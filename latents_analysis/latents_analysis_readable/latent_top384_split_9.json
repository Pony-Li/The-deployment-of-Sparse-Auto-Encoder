Each of these countries is targeted by Washington for overthrow or for their sovereignty to be degraded by propaganda and US military bases that leave the countries vulnerable to attack, thus coercing them into accepting Washington’s will.\n\nThe problem that has arisen between the US and EU with regard to Ukraine is that Europeans have realized that the takeover of Ukraine is a direct threat to Russia, which can cut Europe off from oil and natural gas, and if there is war completely destroy Europe. Consequently, the EU became willing to stop provoking the Ukraine protests.\n\nThe response of the neoconservative, Victoria Nuland, appointed Assistant Secretary of State by the duplicitous Obama, was “fuck the EU,” as she proceeded to describe the members of the Ukraine government that Washington tended to impose on a people so unaware as to believe that they are achieving independence by rushing into Washington’s arms. I once thought that no population could be as unaware as the US population. But I was wrong. Western Ukrainians are more unaware than Americans.\n\nThe orchestration of the “crisis” in Ukraine is easy. The neoconservative Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland told the National Press Club in Washington on December 13, 2013, that the US has “invested” $5 billion in agitation in Ukraine. http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article37599.htm The crisis essentially resides in western Ukraine where romantic ideas about Russian oppression are strong and the population is less Russian than in the eastern Ukraine.\n\nListen from 7:30\n\nThe hatred of Russia in western Ukraine is so dysfunctional that the duped protesters are unaware that joining the EU means the end of Ukraine independence and rule by the EU bureaucrats in Brussels, the European Central Bank, and US corporations. Perhaps Ukraine is two countries. The western half could be given to the EU and US corporations, and the eastern half could be reincorporated as part of Russia, where the entire Ukraine resided for as long as the US has existed.\n\nThe disaffection from Russia that exists in western Ukraine makes it easy for the EU and US to cause trouble. Those in Washington and Europe who wish to destroy Ukraine’s independence portray an independent Ukraine as a hostage of Russia, while a Ukraine in the EU is allegedly under the protection of the US and Europe. The large sums of money that Washington funnels into NGOs in Ukraine propagate this idea and work the population into a mindless frenzy. I have never in my life witnessed people as mindless as the Ukrainian protesters who are destroying the independence of their country.\n\nThe US- and EU-financed NGOs are fifth columns designed to destroy the independence of the countries in which they operate. Some pretend to be “human rights organizations.” Others indoctrinate people under cover of “education programs” and “building democracy.” Others, especially those run by the CIA, specialize in provocations such as “Pussy Riot.”\n\nFew if any of these NGOs are legitimate. But they are arrogant. The head of one of the NGOs announced prior to the Iranian elections in which Mousavi was Washington’s and the CIA’s candidate that the election would result in a Green Revolution. He knew this in advance, because he had helped to finance it with US taxpayer dollars. I wrote about it at the time. It can be found on my website, www.paulcraigroberts.org and in my just published book, How America Was Lost.\n\nThe Ukrainian “protesters” have been violent, but the police have been restrained. Washington has a vested interest in keeping the protests going in the hopes of turning the protests into revolt so that Washington can grab Ukraine. This week the US House of Representatives passed a resolution threatening sanctions should the violent protests be put down by the police.\n\nIn other words, if the Ukrainian police behave toward violent protesters in the way that US police behave toward peaceful protesters, it is reason for Washington to interfere in the internal affairs of Ukraine. Washington is using the protests to destroy the independence of Ukraine and has ready the list of puppets that Washington intends to install as Ukraine’s next government.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n– Exposed: CIA, NATO and NGOs created the Ukrainian crisis\n\n– Ukraine’s gold reserves sent to NY Federal Reserve\n\n– Central banker appointed as Prime Minister of Ukraine\n\n– Ukrainian capital Kiev burning to the ground\n\nSource: http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/02/12/washington-orchestrated-protests-destabilizing-ukraine/",
  "latent_110": "Kafka with selective acknowledgments (kmq) performance & latency benchmark\n\nWhen receiving messages from Apache Kafka, it's only possible to acknowledge the processing of all messages up to a given offset. Thanks to this mechanism, if anything goes wrong and our processing component goes down, after a restart it will start processing from the last committed offset.\n\nHowever, in some cases what you really need is selective message acknowledgment, as in \"traditional\" message queues such as RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ. That is, we'd like to acknowledge processing of messages individually, one by one. This might be useful for example when integrating with external systems, where each message corresponds to an external call and might fail.\n\nIf a message isn't acknowledged for a configured period of time, it is re-delivered and the processing is retried. That's exactly how Amazon SQS works.\n\nSuch a behavior can also be implemented on top of Kafka, and that's what kmq does. It uses an additional markers topic, which is needed to track for which messages the processing has started and ended. For a detailed description of kmq's architecture see this blog post.\n\nGiven the usage of an additional topic, how does this impact message processing performance? Let's find out!\n\nWe'll be comparing performance of a message processing component written using plain Kafka consumers/producers versus one written using kmq.\n\nTest configuration\n\nThe tests were run on AWS, using a 3-node Kafka cluster, consisting of m4.2xlarge servers (8 CPUs, 32GiB RAM) with 100GB general purpose SSDs ( gp2 ) for storage. All the Kafka nodes were in a single region and availability zone. While for a production setup it would be wiser to spread the cluster nodes across different availability zones, here we want to minimize the impact of network overhead.\n\nAdditionally, for each test there was a number of sender and receiver nodes which, probably unsurprisingly, were either sending or receiving messages to/from the Kafka cluster, using plain Kafka or kmq and a varying number of threads. The tests used from 1 to 8 sender/receiver nodes, and from 1 to 25 threads.\n\nAll of these resources were automatically configured using Ansible (thanks to Grzegorz Kocur for setting this up!) and the mqperf test harness.\n\nTest data\n\nMessages were sent in batches of 10, each message containing 100 bytes of data.\n\nDepending on a specific test, each thread was sending from 0.5 to 1 million messages (hence the total number of messages processed varied depending on the number of threads and nodes used).\n\nThe Kafka topics used from 64 to 160 partitions (so that each thread had at least one partition assigned).\n\nSender/receiver code and Kafka configuration\n\nAs we are aiming for guaranteed message delivery, both when using plain Kafka and kmq, the Kafka broker was configured to guarantee that no messages can be lost when sending:\n\nthe topics were created with a replication-factor of 3\n\nof Kafka was configured with min.insync.replicas=2\n\nthe producer used for sending messages was created with acks set to all ( -1 )\n\nThis way, to successfully send a batch of messages, they had to be replicated to all three brokers. The send call doesn't complete until all brokers acknowledged that the message is written.\n\nThe sending code is identical both for the plain Kafka (KafkaMq.scala) and kmq (KmqMq.scala) scenarios. Given a batch of messages, each of them is passed to a Producer , and then we are waiting for each send to complete (which guarantees that the message is replicated).\n\nThe receiving code is different; when using plain Kafka (KafkaMq.scala), we are receiving batches of messages from a Consumer , returning them to the caller. Message acknowledgments are periodical: each second, we are committing the highest acknowledged offset so far.\n\nWith kmq (KmqMq.scala), we are using the KmqClient class, which exposes two methods: nextBatch and processed . The first one reads a batch of data from Kafka, writes a start marker to the special markers topic, and returns the messages to the caller. The processed method is used to acknowledge the processing of a batch of messages, by writing the end marker to the markers topic.\n\nThe acknowledgment behavior is the crucial difference between plain Kafka consumers and kmq: with kmq, the acknowledgments aren't periodical, but done after each batch, and they involve writing to a topic.\n\nTest results\n\nTest results were aggregated using Prometheus and visualized using Grafana. Let's see how the two implementations compare.\n\nFirst, let's look at the performance of plain Kafka consumers/producers (with message replication guaranteed on send as described above):\n\nThe \"sent\" series isn't visible as it's almost identical to the \"received\" series! Hence, messages are always processed as fast as they are being sent; sending is the limiting factor. A single node using a single thread can process about 2 500 messages per second. When using 6 sending nodes and 6 receiving nodes, with 25 threads each, we get up to 62 500 messages per second. Note that adding more nodes doesn't improve the performance, so that's probably the maximum for this setup.\n\nNow let's do the same, but using kmq:\n\nThe graph looks very similar! Again, the number of messages sent and received per second is almost identical; a single node with a single thread achieves the same 2 500 messages per second, and 6 sending/receiving nodes with 25 threads achieve 61 300 messages per second. Same as before, the rate at which messages are sent seems to be the limiting factor.\n\nHence, in the test setup as above, kmq has the same performance as plain Kafka consumers!\n\nIf you are curious, here's an example Graphana dashboard snapshot, for the kmq/6 nodes/25 threads case:\n\nBut how is that possible, as receiving messages using kmq is so much complex? After all, it involves sending the start markers, and waiting until the sends complete! Part of the answer might lie in batching: when receiving messages, the size of the batches is controlled by Kafka; these can be large, which allows faster processing, while when sending, we are always limiting the batches to 10.\n\nSend messages faster?\n\nWhat happens when we send messages faster, without the requirement for waiting for messages to be replicated (setting acks to 1 when creating the producer)?\n\nIt turns out that both with plain Kafka and kmq, 4 nodes with 25 threads process about 314 000 messages per second. Again, no difference between plain Kafka and kmq. It would seem that the limiting factor here is the rate at which messages are replicated across Kafka brokers (although we don't require messages to be acknowledged by all brokers for a send to complete, they are still replicated to all 3 nodes).\n\nWhat if we try to eliminate sending completely, by running the receiver code on a topic already populated with messages? With plain Kafka, the messages are processed blaizingly fast - so fast, that it's hard to get a stable measurement, but the rates are about 1.5 million messages per second. With kmq, the rates reach up to 800 thousand. However, the measurements vary widely: the tests usually start very slowly (at about 10k messages/second), to peak at 800k and then slowly wind down:\n\nIn this scenario, kmq turns out to be about 2x slower. However, keep in mind that in real-world use-cases, you would normally want to process messages \"on-line\", as they are sent (with sends being the limiting factor).\n\nLatency\n\nPerformance looks good, what about latency? The measurements here are inherently imprecise, as we are comparing clocks of two different servers (sender and receiver nodes are distinct). Even though both are running the ntp daemon, there might be inaccuracies, so keep that in mind.\n\nWhen using plain Kafka consumers/producers, the latency between message send and receive is always either 47 or 48 milliseconds.\n\nWith kmq, we sometimes get higher values: 48ms for all scenarios between 1 node/1 thread and 4 nodes/5 threads, 69 milliseconds when using 2 nodes/25 threads, up to 131ms when using 6 nodes/25 threads. That's because of the additional work that needs to be done when receiving.\n\nWhat if messages are dropped\n\nThe reason why you would use kmq over plain Kafka is because unacknowledged messages will be re-delivered. How do dropped messages impact our performance tests? Redelivery can be expensive, as it involves a seek in the Kafka topic.\n\nWe'll be looking at a very bad scenario, where 50% of the messages are dropped at random. With such a setup, we would expect to receive about twice as many messages as we have sent (as we are also dropping 50% of the re-delivered messages, and so on).\n\nHere's the receive rate graph for this setup (and the Graphana snapshot, if you are interested):\n\nAs you can see, when the messages stop being sent (that's when the rate starts dropping sharply), we get a nice declining exponential curve as expected.\n\nSumming up\n\nIt turns out that even though kmq needs to do significant additional work when receiving messages (in contrast to a plain Kafka consumer), the performance is comparable when sending and receiving messages at the same time! The limiting factor is sending messages reliably, which involves waiting for send confirmations on the producer side, and replicating messages on the broker side.\n\nWe have seen that in the reliable send&receive scenario, you can expect about 60k messages per second sent/received both with plain Kafka and kmq, with latencies between 48ms and 131ms.\n\nKmq is open-source and available on GitHub.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nNov. 13, 2016, 12:01 AM GMT / Updated Nov. 13, 2016, 12:46 AM GMT By Daniel A. Medina and Chiara A Sottile\n\nThe incoming Donald Trump administration will ensure the completion of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, the pipeline company's CEO told NBC News in an interview Friday.\n\n\"I'm 100 percent sure that the pipeline will be approved by a Trump administration,\" CEO Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners — the Dallas-based company funding the $3.7 billion project — told NBC News. \"I believe we will have a government in place that believes in energy infrastructure.\"\n\nWarren said he had not spoken to the President-elect to understand his position on the pipeline, which has galvanized opposition globally for months, and Warren denied any prior contact with the Trump campaign.\n\nIn June, Warren donated $100,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee for Trump’s campaign, and a further $3,000 directly to the Trump campaign. For his part, Trump's campaign financial disclosure forms revealed the President-elect's investments totaling between $500,000 and $1 million in Energy Transfer Partners, suggesting a possible vested financial interest in the completion of the pipeline. The Guardian first reported on the two men's financial ties last month.\n\nRelated: What's Behind the Dakota Access Pipeline Protests?\n\nThroughout his campaign, Trump railed against what he called \"special interests\" in Washington. His message was clear: Industry lobbyists and corporate executives yield an outsized influence on shaping policy in Washington and he was going to \"drain the swamp\" of this quid-pro-quo corruption.\n\n\"It was a moment where I was very, very afraid for our people.”\n\nWarren, whose personal net worth Forbes estimates to be $3.9 billion, said he did not categorize his donations as akin to special interests.\n\n\"I don't even know even how much I gave to the [Trump] campaign,\" said Warren. \"I give to Republicans and Democrats.\"\n\nA Fossil-Fuel Energy Policy\n\nPresident-elect Trump has pledged to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency, has called climate change \"a hoax,\" and wants to take apart President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan that would cut carbon emissions from the nation's more than 7,500 power plants.\n\nOn his campaign website, Trump’s energy plan promises to \"unleash America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in clean coal reserves.\" That is welcome news for the country's fossil fuels industry, which universally applauded Trump's stunning electoral victory this week.\n\nWestern Energy Alliance, which represents more than 300 oil and gas companies in the western United States, said in a statement that it was \"overjoyed\" by Trump's victory and anticipates progress on projects like the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines.\n\nAs he affirmed in his victory speech, President-elect Trump says his government will invest in extensive infrastructure projects in his quest to \"make America great again.\" While Trump’s campaign press secretary, Hope Hicks, did not respond to a request for specific environmental policy details, candidate Trump supported the Keystone XL oil pipeline on the campaign trail. He has never publicly commented on the Dakota Access Pipeline.\n\n\"Donald Trump’s election is very worrisome for addressing climate change and improving air and water quality,\" Corinne Le Quéré, a climate expert and professor at the University of East Anglia in the UK, told NBC News. \"The statements he made so far suggest he intends to shut down institutions and reverse plans to reduce pollution.\"\n\nHowever, Le Quéré said Trump's business acumen could potentially be a game changer for addressing the issue.\n\n\"We urgently need businesses to provide options to produce energy without the carbon pollution on a large scale,\" said Le Quéré. \"I would like Donald Trump to see the incredible opportunities that exist for U.S. businesses.\"\n\nStanding Rock Protesters Wary of Trump\n\nWarren, who has remained publicly silent on the pipeline for months as protests forced a halt in the pipeline's construction, labeled most of the protesters at Standing Rock as \"violent mobs.\"\n\nHe repeatedly praised the work of local law enforcement, despite reports of police brutality, unlawful arrests and mistreatment in jail. \"It's unbelievable how they’ve conducted themselves,\" said Warren.\n\nProtesters demonstrate against the Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S. September 9, 2016. ANDREW CULLEN / Reuters\n\nOjibwe tribal member Tara Houska has camped out at Standing Rock since August. She watched the election results come in just down the road from the Oceti Sakowin camp where those protesting the pipeline — who call themselves water protectors — have gathered since August.\n\n\"We got more and more upset as we watched what was happening. It was really, really hard to watch,” said Houska, who is also the National Campaign Director of Honor the Earth and was a Native American adviser to the Bernie Sanders campaign.\n\n\"This project was rerouted from Bismarck [North Dakota] due to concerns over drinking water and put one-half mile from the reservation. That is environmental racism on its face,” Houska said.\n\nHouska said she, along with others at the camp, had hoped that with Hillary Clinton as president there would be a possibility that the executive branch would step in to re-route or block the pipeline.\n\nShe described the mood of the camp as \"low\" since Donald Trump was named the President-elect, adding, “it was a moment where I was very, very afraid for our people.”\n\nFor Houska, it’s not just Trump’s support for oil pipelines that makes her afraid. She pointed to casino mogul Trump’s previous clashes with Native Americans, including in the early 1990s when Trump testified in a hearing on Indian gaming on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"He painted Native people as drug users associated with the mob and criminal activity,\" said Houska. In his testimony, Trump said of the Mashantucket Pequots \"they don’t look like Indians to me,\" according to video posted by the Washington Post, and he spent more than $1 million for a campaign depicting the Mohawk tribe as users of cocaine and other illicit drugs.\n\n\"We have a very difficult path ahead,\" Houska said.\n\n\"I want to know where he is at in terms of upholding treaty rights. Is he truly going to do what the United States has agreed to do — which is fulfill their end of the bargain when it comes to indigenous people?\" Houska said, referring to the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 which gave eight tribes the land in question for the Dakota Access Pipeline.\n\nRelated: Dakota Access Pipeline Fight Watched on Facebook Live Around the World\n\nFilm director Josh Fox camped out at Standing Rock for a week, reporting on protests and clashes with police.\n\n\"Things are going to get much, much harder, and the thing I’m most terrified of now, informed by my experience at Standing Rock — is now you have a president who encourages violence at his rallies. He’s encouraged racism,\" said Fox, referring to incidents in which then-candidate Trump told crowds he longed for the days when protesters were \"carried out in a stretcher.\"\n\n\"I'm 100 percent sure that the pipeline will be approved by a Trump administration.\"\n\nFox and his fellow \"water protectors\" are hoping for help from the current administration before time runs out.\n\n\"What I’m hoping is that the Army Corps of Engineers stops the pipeline. I hope Obama will come out with an executive order,\" said Fox, noting that Dakota Access Pipeline protests are planned around the country for Nov. 15.\n\nThe Obama administration this week denied a report that suggested a decision was coming soon, and said no decision has been made.\n\nTribe Hopes for Resolution\n\nIn a statement, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said that Warren's remarks reflected the mindset of a \"Dallas-based billionaire\" unconcerned with the well being of his tribe.\n\n\"Energy Transfer Partners' assertion that there are no sacred sites affected is another example of how they ignore our voice and fail to listen to our serious concerns,\" Archambault said in the statement. \"Once again, a Dallas-based billionaire and the state of North Dakota's archaeologists continue to render our voice meaningless regarding our own understanding of our traditions, spirituality and culture.\"\n\nProtesters march along the pipeline route during a protest against the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in St. Anthony, North Dakota, U.S. November 11, 2016. STEPHANIE KEITH / Reuters\n\nWarren said the tribe's worries that the pipeline would destroy its sacred sites and compromise its water supply \"were not based on the facts.\"\n\nWhile he admitted that he could not assure the tribe that an oil spill could not potentially occur, he said the pipelines were prepared to withstand such an event. Warren said the pipeline would cross 90-115 feet below Lake Oahe, a large Missouri River reservoir, with double walled and remote-controlled shutoff valves on each side of the crossing.\n\nThough Warren remained bullish on the pipeline's completion, the ultimate decision on the project's fate lies with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. For weeks, the Corps has been conducting a federal environmental review of the land in question. It is not clear when the agency is expected to issue the review but both the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Energy Transfer Partners believe its release is imminent.\n\nIn the event of the Corps denying Energy Transfer Partners the permit to cross Lake Oahe, Archambault has called for a re-route of the pipeline.\n\n\"We are hopeful that a meaningful consultation process will take our concerns seriously and result in a re-route so we can protect our ancestral homelands,\" said Archambault.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether a President-elect Trump would share that sentiment.",

  "latent_425": "As always, gun control proponents say they merely want \"reasonable\" gun control laws. Yet, when listing the actual laws they favor, they go well beyond what most people would possibly consider \"reasonable.\" Just look at the gun bans in Chicago and Washington, D.C. that local politicians and gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign and the Violence Policy Center have fought to protect.\n\nToday, exactly two weeks after the Supreme Court struck down Chicago's handgun ban, the city's strict new gun control laws go into effect. These new restrictions surely do not seem \"reasonable\" but rather intended to make life as difficult as possible for those who legally want to own a gun. Among the regulations is a complete ban on selling guns in Chicago. Also five hours of training is required, which may seem reasonable, but that training is forbidden to take place within the Chicago city limits.\n\nAnd the list of odd restrictions in Chicago goes on. While people can own a handgun for protection in their homes, it only applies to some parts of what most people would consider their home: the gun cannot be used for self-defense in one's yard or garage, nor on your porch, even if it is enclosed. But certainly a garage is a possible place for criminals to strike. Is it \"reasonable\" that if criminals attack a family member in the garage, you aren't allowed to effectively defend them?\n\nFurther, Chicagoans are permitted to own only one handgun that is \"in operating order.\" If you own a jewelry store that criminals might want to rob, forget it. You cannot even place your one functional handgun in your business instead of your home if you think that is the best place to put it.\n\nMultiple residences or a very large house would not qualify for more than one gun either.\n\nBreak any of these or the numerous other regulations and you face up to a $5,000 fine and 90 days in jail.\n\nFor the second offense, the fine goes up to $10,000 and jail time goes up to six months.\n\nThen there are the various fees and other costs of obtaining a handgun legally. A comparison with the First Amendment is useful: If Chicago were to put a tax on newspapers, even just a penny, courts would throw it out as an abridgment of freedom of speech. Why should the Second Amendment be treated any differently?\n\nApparently, the city of Chicago sees no constitutional problem in imposing a $100 Chicago Firearms Permit fee plus another $15 per firearm (even on the non-operational ones) every three years. A valid Illinois Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) card is also required, at a cost of $10, although it seems redundant as the Chicago permit and the Illinois FOID card do the same things. On an annual basis, Chicago's fees are about 2.5 times the cost for the average concealed handgun permit.\n\nAdministrative costs are not an excuse as the Chicago fees are well exceed the costs of running the permit and registration system. Given that training requirements for concealed handgun permits don't make people who carry guns more effective at deterring criminals nor less accident prone, there is no evidence that Chicago's training requirements will make gun owners better at owning guns. What training requirements do is reduce the number of gun owners. The five hour training class, which includes one hour of range training, and the extra costs government imposes on those who want to get a single gun will run at least $200.\n\nLet's face it, Mayor Richard Daley wants to ban guns, all guns. And he thinks that a complete ban is a \"reasonable\" regulation. The Supreme Court has ruled that he is not allowed to ban guns, but this is not going to change his mind about guns in the slightest. Daley now wants to place as restrictive rules as he thinks that the courts will let him get away with. Pretending that these rules are anything more than an attempt to limit gun ownership as much as possible is simply dishonest.\n\nJohn R. Lott, Jr. is a FoxNews.com contributor.

Conversely, the most pessimistic people in the world may be old, poor, uneducated men in Zimbabwe,” the study says\n\nMatthew Gallagher, the lead author of the study and a clinician at the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University, said the study provides compelling evidence that optimism is a universal phenomenon linked to improved perceptions of physical health and improved subjective well-being worldwide.\n\nGallagher added: “Our results therefore suggest that optimism is not merely a benefit of living in industrialized nations, but reflects a universal characteristic that is associated with and potentially may serve to promote improved psychological functioning worldwide.”",

  "latent_967": "People are grappling with market turmoil after Friday's equity slide, but there was a good deal of action in another financial instrument: Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin moved down some 10 percent on Friday after one of its significant developers, Mike Hearn, claimed in a startling blogpost that the cryptocurrency was now a failure.\n\nHearn used a publishing platform, Medium, to make his announcement, writing, \"Despite knowing that bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly.\"\n\nHearn's views are reportedly aligned with Gavin Andresen, another famous developer. The controversy pits Hearn and Andresen against other developers over the issue of whether – and how – processing speed for bitcoin \"blocks\" should be expanded.\n\nEach block has a one-megabyte \"artificial\" processing capacity that only allows three payments per second. According to Reuters, Hearn and Andresen are now said to be promoting their own bitcoin software, called Bitcoin XT, which provides 24 transactions per second. The software would reportedly expand the number of transactions year over year.\n\nThere's a sticking point, however. Computers that \"mine\" bitcoin, many of which are in China, aren't using the new software. Reuters interviewed Hearn in December and quoted him as saying that, \"if an IT system runs out of capacity … then all kinds of things go wrong – all hell breaks loose.\"\n\nHearn also said that, \"The current price of bitcoin is supported almost entirely by people speculating on its future, in the assumption that this could be the money of tomorrow … So if the network starts to collapse, then a lot of people are going to look at it and say: well maybe we've miscalculated (its) future value.\"\n\nThe programmer's open letter was big news, with mainstream media outlets such as The New York Times, The Guardian and Fortune reporting on his decision. Hearn's language was in fact dramatic if not apocalyptic:\n\n\"Why has Bitcoin failed? It has failed because the community has failed. What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked 'systemically important institutions' and 'too big to fail' has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people.\"\n\nCritics of Hearn maintain he has ulterior motives, as he is working with a group of banks, now said to number around 40, to revise the blockchain technology supporting bitcoin and to generally make bitcoin more banker friendly.\n\nGiven Hearn's affiliation with banking startup R3 CEV and his emotionally charged language, it was easy for some in the bitcoin community – never enamored with large banks – to claim a conflict of interest. In fact, fingers have been pointed since Hearn joined R3 last year.\n\nBut Hearn's recent statement obviously aggravated a growing rift and the reaction has been significant. In addition to the sell-off, Hearn has now been branded a \"blatant liar,\" and his recent post has been characterized as \"whiny.\" Developers such as Eric Lombrozo have provided rebuttals.\n\nLombrozo was quoted recently by CoinDesk as saying that developers can now deploy bigger blocks, \"in a way that is backwards compatible and is practical and safe and can be rolled out soon.\"\n\nHere at The Daily Bell, I've always been a bit skeptical of bitcoin because of what I considered to be an over-enthusiastic portrayal by supporters. For instance, we pointed out that the TOR facility that is supposed to keep bitcoin transactions anonymous was developed by the US military, of all groups. And we predicted long ago that bitcoin would be afflicted with continued, serious security breaches and embezzlement. All that has taken place.\n\nGold, physical gold especially, is a proven money medium when it comes to anonymity and liquidity. Around the world you can always find someone to buy and sell gold. And if you don't want to deal with public, regulated channels, you can arrange private transactions.\n\nI have no axe to grind with bitcoin, but I've never thought of it as a replacement for precious metals, even though some have been intent on characterizing it that way.\n\nGold and silver have been around for thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of years. And as we just pointed out yesterday, if the West enters a period of prolonged stagflation, people will once again discover just how valuable owning gold can be.\n\nGiven the current market turmoil, you ought to consider precious metals if you haven't before, or contemplate adding to what you have. Not just physical metals, either. Junior miners such as Seabridge – a company we've covered in the past – may prove lucrative if the mining sector heats up. And physical gold and silver have retained their value since ancient days.\n\nHistorically, the record is clear. Gold and silver have a place in your portfolio.\n\nYou don’t have to play by the rules of the corrupt politicians, manipulative media, and brainwashed peers.

  "latent_1378": "A migrant boat capsizes off the coast of Italy on May 26. On Friday, another boat filled with hundreds of migrants capsized near the island of Crete. (Marina Militare via AP)\n\nA grim succession of shipwrecks and drownings in the Mediterranean Sea this week has highlighted a shift in migrant smuggling operations away from relatively safer routes into Europe and sparked recriminations about whether European governments are doing enough to stem the flow.\n\nThe rising death toll spiked Friday with the discovery of more than 100 drowning victims off the Libyan coast, as rescuers searched for survivors of at least two other stricken boats in waters off Crete and Egypt. The new wrecks padded a toll estimated to exceed 1,000 this week.\n\nWith 2015 as the deadliest year on record for those who sought passage into Europe by sea, more than 2,500 people have died so far this year, compared with 1,800 in the same period last year, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\n\nIn the past 10 days alone, the 2016 death toll for migrants attempting to make the central Mediterranean crossing — from North Africa to Europe, typically via Italy and its outer islands — has already doubled. That has shifted the focus of refugee organizations from the shorter, safer Greek route traveled mainly by people from Syria, Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East to those who are crossing from the Maghreb.\n\nFor many in Europe and North Africa, the question is why no systematic European Union policy or temporary solution has been put in place to prevent further deaths at sea.\n\nIn Libya on Friday, Col. Ayoub Gassim, a spokesman for the Libyan navy, blamed E.U. leaders, who he said were “doing nothing but counting bodies.” The accusation struck a chord even in Brussels, the E.U. headquarters, where some critics cited the nature of E.U. policymaking.\n\n“Everybody knows what needs to be done — an E.U. border and coast guard agency,” said Marc Pierini, a former E.U. ambassador to Libya and Syria.\n\n[Why the number of refugees drowning in the Mediterranean keeps rising]\n\nThe E.U. does have a border control agency, known as “Frontex.” But it has neither vessels nor surveillance equipment of its own, relying instead on individual E.U. member states to provide both.\n\n“We are definitely in crisis-management mode only, which is not good for seeing the next crisis coming and getting the proper structures in place,” Pierini said in a telephone interview from Brussels.\n\n“We are dealing with short-termism. And basically putting patches on leaks,” he said. “They talk about keeping the numbers down, as if the numbers are not human beings like you and me.”\n\nAn Italian official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss E.U. deliberations, said Italy has been pressing its European partners for more than a year to take greater action, such as deploying more ships and other resources, to address the growing number of deaths in the Mediterranean.\n\nVideo from the Italian navy shows a large ship capsizing off Libya’s coast on May 25 with more than 500 migrants aboard. (Italian Navy)\n\n[Tensions rise between E.U., Turkey over deal to end refu­gee crisis]\n\nAnother obstacle is resistance from the Italian and Greek governments to hosting any substantial, long-term humanitarian aid operations on their shores. The rationale typically stems from a desire to protect their countries from becoming holding pens for migrants who have no claim to E.U. asylum.\n\nThe U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported Tuesday that at least 880 migrants and refugees had died trying to cross the Mediterranean in the past week.\n\nAs the approaching summer brings warmer weather and better sea conditions, smugglers from North Africa are likely to continue packing migrants into unseaworthy vessels bound for Europe in dangerous conditions.\n\nA migrant resettlement deal between the E.U. and Turkey in March, which effectively closed much of the “Balkan route” from Greece into Western Europe, also means that more migrants are likely to be smuggled along the central Mediterranean route in the coming months.\n\nGassim, the Libyan navy spokesman, told the Associated Press that Libyan coast guard personnel found a capsized smuggling boat Thursday. Given the typical capacity of these vessels, he said, the actual death toll may even be as high as 125.\n\nSimilar emergencies were reported Friday across the Mediterranean, as governments from Europe and North Africa launched immediate rescue operations.\n\nSeventy-five miles from the southern coast of Crete, Greek authorities dispatched a military aircraft, three helicopters and two patrol vessels to attend to a capsized boat carrying what officials first described as a “significant number of migrants.”\n\nAccording to a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 342 migrants were rescued and four bodies were recovered. The search continued throughout the day.\n\nFarther south, the Egyptian military responded to a distress call from a smuggling boat carrying an unknown number of migrants toward Europe.\n\nOn its official Facebook page, the military said Friday that it dispatched ships and helicopters to a site about 165 miles off the coast of Sallum, a seaside town in northwestern Egypt. The number of migrants aboard the vessel remains unclear.\n\nThe danger posed by the central Mediterranean route is hardly news to leaders in Europe or North Africa. Similar tragedies have plagued the region for years.\n\nIn October 2013, a vessel carrying more than 500 people capsized off the coast of Lampedusa, Italy’s southernmost island, leaving 359 confirmed dead.\n\nThe migrant crisis, the largest on European soil since the end of World War II, has only worsened since then. More than 1 million people poured into the continent in 2015.\n\nAs the archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Angelo Scola, told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica: “Because of its geographical position and because of a social and cultural resilience, Italy could, should have a leading role” in accommodating asylum seekers.\n\nThe government does not share the sentiment.\n\nWhen migrants make landfall in Italy, authorities are required by law to process them for political asylum. But the European Union has sanctioned Italy for failing to fingerprint the new arrivals it receives, which decreases the number it must shelter.\n\nLast month, Angelino Alfano, Italy’s interior minister, proposed an idea of “floating hot spots” where migrants would be subject to health, security and identity checks while still at sea.\n\nAlthough many details behind the project remain unclear, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, is likely to reject the proposal, on the grounds that the hot spots violate the freedom of movement protected by E.U. human rights law.\n\nStefano Pitrelli in Rome and Erin Cunningham in Istanbul contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nMore than 700 migrants drown in the Mediterranean in May\n\nU.N. says 500 migrants drown in the Mediterranean in April\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world",
  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nResident Evil 4 is the best game ever made. Hands down.\n\nYou don't agree? Well then, let me rephrase: I think Resident Evil 4 is the best game ever made.\n\nNo dice? Fine: I think Resident Evil 4 is the best game ever made, but I could be wrong.\n\nThere is nothing materially distinct about those statements. They all express an opinion that Resident Evil 4 is the greatest game ever made. But I'm going to guess that your reaction to each of them was incrementally less severe (unless you also think RE4 is the greatest game ever made). Why? Loss aversion.\n\nThe phrasing of the first statement implies that it is impossible for your favorite game to be the best game ever, because mine is. The second statement implies it impossible for me to think your favorite game is the best game ever because I think mine is. The third statement leaves the door wide open for your favorite game to unequivocally be the best game ever. Each modification reduces the pressure on your aversion to having your favorite game not, in fact, be the best game ever.\n\nHuman beings tend to demonstrate an interesting phenomenon: we experience losses far more intensely than we experience gains.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWhat is Loss Aversion?\n\nThe name is certainly descriptive: you have an aversion to losing things. We all do. Human beings tend to demonstrate an interesting phenomenon: we experience losses far more intensely than we experience gains. Chances are, if you found a $20 bill on the street, you'd be mildly excited. But, if you later lost that $20 bill, you'd be majorly pissed. But why? You're back where you started, no worse off. Easy-come, easy-go. Screw that, you say. That Jackson was MINE!\n\nHere are some other examples. Have you ever:\n\nfelt hesitation or heartache before throwing out, giving away, or selling a personal possession even though you hadn't even looked at it in a decade and rationally knew you would never use it again? purchased a game you weren't in any rush to play just because you found a once in a lifetime deal on it or because it was a rare title? purchased a more expensive, limited edition version of a product even though you had no significant interest in the extras it availed? persisted in an argument with a friend, even though you knew your friend was right, just for the sake of not losing the debate? gotten really pissed when a person that you dumped started dating someone else?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of that, then that strange and potent brew of anxiety, excitement, and frustration, that tempest in your stomach and fog in your head is loss aversion.\n\nBut, beyond being a universal experience, loss aversion is a significant cognitive bias: it will really screw with your ability to make rational decisions. And, as with all cognitive biases, being aware of loss aversion is not enough to counteract it.\n\nLoss Aversion for Gamers\n\nLoss aversion is commonplace in gamer culture. Fanboy'ism is all about loss aversion. Xbox One gamers don't want to feel like they missed out on all the cool stuff over on the Playstation 4, so they rationalize that loss aversion away by attempting to convince themselves (and everyone else in the foums) that the Playstation 4 is for stupid people. And the reverse is true for PS4 fans. And it was true of the N64 and the original Playstation, and the SNES and the Genesis. It's true of Mac's and PC's, Call of Duty and Battlefield, taekwondo and jujitsu, grape lollipops and cherry lollipops.\n\nOh, and my dad can TOTALLY beat up your dad. He always could.\n\nA limited edition helps ensure that if you are willing to pay a higher price you're duly motivated by loss aversion to do so.\n\nIt's also present in the scarce-goods model of special/limited/collector's editions. Collectors editions are an example of what economists call \"price discrimination\": finding a way to get people who would be willing to pay more to do so without pricing-out everyone else. The fact that it's a limited edition helps ensure that, if you are one of those folks willing to pay a higher price, you're duly motivated by loss aversion to do so. If I don't get that CoD-branded remote control car now, then when, bro?\n\nThe same principle applies for DLC vouchers and special content for pre-orders or vender specific purchases. Publishers, developers, and vendors love pre-sales for obvious reasons. So, throw a lil' loss aversion in there and watch the numbers ratchet up. And now we have the phenomenon of venders offering unique pre-order content to make sure you pre-order from them. That's just cruel. Do you want the Valkyrie assault rifle from GameStop or the Raider shotgun from Origin? That's right folks: through the magic of loss aversion, you now have to comparison shop for pre-order bonuses. If there's a textbook example of a first world problem, that's it right there.\n\nThe Other Side of Loss Aversion\n\nLoss aversion isn't just an Achilles heel to be manipulated for financial gain. It's also a PR nightmare. The trick about loss aversion is that it's really, really easy to trigger, whether you intend to or not. In reality, almost any change can trigger loss aversion, even if that change is for the better. Remember: losses loom larger than gains. People will focus on what the change costs them and overlook the benefits.\n\nSay you're a manager, and you want to switch from one task tracking software to another. The new software is more reliable, easier to access from outside the office, and easier to use. Empirically, it will be a net positive to productivity. You make an excited announcement to your team: \"Hey guys! Guess what? As of next week, we're transitioning to Pro Project 64 Professional Edition\".\n\nThe reaction? Grousing. Lots and lots of grousing. You say \"better stuff!\" and your team hears \"Hey guys! Guess what? An IT rep is going to take over your desk for an hour and install some software that you didn't ask for, while jawing at you about God knows what, and then you're going to have to learn an entirely new UI and workflow in order to regain your current pace of productivity.\" Your disruption to the status quo triggered the team's loss aversion. It's not that they're unprofessional, or self-absorbed, or immature. They're human, and you inadvertently pushed their buttons.\n\nThe trick about loss aversion is that it's really, really easy to trigger. Almost any change can trigger loss aversion, even if that change is for the better.\n\nNow, apply this principle to gamers. On a rational level, online passes make sense: publishers can recover some value out of used game sales and cover some of the cost of server usage by gamers in the secondary market. And, seriously, let's be honest: if you bought the game new, entering an online passcode is really not a big deal. If you're playing a video game, you ostensibly have some time to kill. Spending 30 seconds to enter a code should rate somewhere around \"Do dogs prefer hoppy beer or malty beer?\" on your list of personal concerns. 30 seconds of your time and you get access to the gated content.\n\nBut the practice triggers a loss aversion due to the cost of your time and the denial of unrestricted access to something you paid for. For all its economic and business sense, online passes completely ignored the fundamental psychology of human beings. Gamers got pissed, publishers were painted as greedy pigs, and the whole idea was euthanized.\n\nA similar example is on-disc DLC. Gamers go bananas about on-disc DLC. Holy smokes, we just go ape-shit over that concept. But again, putting aside emotions, think about what's really going on. You and a game maker engage in a tacit agreement: your cash for their product. It isn't a bait and switch: you are given a disc with all of the content you paid for. It just also happens to have other content that you didn't pay for and can't access yet. On-disc DLC is transactionally no different than regular old DLC: you buy the base product and then later pay for additional content. The only difference is that the latter is pulled down from the internet and the former is just unlocked. From that perspective, all the developers and publishers are trying to do is make it faster for you to get the content once you've paid for it.\n\nBut, of course, you can't put emotions aside. Developers and publishers think \"more efficient delivery vector\", and gamers think some combination of:\n\n\"I already paid for this! Why are you trying to charge me for it again?!\"\n\n\"You deliberately held back this content from the launch release to charge me for it later!\"\n\nNow, again, rationally, neither of these arguments actually makes any sense. You didn't pay for access to the on-disc DLC. You paid for a plastic disc and access to the base content. And even if developers or publishers deliberately held back content, so what? That's their release strategy. Your purchase does not entitle you to everything they produced before they submitted the gold master. And again, this is no different than traditional DLC: there is absolutely nothing stopping a developer from deliberately holding back content for later release regardless of the vector.\n\nIf you're sitting there fuming at the screen, screaming where I can shove on-disc DLC, that's exactly why the concept didn't work: it tweaks the living hell out of your loss aversion. And if it makes you feel any better, I also have a loss aversion to on-disc DLC. Despite the fact that I just wrote the preceding paragraphs and despite all of my calls for rational thought, something about on-disc DLC just feels wrong.\n\nAnd that's my point: the reality and the rational argument aren't the end of the conversation. You need to think about how your customer will feel about the product you're selling. Sure, maybe there's no logical reason to get upset about online passes or on-disc DLC, but for whatever emotional reason, it just makes people feel funny/manipulated/abused.\n\nOh, and remember that time David Vonderhaar tweaked the performances of some weapons in CoD and got shellacked with Twitter death threats? Yeah, guess what that was all about.\n\nXBone'd\n\nMicrosoft's launch of the XBox One was a master class on loss aversion and the consequences of not considering it. Let's review - initially, the XBox one was going to:\n\nRequire an always-on connection\n\nPrevent you from playing used games\n\nPrevent you from borrowing games\n\nRequire you to leave a camera plugged in that may or may not be able to see your dong through your Dickies\n\nAnd we all know how that turned out. To be fair, Microsoft did have some user experience justifications for the always-on connection and the Kinect requirement, but it didn't matter in the face of an all-powerful force like loss aversion.

And all Sony had to do was say \"Yeah, no\" and it looked like a collective of forward-thinking, progressive, egalitarian geniuses. Round one: PS4.\n\nHow to Manage Loss Aversion\n\nIn some cases it's possible to avoid loss aversion by leaving (or appearing to leave) an option open. When expressing an opinion that might be controversial, simply prepend \"I could be wrong, but...\" or append \"That's just my opinion.\" By doing so, you are providing a psychological safety net: your colleague can engage and consider your idea without the threat of his or her own being wrong. He or she has the option of accepting your idea or sticking with his or her own. The next time you're on the cusp of a heated debate, try that trick.\n\nWhen the option approach isn't an...option, you can emphasize the benefits of the change, but that only goes so far, and won't really counteract loss aversion. So what is a manager or marketer to do?\n\nYou need to think about how your customer will feel about the product you're selling. Maybe there's no logical reason to get upset but it can still make people feel manipulated.\n\nI've never worked on an oil rig, but I'm told that the way to put out a well fire is to set off a big explosion next to it and choke off its oxygen supply. It turns out that loss aversion is analogous. The way to counter loss aversion is with more loss aversion. Specifically, you need to create a loss aversion to inaction.\n\nIn the task tracking software example above, if you want to curtail the grousing, you need to position the old crappy software in such a way that it triggers a bigger loss aversion. For instance, indicate that the current software is unsuitable and will result in lower efficiency, necessitating late nights and weekend work. That's WAY worse than learning a new UI.\n\nWhen it comes to product changes, you need to take a similar approach: if you need to change some key feature or delivery strategy and you want to mitigate backlash, explain why the change is necessary and the problems you want to avoid. Make sure it's clear why the consequences of inaction are worse than making the change.\n\nAll that being said, there is a difference between influencing your customers and manipulating them with spin. If you are honestly trying to communicate a true benefit the change creates or a significant problem it avoids, that's influence. Nothing wrong with influence. If you are trying to manufacture loss aversion by spinning a change to mask your true intentions, then you are trying to manipulate people. There's no grey area. You're either up front, or you're not. And if you're not, gamers, a highly connected and very cynical bunch of folks, will probably sniff you out.\n\nSim City, anyone?",

We’ve seen some move on but for decent fees.\n\n“Others use it slightly differently but what it does mean is that players like Kev Stewart, Mark Grujic and Tiago Ilori are all under-age and we can have four older than them.\n\n“When it comes to home games, we try to work really hard at finding days that suit them.\n\n“If we play the next day it helps them because they were sat on the bench and it hasn’t affected their preparations and they can drop in and play for us. This maybe the case this weekend against Leicester - injury permitting.”\n\nBeale has been particularly impressed with the professionalism shown by some of Liverpool’s established stars who have turned out for his side – including the club’s longest-serving player, Lucas.\n\nHe said: “As soon as you put an age limit on a competition there’s an excuse for a senior player dropping down and it’s something that probably went from the game around 10 years ago.\n\n“But the times that Lucas or Andre Wisdom have played for us, the way they organise the players around them is great.\n\n“Someone like Lucas does it when he’s in our first team so you can imagine the effect he has with us.”\n\nRebuilding the Main Stand at Anfield will ensure more fans than ever get to watch Liverpool home games this season, but Beale is hoping that with a more settled home closer to the city and the prospect of a few more big names turning out, an increasing number of Reds will check out his own charges in the flesh.\n\nHe said: “Hopefully more people will come out to watch the lads with us staying at Tranmere, it’s a lovely ground and it’s as close as we could get to the city with a credible stadium.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n“It’s still a small bugbear that we’re probably not getting the crowds at home that we’d like.\n\n“When we go to Chelsea the crowd is 60-40 in our favour and that shows the level of our support.\n\n“It shows there’s a real interest in our young players. It’s a nice chance for kids to get close to the players who will come over and talk to them and see them.\n\n“We were in Denmark and it was nice and crazy at the same time that there was a middle-aged man with Ben Woodburn’s name and number on the back of his shirt.\n\n“He’s a very level-headed boy and we have no problems with him but it shows you how quickly you can go from being under the radar to jumping out.”\n\nEntry to Liverpool U23s v Leicester at Prenton Park on Sunday (2pm) is £4 for adults and £1 for children and concessions.\n\nMembers and season ticket holders can gain admission free of charge, simply by bringing their cards on the day.",

Россия будет расширять полицейские полномочия — об этом свидетельствуют итоги заседания Совета Федерации и Госдумы в Колонном зале Дома Союзов. Там даже уже обсудили частичное снятие моратория на смертную казнь.\n\nПараллельно Россия активизирует усилия на международной арене, принуждая Запад к любви. Роль России в борьбе с «Исламским государством»* до сих пор не ясна: пока что все ее удары были направлены не столько на позиции ИГИЛа, сколько на позиции его конкурентов. То есть Россия скорее помогала ИГИЛу, чем громила его. И в том я вижу тайный умысел: помощь в усилении «Исламского государства» как рычага воздействия России на позицию Запада.\n\nНаземная операция в Сирии остается возможным сценарием. Насколько я знаю, операция с участием 25–30 тысяч российских военных обсуждается всерьез. Чтобы меня не обвинили по 282-й статье, скажу, что наземная операция в Сирии означает не конец, а переформатирование той России, в которой мы живем сегодня. Она будет слишком сильно напоминать Афганскую войну, которая сыграла не последнюю роль в разрушении Советского Союза.\n\nВ любом случае победа над «Исламским государством» — авиаударами или наземной операцией — не является целью Путина. Цель — новый пакт с Западом о разделе сфер влияния в мире, для чего борьба с терроризмом является лишь инструментом. Такая борьба может длиться вечно.\n\nОбъединяя усилия по борьбе с терроризмом с Западом, Россия рассчитывает на полную или частичную отмену санкций, фактическое признание Крыма частью России и легализацию ДНР и ЛНР как квазигосударственных образований, находящихся как бы в составе Украины, но по факту «независимых» — подконтрольных Москве.\n\nЗапад, если и готов к чему-либо из этого, то частично, иначе предполагается возврат в ялтинско-потсдамский мир, в ситуацию до падения Берлинской стены 9 ноября 1989 года.

  "latent_1808": "The United States has identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime. — Sean Spicer, White House Press Secretary, June 26, 2017 Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me, you can’t get fooled again. — George Bush, Sept. 17, 2002\n\nThe White House statement raises a number of questions. Who has identified the “potential preparations”? No reference is given, not even a source agency. Does the information come from intelligence sources? Apparently the Pentagon had not even been informed. What is “potential information” and how does it compare with real information?\n\nOf course, the White House has its own direct sources. The Syrian opposition groups who met with John Kerry, Michael Ratney and Jon Finer at the UN in September, 2016 are tight with al-Nusra and other terrorist groups, and would be happy to provide a pretext for another US strike on Syria. No real evidence is required, but they would be happy to fabricate it nonetheless.\n\nCan anyone cite a case of the use, or even the alleged use, of chemical weapons in Syria that has been to the strategic advantage of the Syrian government or its forces? The fact is that every incident has been to their disadvantage, and invariably a pretext for US intervention. Why then, would they use it, especially when they hadn’t done so before Obama drew his famous “red line”?\n\nTo the contrary, when British intelligence analyzed traces of the gas, they found it to be inconsistent with samples of Syrian government stocks. Furthermore, Turkish sources have reported the delivery of chemical weapons to opposition fighters. Distinguished MIT researchers Lloyd and Postol demonstrated definitively that the 2013 CW attack in Ghouta could not have come from Syrian government forces.\n\nSimilarly, Postol demonstrated multiple inconsistencies in the reports of the April 4, 2017 Khan Sheikhoun attack. More recently, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh uncovered the inside story on that attack, to the effect that US Defense Department sources knew that there were no chemical weapons used in the Syrian Air Force bombing attack on Khan Sheikhoun, and that to the extent that toxic gases caused casualties in that attack, it was the result of what the al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham fighters had stored at the site or had deployed as a false flag event, for the purpose of precipitating US intervention.\n\nPostol warned at the time that without proper corroboration of Syrian government culpability, a US attack would motivate the terrorist constructors of the false flag to replicate more such incidents. In this context, the White House statement, based solely on vague allegations, can be interpreted as the start to a manipulation of public perception, so that an upcoming false flag event can appear to be a corroboration of the initial suspicions.\n\nSuch are the workings of what military and security forces call “securocratic wars” and specifically “security-based framing”. This is jargon for what used to be called propaganda, but which is now an integrated part of military and security planning for the control of public perception.\n\nThere is plenty of reason for the White House to welcome such a pretext to attack Syria again. The approval ratings for the Trump Administration have never been higher, nor the press more approving, than when US warships fired 59 Tomahawk missiles at Syria’s Shu’ayrat Air Field two days after the Khan Sheikhoun attack. Given the unpopularity and failure of Trump’s domestic initiatives, it is easy to see how he might be tempted to employ similar death and destruction to boost his image again.\n\nOf course, such actions risk a dangerous confrontation with Russia on the Syrian battlefield. Russia has already threatened to target US aircraft and has suspended coordination of flights over the shooting down of a Syrian jet fighter. But Trump is not averse to risk. We should therefore not be surprised to see another false flag killing of innocents blamed on the Syrian military in order to embroil the US further in an illegal war where we don’t belong.",
  "latent_1952": "When the U.S. Supreme Court elevated the importance of religious freedom in the Hobby Lobby case, it made it possible for a member of a fringe religious sect to avoid helping the federal government investigate child labor allegations.\n\nCiting the precedence established in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, which allows businesses to cite religious objections in not providing birth control to workers through company health insurance plans, U.S. District Judge David Sam in Utah has ruled that a member of a polygamist group can cite religious freedom as a reason to not give testimony in a criminal probe.\n\nWarren Jeffs, the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), an offshoot of the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has been in trouble with law enforcement for years. He’s now serving a life sentence in prison for sexually assaulting two under-age girls he had taken as wives.\n\nNow his church is the focus of a federal labor investigation. Jeffs was accused in a CNN report of ordering that children be taken out of school to help pick pecans at a private orchard. The government wanted FLDS member Vergel Steed, who has worked at the school, to testify about this practice.\n\nThat effort hit a roadblock when Sam, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan, ruled Steed could refuse to talk about FLDS business based on his religious oath to not discuss internal matters.\n\n“Before Hobby Lobby, it’s unlikely that Steed’s claim would prevail. Although a federal law offers fairly robust protections for religious liberty, this law only applies when the federal government ‘substantially burden[s] a person’s exercise of religion,’” Ian Millhiser wrote for ThinkProgress.\n\nSam ruled “Petitioner has failed to show that forcing Mr. Steed to answer the questions offensive to his sincerely held religious beliefs is the least restrictive means to advance any compelling interest it may have,” and suggested other avenues for the government to pursue.\n\n-Noel Brinkerhoff\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nJudge: Hobby Lobby Decision Means Polygamous Sect Member Can Refuse To Testify In Child Labor Case (by Ian Millhiser, ThinkProgress)\n\nFLDS Cites ‘Hobby Lobby’ Case to Fight Subpoena on Child Labor (by Nate Carlisle, Salt Lake Tribune)\n\nArizona Asks Federal Judge to Disband Police Department that Places Church Directives over Law (by Noel Brinkerhoff and Steve Straehley, AllGov)",
  "latent_2058": "The United Federation of China was the culmination of a decade's of work by the Unity Society of Taiwan and the Social Democratic Alliance in the waning People's Republic, with a little help from American economic and military support to combat the Japanese during the last World War. Formally founded in 2058 the new China looked to have finally gotten over the millenia of cycles of growth, disparity, and revolution that had plagued Chinese civilization since its inception. The Federation shared in the prosperity of the post-war world, its economy bolstered by American investment and the return of its low lying coast-lands after the refreeze that let the Chinese rebuild their greatest cities. The flood had driven millions of Chinese inland, and driven a new kind of cultural revolution that spread the wealth and skills of the richer coastal areas to the poorer inland provinces. When the waters receded, and Shanghai was returned from the seas, the children of those pilgrims to the frontier returned to their parent's cities, and built an economic boom that returned China to its position as the economic heart of Asia, and the second largest economy on Earth.\n\nThe prosperity was short lived, as it was for every nation by the end of the 21st Century. The population crisis of the Americans could not compare to that of China. Where the United States began to feel the stings of an inflated workforce made redundant by advances in robotics and automation by the late 2070s, China had been reeling from economic depression for most of the decade. When the gates opened for a new wave of colonists to Mars in 2081, was it any wonder that the Chinese saw the largest transfer of citizens to the American space colonies? Over half a billion people from China flooded to the colonies in the space of 20 years, abandoning their homeland for the promise of a better life in space. For those that stayed behind, a power vacuum was left by the elites that had fled. By 2096, many Chinese leaders sought to adopt the Quantum Economic Model that had freed the colonies from economic disaster. After several pilot programs in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanning, the government began to move forward with plans to be the first nation on Earth to implement the colonial model. Unfortunately for the Chinese, the Mex-American Cold War intervened.\n\nChina was America's strongest ally in Asia, and its military was often involved in proxy wars in South-east Asia and the Pacific to counter Mexican sponsored separatists. After the end of the Second Vietnam War, many Chinese soldiers returned home to not only find their economy still devoid of opportunities, but the Federalist government delaying pensions for veterans. The whole situation was a powder keg, and Mexico was quick to exploit it for their own benefit. After making contacts with local regionalists, Mexican operatives quickly established separatists movements from within local Chinese Army regiments. With a little social engineering, all of Southern China was quickly in open revolt against the Federalist government in Beijing. The revolts in the South eventually became a coup de tat that forced the Americans to invade and pacify the Chinese capital. After a short, but costly civil war, some order began to be restored by 2108 and a provisional republic governed from American-run Shanghai had been propped up. Taiwan and Manchuria were in open rebellion, but not by Mexican sponsored revolutionaries, but revolts from local governments who refused to submit to a government so incapable of keeping the country in one piece. As the Americans and Mexicans grapple for dominance, it is not yet clear how much of China will pay the price.",

We heated our house with the fireplace, cooked simple meals on our stove top or ate from food trucks, and listened to the radio at night. It was eerie, quiet and desolate, but we never left.”\n\nFortunately for Racioppo, there was one house with a fence that provided just enough of a buffer between his home and Sandy’s massive waves to prevent total devastation. He lost some $10,000 worth of tools and other possessions, but not the three things that matter most: Barbara, Juno and a lifetime of creative work. Racioppo had long been astute enough to keep his pictures, equipment, negatives, cameras and everything else that goes along with it upstairs.\n\nAll things considered, they came through it with bumps and bruises, but no knockout punch. So after the initial impact of Hurricane Sandy began to ebb, Racioppo did what he always does, albeit reluctantly.

Tehran has always denied seeking nuclear arms.Gabriel praised the agreement as \"a first big step\" and said it was now possible for trade between the countries to increase.\"The agreement reached between the E3+3 and Iran in Vienna has laid the foundations for a normalization of economic relations with Iran,\" Gabriel said before setting off earlier on Sunday. E3+3 refers to the group of countries that negotiated with Iran.\"The precondition for this is that the steps foreseen in the agreement are now implemented,\" said Gabriel.German industry groups have said exports from Europe's largest economy to Iran could as much as quadruple in the next few years due to the nuclear deal and companies like Volkswagen and Siemens as well as thousands of smaller family-owned firms are eager to claw back their dominant role in shipments to Iran.Germany was once Iran's leading supplier from outside the region but in 2007 it lost that position to China, which now sends 15 to 20 times as many goods there as Germany does.Eric Schweitzer, head of Germany's DIHK chambers of trade and commerce, said Gabriel's trip was \"a very good sign\" for business and while German-Iranian trade would not immediately soar, it could more than double to a value of 6 billion euros within around two years.In the medium term it could even jump to 10 billion euros, Schweitzer said.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

He accused some of spreading misinformation and using \"astroturfing\" (fake grassroots) campaigns to persuade politicians to pass legislation making windfarm operations more difficult.\n\n\"They don't observe rules of civilised debate, they are not particularly interested in facts and they have been doing it for years ...

They are building an online portal to encourage renewable energy and windfarm supporters to write letters and lobby politicians, and to give them information and contacts to do so. After Australia, the company plans to expand the campaign to Britain, Canada and possibly the United States.\n\nAlbaek says there are anti-wind activists around the world who \"demonstrate a brazen disregard for fact-based information\" and in Australia the \"rising anti-wind movement could, if unchecked, lead to additional legislative and regulatory restrictions that will constrain the market and choke off the country's exceptional wind potential\".\n\nMcAlpine says the industry's biggest problem is that it has \"broad support from the silent majority but a tiny minority is running a well orchestrated campaign\". [It has] convinced politicians to change policy and we have to turn the debate around.\"\n\n\"There are of course people with legitimate questions about windfarms and we have to do better at answering those questions,\" McAlpine said.

They bully and intimidate supporters of windfarms in rural areas ... to get their way.\"\n\nAs Essential Media poll this month found 76% of people supported building windfarms to generate renewable energy, including 82%cof Labor voters, 71% of Liberal and National party voters and 89% of Greens voters.\n\nAs Guardian Australia reported last week, the federal Coalition would impose new noise monitoring rules on windfarms, which the industry says will inflict crippling costs. Shadow ministers argue it is the only way windfarms can maintain sufficient public support to continue operating.\n\nThe Coalition's policy is to maintain the current target of 20% renewable energy by 2020, but several Coalition MPs who believe new windfarms should be banned and the renewable energy target wound back will attend the rally on Tuesday.\n\nPeople living close to wind farms have reported symptoms including headaches, sleeplessness and nausea, and several residents experiencing the symptoms have given evidence at inquiries. But a recent study by Professor Simon Chapman of the University of Sydney found incidence of the sickness was far more prevalent in communities where anti-windfarm lobbyists had been active. He suggested it might be a psychological phenomenon caused by the belief that turbines make people sick.\n\nProminent among those against wind power is the chairman of Tony Abbott's proposed business advisory council, Maurice Newman, who has called for the renewable energy target to be scrapped because he believes the scientific evidence for global warming and the economic case for renewable energy no longer stack up.\n\nThe anti-wind website Stop These Things says the purpose of Tuesday's rally is to tell a future Coalition government, \"Australia simply can't afford the great wind power fraud.\"",
  "latent_2604": "Marine: 'We're Starting To Fall To The Wayside'\n\nA very small number of Americans are now serving in the military — less than 1 percent. Some are looking for direction; others are inspired by a sense of patriotism or by a family member who served in an earlier war. In the series Who Serves, NPR looks at those who have made a decision few others have — to fight in America's wars.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Gilkey/NPR David Gilkey/NPR\n\nJust after dawn one day last month, Sgt. Jon Moulder led his patrol of Marines out of Combat Outpost Reilly — basically a collection of tents and sandbags and razor wire — and headed down a dusty road in Afghanistan's Helmand province.\n\nMoulder is a short, compact Marine from Nashville, Tenn. He's on his fourth combat tour, split evenly between Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThat's meant a lot of time away from home.\n\n\"Yeah, it's this whole family thing, deploying and keep leaving,\" Moulder says. \"I have my personal views and opinions on things.\"\n\nMoulder has a wife back home and two children — a 6-year-old from a previous marriage and a 2-year-old.\n\nThis is likely his last deployment. But he acknowledges that this life is exciting. It's fighting America's enemies; it's danger; it's firefights.\n\n\"It's the biggest adrenaline rush that you'll ever get,\" he says. \"Not to say that I've done drugs but I don't think drugs could ever ... top the adrenaline rush of getting [into] a firefight.\"\n\n\"That's why guys, when they get home, they just do dumb stuff. [You're] basically an adrenaline junkie for about [the] first month that you're back home from this type of place.\"\n\n'You Never Know When Your Last Footstep Is'\n\nThat adrenaline rush keeps him going. But all those deployments — and the endless patrols — take their toll. Moulder has lost several friends. Others have been seriously wounded, the most recent back in February.\n\n\"My team leader this deployment — he lost half his right leg,\" he says.\n\nOut on that patrol, Moulder stopped at an Afghan security post. It's a small concrete building topped with the country's flag. A couple of Afghans joined the Marines, and they all headed off the road and began to cross a field.\n\nMoulder was relieved to take his patrol off that dirt road. Roads and footpaths hide the crude bombs that kill Americans.\n\nEvery time you come over here on deployment like this, it's like you lose ... a piece of yourself. ... And I don't want to hit that breaking point to where I have no respect for humanity left.\n\n\"I don't trust any roads, really. I hate roads, footpaths – that's what sucks doing what we do. ... You never know when your last footstep is. Like, next footstep could be your last. Next footstep could be losing limbs,\" he says.\n\nSlipping Away\n\nMoulder's had his share of near misses. And for him, and many of the Marines, the question is whether it's all worth it.\n\nLast month in Washington, the debate was about how many troops to bring home.\n\nWhen asked whether he felt that people back home care about the war, Moulder says, \"I think we're starting to fall to the wayside.\"\n\n\"This has been going on for so long,\" he adds. \"Hell, you know, it's America's longest conflict running to date. ... We're kind of like the bastard children of our generation. Starting to become unwanted,\" Moulder says.\n\nHe's feeling forgotten. And that's after having survived four roadside bomb explosions. He's suffered a concussion — he's having trouble sleeping and he's seeing a counselor about post-traumatic stress.\n\nAt times, Moulder says, he feels himself slipping away.\n\n\"Every time you come over here on deployment like this,\" he says, \"it's like you lose ... a piece of yourself. Every time you come over here, little bit of [a] piece of humanity every time. And I don't want to hit that breaking point to where I have no respect for humanity left.\"\n\nMoulder has a little more than a month left on his deployment. He says he has to convince himself to go out each day and risk his life to help the Afghan people.",
  "latent_2614": "Sheldon Adelson, who pressed the White House to nuke Iran, now seems to have threatened Jeb Bush over the fact that a foreign policy adviser, James Baker, addressed a liberal Zionist group last month.\n\nAt issue was Baker’s speech to J Street, which has opposed the settlement project in the West Bank. National Review reports\n\nAdelson sent word to Bush’s camp in Miami: Bush, he said, should tell Baker to cancel the speech. When Bush refused, a source describes Adelson as “rips***”; another says Adelson sent word that the move cost the Florida governor “a lot of money.”\n\nBaker did criticize Netanyahu in that speech. But is Adelson’s pressure why Baker came out against the Iran deal , ahead of the beauty pageant for Republicans that Adelson conducted last week in Las Vegas at the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC)?\n\nNational Review’s Eliana Johnson says that Bush “lost the Adelson primary,” but he hasn’t given up working the big money that is the Israel lobby:\n\nThe tension between Bush and Adelson doesn’t mean the candidate won’t have a chance to raise money from the rest of the pro-Israel crowd. Bush did not attend this year’s RJC leadership meeting, last weekend in Las Vegas, but several of his allies, including Mel Sembler, a top Florida bundler, and Fred Zeidman, a Houston-based fundraiser, were there. His son Jeb Bush Jr. was also in attendance, and his brother George W. Bush delivered the keynote address. Aides to the former Florida governor handed out buttons with “Jeb” emblazoned in Hebrew.\n\nAnd maybe the need for Adelson’s money is what got George W. Bush to come out of his shell, and attend that RJC event in Vegas and attack Obama’s Iran deal? (“Warmonger critical of diplomacy that averts war”– J Street’s Dylan Williams)\n\nThe truckling goes on. Jeb Bush went to the Ramaz School in New York to say the Iran deal is “naive”, while Rand Paul met Jewish day school leaders in Brooklyn. MSNBC\n\nPaul said of his stance toward Israel. “All I can do is keep saying what I believe in,” he added, calling Israel one of America’s “best allies and best friends around the world.” Paul’s stop in Brooklyn comes just days after his potential GOP rival, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, visited The Ramaz School, an orthodox Jewish day school, to celebrate Israel’s Independence Day. Bush has come under fire by some for not immediately coming out against his foreign policy adviser James A. Baker, who was critical of Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nAll this pandering does raise the possibility that the Israel lobby is going to be an issue in the 2016 campaign, with Democrats including Hillary Clinton taking the J Street line, and a few of them actually talking about the end of the two state solution.",

Presumably, a lot of money would go to bike and pedestrian improvements. Is this really the most pressing need at this time?\n\nOver the years, Seattle has acquired a variety of nicknames. Queen City. Rain City. Jet City. And if Mayor Mike McGinn gets his way, Seattle also will be known as the Motor-less City.\n\nOr something like that.\n\nThe bicycle lobby helped elect the mayor and now it wants significant bike striping all over town in return.\n\nThe question of whether this group of citizens can impose their will on the rest of the place will be answered in the next year or so.\n\nThe City Council is pondering creation of a transportation taxing district. After a fair amount of Seattle process, the city would ask that reliable and generous Seattle ATM, the taxpayers, to pay higher property or sales taxes or increased vehicle licensing fees to produce millions of dollars a year for bicycle and pedestrian improvements.\n\nThe council can create the taxing district with a simple council vote — and its creation enables the collecting of new taxes. Then, as soon as next summer or fall, bike and pedestrian groups would be expected to help sell the plan to voters, who must approve most of the taxes.\n\nAt the depth of a stubborn recession, with pressing civic needs ranging from education to public safety, is this really the top priority? Or do these powerful interest groups merely have the city's ear?\n\nAs an avid runner, and occasional biker, I bear no deep-seated opposition to more recreational or commuter space for each and every group. At least theoretically. As a taxpayer, I say hold your spandex bike tights on a minute.\n\nIn 2011 Seattle's Families and Education Levy that supports public-school students comes up for renewal. McGinn flirts with the idea of more public investment in light rail in several locations. And this fall, the big thinkers at King County propose a sales tax increase for public safety. The Legislature patched its leaky budget with a slew of taxes on candy, bottled water, beer and soda pop.\n\nHave a headache?\n\nYou will.\n\nSeattle and King County are oh so adept at sending spending requests to the ballot but pathetic at deciding which money measures to move forward and which to put on hold until the ravaged economy improves.\n\nIf you pose the question to voters, do you prefer a sidewalk in a neighborhood or a police officer downtown, says one wise business leader, the choice just might be public safety.\n\nBut that's not how it works. Each item is put forward as the absolute most important thing for that moment. And why not? The generous voters of Seattle usually say yes\n\nKeep in mind, the bike and pedestrian lobbies, whose efforts began before the arrival of McGinn, are already getting improvements that infuriate some motorists — oops, motorists, swear word, I know. Nickerson Street east-west between the Ballard and Fremont bridges is on a \"road diet\" that provides increased safety, more bicycle lanes and fewer car lanes.\n\nSafety advocates also fought to change the configuration on Northeast 125th Street — again more bike space, fewer car lanes and enhanced safety.\n\nIncreasingly, cars are being shoved aside, as evidenced by efforts to jack up commercial parking rates, the constant plea for more light rail and significant transfer of asphalt to bike lanes.\n\nHad Seattle elected leaders with a better business sense or a more rational view of the affordability or lack of it of living in the city, things might be different. But every new bike lane can make a road less appealing to a car or a truck. Bicycles prevail, freight mobility takes a sorry hike.\n\nThis is all more complicated than it sounds. A tax package might also include money for general road maintenance, transit, money to rebuild the sea wall and a host of other, perhaps worthy endeavors.\n\nThe issue is not the worthiness of any project but the ability to pay for it all. Seattle voters have to decide what kind of city they want: one with affordable taxes and reasonable accommodation for business and jobs, or a bike and pedestrian haven backed by plenty of public spending. And that means generous and frequent donations from Seattleites who may not spend umpteen hours a week on two wheels.\n\nJoni Balter's column appears regularly on editorial pages of The Times.

This means Hillary had knowledge of where all the money went including the $12 MILLION DOLLARS for the Fusion GPS defamation dossier Donna Brazile throwing everyone under the bus, especially Debbie Wasserman Schultz. This is amazing! Maybe now more people will realize the DNC is a corrupt criminal organization that is similar to the Mafia. The DOJ needs to use RICO statutes to prosecute them now. From The Politico: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Secret Takeover of the DNC\n\nWhen I was asked to run the Democratic Party after the Russians hacked our emails, I stumbled onto a shocking truth about the Clinton campaign. Before I called Bernie Sanders, I lit a candle in my living room and put on some gospel music. I wanted to center myself for what I knew would be an emotional phone call. I had promised Bernie when I took the helm of the Democratic National Committee after the convention that I would get to the bottom of whether Hillary Clinton’s team had rigged the nomination process, as a cache of emails stolen by Russian hackers and posted online had suggested. I’d had my suspicions from the moment I walked in the door of the DNC a month or so earlier, based on the leaked emails. But who knew if some of them might have been forged? I needed to have solid proof, and so did Bernie. So I followed the money. My predecessor, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had not been the most active chair in fundraising at a time when President Barack Obama’s neglect had left the party in significant debt. As Hillary’s campaign gained momentum, she resolved the party’s debt and put it on a starvation diet. It had become dependent on her campaign for survival, for which she expected to wield control of its operations. Debbie was not a good manager. She hadn’t been very interested in controlling the party—she let Clinton’s headquarters in Brooklyn do as it desired so she didn’t have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was. How much control Brooklyn had and for how long was still something I had been trying to uncover for the last few weeks. By September 7, the day I called Bernie, I had found my proof and it broke my heart.

On July 20th 1969, he was the first person to walk on the Moon – one of the greatest achievements in human history. He is the most famous and well-known astronaut the world has ever seen. See the fact file below for more interesting facts and information about Neil Armstrong\n\nThat’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\n\nNeil Armstrong was born on August 5, 1930 just outside of Wapakoneta, Ohio. Armstrong was interested in flight from a very early age. When he was just two years old his dad took him to the Cleveland Air Races and he took his first airplane flight in a Ford Trimotor (also known as The Tin Goose ) with his father in Warren, Ohio on July 20, 1936 when he was five. Neil Armstrong could fly a plane before he could drive a car! He got his student flight certificate on his 16th birthday and then did his first solo flight later that month. All of this before he even had a drivers license. At 17, Neil Armstrong studied aeronautical engineering at Purdue University as part of a scholarship by the US Navy. He was also accepted to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) but another engineer who had been to MIT told him he didn’t need to go there for a good education. While at Purdue, Armstrong was called up to fight in the Korean War for the US Navy as a pilot. He flew 78 missions over Korea for a total of 121 hours in the air – most of which were in January of 1952. Neil Armstrong received the Air Medal for 20 combat missions, a Gold Star for the next 20 missions, and the Korean Service Medal and Engagement Star for his heroics in the war. After his service with the Navy, Armstrong returned to Purdue University to complete his studies and got better grades after the war than he did before. He finished with a GPA of 4.8 out of 6.0. In 1955 he joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) which would later become the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). He was an engineer at NACA and was also a test pilot for experimental aircraft and modified bombers – like the X-15 rocket plane which he flew 7 times to maximum altitude of 207,500 feet. In 1962, he was asked whether he would be interested in joining the NASA Astronaut Corps. Without hesitation, Armstrong responded “Yes!”. He moved to Houston, Texas to join the astronaut program. Neil Armstrong was the Command Pilot for the Gemini 8 mission on March 16, 1966, along with fellow astronaut David Scott as Pilot. During this mission, they managed to dock two vehicles in space, which had never been done before. The mission was cut short though because of technical difficulties. Armstrong was also a backup Command Pilot for the Gemini 11 mission. He had a lot of knowledge about the systems used on the mission and took on a teaching role for Gemini 11.\n\nOn July 16, 1969 that Neil Armstrong, along with fellow astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, launched the Apollo 11 manned mission to the Moon.\n\nJuly 20, 1969 is one of the most memorable days in human history, as Neil Armstrong piloted Buzz Aldrin to the Moon’s surface in the Lunar Module. They spent over two hours collecting rock samples, taking photographs and exploring the surface of the Moon. Apollo 11 returned to Earth on July 24, 1969.\n\nAs Neil Armstrong placed his left boot onto the surface of the moon at 2:56 UTC July 21, 1969, he spoke the now famous words: “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.“\n\nAfter his return to Earth, Armstrong became an instant celebrity. He was never comfortable with the media attention though and rarely gave interviews on the mission. He worked with NASA until the 70s when he retired to become a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati.\n\nNeil Armstrong died in Cincinnati, Ohio, on August 25, 2012, after complications from heart surgery. He was 82 when he died.\n\nNeil Armstrong Worksheets\n\nThis bundle includes 15 ready-to-use Neil Armstrong worksheets spanning over 30 pages!

  "latent_2908": "Syrian Kurds are taking critical steps to deal with the threat of being caught in a vise between their worsening relations with the Damascus regime, and Turkey's possible cross-border operations. Syria's Kurds have just proposed a new governmental structure comprising three federal regions and six cantons in the Democratic Federal System of Northern Syria (previously known as Rojava). They have devised a three-phase election calendar to decide who will run these new areas.\n\nKurds worry that the US alliance with the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) will be diluted once the Islamic State (IS) is forced out of Raqqa. They believe that Washington will then opt to improve its ties with Ankara. They are now moving quickly to consolidate their gains before the next Geneva conference on the Syrian civil war.\n\nHow is this Kurdish democratic autonomy structure shaping up?\n\nThe Constituent Assembly of the Democratic Federal System of Northern Syria convened at Rmelan from July 27-28 and adopted a series of critical decisions, with delegates participating from Jazeera, Kobani, Afrin, Manbij, Tell Abyad and Raqqa. According to a document Al-Monitor obtained, the July 27 decision revises the original cantonal system of Jazeera, Kobani and Afrin into three regions with six cantons attached to them:\n\nThe Jazeera Federal Region includes Hasakah and Qamishli cantons. Hasakah canton comprises the towns of Hasakah, Darbasiya, Serekaniye (Ras al-Ain), Tel Tamir, Shadi, Arisha and Hula. Qamishli canton comprises the towns of Qamishli, Derik, Amude, Tirbesiye, Tel Hamis and Tel Barak.\n\nThe Euphrates Federal Region includes Kobani canton and its towns (Kobani and Sirrin), and Tell Abyad canton and its towns (Ain Issa and Suluk).\n\nThe Afrin Federal Region includes Afrin canton and its towns (Afrin, Jandairis and Raqqa), and Sheba canton and its towns (Tel Rifaat, Ehraz, Fafeyn and Kafr Naya).\n\nYou may have heard of Sheba. It's a new name that Kurds are using for the area that covers Jarablus, Azaz, Manbij, Tel Aryan and Tel Hasil, all west of the Euphrates. Of these locations, Manbij is considered to be outside the Democratic Federal System of Northern Syria. Actually, apart from Tel Rifaat, all other locations are under the control of Operation Euphrates Shield forces (fighters from the Turkish army and the Free Syrian Army). Although Kurdish civilian administration bodies have been set up in these places, they, along with Raqqa, are not considered Kurdish-controlled.\n\nAn official of the Kurdish nationalist Democratic Union Party (PYD) from Raqqa told Al-Monitor by phone: “After they are liberated, the people of Raqqa will decide their status. We are simply helping them. I think Raqqa will be a Kurdish entity outside the federation, like Sheikh Maksoud in Aleppo.”\n\nThe Sheba Region Executive Assembly officially declared the formation of Sheba canton Aug. 6. The assembly was formed in February 2016, with the participation of 17 representatives from Azaz, 17 from al-Bab, six from Jarablus and six from Safira. Since Tel Rifaat delegates joined, the assembly now has 56 members.\n\nAccording to a decision made at the Rmelan meeting, there will be communal elections Sept. 22, followed by cantonal and municipal elections Nov. 3 and elections for the People's Assembly of the Federal Regions and the Democratic Federal System of Northern Syria People's Congress on Jan. 19.\n\nAmid myriad ambiguities, why did Rojava decide to speed up its work and devise an election calendar?\n\nTurkey says it will not allow an autonomous entity in the region while a \"de-confliction zone\" is being formed. Security and government officials — and even many members of Turkey’s opposition parties — see that possibility as a threat to the state's integrity and existence. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made that clear Aug. 2 when he said, “We are determined to expand the dagger we stabbed into their project of forming a terror entity in Syria. Very soon we will take new and important steps in this direction.” Turkey considers the PYD a terrorist group.\n\nSome commentators think the United States will not need Turkey after the Raqqa operation is complete. Washington has persistently asked Turkey to refrain from any action that might affect the Raqqa mission because Kurds have warned they will withdraw their forces from Raqqa to defend their own northern areas if Turkey threatens action.\n\nAnother important development is the Damascus regime's increasingly hardened position toward the Kurds. It infuriates the Damascus regime to see the Kurds cooperating with the United States and allowing US forces to set up military bases.\n\nFaisal Mikdad, Syria’s deputy foreign minister, recently said the Kurdish elections \"will be nothing but a joke.\"\n\n\"Syria will never allow the division of its soil,\" he said. \"We know there are Syrian citizens in the north who will not endanger this country. Those striving to divide the country know well the price they will be made to pay.\"\n\nThis is the strongest language the Syrian regime has used in its relations with Syrian Kurds.\n\nAnother factor to bear in mind is the new Geneva process. The United States, despite its partnership with the Kurds against IS, couldn’t arrange for the PYD and its allies to participate in the Geneva talks because of a veto by Turkey and the objections of the Syrian opposition. Russia also couldn’t arrange for the Kurds to join the talks in Geneva or Astana, Kazakhstan. But there are rumors that the Syrian opposition, which is about to select a new negotiation team at a Riyadh gathering, may come up with an opening for Kurds. According to the draft constitution leaked to Arab media outlets, Kurds would have a place in the new power-sharing proposal. The president would be Sunni, with one Christian and one Alawi deputy president. There would be a presidential council. The parliamentary speaker would be Druze and the chief of staff would be Kurdish, according to the draft.\n\nA Kurdish representative who was in the Rmelan meeting is dismissive of the Riyadh meeting, which he said will support the regime. “Like the Syrian opposition,\" he said, \"they invited independent Kurds to Riyadh instead of Rojava Kurdish actors. They will recruit a Kurd, but that won’t be anyone representing us.”\n\nThe PYD official in Raqqa had this analysis for Al-Monitor: “Whether we have US assurances or not, we are trying to thwart a Turkish occupation by relying on the coalition. There is no US guarantee for Afrin. We cannot yet say that the US will disappear after the Raqqa operation. Deir ez-Zor is next in line [in the battle against IS]. After Raqqa, the political process will gain prominence. The Syrian Democratic Forces [the US-supported alliance in which the Kurds play a significant role] will control all areas liberated, including Raqqa. If Damascus accepts the Democratic Federal System, the problem will be over. If not, the US will support the Syrian Democratic Forces until a solution is found. We don’t know what they are discussing at Riyadh now, but I don’t think the draft constitution will be approved because our [the PYD] model is totally different.\n\n\"Moreover, it is not all that important to go Geneva anymore because Geneva came to us. Twenty days ago the Raqqa Civilian Assembly had a video conference with 73 countries that support the coalition. Commanders of US forces come [to us]. Soon, other delegations will also come. In other words, today we have the full backing of the coalition. I don’t favor joining the new Syria delegation [that will be] decided at Riyadh because they will do everything to marginalize us. Turkey is now working on handing over Afrin to the Syrian regime, but we are in contact with the Russians about it. We are ready for every eventuality.”\n\nThis is how the Kurds are trying to transfer the situation from the battlefield to the table and raise the bar for negotiations. But do they have a unified, free hand? Can they afford to ignore the multitude of potential spoiler elements on the Kurdish side that have their own interests and aspirations?",

Those were okay, so maybe this will be tolerable.\n\nTo be honest, I was expecting to hate it. Or rather, I was hoping to hate it. Felicia Day has built her own success, yes, but the odds that she could have anything to say that I’d care about, seemed pretty low. It was going to be just another silly memoir about someone being successful.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nSo much of what she talked about mirrors my own life and insecurities. The anxiety and self doubt that haunt artists and creators of all types. Are we good enough? Can we finish? What are we without our art? How do we deal with criticism in an age where any asshat with an internet connection can spew vile things and it’s almost impossible to ignore them. Author John Scalzi once told me not to feed the trolls, and Day agrees that’s the best policy. But she also admits how hard it can be to ignore those pesky fucktards.\n\nSome of her struggles actually had me crying in the car. I’m not afraid to say it. She touched a nerve. It wasn’t the simpering of an injured lion, it was full out girly bawling. I related to what she had to say on a very personal level. It wasn’t just me. Other people feel this way, too.\n\nI wanted to reach out and hug her and tell her she’s awesome. I’m glad she’s still on this planet and her work counts. Ignore the dicks on the internet who haven’t had an original thought or put themselves out there. Do your own thing. We love you for you.\n\nPossibly I’m getting a little melodramatic. If so, I’m sorry. I won’t park in your driveway, Felicia. Unless you provide snacks.\n\nIn many ways she not only reminds me of myself, but of one of my daughters. I guess that makes it even more personal. I get really angry when internet jerks say mean things about her. I have absolutely no claim to know her. But when someone nameless attacks her, yeah, I get a little White Knight about it. Just like if someone said something mean to one of my children, I’d punch them in the throat and feed them to my dog.\n\nWhat’s wrong with White Knights anyway? They’re the good guys. I’m a fat old man, I can be a White Knight if I want to. Don’t judge me.\n\nWell, if you’re not clear about it yet, I loved the book. I think it should be required reading for anyone creative. Or for anyone who lives with or loves a creative person. There’s a reason we’re the way we are, all of us. It helps to know we’re not alone.",
  "latent_3087": "The BBC director general, Mark Thompson, is prepared to meet some or all of the £300m annual costs of running the World Service, in a last-ditch attempt to prevent a £556m raid on its finances to fund the cost of free TV licences for the over-75s, MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal.\n\nEmbroiled in crisis talks over BBC financing in the hours before the government's comprehensive spending review is agreed, the corporation's negotiators have been told that ministers are also considering whether to force the BBC to meet the costs of the World Service, which is currently paid for by the Foreign Office.\n\nThat would be an alternative to making the BBC pay out £556m to fund the costs of free television licences for anywhere home to an elderly person – a bill that may force existing television and radio budgets to be slashed.\n\nThompson's team says it is time to \"start having a more reasonable conversation\" about the BBC paying for the World Service because the service is a broadcaster, although it is not clear if the BBC would be prepared to pay the entire bill through the licence fee. By contrast, if the BBC were forced to fund the cost of free TV licences for the elderly there would be no benefit for most viewers on screen or on air.\n\nPolitical sources report that the government's position is in a state of flux, as negotiations go down to the wire. However, there are indications this morning that ministers are moving towards favouring the BBC bearing the costs of the World Service because of the political complications of the alternative.\n\nYesterday, the BBC set down its opposition to paying for free TV licences, with the BBC Trust saying it \"would be unacceptable for licence-fee payers to pick up a bill for what is a universal benefit\". The cost of funding the benefit, received by 4m homes, almost exactly matches the £575m budget for BBC2.\n\nMinisters are searching for last-minute cost-saving proposals after the Ministry of Defence achieved a better than expected settlement. Defence budgets are being cut by 8%, rather than the 10% originally expected, leading to a funding gap elsewhere.\n\nThere are suggestions that the World Service could be funded by some of the profits made by BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm, which licenses formats such as Strictly Come Dancing, Doctor Who and Top Gear overseas. Last year, Worldwide made an operating profit of £140m, although that cash is used to fund the BBC's wider activities.\n\nAlthough the bulk of the BBC's activities are funded by the £145.50 television licence fee, the World Service has always been funded directly by the government. Traditionally the World Service has been focused on \"lifeline\" short-wave radio services for countries such as Burma where independent local broadcasters are weak, but in recent years activity has shifted to developing more expensive Arabic and Farsi (Persian) television channels.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said that \"no comments were being made prior to the announcement of the spending review\".\n\n• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

We can see this good work beginning to pay off.’\n\nHe said the Church was hearing from ‘growing numbers of women with new interest in the religious life to provide for the many needs of the marginalised or excluded in our society.’\n\n“What is becoming increasingly clear, I think for all of us, is that our country needs spiritual leaders to take over the reins from our political leaders in order to guide us out of a cultural decline that is now beyond the power of politics to solve,” Bishop Keenan said.\n\n“There is a huge amount to be done to restore to Scotland the Christian strength whose absence lies at the heart of so many of our recent and most perplexing anxieties and there is a sense that God is raising up just such leaders for this task of our times.”\n\nFour men have been ordained to the priesthood in the past ten days, with more waiting in the wings.\n\nFive priests will be ordained for Motherwell Diocese this year, one for Glasgow Archdiocese, one for Paisley Diocese, two for Aberdeen Diocese, two for the Scottish Ordinariate and one Salesian.\n\nThe last year so many priests were ordained was 1997. Since then there has been an average of five priests a year ordained and in 2008 there were no ordinations at all.\n\nFr Jonathan Whitworth was ordained in St Andrew’s Greenock last Friday and he wants to see more men follow in his footsteps.\n\n“It takes a real man to be a priest, I really have to state that. You are called to be a father of all families yet not having one of your very own, so it takes heroism. I have to say that young men are calling out for something that is radical because they have been sold something of a false reality by the world at the moment,” he said.\n\n“By radical I mean you give your all to it; you take your chance with God.

  "latent_3665": "The issue of Starcraft 2 (or e-sports but lets focus on SC2) being a charity has come up a lot recently with the downward spiral that its presumably in. There are a large number of things to blame for it but we won’t go directly into that. Today I am going to address an issue with Korea specifically that fits under the illusion category that is specific to this blog as well as addresses the act of expecting it to be a charity. That is that “as long as we are pro gamers we will get paid”.\n\nTo try to get you into my head and thought process I am going to take you back to a time when things were good. Personally my fondest memory of Korean SC2 was GSL Season 3. When Moonglade and I made the trek to Korea, him to play and me to check things out. Code A Quals was packed to the rafts, there were 6-8 foreigners trying out and the buzz was great. GSL was hosting shows on non game days (much like regular sports do) and viewership most likely was close to its peak at this time.\n\nWe all remember watching the matches, NESTEA, SC, MVP, MC etc. all duking it out for the championship. Times were good and the inflow of money was just before its peak. Korea had made it, Starcraft 2 was on the world stage.\n\nAnd then……\n\nIt appears that multiple sponsorship of the event itself was not occurring. I do not blame GOM at all for this, the Korean business environment and set up is tipped heavily in the KESPA sides favor just by the sheer number of businesses attached to its core. (With a tiny bit of research of companies such as CJ you will see what I mean). They required a non-korean business development team to market the awesome product they had abroad.\n\nAt the same time, teams were unable to secure good Sponsorship’s, Viewership numbers of GOMTV were not being released to the team and were not able to be used to obtain sponsorship. They could have been the tipping point on a lot of deals but we will never know.\n\nPlayers demands increased significantly due to foreign gamer inflation. Personally I feel that this is a very important part of what has gone wrong in Korea. False rumors of mega salaries to sub par gamers caused better gamers to start pushing for more money but at the same time they did not want to do what it takes to be worth that extra money because they were ‘champions’. (I remember back to when a code B player asked me for 6k a month + travel and then said thats what XYZ foreigner was getting, when they weren’t, I said if you can do X , Y and Z and get your fanbase to Q they could have it. They asked why they should do that when they are better than the other player).\n\nFinally KESPA preventing participation of proleague from ESF teams was one of the nails in the coffin. The viewership would have boomed for that season of proleague because of the hype, the ‘elephant in the room’ and the fan favorites all molding into one enormous bang. Instead we saw arrogance from the organisation and lack of vision that essentially split an already small community in half.\n\nWhats this got to do with Starcraft 2 being a charity you are asking?\n\nWell my dear friend Choya recently said that WCS is killing or has killed Korean SC2. Which is false in my opinion. Without WCS Korea would most likely have very little money or pretty much nothing for Starcraft 2. They are saying this is the last season of proleague so you can scratch that from the SC2 books, OSL viewership was less than Destiny’s (slight exaggeration) and would have been dumb to continue on, leaving GSL the one which was not marketed properly when it was in the boom. WCS injected clean money into the scene when it needed it most (Korea). Unfortunately, the Korean gamers are not used to money leaving their game (as with brood war) and are expecting someone to foot the bill. Brood war was of a different time. There was almost nothing competing against it and a bunch of the biggest group of companies in Asia decided to put together a league of which they fully controlled. The money didn’t go away because there was no where for it to go. Nowadays there are plenty of options on where to spend your companies money and Starcraft 2 right now in Korea would be at the bottom of the list. Yet, people are still expecting to get paid because they do their 8-10 hours of game time and show up to their matches. This…. is charity.\n\nWhy the bottom of the list Josh? Starcraft is the hardest game and has the highest skill ceiling!!\n\nNo company cares what Starcraft 2 is. All they care about is what it can do for them. And right now it can do very little. The Korean players have made very little effort to make themselves a product and they do not try overly hard to reach out to their fan base. (Of course there are exceptions like MC for example, but he is paid well for his work so its case and point).\n\nLeague of legends in Korea have at least one thing going for them and that is consistent stable viewership. They have the KESPA backing (access to the majority of significant companies in Korea as well as professional training) and then they have RIOT supporting them as well. The stability is good and its being utilized better (even though I am certainly not a fan). The numbers alone are enough for a good sales person to walk into a meeting room and get the marketing execs attention, it would be up to their talent to seal the deal.\n\nHow can we fix it?\n\nSome would argue its beyond repair but I don’t believe it is. WCS is holding up the ceiling at the moment and its up to teams and organisations to work around that. GOMTV needs to bring back its variety shows and a subscription model for them. Teams need to some how obtain training to grow their fan base (yes it is still possible) and then GOMTV can use some of the subscriber money to pay appearance fees to popular players for the shows. Ultimately they need to cater to the foreign audience directly and have the Korean side as the secondary. After that they will need to find a decent agency abroad to find them advertising and sponsorship and keep their product fresh.\n\nThey also should probably wait a year or two before giving in to any demands for higher wages as this is a common mistake in the e-sports industry in general. (Of course if someone is working for free they should get paid if this is successful. But those on livable wages should probably not see an increase for 12-24 months).\n\nAs viewers, we should not expect to flip the bill of an organisation or team (this means giving them money, not purchasing a product). They need to put on a show professionally, grab our attention, bring us in and sell to us. If they cannot do the simple parts of business they should probably take a step back from whatever they are doing and not spend money that they inevitably will not have.\n\nFinally it would be up to the community to understand that nothing will or should be forever free but the product must be worth paying for and priced correctly.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nI have decided to leave a message after all my blogs that will be below the line that is shown above for the reason of addressing certain things.\n\nFirstly, Choya is an awesome person and I always wish him all the best. My personal and social side never mixes with my business side so harshness or bluntness could create an image that I am not trying to portray. GOMTV has done an awesome job in the past with their events. I still watch occasionally but the production has become some what stale (even with a new studio). I really like the people who are there, Mr Chae is one of the greatest people I have met in e-Sports and again I mean no ill will towards them by writing this blog. I am most certain that GOMTV would be able to highlight some of my own mistakes as well and would not hold it against them.\n\nFinally I want to say that I am only addressing WCS Korea. My opinion of the WCS tournaments in other regions is entirely different so we should not confuse them with Korea.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nJoshua Dentrinos\n\n(Ex-FXOBoSs)\n\nplug plug plug twitter plug plug plug @gosutrading\n\nAdvertisements",

Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico.\"\n\nKasich's camp offered an inverse statement within minutes, saying it will \"give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana\" while focusing on New Mexico and Oregon.\n\nBoth campaigns called on their allies and third-party groups to cooperate with this approach.\n\nTrump responded late Sunday on Twitter:\n\nWow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination.

  "latent_3746": "State of Decay was one of the gaming highlights of 2013 (and much of 2014). A persistent, open-world zombie survival game, with base-building, resource management, and perma-death? Heck yes! It was unique and addictive – the kind of game that is different for every player, yet with a cohesive, universal feeling and message. And soon, State of Decay fans and newcomers alike will get to experience the post-apocalyptic adventure in a whole new light in State of Decay: Year-One Survival Edition for Xbox One.\n\nState of Decay puts you in the center of a zombie apocalypse in Trumbull Valley. With an ever-growing band of survivors under your control, you have to figure out a way to stay alive long enough to escape. In Year-One Survival Edition, along with the base game, you get both DLCs: A more open-ended, “how long can you survive” experience (Breakdown), and a more structured experience (Lifeline) that includes a different location (Danforth) and you playing as a military unit, Greyhound One. Year-One Survival Edition comes with all three for $29.99 – which is an insane deal.\n\nFor its Xbox One upgrade, State of Decay gets a fancy new coat of 1080p paint. New textures add an increased level of detail to the world, and the lighting changes make day more vibrant… and night more treacherous. The increased draw distance lets you see zombie hordes coming from way down the road, giving you more time to prepare (or panic).\n\nBut State of Decay is really about the people, and developer Undead Labs made improvements to them as well. New animations make both humans and zombies move more fluidly and realistically, while an improved interface makes it easier for players to manage items, equip weapons, and make snap decisions during an intense horde attack. On top that, some of the characters from the Lifeline expansion are now playable in the Breakdown expansion.\n\nOh, and you’ve got a knife now – a sweet, sharp-ass knife. So if your melee weapon breaks, you can go all Michael Myers on the zombies instead of kicking them to death.\n\nFor the loyal State of Decay fans, Microsoft and Undead Labs are sweetening the deal: Everyone who already owns the Xbox 360 version receives a 33% discount on Year-One Survival Edition when it hits Xbox One later this year. On top of that, returning players receive a new exclusive character, the sword-wielding Indian-American badass, Gurubani.\n\nYear-One Survival Edition is truly impressive, and definitely closer to the vision that Undead Labs had for the original game. State of Decay was an ambitious project – and it’s exciting to see it on hardware powerful enough to really handle its apocalyptic scope.",
  "latent_3796": "Version reviewed\n\nEnglish Revised Printing edition 2012\n\nIntroduction\n\nElder Sign makes a decent fist of providing a Lovecraftian adventure experience but its inherent randomness undermines it in both theme and mechanics. That’s why we gave it only two and a half stars in our review. As always though, that’s just our opinion. That and fifty pence will get you a cup of coffee, as they say. Don’t they? They say something like that. Is it fifty pence for a coffee? Do people buy coffee any more? What’s with this Poke man thing I hear all the kids talking about these days?\n\nIt doesn’t matter what we think. There are a hundred review sites out there with thoughtful critiques of every game under the sun. The question that we’re uniquely positioned to answer is whether or not you can play it if you want. Is it going to banish inaccessibility to the hell of fire and ghosts, or is it going to summon an unplayable Cthuluesque monstrosity into your living room? Let’s find out.\n\nColour Blindness\n\nBroadly speaking, it’s fine. Broadly. There are some colour choices that are going to clash with certain categories of colour blindness, but colour is never the sole differentiating channel of information for cards and game state. Consider the back of the resource decks:\n\nThe colour palette isn’t great, but each different card type has a big icon in the centre that uniquely identifies what they are. Colour choices elsewhere are mostly fine:\n\nBuuuuutttt…\n\nThose with Protanopia may find the dice a little awkward to work with, since the red dice is very difficult to distinguish from the green dice. Other categories of colour-blindness should be fine, although those with Deuteronopia may find there’s less discrimination between the red and yellow dice than they might like.\n\nThis extends to the various cards that provide, or lock, coloured dice:\n\nHere, the situation is slightly reversed. It’s easier for those with Protanopia to distinguish the dice than it is for those with Deuternopia, due to the slightly different colour palettes used.\n\nThe yellow and red dice aren’t just extra dice – they’re actually more powerful. It’s important that you’re not rolling those when you are supposed to be using one of the plain old green ones. As such, this is a pretty substantial game-play issue for those with colour-blindness. Not only that, but the red and yellow dice are different from each other, not just different from base level green dice. You shouldn’t be rolling one when you need the other one. They’re non-standard dice too, which means you can’t just go grab a replacement of a more easily differentiated colour without constructing a lookup table.\n\nWe’re going to offer a tentative recommendation here though. If you’re playing with someone that isn’t colour blind, it won’t be difficult for them to keep you on track, Since it’s a co-operative game there’s no cost to you indicating a difficulty in identifying which die is which. If you’re playing a solo game, you might find it difficult to keep track, but you can visually scan the offending dice to work it out. The red die has a wildcard and a four investigation symbol on it, and the yellow die has a four investigation symbol but no wild-card. It’s flow breaking, not game breaking.\n\nVisual Accessibility\n\nText is reasonably well contrasted throughout, although some of the special ability text is in a rather small font.\n\nInvestigation totals to be rolled can be quite difficult to make out due to the small font size, and some of the ornamentation on task symbols may be tricky to identify with certain categories of visual impairment. This is particularly true when dealing with the monster borders around tasks, or the blank silver monster space:\n\nDifferentiation isn’t bad as such, just not optimal.\n\nMany of the tokens in the game are absolutely tiny, especially the doom tokens and the investigator tokens.\n\nThe investigator tokens are moved from card to card to indicate your position in the museum. This is also gameplay information you need to know about other players if you want to make use of their ability to offer assistance with dice rolls.\n\nFont choice on the adventure cards is a problem for flavour text, since it’s printed in a font that’s supposed, I presume, to mirror vaguely spooky handwriting. It’s both lighter than I’d like to see against the background, and difficult to read because of its ornamentation. Flavour text on monsters too is printed in a tiny font that might be difficult to make out, although this isn’t critical to play. It does have an impact on atmosphere though, and in a game like this atmosphere is important.\n\nThe dice used are non-standard, requiring the adoption of a lookup table if you want to use an accessible alternative. The back of the manual has a table showing the dice faces, and it could be used as a lookup table in a pinch.\n\nOtherwise you’ll need to make three lookup tables since each of the coloured dices have a different profile.\n\nRemember too that this is basically Cthulhu Yahtzee. You’ll usually be rolling six dice, and often making use of another two. If you have braille or oversized dice, you’re going to need eight to comfortably deal with the tasks at once, and you’ll need to be cross-referencing the lookup table as you do. It’s not ideal.\n\nTokens are not very well differentiated in terms of their tactility. Each of the investigators shares the same profile, and the sanity/health tokens are all the same size and shape. Some of these have numbers printed on them too, to effectively create the problem of denominations of token you can’t tell apart by touch.\n\nAt the end of each turn you need to move the clock on, but there’s no tactile clue as to its current value, or even its intended orientation. It’s a circular piece of cardboard, and you’ll have to pick it up to easily rotate the hand. It might be anyone’s guess as to what it ends up showing if you can’t make out the numerals.\n\nFor solo play, we wouldn’t be prepared to recommend it at all. However, it’s ideally a game of co-operative play and as such it’s worth also taking into account that all of these issues are likely to go away if playing in a team with at least one sighted played. The flavour text is not long, and reading it aloud for the benefit of the table can be a powerfully atmospheric play choice. Since you’ll only have a few investigators, and only a handful of rooms in play at once, you can reasonably easily track who is where in memory. It’s easy to give a narrative overview of game-state too, such as ‘Mandy Thompson is dealing with the remains of the high priest, while Darrell is in the loading dock’.\n\nSo, we’re going to offer a tentative recommendation for Elder Sign for those with visual impairments, but we do suggest it is likely most playable if you’re part of a team, and nobody minds taking on the role of the narrator for the table.\n\nCognitive Accessibility\n\nThe game doesn’t require any serious investment of thought in play, but it does need a considerable grasp of logical causality to appreciate what’s happening and why.\n\nIn day to day play, there are only a handful of decisions you’ll need to make:\n\nWhich of the rooms is best suited for your investigator Which of your resources do you want to burn to get extra dice Which dice do you spend on completing a task When is it appropriate to use your special ability\n\nThat’s about it. Nothing about it is very challenging. Really once you’ve set the wheels in motion all you’re doing is rolling the dice for the outcome. It’s very similar to the basic flow of Galaxy Trucker in that respect.\n\nHowever, there is a reading level that’s required to understand how each of the powers work, how the terror effects should be resolved, and what special conditions pertain to mythos effects and rooms in play. Coupled to this, there is a fair amount of symbology used throughout that players are going to need to become comfortable with. There is though a lookup table provided on the back of the manual. That’s handy, because the rule-book is singularly badly structured if you want to make use of it as a reference guide.\n\nThere’s quite a lot of conditional complexity that goes into making sure each of the rooms are set up correctly, such as with the different kind of monster tokens, the placement rules for these, and the impact that locked dice and monsters have on play. Some rooms have terror effects, or effects that trigger at midnight. Gate adventures enter and leave the game according to a different set of rules. Each of the elder gods against which you may be battling have different powers that trigger at different times. Some cards have individual tasks that must be completed before other tasks, others have tasks that must be completed in a specific order.\n\nMythos effects too may change the way game rules work. For example, mythos cards exist that tell investigators they can ignore arrow order information on cards, or add additional terror effects to all adventures. Mythos effects may lock dice, or prevent the use of spells or equipment. It adds a lot of flavour, but it also adds a lot of conditionality on the way rules are applied.\n\nFortunately there are few synergistic effects in the game and most items have a simple ‘do this to achieve this’ mechanic. That limits the escalation of cognitive complexity considerably.\n\nThere’s not a lot needed in terms of memory management – everything tends to be in front of you all the time. The goals are clearly indicated as part of the laid out cards, and each special effect is documented somewhere in the game grid. Long term strategy is fairly simple, focusing primarily on maximising the efficiency with which elder signs are procured. As such, it places only a light memory burden on players.\n\nThe game is likely playable with support for those with minor to moderate cognitive impairments, but we would prioritise many games before Elder Sign in that regard. As such, we can’t really recommend it, even tentatively, given the conditional complexity involved. The dice rolling is not complicated in and of itself, but you’d need to spend a lot of time explaining why things are happening and what the consequences of the rolling will be. In the solo game, the expectation too is that a player will control multiple investigators, with all the attendant increase in cognitive complexity that implies.\n\nFor those with memory impairments only, we’re prepared to offer a recommendation. What memory burden it places is primarily in the area of symbols, and there are quick references available for these in the game documentation.\n\nEmotiveness\n\nAs we discussed in the review, this game doesn’t so much have a challenge curve as it does a despair curve. Some cards are so sensitive that a single wrong die roll can be enough to lose you the entire thing. Consider the Koi Pond example – if you roll a terror die and can’t complete the task, you’ve failed. For any green die, you’ve got a one in six chance of rolling a terror. The first task requires a single terror. You’re probably going to succeed with the first task.\n\nThen you need to roll, in one round, a terror and two skulls. So, that’s a one in six chance and two further one in six chances. But now you’re doing it with five dice since you spent one. If you don’t get that exact roll, but you do get a terror, you’ll just fail instantly unless you’ve got re-rolls. Simply attempting the task can create performance anxiety. The cost of failure can be high for certain tasks too – they can spawn monsters, add to the doom track, or more. Terror effects can have consequences for everyone playing. You’re not to blame for that, because ‘lol roll better’ isn’t really actionable advice. But you’re still the one that made it happen.\n\nThat means communal consequences for outcomes you have limited ability to influence. Not a great place to be if emotional accessibility is an important issue.\n\nFailures compound powerfully, too. A terror roll that spawns a monster might end up with dice being locked out of play. Dice being locked out of play may make adventures all but impossible, which can create more failures which can accelerate you along the track to your rapid demise. As with anything, if you can get into the spirit of it then it’s probably okay. I’m not sure how you do that for Elder Sign though given how arbitrary everything is.\n\nIt’s possible for players to be devoured during play, but at least the cost of this is relatively low. You lose all your accumulated resources, but you bring another investigator in to replace the one that was killed. Player elimination in other words isn’t a major problem.\n\nSince Elder Sign is a cooperative game, it does at least mean that everyone wins or everyone loses. That mitigates some of the issues of despair or challenge. As frustrating as it can get to be locked out of progress, or blocked from using the spells and items you had counted on, at least nobody is getting rich off of your misery. The game has no formal scoring mechanic other than ‘how many doom tokens there are versus how many elder signs you collected’. Score disparities can be very high, given how easily doom tokens are accumulated. Again, if it’s a crushing failure at least it’s a group failure.\n\nWe’re willing to offer a tentative recommendation. If this were a competitive game we wouldn’t be willing to give even that, but the fact it’s co-operative mitigates a number of these problems. Perhaps best not to play it solo though.\n\nPhysical Accessibility\n\nMany of the tokens are tiny, and easily dropped or mishandled. Many of the cards too are about a third the size of a standard playing card, while others are perhaps one and a half times that size. That irregularity of size makes card manipulation tricky at times. There’s not a lot of shuffling involved though, other than at setup, and there’s no need for secret hands of cards. If everyone knows what everyone else has, there’s no loss to game integrity.\n\nThere is a lot of dice rolling, and you’re rolling a lot of dice each time. Since the game state is non-contiguous, there’s a risk that you’ll knock everything out of alignment if you’re not a little careful with how this is done. It’s best accompanied by a dice tower, a dice cup, or a dice rolling tray.\n\nYou need to move your investigator from card to card to indicate movement, and there will as a result be a fair amount of reaching over the game state. However, since it’s a game with a non-contiguous state there’s no reason you can’t arrange everything in a way that is comfortable for everyone to access.\n\nYou’ll accumulate a hand of resources as you go along, including spells, magic items, common items, and occasionally allies. You’ll pick up clue tokens too, and have to mark wounds and sanity damage with tiny tokens. There’s a fair bit of traffic as cards are traded and exchanged, and small denomination damage tokens are exchanged for larger tokens. Drawing of monsters is supposed to happen randomly from a cup or other receptacle, which could be a problem for the more serious categories of physical impairment.\n\nHowever, if none of this is possible the game offers a good degree of verbal discrimination. All of the adventures have unique, and evocative names. Every adventurer has their own name, and each of the resources likewise is unambiguously titled. You won’t have a problem in issuing instructions if that’s a suitable alternative for direct engagement with the game. That’s not going to be an option in solo play of course, but it’ll work reasonably well for group play.\n\nAs such, we tentatively recommend Elder Sign for those with physical impairments.\n\nCommunication\n\nThere is a required reading level for play, and a need to communicate some very basic strategy throughout in group settings. There is otherwise no requirement for specific communication.\n\nAs a result, it’s recommended in this category.\n\nSocioeconomic Accessibility\n\nElder Sign has something of a troubling theme for those that may not be willing to countenance the end of all things at the hand of impassive, intolerant ancient gods. It’s never particularly overt in its horror, and throughout it tends to imply more than outright state some of the things that are going on.\n\n“The dark pool on the marble tiles chilled me to the bone. Then I heard the scraping noise’\n\n“The words rewrote my past. Where I had succeeded, they told of my failure and my sudden disappearance”\n\n“What was it that I saw? I cannot say. My mind rebels at the very thought of recalling that which stood before me. I fear madness is truly preferable to a clear memory of that unspeakable thing”\n\nAs vaguely comic as the cavalcade of monsters, magic and mayhem becomes in Elder Sign, I have to say it nails the sinister understatement of Lovecraft’s most effective cosmic horror. As such, the disquiet that you might feel when playing it is going to be entirely generated in your own mind as a response to contemplation of the theme. It’s not a scary game, but it is a game that constantly toys with frightening implications. Those of a sensitive disposition won’t likely find anything especially troubling in day to day play. I make no guarantees for what happens in the dead of some sleepless night. There are passages of Lovecraft I still hear reverberating around my skull when I’m gripped in Insomnia’s vice. There are sections of Elder Sign that threaten the same.\n\nOn the other hand, I can imagine quite easily most people will play it without ever even giving the subtle complexity of the mythos a second thought. Or even a first one. Or a third one.\n\nI have some issues too with the use of the tired cliché of the sanity meter. This takes an absurdly reductionist view of mental health and represents it as something akin to the petrol in a car. That if you get ‘a bit insane’ you can just top up your sanity from the well of psychology. This is a convenient ludic device, but is a very insensitive and crude portrayal of a spectrum of conditions characterised primarily for their nuance.\n\nThe world of Elder Sign is broadly a place for White People Only. Vincent Lee is the only character I think has any kind of nuance at all to his portrayal. Given Lovecraft’s endemic racism, this probably isn’t a surprise. Gender portrayal is somewhat even, which is nice – although there is one character (Mandy Thompson) who seems to have been drawn in a pose specifically designed to show her barely contained breasts spilling out of their constraints.\n\nThere’s also a bit of manual art that suggests a mythos effect that forces women to pose with all the lifeless objectification of a blowup doll:\n\nThe manual does default to assumed masculinity, referring to ‘his turn’ and ‘rolls his dice’ and so on. Overall though, it’s not too bad – even the box has a man and a woman on it, and both of them look like proactive bad-asses.\n\nCost wise, it’s a steal. It has an RRP of £25 for a game that contains a great degree of configurable replayability. It also scales well from one to eight players. That gives it, at the high end, a cost per player of just over £3.12. That’s cracking good value. Sure, I don’t like it much myself but if you do you’ll get a great deal out of the box. There are lots of cards, lots of adventures, lots of investigators, and lots of monsters. Given how each textures the game, you’ll have plenty of reasons to try it out in different combinations.\n\nWe’re prepared to recommend Elder Sign in this category, although as you can tell from the discussion, with caveats.\n\nIntersectional Accessibility\n\nFor those with visual and cognitive impairments, the need to cross-reference a lookup chart with the tasks to be completed is likely to be very taxing, especially if you don’t have the full set of eight accessible replacement dice to use. Tasks require a combination of focusing, assistance, and splitting the cost over multiple dice and there’s going to be a lot you need to keep track of to do it correctly.\n\nThe tiny tokens used throughout are going to be a problem for those with visual or physical impairments, but as you can imagine the problem compounds significantly for those with both. It’s going to be almost impossible to meaningfully manipulate some of the game counters, and that’s going to make the solo game completely inaccessible.\n\nCommunication impairments paired with physical impairments are often an issue, and that doesn’t change here. If both impairments must be considered in combination, the game is likely not playable.\n\nPlaying time varies considerably depending on to whom you talk. The box suggests between one and two hours. I suspect the latter end of that spectrum is more typical, with an additional time consideration when accessibility compensations need to be taken into account. Conditions with symptoms that modulate in severity over the course of a day may not be very compatible with this kind of session length. Luckily the game elegantly supports dropping in and out, and even for one player to control multiple investigators. The solo game in fact is based on the idea of multi-tasking. That won’t dovetail well if cognitive impairments are an issue for people remaining at the table, but in general Elder Sign offers a low-stress alternative to seeing things through to the bitter end.\n\nConclusion\n\nElder Sign does quite well in some of the categories we traditionally see good results in – communication and socioeconomic accessibility for example. It’s also a game that doesn’t put a lot of stress on memory – everything you need is in front of you.\n\nElder Sign, Meeple Like Us, [CC-BY 4.0] Colour Blindness C Visual Accessibility C Fluid Intelligence D Memory B Physical Accessibility C Emotional Accessibility C- Socioeconomic Accessibility B- Communication B\n\nWe have a less positive story for everything else. At best, we offer tentative recommendations for colour blindness, visual impairment, physical accessibility and emotiveness. All of these though are based on the assumption you’re not considering the game for solo play. We are expecting you’ll have someone available to deal with whatever issues that come along.\n\nWe advise you stay away if fluid intelligence, or visual impairments must be considered. It might seem strange given how simple the game is that we have rated it so low in the fluid intelligence category. While you don’t make very many complex decisions, you need to navigate a broad spectrum of conditional effects with every action. Every conditional consideration adds a cognitive burden, and there gets to a point where simple accumulation tips over into inaccessibility.\n\nWe gave Elder Sign 2.5 stars in our review. It’s fine – we don’t dislike it, but we won’t go out of our way to play it either. It does offer an easy to set up alternative to some of the heavier, meatier Cthulhu games, so it does perhaps fill a niche. As such, hopefully this teardown will give you the information you need to make an informed decision on whether it’s something you could realistically expect to play.\n\nA word about teardowns Meeple Like Us is engaged in mapping out the accessibility landscape of tabletop games. Teardowns like this are data points. Games are not necessarily bad if they are scored poorly in any given section. They are not necessarily good if they score highly. The rating of a game in terms of its accessibility is not an indication as to its quality as a recreational product. These teardowns though however allow those with physical, cognitive and visual accessibility impairments to make an informed decision as to their ability to play. Not all sections of this document will be relevant to every person. We consider matters of diversity, representation and inclusion to be important accessibility issues.

  "latent_3832": "Investigation Finds IRS Seized Millions Of Dollars From Innocent Individuals And Business Owners\n\nfrom the IRS-Criminal-Investigations:-A-Cash-Only-Business dept\n\nThe IRS's Inspector General has confirmed what many of its victims have known all along: the Criminal Investigations' asset forfeiture program isn't really for \"disrupting criminal enterprises.\" It's for taking money from innocent people.\n\nThe Treasury Inspector General for the Tax Administration (TIGTA) took a look at forfeitures tied to the IRS's so-called \"structuring\" cases. If you deposit more than $10,000 into a bank account, the IRS is notified and you, the depositor, have extra paperwork to fill out. This fulfills IRS reporting requirements and is generally a headache for the depositor and the bank.\n\nIf you deposit less than $10,000 in cash, it's perfectly legal. Do it often enough and the IRS starts to believe your cash deposits are the product of criminal activity. Even if you never have enough on hand to clear the $10,000 mark with a single deposit, a string of smaller deposits makes the IRS suspicious IRS's eyeballs turn into dollar signs.\n\nThe IRS is allowed to investigate suspected structuring. The problem is, the IRS has very little interest in investigations. It likes taking money from people's bank accounts, but has no stomach for the rest of the legwork. The IRS IG pulled a random selection of structuring cases and discovered a large majority of them had no business being called \"cases.\" In 9 out of 10 \"cases,\" there was no illegal activity discovered. [TIGTA Report PDF]\n\nIn 26 (9 percent) of the 278 structuring cases, we were able to establish that the funds came from a Title 18 illegal source or involved any other illegal activity. In the other 252 (91 percent) of the 278 cases, we did not find evidence that the structured funds came from an illegal source or involved any other illegal activity. Businesses that deal with currency transactions (retail, wholesale, service, automobile, restaurant, gas station, etc.) were primarily (210 of the 252 legal source cases) affected by the structuring seizures.\n\nThe IRS was able to get away with this for so long because it moved fast. It processed seizures quickly and pressured asset owners into taking settlements, rather than risk turning easy money into trickier criminal prosecutions where actual evidence might be needed.\n\nAll told, the IRS took more than $17 million away from US citizens without ever establishing the funds were the result of criminal activity or the asset owners were engaged in structuring. And that's just in the ~300 cases sampled for the TIGTA report.\n\nThe report also notes the streamlined stripping of money comes bundled with the streamlined stripping of rights. It's even worse with the IRS than it is with regular law enforcement, where assets are presumed \"guilty\" and it's up to owners to prove the innocence of property no longer in their possession. While it's understandable the IRS would find advance warning an impediment to its forfeiture efforts, the lack of investigation beforehand means the agency's seizure warrants were likely seriously deficient.\n\nInterviews were conducted only after the seizure warrant was signed by a judge and the property was seized; therefore, judges did not possess information from interviews with the property owner when making their probable cause determination. This could have provided the judge with a possible explanation for the banking transactions to consider before signing the seizure warrant. We are not suggesting that CI should always conduct interviews of subjects prior to obtaining a seizure warrant. In fact, CI indicated that seizures are often conducted before the interview to protect the interest of the Government by ensuring that the assets are not moved. However, when 91 percent of the property owners are not believed to be conducting any illegal activities (other than structuring), conducting the interviews after the seizure leaves judges without relevant information about what subjects knew about CTRs and what their intent was behind their currency transaction patterns...\n\nIn IRS seizures, the money is taken first. Any investigation follows after accounts are frozen or drained. Once owners are finally made aware of the situation, the CI division does what it can to ensure the IRS maintains control of the seized assets. The Inspector General found IRS agents aren't apprising citizens of their rights and remedies.\n\nFor 106 of 229 cases, the agents did not state the purpose of the interview or we did not find evidence they did. IRM procedures in Title 26 cases require special agents to advise the property owner regarding the purpose of the contact. For 62 cases, the special agents did not identify the purpose of the contact, and for 44 cases, the interview does not document whether the special agent explained the purpose of the interview to the property owner… For 181 of 229 cases, we identified a problem with the information provided to the property owner about the seizure. In 110 cases, the property owners were not informed until the end of the interview that a seizure took place. In 60 cases, the property owners were not informed that a seizure took place, and in 11 cases we could not determine if the property owner was informed that their funds had been seized. [...] In only five of 229 interviews were property owners provided the noncustodial advice of rights prior to the interview.\n\nThis extreme indifference towards citizens and their rights and property inevitably leads to this sort of thing:\n\nIn the one case we can discuss publicly, the property owner alleged that special agents and local police arrived at the property owner’s place of business and used police search dogs in the search. The entrance and exit to the store were allegedly blocked, and it was alleged that the taxpayer was asked to answer questions. The property owner, who spoke limited English, was told that his account was seized, and he was presented with a Consent to Forfeiture to sign. He alleged that officers spoke in loud tones at him instructing him that he should sign.\n\nSomeone put money in the bank the wrong way... and they're met with police dogs, yelling, and borderline coercion. But I guess that's what's needed to get \"criminals\" to cooperate. Oh wait.\n\nAfter the Institute for Justice was retained to represent the property owner, all of his funds were returned.\n\nAll of this leads to the following: the IRS's investigatory arm isn't in the \"criminal disruption\" business, but rather the simpler, more profitable forfeiture business.\n\nOutcomes across the CI Asset Seizure and Forfeiture Program did not appear to be consistently determined by the facts of the cases but rather by property owners’ risk tolerance to the high costs of litigation...\n\nIf there's any good news to be had, it's that the IRS is (mostly) no longer pursuing alleged structuring cases if the deposited money appears to have come from a legitimate source. That was put into place after a couple of very uncomfortable Congressional hearings back in 2014. TIGTA says, for the most part, the IRS is following the new guideline. However, it still found five cases where the new rule appears to have been ignored and notes the IRS has still granted itself a sizable loophole to exploit.\n\nUnder the change in policy, CI will no longer pursue legal source structuring cases unless exceptional circumstances justify the seizure and the seizure is approved by the appropriate CI executive. CI has not yet defined what circumstances rise to the level of “exceptional.”\n\nThe other good news is that enough pressure -- applied by citizens and their representatives -- can get the government to severely scale back a program that brought in lots of easy money.\n\nFiled Under: inspector general, irs, seizing, structuring",
  "latent_3842": "When you talk dentistry with Richard \"Jaws\" Kiel, you realise just how much he suffered for the sake of James Bond. Those teeth he wore in The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker took a small eternity to make and were excruciating to wear. \"They were nauseating,\" he says. \"They were up in the roof of your mouth and gave you a gagging effect - you felt like you were going to be sick. It did add to the stoic part of my character - to keep from throwing up.\"\n\nKiel was only able to wear the teeth for a minute or two at most. \"They were kind enough to have a lady with a tupperware container with some cotton at the bottom. As soon as the director called cut, out they came. She would take them and rinse them with mouthwash and leave them to dry off for the next scene.\"\n\nProducer Cubby Broccoli told him his idea for Jaws: \"The character we have in mind is going to have teeth like tools, maybe like a shark. They'll be made out of steel and he'll kill people with them.\" Broccoli had originally recruited John Chambers (famous for making Mr Spock's ears for Star Trek and an Oscar winner for Planet of the Apes) to design the teeth. Chambers's design didn't pass muster, and so Broccoli sent Kiel out to see a dentist near Pinewood Studios for a fitting. \"The guy ended up successfully making one set. He told me he couldn't make any more - it was just too difficult.\" During shooting, the teeth went into a safe each night. No, Kiel isn't quite sure of their whereabouts today, although he thinks they are in a Bond museum somewhere.\n\nKiel started his film career in the early 1960s, after working as a door-to-door salesman and a nightclub bouncer. Early film roles included bit parts in the Jerry Lewis comedy The Nutty Professor and alongside Elvis Presley in Roustabout. He spent 17 years as a bit-part actor before he met Broccoli.\n\nKiel, who was appearing at the time alongside Gene Wilder in Silver Streak, was initially hesitant about toothing up. He wanted to break away from rent-a-giant parts and play - as he puts it - \"regular henchman or villain roles\". However, he eventually managed to talk Broccoli into making Jaws a sympathetic, three-dimensional character rather than just a titan with gleaming metallic molars. \"If I was to play this role, I told him I'd want to give this character who kills people with his teeth a human side to make him more interesting, maybe have him be persevering and frustrated, so he wouldn't become boring. A guy killing people with his teeth could easily become over the top.\"\n\nBut there's more to Kiel's career than wearing the teeth in two Bond movies. For example, he has recently co-written a historical novel called Kentucky Lion: The True Story of Cassius Clay (about the abolitionist, rather than the boxer), and he is also shortly to be seen playing \"an intellectual badass\" in new film The Portal. Nonetheless, Kiel accepts that playing Jaws is what he is likely to be best remembered for. And, yes, he is very gratified at being voted \"Favourite James Bond Film Character\" in a poll run by HMV. He received 30% of the votes counted - and considering he was up against Oddjob, Q, M and Miss Moneypenny, he sees that as a ringing endorsement. \"I was a big fan of the Bond movies. I grew on Dr No, Goldfinger, Thunderball - all the gals and the gadgets,\" he says. \"To find out that with the general public, I got a 30% vote with the second place being 16% - that was incredible for me!\"\n\n• Richard Kiel will be taking part in a Q&A at a screening of Moonraker on Sunday at BFI Southbank",

I also attached my credit form to this email if you could just sign that and email it to my prof. Thanks!\n\nTriangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire\n\nThe Triangle Shirtwaist Fire refers to the deadliest industrial accident in New York City’s history. 146 garment workers died in 1911 when a fire broke out and workers couldn’t escape the building. This reference provides an opportunity for you to comment on the human price of capitalism and the dangers of locking doors. Could be a good way to talk about how locking up our hearts leads to metaphorical smoke inhalation?\n\nSample line: Like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire/ our freewill sits on the pyre\n\nPathetic Fallacy\n\nCoined by British cultural critic John Ruskin, this is a literary term that refers to the practice of the often overly sentimental attribution of human emotion to inanimate objects. FJM, you could use this to be self critical of your own use of this device (which I love!). Like, “Ohhh look how self-aware I am.” That sort of thing.\n\nSample line: Watch the clouds gather on TV/ They look sad but that’s pathetic fallacy\n\nThe Carpenters… Space Encounter\n\nThis was a television special featuring the soft rock duo The Carpenters that aired on ABC in May 1978. The premise of the special was that aliens came to earth to ask The Carpenters to help their extraterrestrial race make music. No doubt you consider The Carpenters your musical predecessors and you love taking a look at humankind from a distant view — perhaps even an extraterrestrial view? Maybe?\n\nSample line: Mankind is strange, what a lark/ just floating on a marble in the dark/ The Carpenters… Space Encounter/ Music binds us, we can’t discount her\n\nSingularity\n\nHave you already sung about the singularity before? No? Really? Wow, OK, you’re overdue. You’ve definitely sung about VR devices so this seems right up your alley. Basically, it’s the idea that we’ll invent artificial intelligence that will eventually just start improving itself to the point of being incomprehensibly intelligent, surpassing human intelligence and radically changing the world. It’s sort of the haunting conclusion of technology’s progress and says a lot about the nature of humanity and blah, blah, blah, something about how we’re all too plugged in.\n\nSample line: Hardback books and carcinogens/ children’s choirs and Playstations/ soft shell tacos and KFC/ are you prepared for the singularity?\n\nThe Teapot Dome Scandal\n\nWhile this one sounds appealing, you should be wary… essentially, it’s just a bribe scandal that involved President Harding, but it gets really murky. I definitely missed this question about this on the AP US exam (me, a professional researcher!!). If you do mention this, maybe draw some parallels to current political scandals? This one involves a murder so maybe it’s saying our current political scandals aren’t as bad as we think they are?\n\nSample line: Politicians never change/ our government just stays the same/ Oh you want some proof? An example?/ Uh…just take the Teapot Dome Scandal\n\nMannerism\n\nThis is an art style that emerged in the late Renaissance in Italy. Whereas early Renaissance art focused on balance and ideal beauty, Mannerism puts these concepts on their head, exaggerating features and emphasizing the artificial over the natural. Again – maybe you could use this to draw some parallels about modern society? Like how we’re all artificial? I know how much you hate how artificial we all are.\n\nSample line: What is beauty? What is pain?/ What is art if not for gain?/ Mannerism, stretch you thin/ breathing artificial oxygen\n\nLos Feliz Murder House\n\nThis is a house in Los Angeles where, in December 1959, the father of the house reportedly murdered his wife in her sleep with a ball-peen hammer and then committed suicide using a cocktail of prescription medicine. The house was never occupied after the murders and rumor has is that the family’s Christmas tree and unwrapped gifts still remain untouched. Spooky huh? You sang about the Hollywood Cemetery so this seems like it would be a logical interest of yours. There’s also something that seems interesting about being frozen in time. That seems songworthy.\n\nSample line: Our love is patient, our love is kind/ Our love is frozen, stuck in time/ Christmas Eve, quiet as a mouse/ Meet me at the Los Feliz Murder House\n\nMarried at First Sight\n\nThis is just a reality show.

I painted his eyes all white and did a light wash on the exposed part of his face. I completely repainted the Bat-Symbol on his chest and repainted the cowl, boots and gloves with a royal blue acrylic paint.

  "latent_4196": "Hilarious Skype Bombing Brings Halt To Witness Testimony In George Zimmerman Trial Share\n\nTweet\n\nAs a witness in the George Zimmerman murder trial testified this morning via Skype, pranksters watching the case bombarded the man’s account with calls, forcing the judge to interrupt the man’s testimony.\n\nAs seen in the above video, Scott Pleasants, a criminal justice professor at Seminole State College, was testifying about Zimmerman taking a criminal investigation course in mid-2011 when the Skype meltdown occurred.\n\nPleasants, who was in Colorado, was about two minutes into his testimony when a steady barrage of incoming call boxes began popping up on the Skype screen. Each call was accompanied by a loud “pinging” sound. It appears that Pleasants's username was visible on the screen, prompting the troll patrol to muster.\n\n“I gotta tell you, there’s now a really good chance that we’re being toyed with,” remarked Zimmerman lawyer Mark O’Mara (who can be seen alongside prosecutor Richard Mantei in the Skype window’s bottom right corner).\n\nAt one point, four separate incoming call boxes were stacked on the screen, covering Pleasants from view (as seen below). As a giggling Pleasants tried desperately to decline the calls, Judge Debra Nelson ordered lawyers to “hang up the phone.” She added, “I don’t want those up on the screen.”\n\nPleasants eventually resumed his testimony via a cell phone connection.",
  "latent_4337": "The prototype taser with attached electrocardiogram device. Courtesy of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center\n\nTasers are quickly becoming one of the most ubiquitous and indispensable law enforcement tools in the country. And yet the “nonlethal” device—which is used by over 16,000 police agencies across the United States—causes a significant number of deaths every year. The Washington Post reported that in 2015, approximately a person a week died in-custody after being Tasered by police. The majority of serious injuries from Tasers (the brand name for conducted electrical weapons) are due to falls resulting from the temporary muscle paralysis that often prevents suspects from bracing themselves. But evidence shows that tasers can also cause cardiac arrest. Now, a group of researchers think that they can make Tasers heart safe by creating a device that combines a Taser and EKG machine into one, to alert officers quickly if the suspect is in cardiac distress.\n\nIn 2009, Dr. William Bozeman, a professor of emergency medicine at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, and his colleagues conducted one of the most thorough studies of Taser safety to date. They concluded that 99.75 percent of the time, Tasered suspects incurred either minor or no injuries. \"That's a stunningly safe tool, especially given how effective it is,\" Bozeman tells Popular Science. \"Compared to the other tools officers have—their gun, pepper spray, baton, or hand-to-hand physical force—the taser appears to be the safest of those,\" he says. \"But nothing's 100 percent. And these unexpected in-custody deaths keep occurring.\" In a small number of cases—they estimate 1 in 2.5 million—the heart may be affected. And some of those incidents may prove fatal.\n\n\"If we could introduce something that could give us an indication that there was a problem medically, we could help them faster, and perhaps save their lives.\"\n\nThough nobody knows exactly how many people die from Tasers per year, Bozeman and his colleagues set out to make the relatively safe device safer. Recognizing that the basic setup of a Taser is similar to an electrocardiograph (EKG) machine (two probes connected by insulated wires to an electronic device), Bozeman along with his colleague, Dr. Jason Stopyra, realized they might be able to combine the two devices. \"We were hoping to increase the safety of suspects,\" Bozeman says. \"If we could introduce something that could give us an indication that there was a problem medically, we could help them faster, and perhaps save their lives.\"\n\nWith funding from the National Institute of Justice, they got to work building a prototype biomonitoring Taser. What they came up with was quite simple: They took standard issue Taser and wired it to an inexpensive, off-the-shelf EKG device. Next they had to test it, but finding volunteers willing to be Tasered isn't so easy. So they approached the Mount Airy Police Department in North Carolina, and the agency agreed to allow the researchers to test the device on the department's officer trainees (getting Tasered is a typical part of training for many officers). \"The device worked beautifully,\" Bozeman says. \"It was able to deliver its intended charge to incapacitate the subject and we were able to read the subject's EKG.\"",
  "latent_4417": "Sophomore forward Ivan Rabb, Cal men’s basketball’s biggest star, announced Wednesday that he will forgo his remaining NCAA eligibility and instead opt to enter this year’s NBA Draft. After surprising many his freshman year by not entering the draft with his then-teammates Jaylen Brown and Tyrone Wallace, Rabb will see if his decision to increase his stock at Cal proves fruitful.\n\n“First, I want to thank everybody for their support. Since the day I committed to Cal, the love from Bay Area fans was overwhelming,” Rabb said in a statement. “I could genuinely tell that people really appreciated seeing me come to Cal and succeed and do well. Haas Pavilion will always hold a special place in my heart, and I won’t forget how incredible it felt to be ‘Oakland’s Own’ as I ran onto the court in front of my friends, family and team.”\n\nIn some ways, Rabb’s decision to return to Cal for a second year proved successful. He established himself as one of the top rebounders in the Pac-12 with an 18.3 percent rebound rate, and he led the Pac-12 with 10.5 boards per game. His defense also proved immaculate, posting a 91.6 defensive rating.\n\nHis offense did not show as much improvement. His field goal percentage dropped from 61.5 percent — which led the team last season — to 48.4 percent, while his point total fell from 17.5 to 17.2. While the the 6-foot-11 Oakland native was projected to go in the lottery of 2016’s NBA Draft, his somewhat disappointing offensive growth this season caused many to now project him as a late first round pick.\n\nRabb’s now-official departure now adds to the uncertainty of the Bears’ 2017-2018 season. With the departure of head coach Cuonzo Martin and offensive threats Jabari Bird and Grant Mullins, Cal’s future on the hardwood is anyone’s guess.\n\nChris Tril is the sports editor.

  "latent_4453": "Natasha Caldwell grew up in rural Indiana a classic tomboy – hunting, fishing, shooting a bow and arrow.\n\nSearching for her identity, she joined a Pentecostal church, traded in her pants for skirts, let her hair grow long, and spent free time praying with a youth group.\n\nLeo Caldwell, now a transgender man, says his younger self “was trying to pray the gay away.”\n\n“I got called a faggot,” said Caldwell, 33, an e-learning developer, online blogger, newspaper columnist, and a former digital newspaper editor.\n\n“But I realized I could not change,” he said, sitting in the kitchen of his home in the South Jersey suburb of Merchantville, which he shares with his wife, Amy, and his stepson.\n\n“All identities intersect to make us. I try and stay away from labels when I write now. And when I use them, they are in quotes – as though they were air quotes.\" – Leo Caldwell\n\n“I always knew I liked girls,” said Caldwell, who “identifies socially as masculine, but legally and spiritually as feminine.”\n\nBut Natasha’s transition to Leo came slowly.\n\nFirst, wearing pants, but underneath skirts. Then a close haircut. A loss of connection to the Pentecostal church's version of God.\n\nAn art student, then a digital studies student back at Ball State University in Indiana, Natasha Caldwell began to come out by negotiating her changing identity, which she variously thought of as lesbian, then gay, and finally queer.\n\nOverwhelmed, Natasha dropped out of college for a few years, but kept trying to place herself somewhere on the gender spectrum.\n\n'I DIDN'T WANT TO HATE MYSELF'\n\nHelp for sorting it out was found in a book by Kate Bornstein titled, \"My Gender Workbook: How to Become a Real Man, a Real Woman, the Real You, or Something Else Entirely,\" Caldwell recalled.\n\nAfter graduating, Natasha went to work for a local paper, assuming the outward trappings of “a butch lesbian.”\n\nMuncie, Indiana is a small town and Natasha’s time there was difficult. “It is hard not to have a gender” because others don't know where to place you without clear cues and labels, he recalled.\n\nAs elsewhere, people tended to form like groups and stick to them. But the groups were smaller and less numerous in his home state.\n\n“No one reached out to find out if I was in his or her tribe,” Caldwell said.\n\nNatasha followed the paper’s publisher east to Cherry Hill, becoming Leo professionally, which is how he'd seen himself personally beginning three years before.\n\nWith a bump in salary as the digital editor at the Courier-Post, he decided it was time to break out a credit card and find a surgeon so she could stop binding her breasts. She began researching options for female-to-male \"top surgery,\" which included having her breasts removed and chest reshaped.\n\nIn 2012, a doctor in Cleveland was chosen after much research.\n\n“I didn’t want to hate myself,” he said of his decision to transition.\n\nDespite counseling before and after the operation, the three-week recovery felt “way more intense” than the person transitioning from Natasha to Leo ever thought it could.\n\n“I was emotionally devastated when I looked down. It was just weird,” said Caldwell, who has no plans for \"bottom surgery\" to reshape sex organs.\n\nLow-dose testosterone therapy had begun in 2009. It felt strange to be sent to a women’s health center for doses of the hormone “to become a man,” he said.\n\nThe transition took getting used to over time.\n\nA CLEAR CONNECTION\n\n“I’d liked going to gay bars, but now I don’t feel like I’m part of the group,” he said with a hint of wistfulness.\n\nLeo had not told his parents before the surgery, but a posting he did on social media was discovered by cousins who soon outed him to the rest of his family.\n\nThe visit home was hard.\n\nHis dad, who is generally “chill,” became very quiet.\n\nHis mother reacted emotionally, focusing on how Natasha's change to Leo meant she'd have no grandchildren, which he tried to explain was not necessarily the case.\n\nIn fact, Caldwell now has a child, a stepson.\n\n“I didn’t know how hard parenting was,” he said of life with a three-year-old.\n\nCaldwell met the woman he married in a professional situation. The relationship proceeded slowly, at least in part because of the nature of their professional relationship.\n\nAnd with reason.\n\nAmy Caldwell had always dated men. She’d been married to a heterosexual guy for 12 years, the man with whom she had her son.\n\nShe knew, despite outward appearances, that Leo Caldwell was born female.\n\nBut she also felt a clear connection. She’d felt some attractions to certain women in the past, though nothing came of them.\n\nThis time, she said, she knew.\n\nStill, the relationship remained platonic.\n\nHomesick for the wide-open spaces of the Midwest, Caldwell made plans to return to Indiana. A week before the move, Amy asked him out to dinner.\n\nThom Carroll/PhillyVoice Leo and Amy Caldwell sit at their kitchen table during a recent interview.\n\nHe moved and they immediately friended each other on Facebook and flirted. And flirted more.\n\nHe came back to visit Amy in New Jersey the very next weekend.\n\nAnd that’s how it was – text messages, social media, and weekend visits – until Caldwell drove 10 hours back to New Jersey to propose.\n\n“It had been exhausting to date lesbian or straight girls before Amy,\" he said, explaining previous women had placed him in boxes where he didn't fit.\n\n'IT'S A JOURNEY'\n\nFinding his own level has been a journey that continues as he shifts slightly toward his feminine side after years of embracing masculinity.\n\nHe has pursued a personal level not just in his own life, but also in a very public way: online in several formats, especially in a personal blog, columns for several Gannett newspapers and on the Huffington Post’s Queer Voices section.\n\n“I write to feel normal. I identify myself, discover myself, with writing. There is so much gray in this definition of trans,\" he said. “All identities intersect to make us. I try and stay away from labels when I write now. And when I use them, they are in quotes – as though they were air quotes.\n\n“I was embracing my masculinity, but now I am moving away. It’s a journey and I’m always trying. Being trans is a struggle. It’s a lost community, at the boundaries of society.\n\n“Being a trans person is not all before and after. The next thing is seeing gender on a spectrum and with wider acceptance,\" he said. \"Gender is not a binary. That’s important to trans people.”",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJan. 15, 2016, 12:37 AM GMT / Updated Jan. 15, 2016, 12:37 AM GMT By The Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK — Goldman Sachs said Thursday it will pay roughly $5 billion to settle federal and state probes of its role in the sale of shoddy mortgages in the years leading to the housing bubble and subsequent financial crisis.\n\nComing nearly eight years after the crisis, the settlement is by far the largest the investment bank has reached related to its role in the meltdown. But the payment is dwarfed by those made by some of its Wall Street counterparts.\n\nGoldman will pay $2.39 billion in civil monetary penalties, $875 million in cash payments and provide $1.8 billion in consumer relief in the form of mortgage forgiveness and refinancing.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, the attorneys general of Illinois and New York, and other regulators who are part of the settlement have not officially signed off on the deal, which could take some time.\n\nThe government agencies are part of a joint state-federal task force created by President Barack Obama after the 2008 financial crisis that has extracted some of the largest settlements out of Wall Street.\n\nGoldman, like other Wall Street banks, has been under investigation for allegedly misleading investors on the safety of the securities they created by bundling and selling mortgages.\n\nMany of those poorly written mortgages went bad, triggering the financial crisis that spawned the Great Recession and the multi-billion government bailouts that have caused so much political anger in recent years.\n\n\"We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle to resolve these matters,\" Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in a prepared statement.\n\nAs a result of the settlement, Goldman said its fourth quarter earnings will be reduced by $1.5 billion. The firm earned $1.33 billion in its third quarter. Goldman is scheduled to report its results on Jan. 20.\n\nA spokesman from the Department of Justice declined to comment on Goldman's announcement.\n\nGoldman has been one of the last banks to settle with regulators for its role in the financial crisis. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and others all reached larger, more substantial settlements in 2014 and 2015.\n\nBank of America individually has paid out tens of billions of dollars in fines as a result of its role in the housing crisis. When JPMorgan reached a similar settlement with the same task force, it paid out $13 billion.\n\nGoldman shares fell 9 cents to $161.30 in aftermarket trading.",

  "latent_4549": "Joey Barton joined Rangers after leaving Burnley this summer\n\nJoey Barton has had his club suspension extended for another week by Rangers.\n\nThe 34-year-old midfielder was due to return to Ibrox on Monday from a month-long absence following a dressing-room disagreement.\n\nBut Rangers said: \"Joey Barton has been informed that his suspension by the club has been extended by one week.\n\n\"This is part of a formal disciplinary procedure and Joey has been instructed not to return to Ibrox or Auchenhowie until further notice.\"\n\nBarton, who joined Rangers on a two-year contract this summer after helping Burnley win the Championship in England, was initially told to stay away from the club's stadium and training ground last month.\n\nIt followed a training-ground altercation with fellow midfielder Andy Halliday after Rangers' 5-1 defeat by Celtic and a disagreement with manager Mark Warburton.\n\nA three-week club suspension followed and he was due to report back to the Scottish Premiership club this week.\n\nHowever, in the meantime, Barton has been charged by the Scottish FA with breaking rules relating to gambling on football matches.\n\nThe Englishman has until Wednesday to respond to the charge, with a hearing date set for 27 October.\n\nMeanwhile, Rangers said on their website that, following Sunday's statement: \"Neither party (the club and player) will make any further statement or comment.\"",
  "latent_4558": "Microsoft\n\nThe popular construction game Minecraft is due to become a testbed for artificial intelligence software designed by startup and scientists alike.\n\nMinecraft, a game based on construction and blocks, is played by millions of users on both consoles and the PC. Developed by Stockholm-based Mojang, the game was snapped up by Microsoft in September 2015 for $2.5 billion, followed up by the Redmond giant's acquisition of Teacher Gaming LLC's MinecraftEdu line of teaching tools in January this year.\n\nThe game has now gone far beyond its roots as a simple building game, and through mods and additional development can also be used as a teaching tool to instruct students on topics including conservation and resource management.\n\nHowever, the platform is now destined to contribute to the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nDubbed \"Project AIX,\" Microsoft said on Sunday a new platform, based on Minecraft, is being used by scientists to \"train\" an AI to learn how to do things in the Minecraft environment. The tester AI is currently being developed to be able to learn how to do things such as climb mountains in the virtual world -- although not without continual dives into lava and rivers.\n\n\"The agent starts out knowing nothing at all about its environment or even what it is supposed to accomplish,\" Microsoft says. \"It needs to understand its surroundings and figure out what's important -- going uphill -- and what isn't, such as whether it's light or dark. [...] It needs to understand -- via incremental rewards -- when it has achieved all or part of its goal.\"\n\nAIX spawned after the lead researcher, Katja Hoffman, became frustrated with the limits of other programs available which are only able to use simple games to test AI agents.\n\nMinecraft's virtual reality, in comparison, is considered sophisticated enough for deeper tests and is also far cheaper than building robots for testing in the physical realm.\n\nHoffman said:\n\n\"Minecraft is the perfect platform for this kind of research because it's this very open world. You can do survival mode, you can do 'build battles' with your friends, you can do courses, you can implement our own games.\n\nThis is really exciting for artificial intelligence because it allows us to create games that stretch beyond current abilities.\"\n\nThe main problem with today's AI, Hoffman says, is going beyond tasks and into learning through the involvement of multiple sensors. This \"general intelligence,\" which mimics how humans learn and make decisions, is complex and a far more daunting task to instil within computers than recognizing words, commands and storing information.\n\nThe platform consists of a mod for the Java Minecraft version as well as advanced code to assist AI in working with the Minecraft environment. The platform is compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, and researchers can tailor their artificial intelligence agents to run in whatever programming language they wish.\n\nAIX is currently available to a handful of researchers in a private beta, but will be released to the open-source community in summer.\n\nRead on: Top picks",

But to present an abridged version:\n\nA guy wore a Parise Team USA jersey to Parise’s first game back in New Jersey after leaving the Devils in 2012. He sat in Section 123, which is next to the Devils’ “Fan Section” called the “Diablos” in Section 122. They’re a rabid, chanting, taunting section of super fans. Going there as a supporter for the other team is akin to wearing a Red Sox jersey to the old Yankee Stadium bleachers.\n\nHe claims he was harassed from the moment he stepped off the train to the arena, that “everyone in section 122” chanted \"Who's a f--got? He's a f--got! Who's a f--got? Parise is a f--got!\"\n\nHe said there was an altercation with a father of three who turned to him to start a “Parise swallows” chant, only to be confronted by the fan who said, \"Why don't you explain to your children what it means to swallow? Why don't you explain to your children what you mean by ‘Parise is a f--got?’” To which he said the response was: \"Meet me in the parking lot and I will kick your [expletive] teeth in f--got.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHis response to this harassment? Standing up and clapping for the remaining six minutes of the third period, his Parise jersey facing the fans behind him. This drew the attention of an usher, who asked him to leave, as was captured on this YouTube video:\n\n[WARNING: NSFW IMAGES HERE]\n\nLater, after the Devils won in overtime, he claimed a Devils fan threatened his life if he returned to the section again, and that “a woman then grabbed my hat ripped my necklace off my chest and attempted to push my another Wild fan down the stairs. Security then decided to escort us out the building.”\n\nA few reactions to this story, speaking as guy who’s both been in the press box and still pays to attend Devils games:\n\n1. Anyone who drops “f--got” at a hockey game should be kicked out of the arena.\n\nFull stop. Period.\n\nI know I’m the first one to bitch about the language police when it comes to “blows” and “sucks” and “swallows”, but there’s no gray area on “f--got.” It’s a slur, you’re a dinosaur, enjoy listening to the game in your car on the way outta Newark. (And it’s contingent on NHL teams instructing arena staff to understand this is how it works.)\n\n2. Some of the responses on Reddit have mentioned asking an usher or security personnel for help. This, sorry to say, is a non-starter. A visiting fan at The Rock has zero chance of policing a section’s action by complaining to arena staff, mostly because they’ll have 12 people all claiming another story to their one or two. Best case scenario: Telling a security guard or Devils guest services staffers in the arena that you genuinely fear for your safety, and see what they do.\n\nOr, this being a Devils game, just find two empty seats in another section between periods.\n\n3. To that end – and let’s all just be a little skeptical here – standing up in your Zach Parise jersey, clapping, in a section that’s seated for six minutes in the third period? Wouldn’t it be easier to just put a neon sign over your seat that declares, “COME AT ME DEVILS BROS.”\n\n4. The “Diablos,” for what it’s worth, deny they were involved in the incident.\n\n5. Hugh Weber, the Devils’ President of Business Operations, is getting inundated on Twitter with this tale, so I’d expect the team to take some action here. He’s one of the leaders behind the war on “vulgar chants” at games that led to the team changing its goal song.\n\n6. Devils fans have, and probably always will, push the envelope on behavior. Part of this is due to the arena being shared by invading Flyers and Rangers fans for the last 30 years – there are entire generations of fans, myself included, for whom jawing with visitors in the stands was part of the game night experience. It's learned behavior.\n\nThe Devils, despite their recent reversal on language, have fostered this. They ask for a home ice advantage, for fans to make The Rock a difficult place to play. The create a supporters section. They add cheerleaders. The whole thing can be very bro-tastic, but there’s no question that the atmosphere in Newark is incredible where the atmosphere in East Rutherford was a 60-minute yawn in a cavernous arena.\n\nDevils games are lewd. They’re vulgar. But for a large portion of the audience, that’s part of the appeal, and their behavior plays into that crude tradition.\n\nBut no one deserves to be hit with homophobic, racist or sexist slurs at a game. And no one deserves to be assaulted afterward, either. It’s disgusting; no matter the accuracy of this tale, it reinforces stereotypes not only about Devils fans’ behavior but that of hockey fans, and that sucks.\n\nUPDATE: In the interest of equal time, a Reddit commentator refutes the story:\n\nHEY EVERYONE. I SAT RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM--WHAT HE REPORTED IS F.A.L.S.E. and he KNOWS it.\n\nI was the girl who sat in front of this drunk jerk, and he is completely lying right now. The homophobic slurs were things HE said, NOT us. This was in sec 123, NOT 122. The people who were upset were in 123 and 124.\n\nHe sat in sec 123 with his buddies in Row 4, seats 5,6,7. I sat directly in front of him, sec 123, row 3, seat 6. I had to ask the father with his little children next to me to make sure I could get out of there safely as I did NOT feel safe. At all.\n\nNow, note this picture that was taken by someone: https://scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/t1.0-9/10014938_10201679010320893_1017122726_n.jpg\n\nThis was AFTER the fan had been disrespectful and before security finally hauled him out.\n\nFor what REALLY happened:\n\n1) People yelled after he stood up and started flipping us the bird and using homophobic slurs at us/our players. I turned back and asked him to stop and to please respect us in our house. His answer, \"Are you F-expletive kidding me? This is a hockey game.\"\n\n2) The people who got upset with him mostly were in 124, and the people in my row (3 in sec 123) as he was calling everyone the profane gay slur that starts with an F.\n\n3) There were a LOT children in my row. He started bragging and yelling, \"I'm a homophobe!\" at the top of his lungs as well as making references to oral sex. He also told a fan who asked him to sit down to suck it.\n\n4) He's blaming the Diabolos because he was escorted out past their sign (in 122) so my guess is that it was the only thing he saw/remembered when taking his video as he was drunk off his ass.\n\n5) In terms of the video, he took a video after goading people with the armpit thing and telling everyone, \"F(Expletive) off\" and \"Go to H(Expletive)\" and \"Your team is S(Explitive), like your state.\" He did not mention that his middle finger was raised as he took this video footage either. The game was also in play and people were mad as he was standing up, while the puck was in play, and people couldn't see.\n\n6) The dude's basically pissed because security hauled him off after he refused to leave then and was saying more homophobic slurs. It was the most awful experience at the Rock.\n\n7) Did I mention that there were a lot of little kids in my row and he kept yelling stuff about \"Sucking c(Expletive)\"? Parents in my row turned around and asked him to please knock it off, and he told them to \"F(expletive) off.\"\n\n8) Again, I can verify that the reason why things happened was that he started saying homophobic comments after people Booed Zach.\n\n9) He proceeded to say a lot of awful stuff about ANYONE I would cheer on when watching and was blatantly harassing me. Yeah, I know YOU Remember--all the stuff you said about Zidlicky, Schneider, and Zubrus.\n\n10) Literally, everyone in section 123 and 124 were pointing at him to get him removed. I'm not sure why he wasn't when security confronted him before. This happened after he was extremely intoxicated and disrespectful.\n\nDon't believe a word this clown said. He's lying.\n\nSigned,\n\nThe girl in the Zubrus shirt who was TERRIFIED that OP was going to spill beer on me or physically hurt me",
  "latent_4643": "Continue Reading\n\nFrom his sunny corner office on the sixth floor of Miami Beach City Hall, the engineer has spent the past two and a half years working on one of the hardest jobs in the country: trying to keep this city of 90,000 above water.\n\nThe Mississippi native has tackled difficult jobs before. Before Mowry took the position in 2013, he'd spent 35 years working on water-resources projects from China to New Orleans. Now he's a key part of a stable of experts Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine has positioned in top city posts since 2013, all trying to save this town from salt water without tarnishing its well-groomed tourism image.\n\nTheir plan of attack is unprecedented: $400 million poured into state-of-the-art stormwater solutions, from valves and pumps to raised roads. The project is especially bold in a state where the governor refuses to acknowledge that climate change even exists, let alone fund infrastructure improvements to prepare for it. Just across the causeway, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez recently said a lot of sea-level-rise talk \"is of doomsday scenarios which, frankly, I do not believe.\"\n\nIn Miami Beach, Levine has never denied the science. And for his willingness to stare straight into the problem and invest huge sums of money into fixes , he's been lauded as a pioneer. Media across the country have characterized him as \"Bloomberg South,\" a progressive political outsider who kayaked into office saying, \"Enough is enough.\"\n\n\"Here's a community with worldwide notoriety for getting things done,\" Levine says of his work.\n\nBut not everyone is cheering the city's plans. Some wonder if aggressive action on sea-level rise can really coexist with a boom in luxury development. The mayor — who owns millions in South Beach property himself — has installed developers in key positions and, some say, steered city action toward protecting big-money interests. Local critics question the city's rapid-fire move toward untested solutions. Still others say the plan doesn't go nearly far enough to save the city long-term from being swallowed by water.\n\n\"We're spending exorbitant amounts of money, and it's the first time anyone's ever done anything like this,\" says Miami Beach City Commissioner Kristin Rosen Gonzalez. \"We've got to be sure we're doing it right, because we're not going to have the money to do this twice.\"\n\nThe behind-the-scenes story of Miami Beach's war against sea-level rise makes this much clear: No city has ever faced a threat quite like this. And whatever happens here will be a blueprint — for better or worse — for the whole world.\n\n\"This is the greatest threat humanity has ever faced,\" geospatial analyst Keren Prize Bolter recently told an audience in Miami Beach. \"In South Florida, the water is coming in not just at the sides. It comes up from underground. Not even seawalls will stop the flow of water. This is bigger than the government.\"\n\nGiven that danger, Mowry says slowing down or rethinking strategy isn't an option. Though he admits he's as clueless about the future as anyone else, he refuses to let Miami Beach sink.\n\n\"You can't take a city and say we're gonna wait until the last minute and then let that city decay its economy,\" he says. \"Would you want to lose a patient on life support just because you were too busy looking for a cure?\"\n\nLong before the white sands and the sunbathers, Miami Beach was an overgrown, bug-infested swath of mangroves and swampland.\n\nA little more than 100 years ago, a Midwestern auto pioneer and real-estate developer named Carl Fisher invented the idea of Miami Beach after setting his sights on the uninhabited stretch of land between Biscayne Bay and the ocean. For such a prolific entrepreneur (he created the automobile headlight, the Indian­apolis 500, and America's first transcontinental highway), the swampy ecosystem couldn't stop his grand vision of an island paradise. In 1912, he and his wife bought a Miami vacation home and began acquiring land. They widened the shoreline with millions of cubic yards of white sand dredged from the bottom of Biscayne Bay. The beach, on the east side, was built up into the highest part of the island.\n\nIn his 2006 book The Swamp, Michael Grunwald writes about \"Crazy Carl,\" saying that \"by 1920 he had remodeled a worthless spit of swampland into a destination resort, but he had also ravaged a formerly pristine habitat for crocodiles, pelicans, shrimp, crabs and fish.\"\n\nOther developers soon followed, adding a smattering of manmade islets up the west side of Miami Beach, from Star Island and the Venetians to Normandy Isle and Biscayne Point. But Fisher and his followers didn't give much thought to elevation as they carved out their slice of paradise. Most of Miami Beach was built at barely two feet above sea level, making it one of the lowest-lying places in the entire country.\n\nAlmost immediately, the winter playground began to flood. On September 18, 1926, the Category 4\"Great Miami Hurricane\" made landfall over Miami Beach, spewing tides from 10.6 feet on the ocean side to 6.4 feet on the bay side. Miami Beach was inundated.\n\n\"If the guy who built Miami Beach could go back and redo it, the whole area should have been four feet higher from the beginning,\" Mowry says. \"But that's 20/20 hindsight now.\"\n\nDuring early population booms between the 1930s and the 1960s, the city built a storm drainage system to fight the problem. It used gravity to drain the town from east to west, where the water drains into Biscayne Bay. It mostly worked. And until recently, occasional flooding was called a recurring nuisance.\n\nBut over the past two decades, as the floods worsened and climate-change science improved, the facts began to suggest otherwise.\n\nThough there is still wide disagreement on the rate of sea-level rise, it's become indisputable that it's happening. Scientists generally agree that it's caused by a warming planet that's melting the polar icecaps. Global sea level has risen by about eight inches since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. And over the past decade, the average rate of sea-level rise has increased by 6 millimeters per year — from 3 millimeters per year before 2006 to 9 millimeters per year since.\n\nThat's already having unique impacts on Miami Beach. A team of University of Miami scientists using data like tidal records, rain gauges, and insurance claims found that since 2006, rain-based floods have increased by 33 percent and tidal flooding by an astounding 400 percent.\n\nScientists point to Miami Beach's unique features, like its proximity to the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic and its geography atop porous limestone, as contributing factors. The Gulf Stream creates a \"hill\" of water in the Atlantic Ocean that's roughly parallel to the shores of the East Coast. But the Gulf Stream has been slowing down, causing the hill to flatten out, which leads to higher sea levels along the Eastern Seaboard.\n\n\"We know there are certain processes that are going to make sea-level rise a lot worse here than in other parts of the world,\" Bolter says. \"Gulf streams are slowing down like a traffic jam up the coast.\"\n\nSo just how much are the seas going to rise? The best-case scenario is that ice sheets melt at a relatively stable rate through the end of the century. The doomsday possibility? The melt will keep accelerating ever faster as the Earth warms.\n\nCity workers install stormwater pumps as part of a $400 million project to fight flooding. Photo by Karli Evans\n\nThat latter possibility is more than just a slight risk. Last month, science journal Nature published a report finding that oceans could rise by more than six feet by the end of the century. If high levels of greenhouse gas emissions continue, scientists concluded, the melting of ice on Antarctica alone could cause seas to rise more than 49 feet by 2500.\n\n\"Big surprises may come in the future,\" says Dr. Roni Avissar, dean of the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. \"We just have to stay open and continue to follow the science.\"\n\nIt's only recently that all this science has become part of the daily conversation in Miami. Greenpeace was perhaps the first group to raise local concern, in July 2001, when activists gathered at Tenth Street and Ocean Drive to warn that rising temperatures could drown the city. In 2006, that message went global thanks to Al Gore's Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth. In 2008, the late Florida International University geoscientist Peter Harlem earned international recognition by using a depth-mapping program called Lidar to show just how much of Miami could sink under water.\n\nAround 2009, Miami Beach began to experience a troubling new phenomenon: Pools of water appeared out of the blue on the west side of the island. The floods didn't come from a storm but rather from below, as if out of nowhere. And that water, scientists discovered, was salty.\n\n\"Big surprises may come in the future,\" says Dr. Roni Avissar, dean of the UM Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. \"We just have to stay open and continue to follow the science.\" Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore shares reddit email\n\nResearch showed that the porous limestone below Miami was completely saturated, causing \"sunny-day flooding.\" The gravity that had funneled water off the beach for decades no longer mattered; encroaching seawater simply soaked into the city's foundation, rubbed up against freshwater supplies, bubbled up through pipes and drains, and overwhelmed the streets. In 2012, the city, then under Mayor Matti Bower, crafted a blueprint for overhauling the stormwater system.\n\nThen came Levine, a political newbie, media mogul, and real-estate developer. Levine got his start as an entrepreneur in 1990 when he was working as a port lecturer on cruise ships, telling people where to shop onshore. He turned that into an $85 million business that produced onboard TV advertisements, magazines, and port marketing. Through a merger, he expanded his company, Onboard Media, to create the world's largest duty-free shopping and media firm, with revenues reaching $400 million. In 2000, he sold that company to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.\n\nIn his $2 million campaign to replace Bower in 2013, Levine blamed the constant flooding and broken streets on poor investments in the city's infrastructure in the face of rising seas. The longtime Clinton donor — and close friend of the ex-president — even snagged an endorsement from his pal Bill.\n\n\"Before Philip, the model for sea-level rise was kind of 'Don't freak everyone out,' \" says former Miami Beach Commissioner Jonah Wolfson. \"Assumptions were always very conservative, as if the problem wasn't really as bad as it was.\"\n\nLevine changed that entire ly. In a memorable campaign ad, Levine and his Boxer pup Earl paddled on a kayak through the streets of South Beach during yet another deluge. \"Vote Philip Levine, a businessman and part-time gondolier, for Mayor,\" the ad chided.\n\n\"Like others before him, this mayor talked about flooding and keeping the streets dry, but he was the first to really link it to climate change,\" says Betsy Wheaton, the city's environment and sustainability director, who's been working for Miami Beach since 2009. \"He expanded the conversation.\"\n\nThat message helped Levine win the mayor's office. Then came the hard part: how to actually fix it. \"There's no playbook for this,\" Levine says. \"There's no one saying, 'Here, mayor, follow these 20 easy steps and you'll be OK.' I wasn't swept into office; I floated in.\"\n\nWhile a student at the University of Miami School of Architecture, Isaac Stein designed a vision for Miami Beach that embraces the water. Image courtesy of Isaac Stein\n\n\"See those stairs there?\" Mowry asks, pointing to the entrance of Publix in the Sunset Harbour neighborhood. \"There used to be seven stairs leading up to the front door.\"\n\nNow, there are just two. That's because throughout Sunset Harbour — a booming area of hip restaurants and bars — the streets have been raised by a full two and a half feet. While Publix still sits above street level, the entrances to neighboring businesses like Purdy Lounge and Pubbelly are now subterranean.\n\n\"Elevation is a key aspect of our plan,\" Mowry says. \"We've inherited problems from the past because people were instructed to build low. You're going to start seeing a lot of cultural and architectural changes.\"\n\nThe sidewalks are just part of a never-before-attempted civic plan, which took massive political will, creative financing, and a team of world-class scientists. And while returns are early, Levine insists it's working.\n\n\"Sunset Harbour was underwater all the time. People were freaking out and leaving,\" Levine says. \"But look at it now. Look at those streets. These raised streets have become the eighth wonder of the world.\"\n\nLevine's scheme took shape soon after he took office. Mowry, who had just been hired a month earlier, got right to work. Like Levine, Mowry touts his private-sector background as a boon to getting things done quickly. After earning a PhD in civil engineering from the University of Mississippi in 1982, Mowry worked on water and wastewater projects at a private company in Louisiana. He went on to work on water projects from California to Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Egypt, and China. Although the scope of the problem in Miami Beach was new, his solutions weren't.\n\n\"The things we're doing — with pumps and valves and elevation — aren't different,\" he says. \"It's just that we're actually doing them.\"\n\nAlongside Mowry, Levine rallied Wheaton as well as top Miami engineers like Dwight Kraai and Michael K. Phang. Levine recalls first gathering them all to talk about their plan.\n\n\"We had all our chief engineers, everyone around the table, and I said, 'Guys, the days of analysis and paralysis are over. We're not hiring a consultant to hire a consultant. We need a plan to get rid of this water,\" Levine says.\n\n\"I told residents, you have a choice to make,\" Levine says. \"Would you rather keep living in Miami Beach, or would you rather live in Atlantis?\" Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore shares reddit email\n\nWolfson says he vividly remembers how the tone changed after that meeting. The city had been debating a variety of solutions, including new injection wells, but those ideas were quickly scrapped. Instead, the city tackled the plan devised by Mowry and his colleagues.\n\n\"Bruce and Philip came in and ramped everything up,\" Wolfson says. \"There were new engineers, new assessments, new committees. We developed a more realistic viewpoint of sea-level rise. And we moved very quick.\"\n\nThe goal was clear: keeping at least some of the most flood-prone areas dry during the looming King Tide — the first big test — in early October 2014.\n\nBut first Levine needed to pay for his plan. Levine and commissioners swiftly raised stormwater rates by 84 percent, for a $7 increase per month per household. \"I told residents, you have a choice to make. Would you rather keep living in Miami Beach, or would you rather live in Atlantis?\" Levine says.\n\nThat tax bump secured $90 million worth of bonds to start work in the fall of 2014, when pumps began to go in along Alton Road and in Sunset Harbour under emergency single-bidder resolutions.\n\nWhen that King Tide came, those streets stayed mostly dry, even as other Beach neighborhoods sank under several inches of water. Since then, 12 new pump stations have been installed along the west side of South Beach, in Sunset Harbour, the Sunset and Venetian islands, and South Pointe. At the same time, streets were raised on West Avenue, 20th Street, Tenth Street, Sixth Street, and all of Sunset Harbour.\n\nMowry is now finalizing plans for two big pump stations near the Convention Center and others at 19th Street and in Flamingo Park, with simultaneous street raising. And the city is about to embark on a huge new endeavor: raising Indian Creek, from 26th to 41st streets, and improving the seawall. That area was heavily impacted during last year's King Tide, when the water reached a foot higher than predicted, spilling onto the road and causing traffic disasters.\n\n\"When Al Gore visited Miami Beach and said he saw fish swimming in the streets on a sunny day, that's the area he's talking about,\" Mowry says.\n\nThat project has been an even bigger political challenge than the rest of the Beach projects. Indian Creek is actually a state highway, not a city road, so Levine and his allies had to fight Tallahassee for approval and funding. The upgrades will be a $25 million partnership between the Florida Department of Transportation and the city, with the goal to stop flooding before this fall's King Tide. During construction, there will be no parking along the road.\n\nMiami Beach isn't necessarily stopping with pumps and raised streets. In September, the city hired its first \"Chief Resiliency Officer\" to oversee everything from building-code compliance to green spaces to recycling and environmental departments. Susanne Torriente, who had been Fort Lauderdale's assistant city manager before taking the job, says the city can become a national leader in fighting climate change.\n\n\"Bruce's work came first, and it was the biggest and most visible,\" Torriente says. \"The resiliency strategy that we're developing now is building upon that.\"\n\nImage courtesy of Isaac Stein\n\nIn a fifth-floor City Hall conference room, the city's Blue Ribbon Panel on Sea Level Rise considers a tricky question: As new buildings and homes — including the city's growing crop of McMansions — are built ever higher to avoid rising seas, what becomes of the older, low-scale constructions more characteristic of historic Miami Beach?\n\nAt the head of the panel sits megadeveloper Scott Robbins. Robbins, who is Levine's good friend and partner in several real-estate deals, shared his vision for those older homes: \"Well, they are knockdowns,\" Robbins calmly noted.\n\nImmediately, preservationist Daniel Ciraldo, of the Miami Design Preservation League, shot back, \"Not everyone feels that way.\"\n\nThe testy exchange underscores the delicate balance among preservationists, politicians, and developers in a city on the edge of sea-level ruin. Although Levine has been widely lauded for his quick action on flood prevention, he's also been criticized for his close ties to developers and his no-bid contracts. Some environmentalists, meanwhile, question whether the pumps and raised streets are more than a short-term solution. Others say the pumps have filled Biscayne Bay with polluted runoff.\n\n\"We're getting world-class attention because we're making efforts a lot sooner than others — but that's out of necessity,\" says scientist Isaiah Mosley, who lost a campaign for the commission last year. \"We have billions of dollars of property on Miami Beach. The cheapest way to solve the problem right now is to build, build, build.\"\n\nOf the criticisms lobbed at Levine, his ties to developers might be the most consistent. Many point to the history of the Blue Ribbon Panel as evidence. When Levine first convened the group in 2014, it included engineers Kraai and University of Miami engineering professor Phang. \"We were talking about really exciting solutions, and we had found new ground,\" Kraai says.\n\n\"We have billions of dollars of property on Miami Beach. The cheapest way to solve the problem right now is to build, build, build.\" Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore shares reddit email\n\nBut the engineer quickly grew disillusioned. \"The atmosphere kind of changed. It seemed like the panel existed just to monitor the public-works projects that were being implemented. No one wanted to talk about the long-term impacts of sea-level rise,\" he says. \"I think Levine decided he didn't want to be mayor of Venice, but he is.\"\n\nSome environmentalists questioned Robbins' leadership, especially after he told Audubon magazine in 2014 that developers had no cause to fear climate change. \"Right now, Miami is going through one of the hottest real-estate booms ever in its history,\" he said. \"People are investing enormous sums of money, and many of them really aren't worried about sea-level rise.\"\n\nThose critics had more ammunition when Levine disbanded the panel, then rebuilt it — but without the two scientists. In their place came Wynn Bradley, an architect who does not live in Miami Beach, and Michael DeFilippi, a luxury-real-estate agent who focuses on trash and litter issues. Robbins returned as chairman.\n\n\"Although the administration makes jokes about Governor Scott being a climate-change denier, it seems that this group has a different type of denial going on,\" Ciraldo says, \"one that denies the impact that climate change will have on the ability for new development.\"\n\nThe panel has little real power. But its composition amplifies other concerns about Levine's ties to developers. During last year's reelection campaign, Levine's opponent, David Wieder, noted a potentially shady side to Levine's acclaimed work in Sunset Harbour: The mayor owns millions of dollars' worth of property there, as does Robbins.\n\nWolfson, then a commissioner, says he understands why people would be suspicious. \"Sunset Harbour needed pumps; however, Sunset Harbour also got the streets raised, and no other area in the city got that,\" Wolfson says. \"There is an obvious interest there; they own a lot of property together. Is it a conflict? Maybe. It clearly raises property values there.\"\n\nLevine pushes back against those criticisms, though. He says the city raised streets and installed pumps in Sunset Harbour first for one reason: It's the lowest-lying part of the city. \"When you look at the topography, that's the topography,\" he says. \"What could we do?\"\n\nImage courtesy of Isaac Stein\n\nAs for Robbins' role in the city's plans, he says the developer has taken on the volunteer job at considerable time and expense — and no business advantage. \"He has the expertise and the passion for fixing this city,\" Levine says. \"It's like with me: This is the most expensive job I've ever had in my life. I've lost more money being mayor than I could ever make back.\"\n\nWithin City Hall, others have raised questions about the speed with which Levine attacked his sea-level-rise plans. To build pump stations and raise streets so quickly, the city waived normal bidding processes. \"We did it like an emergency measure,\" Levine says. \"We did it like it was World War II and we'd just been attacked at Pearl Harbor.\"\n\nRosen Gonzalez says there's a big risk in that approach. So far, four companies have managed all the city's sea-level-rise projects: Bergeron, Lanzo, Mancini Brothers, and Ricman. \"When we do bid things out, we are getting one bidder,\" Rosen Gonzalez says. \"I think people are discouraged. Why should they try if only Lanzo or Mancini Brothers are going to get contracts?\"\n\nLevine says that a single-bid process was the only way to cut through red tape and that he's held the companies responsible. \"Some of these things had to be done fast and furious,\" he says. \"We've made them sharpen their pencils. Going forward, we're trying to get more and more contractors in this so we can really bid it out more.\"\n\n\"We did it like an emergency measure,\" Levine says. \"We did it like it was World War II and we'd just been attacked at Pearl Harbor.\" Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore shares reddit email\n\nOn the environmental front, the Beach's massive effort has also raised some concerns. Soon after the pumps kicked into gear last year — spewing out more than 7,000 gallons of water per minute — some residents noted dirty plumes of rainwater and debris shooting into the bay. Videos showed up on YouTube exposing the mess. Last summer, Mosley decided to check it out for himself. With a snorkel, fins, and underwater camera in tow, he jumped into Biscayne Bay near the Tenth Street pump and found a disgusting mess.\n\n\"It was horrible,\" Mosley told New Times last August. \"It tasted like petroleum and gasoline. It was foul, and some of it even made it into my nose. I was so grossed out, I don't even want to think about it.\"\n\nMowry says the pump systems have been built to filter out most pollutants. But he admits it's an issue that still needs to be addressed. \"Storm drains are the sewers of a city,\" he says. \"They take all the runoff; everything left by all the people who come here ends up in storm drains.\"\n\nUrban designer and coastal resilience expert Walter Meyer, who runs the New York-based company Local Office Landscape, says there are other ways the city could clean that water. Though state and federal permits would be required to build into the bay, a new habitat with oysters, grasses, corals, and mangroves just off the pump evacuation point could filter some of the toxicity.\n\nBut there's an even bigger-picture environmental question as well: Will the pumps and raised streets even help if the worst sea-level-rise projections hold true? Levine admits he can't answer that question.\n\n\"We believe what we're doing, this $400 million plan, could be a 30- or 40-year solution, depending on projections,\" he says. After that? He trusts that the inventors of tomorrow will come up with another plan.\n\n\"I know that human innovation is so incredible,\" he says. \"If I told you 30 years ago that an iPhone could Facetime with a friend in Europe right now in real time, you'd think I was out of my mind. The opportunity for entrepreneurs is unlimited. They'll come up with solutions we can't even think of today. Deep-water injection pumps below the aquifer? Who the hell knows?\"\n\nThe key, he says, is fending off the water until then. \"We don't want people to get tired out or lose interest or lose confidence,\" he says. \"Once you lose confidence, try getting it back.\"\n\nImage courtesy of Isaac Stein\n\nAs Miami Beach prepares for the future of sea-level rise, it may just be time to look to the past, before the days of Crazy Carl, when Miami Beach was still an actual swamp. As efforts mount to find ever-more-creative ways to force water off the land, some visionaries say it's time to invite it back in.\n\nDeveloper Isaac Stein, a UM alumnus currently working in New York City, has proposed one of the most creative solutions yet to save South Beach: a mix of urban mangrove forest, buildings on stilts, and citywide canals that would turn Miami Beach into a pedestrian-friendly, water-borne city — a mix of the Everglades and Venice.\n\n\"Just look at Venice or many Dutch cities,\" he says. \"Bringing in water and inviting it to be part of the city can really add quality and value. It can make the city better.\"\n\nOn the Bay side, Stein envisions returning Miami Beach to its early glory, notably by restoring mangroves, which were once plentiful there. \"Mangroves create a subdued storm surge,\" he says. In some residential areas, six feet of fill could be cut to form an ecological canal and \"raise the grade\" of residences on these streets. At the heart of his vision: fewer cars and more public transportation options.\n\nStein's plans might be extreme, but so is the threat facing Miami Beach. Whether Levine's plans end up as a visionary solution to sea-level rise or a short-term Band-Aid, nearly everyone agrees that outsized ideas like Stein's are going to be key to Miami Beach's long-term future.\n\nThe city itself is trying to start that move, through Torriente's job as chief resiliency officer. Torriente says she plans to replenish oceanside dunes, heighten existing seawalls, and create new urban green spaces that will absorb water and carbon dioxide. Flood regulations could change for new buildings, and so could building heights.\n\n\"Thinking about 2100 is overwhelming,\" Torriente says. \"But if you think about the things we can do now, it's a manageable challenge and an opportunity. The next person in my job is going to have to keep building upon this over time.\"\n\nPlenty of long-term thinkers say there's only one real solution to Miami Beach's mess: a mass migration to higher land. But Torriente says there's newfound optimism and energy in the city — an opportunity for Miami Beach to become a world leader.\n\n\"This is an opportunity to be creative, to innovate,\" Torriente says. \"I don't think anything's off the table. Even a far-out idea can give you a spark of something that could be implemented easily.\"\n\nAlthough Torriente isn't backing any plans as extreme as Stein's, she too envisions mangroves, new dunes, solar panels, and a more efficient building stock as part of the solution.\n\nFor now, Mowry's not slowing down on the current project. Ten new pump stations are under construction, and three additional projects will break ground in the next six months. In total, the city will get 60 to 80 pump stations over the next few years. Meanwhile, streets on Palm and Hibiscus are being raised, as are streets in Bayshore South and Flamingo Park. Eventually, 30 percent of all roads on the Beach will be elevated.\n\nThe work may not be perfect — or even a long-term solution at all — but Mowry says there are few other options.\n\n\"Mother Nature's gonna win, and sea-level rise is coming,\" he says. \"But failure is not an option. Retreat is unacceptable. When people say we should leave Miami Beach, I ask them if they would like me to buy them a ticket to leave town. We need positive thinkers who believe there are solutions and are ready to try them.\"\n\n— Managing Editor Tim Elfrink contributed to this report",
  "latent_4652": "Chief Economist: Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Only Thing Preventing 40% Stock Increases Over Next Two Years\n\nGuest post by Joe Hoft\n\nChief Economist Brian Wesbury Says the Only Thing Stopping Additional 40% Stock Gains Over the Next Two Years Under President Trump Would Be Excessive Fed Funds Rate Hikes or a Tightening Federal Monetary Policy.\n\nBrian Wesbury joined Stuart Varney Friday morning on Varney and Co. to discuss the Trump economy. Wesbury argued that the stock market will see great gains in the next two years. He also noted that the only thing that could sideline these increases would be related to actions by the Fed:\n\nBrian Wesbury: The number one cause of recessions in the Federal Reserve. When they raise rates too much, when they tighten monetary policy too much. Right now the fed has $2 trillion of excess reserves in the banking system and until they get them out they are not going to be running a tight monetary policy. Therefore I would say the odds of recession are extremely low.\n\nThe only other item that Wesbury believes could stop the Trump economy are tax hikes which under President Trump are very unlikely.\n\nVia Varney and Co.:\n\nWesbury has a point.\n\nSince 2000, the Federal Reserve increased the Fed Funds rate excessively under President Bush between 2004 and 2006. These excessive increases led up to the 2009 recession and may have at least partially influenced the economic disaster at that time.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve was political and wanted to prevent Republican Presidents from successful economic growth, then the Fed would increase the Fed Funds rates during Republican Presidents’ terms while decreasing the Fed Funds rates under Democratic Presidents’ terms.\n\nIn the past 10 years there have been only four Fed Funds rate increases. Three of those increases occurred since President Trump won the election on November 8th, 2016.\n\nNo Fed Funds Rate increases took place between June 2006 and December 2015. CNBC reported in December 2015 that President Obama oversaw “seven years of the most accommodative monetary policy in U.S. history” (from the Fed). The Fed Funds rate was at zero for most of Obama’s time in office. Finally, in December 2015 after the Fed announced its first increase in the Fed Funds rate during the Obama Presidency, it was reported that:\n\nGiven the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic conditions, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent,” the FOMC’s post-meeting statement said. “The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvements in labor Premarket conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.”\n\nThe only Fed Funds Rate increases after 2015 were after President Trump was elected President. The Fed increased the Fed Funds Rate on December 14, 2016, on March 15th, 2017 and again on June 14, 2017.\n\nThe Fed Funds Rate greatly impacts the economy:\n\nLower interest rates usually spur the economy by making corporate and consumer borrowing easier. Higher interest rates are intended to slow down the economy by making borrowing harder.\n\nSo the question is whether the Fed is trying to negatively impact Republican President Trump’s economic recovery after the abysmal economic Obama years (Obama was the only President where the GDP growth rate never broke 3% ) or is the economy just so much better now that President Trump has taken office?\n\nPresident Obama’s policies were so horrible that the historically low Fed Funds interest rates did nothing to spur the Obama economy. Now the only thing stopping President Trump’s economic prosperity for the United States is the same group that gave Obama the most “accommodative monetary policy in U.S. history”.",
  "latent_4679": "In early September I gave a keynote at Kiwi PyCon in New Zealand on effective learning for programmers. There were two pieces to the talk: one about mindset, and one about particular strategies we can use. The text below is an aspirational and lightly edited transcript of the mindset piece of that talk. There’s also a video available if you’d like to see the strategies piece.\n\nRecurse Center\n\nBefore I joined Dropbox last year, I spent two years working at a company in NYC called the Recurse Center. The Recurse Center is like a writers’ retreat for programmers. Participants spend 3 months working on whatever is most interesting to them. So someone who’d been writing Java for ten years might come to RC to learn a new language like Clojure, or someone who just graduated with a CS degree might come work on their web development skills, or someone who’d been learning programming in their spare time might come to turbo-charge their learning. There’s almost no structure to the program – no deadlines, no assignments, no teaching. It’s an experiment in unstructured learning for adults.\n\nMy role as a facilitator was to help people make the most of that disorienting amount of freedom that they had at RC. People who come out of traditional educational experiences or traditional jobs very often don’t know what to do with that. So I’d help them with goal-setting and help them make the most of the experience. One of the things we thought a lot about was how to have the most effective learning experience possible for programmers. Today I’ll talk about some of the research into how to be an effective learner, and how we can apply that research to our daily lives as programmers and engineers.\n\nWhat to get out of this post\n\nTake a minute and consider what you’d like to get out of this post. You might want to learn something new about how to be as efficient and effective in your job as possible. You might want to hear about how you can be a better teacher or mentor to junior engineers. Or you might want to hear about how you can make institutional change in your organization to set up a better environment for these kinds of things.\n\nAll of these are useful goals, and I’ll touch on material relevant to all of them. However, I want to challenge you to consider the strategies mostly for yourself. When I hear about these strategies, very often it seems obvious to me that other people should be following them, but not necessarily obvious that I myself should. I’ll come back to that tension a little bit later on.\n\nGrowth mindset: Carol Dweck\n\nLet’s talk about the first key to effective learning. The sociologist Carol Dweck has done a ton of interesting research about how people think about intelligence. She’s found that there are two different frameworks for thinking about intelligence. The first, which she calls the fixed mindset, holds that intelligence is a fixed trait, and people can’t change how much of it they have. The other mindset is a growth mindset. Under a growth mindset, people believe that intelligence is malleable and can increase with effort.\n\nDweck found that a person’s theory of intelligence – whether they hold a fixed or growth mindset – can significantly influence the way they select tasks to work on, the way they respond to challenges, their cognitive performance, and even their honesty. I’m going to run through a couple of the most interesting results from her work here.\n\nThese mindsets cause differences in effort\n\nThe first interesting result is that this framing impacts how people view effort. If you have a fixed mindset – you believe that people are either smart or they’re not, and they can’t really change that – then you also tend to believe that if you’re good at something, it should be easy for you, and if something is hard for you than you must not be good at it. That’s a fixed-mindset view. People who have a growth mindset believe that you need to exert effort and work hard at something to become better at it.\n\nSeveral studies found that people with a fixed mindset can be reluctant to really exert effort, because they believe it means they’re not good at the thing they’re working hard on. Dweck notes, “It would be hard to maintain confidence in your ability if every time a task requires effort, your intelligence is called into question.”\n\n“Praise that backfires”\n\nThe second interesting result is probably the most famous. Dweck and her collaborators showed that giving students subtly different kinds of praise significantly impacted their performance.\n\nIn this study, Dweck and her collaborators gave a students a series of problems. After the first set of problems, all of the students did pretty well. Then half of the students were told “Wow, you did really well on those problems – you must be very smart.” and the other “Wow, you did really well on those problems – you must have worked very hard.” Then they got a second set of problems, much harder, where everyone did badly. Then they got a third set of problems that were like the first set – back to the easier level.\n\nHere, they’re creating a fixed mindset in the first group of students (your performance shows that you’re smart) and a growth mindset in the second set of students (your effort drives your success).\n\nThey found a bunch of interesting things from this. The first aspect of the experiment is that in between the first and second problem sets they asked the students if they’d like to do an easier exercise or a harder one next. (In practice, everyone got the harder set next.) Dweck et al. wanted to see if there would be a difference between the students who got different kinds of praise. And sure enough, there was: 90% of the students praised for effort chose to do a harder set of problems next, compared to only a third of the group praised for intelligence. The kids praised for effort were much more interested in a challenge.\n\nThe second thing that they looked at was how student performed on the third set of problems. They found that students who’d been praised for their intelligence did significantly worse on the third problem set than they had on the first, but students who’d been praised for effort did slightly better. Students who got intelligence praise weren’t able to recover effectively from hitting a wall on the second set of problems, while students who got effort praise could bounce back.\n\nAfter this, they had the students write letters to pen pals about the study, saying “We did this study at school, and here’s the score that I got.” They found that almost half of the students praised for intelligence lied about their scores, and almost no one who was praised for working hard was dishonest.\n\nSo there are three implications here: a growth mindset made students more likely to choose a challenge instead of something easy, more likely to persist after a setback, and more honest about their performance, compared to the students with a fixed mindset.\n\nWhat’s fascinating about this is how subtle the difference in praise is. Being told you’re smart leads to all of these attempts to preserve the appearance of smartness, by only doing easy things you know you can perform well on and by hiding your poor performance. Being told that you work hard leads to attempts to preserve the appearance of working hard – and the best way to do that is to actually work hard.\n\nResponse to confusion\n\nAnother study looked at what happened when students faced a temporary period of confusion. Dweck and her collaborators designed a short course on psychology to give to elementary school students. The course was a booklet on psychology followed by a quiz. Some of the booklets had a confusing passage in them, and others didn’t. The confusing part wasn’t on the quiz, so students could master the material if they just completely ignored the confusing bit. The researchers wanted to see whether students would be able to recover from being totally bewildered in the middle of this booklet.\n\nThey found that students with a growth mindset mastered the material about 70% of the time, regardless of whether there was a confusing passage in it. Among students with a fixed mindset, if they read the booklet without the confusing passage, again about 70% of them mastered the material. But the fixed-mindset students who encountered the confusing passage saw their mastery drop to 30%. Students with a fixed mindset were pretty bad at recovering from being confused.\n\n“How can one best describe the nature of people who will most of all be that way which will make the imitating of others happen most often? Is it that these are the people we want to be like because they are fine or is it that these are the people we want to be liked by?”\n\nI wanted to put up a section of the confusing passage because this really resonated with me. Hands up if you’ve ever started using a new tool and run into documentation that sounded like this. [Roughly 100% of hands go up.] It happens all the time – you get domain experts writing docs aimed at beginners, or out-of-date docs, or some other issue. It’s a critical skill for programmers to push past this kind of confusion and be able to successfully retain the rest of the information in the document we’re reading.\n\nProgrammers need a growth mindset\n\nProgrammers need a growth mindset! Key skills for programmers – like responding to confusion, recovering from setbacks, and being willing to take on new challenges – are all much easier with a growth mindset, and much harder with a fixed mindset.\n\nDoes anyone believe in a fixed mindset?\n\nNow sometimes when people hear this idea of the fixed mindset, it almost sounds like a straw man. Like, does anyone in the tech industry actually believe this? I think that absolutely a fixed mindset is a widespread belief. Here are a couple of examples.\n\n10x engineers\n\nStart with the idea of the 10x engineer. This is the idea that some engineers are an order of magnitude more effective than others, for some definition of effective. And there’s lots of critiques of this framing, but we’ll set that aside for a moment. If you believe in the idea of the 10x engineer, do you think that engineer was born as a super effective engineer? Or did they get to be 10x one x at a time?\n\nI think very often in the popular framing of this, the 10x engineer is set up on a pedestal, as someone that other people cannot become. Very often this is approached from a fixed-mindset perspective.\n\nHero worship\n\nAnother case where we see evidence of a fixed mindset is with hero worship. So Julie Pagano did a great talk at PyCon 2014 about impostor syndrome, and one of her suggestions for a way to combat impostor syndrome was “kill your heroes.” Don’t put other programmers on a pedestal, don’t say “that person is so different from me.” Fixed/growth mindset is a really useful framing for this too. If you have programming heroes, do you consider them to be totally different from you? Could you become more like the kind of person you admire? If you don’t think so, that’s some evidence of a fixed mindset.\n\nSo I’d argue that yes, a fixed mindset is quite prevalent in the tech industry.\n\nCan you change a fixed mindset? Heck yes\n\nHopefully by now you’re convinced that a growth mindset is better for you than a fixed mindset. So the next question is: is this malleable? Can you take a fixed mindset and turn it into a growth mindset? And the answer is heck yes, you absolutely can change a fixed mindset into a growth one.\n\nIn fact, in many of Dweck’s studies they experimentally induce a fixed or growth mindset, often in really subtle ways. The praise study is one example: one sentence of praise changes the students’ behavior. In other studies they have students read a paragraph about a famous person’s success, and at the end it says “because they worked very hard,” or “because it was in their DNA.” This is absolutely a malleable thing.\n\nSo how do you change a fixed mindset? Sometimes the challenge is mostly in actually identifying the fixed mindset, and once you hear yourself say the words, “I could never learn physics,” it’s already obvious that that’s probably not true. But other times it’s harder to root out the fixed mindset. So here are a couple of flags you can use to identify fixed mindsets so you can root them out.\n\nHow do you identify a fixed mindset?\n\n“I am ..”\n\n“Some people are just …”\n\nIf you’re on the lookout for places where your mindset might be fixed, you should be listening for sentences that start like this. Things like “I’ve never been good at CSS” or “I’m not a people person” or “Some programmers are just faster than others.” Anything that starts with “I am …” is a candidate. The word “just” is often present.\n\nNow, obviously, you can say sentences with “I am” that aren’t indicators of a fixed mindset. Instead, the point here is to treat sentences like this as a little bit of a yellow flag for yourself, to notice and then to examine your mindset more closely.\n\nJust as an aside, the example “I’m not a people person” is supported by the research – Dweck and collaborators did a study on making friends and social situations, and this research holds there too. [See the Q&A for more about this.]\n\nHow do you change a fixed mindset?\n\nReframe praise & success\n\nOk, so once you’ve identified a fixed mindset, how can you go about changing it? Here are four strategies.\n\nThe first is to reframe praise and success. By reframe praise I mean that when you get the wrong kind of compliments, turn them into growth-mindset compliments. So if someone says “wow, great job on that project, you’re so smart,” translate it to “yeah, it was great, I worked really hard on that project.” You don’t necessarily have to do this out loud! But this reframing reinforces for yourself that you gain mastery by seeking out challenges and by exerting effort.\n\nAnd you can use the same techniques for successes and accomplishments. When something goes well, don’t think, “Of course that went well because I’m awesome.” Instead think, “I used an effective strategy on that project! I should do that more often.”\n\nReframe failure\n\nOf course the flip side of this dynamic is also really effective. A huge part of a fixed or growth mindset is how you respond to failure. What’s your self-talk when you face a setback or don’t get what you wanted? If you’re saying, “Maybe I’m not cut out for this job after all,” treat that as a red flag. Instead, ask what you learned from your unsuccessful attempt or what strategies you could have used instead. It sounds cheesy, but it really works.\n\nCelebrate challenges\n\nThe third way that you can change a fixed mindset is to celebrate challenges. How do you respond when you have to struggle? Try explicitly celebrating. This is something that I was really consistent about when I was facilitating at the Recurse Center. Someone would sit down next to me and say, “[sigh] I think I’ve got a weird Python bug,” and I’d say, “Awesome, I love weird Python bugs!” First of all, this is definitely true – if you have a weird Python bug, let’s discuss – but more importantly, it emphasized to the participant that finding something where they struggled an accomplishment, it was intentional, and it was a good thing for them to have done that day.\n\nAs I mentioned, at the Recurse Center there are no deadlines and no assignments, so this attitude is pretty much free. I’d say, “You get to spend a day chasing down this weird bug in Flask, how exciting!” Now, at Dropbox, where we have a product to ship, and deadlines, and users, I’m not always uniformly delighted about spending a day on a weird bug. So I’m sympathetic to the reality of the world where there are deadlines. However, if I have a bug to fix, I have to fix it, and being grumbly about the existence of the bug isn’t going to help me fix it faster. I think that even in a world where deadlines loom, you can still apply this attitude.\n\nAsk about processes\n\nThe last strategy for changing a fixed mindset is to ask about processes. Like many of you, I work with some great engineers. Sometimes, I’ll try to fix a tricky bug and won’t be able to, and then one of them will be able to fix it right away. In these situations I’ve tried to be really disciplined about asking how they did it. Particularly when I was new at Dropbox, the answers would be really illuminating. Sometimes the information had come from a source I didn’t know existed. Now that I’ve been there longer, it’s usually a technique or strategy difference, or a detail about why my strategy had not succeeded.\n\nThis is a much more useful strategy in the long term than saying “Oh, of course, that person got the bug because they are a wizard.”\n\nConfidence & imposter syndrome\n\nDweck’s research is really interesting in the context of the discussion around impostor syndrome. Impostor syndrome is the feeling that you’re secretly an unqualified fraud who will be uncovered any second now. Hands up if you’ve ever felt impostor syndrome in your career? [80% of hands in the room go up.] Yeah, that’s lots of you, and I definitely have as well. And it sucks! It’s so painful, and it’s really bad for your career, because you’re less likely to take chances or to look for new opportunities to grow if you’re worrying about getting fired from the job you already have.\n\nThe proposed solutions for impostor syndrome very often center around confidence. Like, “Oh, if you feel like you’re not qualified for the job you already have, you should be more confident, and then you’ll be fine.” This sometimes is as simple as, “Don’t feel that way,” which is not very helpful as advice goes. But even when it’s more nuanced than that, there’s a focus on confidence and past accomplishments.\n\nConfidence doesn’t help you respond to challenges\n\nHenderson & Dweck, 1990\n\nBut here’s the catch. Dweck’s research shows that confidence doesn’t actually predict your success at responding to new challenges or recovering from setbacks.\n\nHenderson and Dweck did a study of students moving from elementary school to junior high in the U.S. They asked the students to assess their confidence when they were still in the younger grade, and they also measured whether the students held fixed or growth mindsets. Then they tracked the students’ academic performance in junior high.\n\nThey found that confident students with a fixed mindset suffered academically. By contrast, students with a growth mindset tended to thrive academically, regardless of whether their confidence was high or low. Confidence wasn’t a useful predictor of success at all.\n\nNow, there’s lots of other research that shows confidence is correlated with success. Dweck argues that confidence is a good predictor of how well you can do things you’re already doing, but it’s not a good predictor of how you respond to new challenges and how you feel about failure.\n\nThe second, related point that Dweck has discovered is that a history of success also doesn’t impact how you respond to challenges and how you deal with failure.\n\nSo past successes don’t predict your response to new setbacks and failures, and your confidence level also doesn’t predict your response to failure. The thing that is a good predictor of resilience in the face of failure is having a growth mindset.\n\nBreak the framework\n\nThis is hugely exciting to me and I think it doesn’t come up nearly often enough in the discussions around impostor syndrome. This gives us a new and more useful framework for combating impostor syndrome. Basically, if you’re holding a fixed mindset, you’re going to be really stressed and afraid at any moment that you have to struggle. We’re programmers, so it’s mostly struggle, right? It’s struggle all the time. With a growth mindset, you can enjoy the struggling and enjoy working on something that’s really hard.\n\nAnd guess what? When your identity isn’t being threatened by a particularly tricky bug, it’s a lot easier to stay focused on the bug. You’re not worried about also getting fired and being a fraud, so you can free up those cognitive resources to focus on the task at hand.\n\nSo, again: if you believe, for example, that “some people just aren’t cut out for programming,” you can spend a ton of time & energy trying to find evidence and validation and reassurance that you are one of the people who can make it. Instead, upend this framework. Break the idea of fixed levels of talent and move to the idea that everyone can increase their skill by exerting effort.\n\nSelf-theories: Their role in motivation, personality, and development\n\nHaving a growth mindset makes you more resilient to failure, makes it easier to exert effort, makes you more likely to take on challenges, all things that are very useful to programmers.\n\nIf you’d like to dig more into the details of this research, and also see some of the findings that I didn’t have time to cover today, I highly recommend a book Dweck wrote called Self-theories. Self-theories is a collection of short essays that summarize many major points of her research. It’s got detail about the studies but is accessible to a lay reader. She’s also got a book called Mindset that’s written for a pop-science audience, but if you want a little more nuance and detail about the particular studies, Self-theories is the way to go.\n\nQ & A\n\nA selection from the Q&A:\n\nQ: Is there any research in growth and fixed mindsets at the team-level, and how teams approach problems?\n\nA: I’m not aware of any, but that’s a fascinating question. I’d love to see that research if it exists.\n\nQ: I read Mindset, and I’m a father to twin girls. I found that these strategies really changed their resilience and their approach to problem solving.\n\nA: Yeah, this research is kind of terrifying. Like, do you tell your children that they’re smart? You’re ruining them! I didn’t have a chance to talk about this, but there is some research in this book about gender discrepancies, and findings that high-achieving girls are more likely to have a fixed mindset and less likely to risk failure when they hit something hard. Many of the women in the room in particular can probably relate to this.\n\nQ: Is this binary, or a gray scale?\n\nA: I think it probably is a spectrum, yes. For this research it’s classified into a binary model. I’m not precisely sure where the line gets drawn. And some of these cases with experimental induction of a fixed or growth mindset, if someone has one mindset going in and has the other induced, they’ll probably end up in a moderate place.\n\nQ: Is it possible to have a fixed mindset in one area and a growth mindset in another?\n\nA: Absolutely. One that is common for programmers is to have a growth mindset about programming and a fixed mindset about social skills.\n\nQ (from a CS lecturer/TA): For our new students, is there a way we can create a growth mindset in the students? A lot of people come in from school with a fixed one, and it can be damaging in those early courses.\n\nA: If you’re a lecturer or have a chance to get up in front of the auditorium, you can say it explicitly: “Programming is a skill that you can get better at with effort,” and even though it doesn’t sound like it’d convince people, the research shows that it does make a difference.\n\nThe other thing that’s really interesting is a study on a values exercise. This shows that having women in particular write down their values before they enter into a context where they’d experience stereotype threat can significantly improve their performance. The basic idea here is if you’re identifying as a programmer, and your programmer identity is threatened, that’s very painful and difficult. But if you have these other things that you value about yourself, then that mitigates the threat. The results are really dramatic for people who are marginalized in tech (and it doesn’t hurt those who aren’t). For more, see this worksheet by Leigh Honeywell.\n\nQ: So this is nature versus nurture all over again, isn’t it?\n\nA: I wouldn’t characterize it that way, in part because I think both of those remove agency from the individual. Your mindset is something that you can control to a significant extent. That’s why I think it’s so important to think about this research from the context of ourselves, and not just our children or our students.\n\nQ: It’s easy to think of lots of ways to apply this in programming, but can you talk more about ways to apply this in social situations?\n\nA: Sure. In the study covered in a Self-theories, Dweck had children write letters applying to the pen pal club (which was a real pen pal club – they did eventually match people up). Then all the children got rejected from the pen pal club. [Audience laughter] Before writing the letter, they’d told half the children, “This is to see how good you are at making friends,” and the other half, “This is a chance to practice and improve your ways of making friends.” The children who heard the fixed-mindset framing sometimes wrote the same letter or sometimes wrote a shorter and less detailed letter. The kids who got the growth framing were much more likely to write longer things, to be more inviting, to say, “Oh, I love talking to you” even though it’s a first letter to a pen pal. [Audience makes sympathetic noises.] Yeah, throughout this book Dweck and her collaborators were pretty careful to not traumatize any students, not to leave them thinking that they’re stupid or bad at making friends.\n\nIf you’re interested in particular strategies for social situations, I highly recommend the blog Captain Awkward. Captain Awkward has some constructions of social challenges, like “I’ll go to a party and talk to three people, and award myself ten points for each person I talk to and learn a fact about.” There’s a lot of interesting stuff on the internet about strategies for coping with social anxiety that I think you can apply whether or not that’s something that you struggle with.\n\nThanks\n\nMy thanks to Maggie Zhou, Amy Hanlon, Alyssa Frazee, and Julia Evans for feedback on early versions of this talk.\n\nThanks to Sasha Laundy, who invited people to consider what they wanted to get out of her PyCon talk on giving and getting help, and inspired me to use the same construction.\n\nThanks to the Kiwi PyCon organizers, particularly Marek Kuziel, for hosting me.",
  "latent_4754": "The Season Of Down\n\nJon Hill (originally posted at Ramblings: A Fly Fishing Journey)\n\nFor the past 10 years I have used the same 30-degree mummy style sleeping bag and it has done well in all types of weather. This year, however, it was time for an upgrade. I started researching backpacking sleeping bags and stumbled upon the quilt style of bags. These intrigued me as they are lighter and take up less space, plus because of the fact that I do not sleep on my back and I never really use the head mummy portion of my sleeping bag - I decided to go with one of these quilts, made with down, from Enlightened Equipment.\n\nI fell in love with Enlightened Equipment before I ever received my quilt from them. First because everything they create is handmade. And second because they are based out of Minnesota. (I have a soft spot for anything Minnesota since I go on a week long hiking and fishing trip there every two to three years.) After receiving the Enigma 20-degree, 750 duck down quilt from them, I now have a third reason to love this company.\n\nThe only downside to my new sleeping quilt is that I did not discover Enlightened Equipment sooner. I was able to use the Enigma for all my overnight trips this year, and as my friends can attest I cannot stop raving about this product. Maybe it is because I have never used a down bag previously so I was unaware of the comfort and warmth that is attributed to down. Or maybe it’s because of how small it packs down or because it weighs half of what my previous bag weighs. For whatever reason, I’ll be using this bag for years to come!\n\nColorado weather is always unpredictable, especially when camping in the Rocky Mountains. At any time of the year the temperature can drop below freezing and dump hail or snow for as little as 10 minutes, or as long as a day or two or more. Being well equipped for whatever weather may arise is key to having a successful and enjoyable trip and the 20-degree Enigma is the perfect bag for all of your three season camping.",
  "latent_4801": "burning cigarette with smoke\n\nWASHINGTON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. government plans to spend as much as $273 million over the next five years on tobacco-related research in a bid to help reduce the number of deaths from smoking.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health said on Thursday they have awarded an initial $53 million to 14 institutions to conduct research that could help the FDA shape tobacco product regulations.\n\nIn 2009 the agency was given authority to regulate cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco, though not pipe tobacco, cigars or e-cigarettes.\n\nThe law allows the FDA to expand its authority to all tobacco products but it must first issue new regulations. Those are in development and no date has been announced for their publication.\n\nOn Thursday the American Academy of Pediatrics and 14 other public health organizations, including the American Lung Association and American Heart Association, sent a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to pressure the FDA to issue the new rules.\n\n\"More than two years ago, FDA announced its intent to take this action, yet no progress has been made,\" the letter said. \"This delay is having very real public health consequences.\"\n\nIn July the FDA said it may place restrictions on menthol cigarettes following a scientific review that showed the products are likely to be more addictive than regular cigarettes. The agency is seeking public comment on whether a limit could be set on the amount of menthol in cigarettes.\n\nThe public health organizations, in their letter, note that while cigarette use fell 33 percent between 2000 and 2011, e-cigarette use is rising, as is the use of cigars by young people. And while the FDA has the authority to stop the use of candy and fruit-flavors in cigarettes, it cannot stop their use in cigars or e-cigarettes.",

  "latent_4940": "“I can’t take this” “ I’m sick of running,” “Running is not for me,” “I can’t stand it,” “This is too much,” “Why I’m doing this?” “I hate this,,” “I think I’m gonna quit.”\n\nIf these thoughts have ever crossed your mind while running, then you are not alone.\n\nSpeaking to you as someone who has been running quite a lot over the last decade, I’ve had my fair share of those thoughts.\n\nRunning is hard, and at times, quitting might feel like an option—maybe the only option—especially if you are just starting out, suffering from a serious injury, or just completely and utterly bored out of your mind with your running.\n\nIn other words, falling in love with running is really a hard feat. But it’s worth the effort.\n\nIt wasn’t love at first sight\n\nI have been running for the last 10 years, but I wasn’t born with an I-Love-Running gene. And truth be told, running for me wasn’t love at first sight.\n\nIn fact, I used to “not like” it so much (even hated it at occasions) when I took it up for the first few months.\n\nAs a result, today my dear readers, I wanted to share with some of the practical strategies and action steps that helped me fall in love with running and stay so for the past few years.\n\nSo are you ready?\n\nThen here we go…\n\nImage Credit – Celso Florest via Flickr\n\n1. Get the Right Gear\n\nObviously, running requires a minimum investment. In fact, all you need is a pair of decent shoes, and there you go.\n\nHowever, getting your hands on a few essentials is key for long-term success—especially once you start becoming a bit more serious about your training program.\n\nThe right gear is crucial for helping you avoid all sorts of pain and injury. For instance, wearing improper footwear can lead to blisters, black toenail, and serious overuse injury. So why would you want to go through that when all you need to do is get the right shoes for the job?\n\nThe other piece of gear that’s essential for running success is running clothing.\n\nWearing the right clothing that makes you feel good and comfortable while running so you can achieve more consistency with your training and be looking forward to every run. Some of the essential clothing items you’ll need include breathable and waterproof shirts, pocketed leggings, clothing for different weathers, etc.\n\nSo please, do invest in a good pair of running shoes and other running apparel and start feeling (and looking) like a real runner.\n\nTo get the best (and proper) deal, I highly recommend going to a specialist running store, instead of a high streets sports shop.\n\nIn most of these special stores, you can find expert staff (who are runners themselves) that can give you personalized gait analysis and set you off with the right gear, depending on your own needs and budget.\n\n2. Start Slow\n\nAs we already know, love cannot be forced. So if you are really out of shape, then going for a 60-minute run from the get-go can be extremely overwhelming—and right down dangerous.\n\nAs a beginner, it’s vital that you stay within your fitness level; otherwise, if you do too much too soon, then you’ll definitely hurt yourself, which might lead to you growing disdain for the sport.\n\nTherefore, if you’ve decided to take up running, you need to start slow and work it up gradually. Think of your first few runs as flirtations, short, thrilling and they should leave you craving for more.\n\nThere is no to rush it here, and it’s perfectly normal if you can’t run for 5 minutes the first time you start out—no one is judging you for it.\n\nThe best method you can opt for when starting out is the walk-run method—which consists of alternating between periods of low-intensity jogging and bouts of walking breaks.\n\nFor more on that, check my beginner running guide here.\n\n3. Set a Goal\n\nBefore you start running or decide to take your running to the next level, you have to think about what you are looking to achieve: Do you want to lose weight? Are you looking to improve your 5K timing? Do you want to be a role-model for your kids? Etc.\n\nYou need to dig deep and know WHY. The Why may differ from one person to the next, but its impact is undeniable.\n\nThis is the golden principle that will serve as the foundation for everything else you will be doing.\n\nBy setting the right goals, you will be giving yourself something to work toward to, and will guide your training program and keep you heading out the door more consistently— even when that inner mind chatter suggests otherwise.\n\nJust know that running goals don’t have to be that complicated. In fact, they can be as simple as running three times per week, or losing 15 pounds of fat within a specific timeframe.\n\nNonetheless, if you want more, then your goal can be more specific, like running a sub 30-minute 5K or completing a marathon race distance in less than four hours.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say here, in a nutshell, is, regardless of your current fitness level and background, there is always a running goal for you.\n\nYou just have to find it, set it, and go after it.\n\nTherefore, after figuring out your running goals (and fitness goals in general), sit down and write them down, then break them into mini-goals that you can manage one at a time without overwhelming yourself.\n\nFor more on how to set running goals, check this post.\n\n4. Reward yourself for the Tiniest Progress\n\nTo go to the next step with your goals, be sure to review them and on a consistent basis and put in place a system of rewarding yourself each time you accomplish a mini-goal or reach a certain benchmark that’s taking you closer to realizing your ultimate goal.\n\nStudies show that self-rewarding is crucial for increasing motivation and renewing enthusiasm for any activity—running is no exception. In fact, regardless of the habit you are trying to build, rewarding yourself and getting your brain to link the pleasure of the reward with the activity itself is of paramount importance.\n\nNevertheless, there is something you need to understand before we proceed here and here it is: Your achievement DO NOT have to be big to celebrate them. In fact, celebrate everything—even the smallest of all successes.\n\nHence, be sure to monitor your success—even the smallest and tiniest progress. Use apps like Runtastic, Runkeeper or MapMyRun to keep tabs on every one of your workouts. And the moment you notice the slightest improvement, reward yourself immediately.\n\nSome of the best rewards include: taking a long nap, binge-watching your favorite show, buying a new running outfit, getting new shoes, having dinner out with a friend, spending the evening at the movies, etc.\n\nImage Credit – Simon Thallman via Flickr\n\n5. Race\n\nRunning to get in shape is one thing. Training for a race is an entirely different experience. In fact, the first time I trained for a race—it was just a short 5K distance—was a big turning point for me, and I believe that it was what revealed the runner inside of me that I never knew I was.\n\nSo it’s really worth having a goal that’s way bigger than losing a few pounds, or doing a couple of runs every week.\n\nHowever, don’t sit around, waiting for the perfect race. Instead, go and register for that race—any practical race— in advance. Signing up for a race and making the investment beforehand will definitely get you up and moving. And Once you have invested your money, you will be more likely to follow through and get ready for the big day.\n\nWhat’s more? Keep in mind that if traditional race distances, such as a 5K, 10K, half-marathon or a marathon, don’t excite you enough, then you might need to sign up for some other form of competitive endurance events.\n\nLuckily, there are plenty of other races to choose from: mud runs, obstacle races, trail races, or even go the extra mile—literally—with ultra distances, ranging from 50K to a 100-miler or more.\n\nSo there is something for everyone—you just have to force yourself to sign up for it, then do the work. And that’s it.\n\n6. Buddy Up\n\nIf you lack affection for running, but you want to love the sport, then peering up with a partner might be the exact thing the doctor ordered. In fact, training with a partner is ONE of the best ways to get you committed to your training program and keep you accountable for your actions.\n\nWith the right training partner, you can explore new running routes and territories, try out new running workouts, and gab about the latest shocking episode of Game of Thrones while getting your workout done.\n\nSo please, keep in mind that there is plenty of roads to share. Ask around. Join a running club. Befriend other runners. Use online running community to match yourself up with a suitable and proper running buddy.\n\nJust don’t be shy and do approach a lot of runners, and keep in mind that if you don’t ask, the answer will always be no.\n\n7. Change up Your Running Routine\n\nThey say that variety is the spice of life—and this can’t be more relevant when it comes to staying in love with running.\n\nI believe that varying your running settings can spark drastic changes in your attitude and approach toward the sport. The fact is, it is very easy to get bored with running if you are doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nOne thing you can change and see immediate results is your running route. If truth be told, running the same route day in and day out is the fastest way I can think of that will get you stuck in a running rut.\n\nConversely, picking up a new place to run is an awesome way to spark your love for your outdoor workouts.\n\nAs a result, look up an open road, a new trail or a state park—preferably where you can immerse yourself in the beauty of nature, and keep changing your running routes on a regular basis—never letting routine to settle in.\n\nIn addition to changing your routes, make sure also to change your running workouts and your running approach more often. Hence, if you are bored with, let’s say, your long runs, then try something new. Hit the track and do an interval workout instead, or look up a steep hill and perform some hill sprints on it.\n\nAnd in case you are bored with running or got yourself injured, then cross train. Go to the gym and lift some weights; join a Crossfit or a spinning class, or roll your mat out and do some yoga. You might also go for a long hike in nature; pick whatever you like.\n\nIf you are looking for more ways to change up your running program, then check my 23 ways article here.\n\n8. Avoid Common Running Injuries\n\nRunners get injured a lot, and that’s a real bummer. And if you get injured a lot, then this will often lead to more pain and might force you to grow a hatred for the whole sport.\n\nNonetheless, the good news about running injury is that they are often preventable.\n\nHere are two things you can do to reduce the risks of injury while running:\n\nStay within your fitness level. This is the cardinal rule: don’t do too much too soon; otherwise, your body will start breaking down on you, and that’s not good. Therefore, be sure to run at your own pace and speed, and never try to match someone’s else.\n\nListen to your body. Keep a keen eye for any red flags and warnings signs of pain and discomfort—especially in your feet, legs, knees, and lower back. These warning signs could either indicate muscle soreness, an impending injury, joint stiffness, or a previous injury creeping up.\n\nSo please don’t persist with a training program when you feel pain and discomfort, regardless of how super goal-oriented and disciplined you think you are.\n\nFor more check my guide to running recovery here.\n\n9. Take a Break\n\nI don’t want to sound like a cliché, but as they say: absence makes the heart grow fonder.\n\nAs a result, if you are feeling a little burned out, it’s perhaps a good idea to put some distance between you and your running. If you are really meant to be running, it’s not going to be a long time before you start missing the pavement and looking forward to your next run.\n\nHowever, if the time spent being away from running doesn’t make you appreciate the sport, then I don’t think running is for you for the time being.\n\nAnd the fact is, recovery and rest days are just as vital as training days. Proper downtime can help your body repair and might fix a lot of things that were bothering you in the first place about running.\n\nSo if you are really at rock bottom with your running, then I suggest taking a break—maybe for longer than a week. Try a month, or longer. Of course, this depends on your fitness level and goals.\n\nYou don’t have to be your best running self and at the top of your running game every single day of the year. In fact, you are not perfect; running is not perfect; and no one (or any “thing”), is perfect for that matter.\n\n10. Or Start Streaking\n\nDon’t get me wrong here. I’m not suggesting that you should start running naked through a public place. In fact, the kind of streaking I’m talking about has nothing to do with that.\n\nIn the running world, streaking is the act of running on consecutive days for a specific period of time, usually for more than a month or so. My longest streak lasted for two months, and that was a long time ago and was really a turning point for me.\n\nSo regardless of your fitness goals and motivation, streaking can be of great help.—especially if done correctly.\n\nTherefore, I encourage to start a shorter streak, from two to three months, and that’s it.\n\nYour streaking goal is simple: aim to run at least a mile every day for three months, And the weeks go by, try to add no more than 5 to 10 minutes to your daily run until you are running for an hour or so every day.\n\nNevertheless, before you start a streaking routine, make sure that you are already at moderately high training mileage, and that your body has well adjusted to the high impact nature of running.\n\nAnd yes, be willing to take one day off every week to help with recovery. Proper rest helps your body repair and get adapted to the high impact; otherwise, ignoring proper recovery is paramount to flirting with disaster.\n\n11. Stay in the Moment\n\nThis might sound like the type of advice you’ll usually hear in new age circles, but it’s not all bogus. The stuff works.\n\nI mean, just think about it for a moment.\n\nAll there is the NOW. No past. No future.\n\nOnly the eternal moment of the NOW.\n\nAnd by staying in the moment through the practice of mindfulness, you’ll be free from getting entwined in thoughts of the past, and no longer be worrying about the future.\n\nTherefore, next time you go for a run, let go of your past failures and expectations and do your best to run in the now.\n\nHere is how to do that:\n\nFirst of all, get into the right mindset: clear your mind from everything, breathe deep, stand tall, relax your body, and set your intention on staying in the moment as often as possible.\n\nNext, focus on what you are doing and your surrounding. Bring your attention to your gross motor movements, the temperature, the wind, the elements, and go through every one of your senses: smells, sounds, everything.\n\nIn other words, lose your mind and come to your senses.\n\nThat’s the state of mindfulness. Practice it. Cultivate it. And whenever your mind wonders, bring it back to the now.\n\nImage Credit – Marco via Flickr\n\n12. Give it Time\n\nFalling in love with running doesn’t happen overnight.\n\nAs you already know, love takes times, and trying to rush things out is never the path to a healthy and happy relationship—especially with running.\n\nTherefore, if you are a really serious about staying in love with the sport for long, then remember that it isn’t a fling; it’s a long-term commitment (with lots of ups and downs just like a real relationship).\n\nIn other words, running is a lifelong affair, period.\n\nIn the end, time will tell.\n\nTherefore, if your current running routine is not working out according to your expectations, then give it time. Try out different things, change up your routine, reevaluate your goals, ask for help, get the support you need, etc.\n\nNew to Running?

It's just setting up the interviews or working with the league office.\"\n\nMatthews and Peppers -- along with former Packers player Mike Neal -- have denied the assertions of the Al-Jazeera report.\n\nClay Matthews, above, and Julius Peppers will be interviewed by the NFL, regarding an Al-Jazeera America report about performance-enhancing drugs. AP Photo/Morry Gash\n\nThe initial report came out last December and linked several NFL players, including Peyton Manning and James Harrison, to HGH and other drugs.\n\n\"I think it's bulls---, to be completely honest with you,\" Matthews said on Dec. 27. \"It's 100 percent falsified, fabricated information. I don't who this guy is. I couldn't tell you what he looks like. I've never talked with him. I've never communicated with him. So for him to bring my name up like that, which appears to be out of thin air, it's bulls---, for a lack of a better term.\n\n\"I work hard on my reputation, and really that's all I have,\" Matthews added. \"For seven years, I've worked my ass off. For this guy to say those type of things, it's just not true, and especially for him to recant everything that he said, too, I think it really just goes to show the [type of] source he is, as well. The truth will come out, and I'm not worried about it, because I carry myself a certain way, and that is the right way.\"\n\nNeither Matthews nor Peppers has been available for comment since the news broke that they would be interviewed by the league at the start of training camp.\n\nCharlie Sly -- the source for the Al-Jazeera report that implicated the NFL players -- has since recanted his remarks. Harrison said earlier this month in an affidavit provided to the NFL that he has never violated the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs and has never met Sly.",
  "latent_5164": "Brandon English/CL File\n\nProtesters on March 11 rallied in downtown Decatur over the police killing of Anthony Hill.\n\nBridget Anderson was planning to celebrate her three-year anniversary with her boyfriend, Anthony Hill, after work on the evening of March 9. As she drove home from work that afternoon, she received a call from his roommate who was in tears.\n\nHill, a 27-year-old African-American U.S. Air Force veteran who suffered from bipolar disorder, earlier that afternoon had been shot and killed by a white law enforcement officer. His incident was one of many high-profile police-involved shootings that have followed the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., last August.\n\nBut Anderson considers Hill's death \"the most blatant case of excessive force\" she's ever seen. That's because he was crawling naked around his apartment complex in Chamblee, knocking on his neighbors' doors, and at one point hanging from a balcony. Despite Hill later being found unarmed, DeKalb Officer Robert Olsen resorted to using his pistol despite having a taser and pepper spray on his belt.\n\n\"Anthony was a very good kid,\" she says. \"He had no criminal record. He loved children. He loved singing. He was a very friendly and sociable person. He wouldn’t hurt a fly. He actually would take spiders out of my apartment and set them free. I’ve never met anyone like that in my entire life who cared about people so much.\"\n\nHill left the military in 2013. Anderson says he struggled in his transition back to civilian life, partially because he failed to receive enough support leading up to his killing. One month after Hill was shot and killed, Anderson hopes that his death will lead to major reforms in how the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs takes care of veterans returning home from combat. In addition, she wants police officers to be better trained in dealing with people living with mental health illnesses.\n\nHill was unsuccessful in attempts to find steady work after serving in Afghanistan. According to Anderson, the V.A. was supposed to have case workers assigned to check up on him, but he received little assistance aside from a two-day resume class. He should have had a case worker who was more involved with helping him get his life back on track, she says.\n\n\"The transition from military life to civilian life is a huge change,\" she says. \"For somebody like Anthony, the V.A. needed to make sure the people who served our country are checked up on and getting the help they need because they risked their lives on the front lines.\"\n\nHis job search after being discharged from the military was also hamstrung by social anxiety and bipolar disorder. When Hill tried to get medical help to stabilize his mood, Anderson says the V.A. tried scheduling him for appointments in Charleston, S.C., and Texas despite the fact he had updated his records. Last January, he was also forced to wait on the phone for two and a half hours to obtain basic information and initially received poor treatment at the Atlanta V.A. Medical Center.\n\nAnderson says that Hill had smoked marijuana multiple times a week to help his mood and was able to start taking bipolar medication last January. But Hill, who was an aspiring singer hoping to sign a record deal, experienced side effects that included a locked jaw and a swollen tongue. She says those side effects prompted Hill to stop taking his medication about 10 days before he died. Hill had a follow-up appointment scheduled with his doctor for March 18, nine days after he was shot and killed, she says.\n\n\"He was going to tell his doctor to switch his medicine,\" Anderson says. \"He never got to do that. When he was on the medicine, he was smoking more because the side effects were worse. He was like, 'I don’t want to wake up one day and not be able to breathe because of what this medicine is doing this to me. He decided to stop taking the medicine and use marijuana to help him sleep, to help his brain function better.\"\n\nAtlanta V.A. Medical Center spokesman Greg Kendall declined to comment on specific details about Hill's medical treatment, citing privacy concerns. He says the V.A. facility offers \"a wide range of mental health services to all veterans seeking assistance\" such as primary care and specialized programs for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder treatment. The facility also offers a psychiatric emergency department that's open at all hours and a crisis line to speak with mental-health professionals.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the Hill family during this very difficult time,\" Kendall said in a statement.\n\nHill, thought to be in the middle of a bipolar episode when he was killed, was gunned down by a veteran officer who had received limited training on how to work with people suffering from mental-health conditions. Olsen, who was placed on administrative leave pending the investigation's outcome, had no serious discipline issues on his seven-year record. According to his police file, Olsen had completed 40 hours of Crisis Intervention Team training in 2009 that included instruction on how to respond to people whose behavior might be affected by mental illness. He received one more hour of mental illness training in 2011.\n\nDeKalb County Police spokeswoman Mekka Parish declined to comment on the Hill case. But Parish says new recruits have received four hours of mental-health training, plus one hour of additional officer training every three years. Not all are required to take the CIT training. She says the department now plans \"to be even more proactive\" by increasing officer training to two hours each year. And starting with DeKalb's next class of new officers, the department will mandate all recruits complete the 40-hour CIT training. All current officers who haven't taken the course will be required to do so, she says.\n\nYet Anderson says DeKalb Police should have required Olsen and officers to receive even more additional training. According to Anderson, DeKalb officers should be required to take comprehensive mental-health training at least once every six months. If that didn't happen, she says DeKalb could follow the San Antonio Police Department's example and establish a mental-health detail that specializes in responding to incidents like the one that took Hill's life.\n\n\"Hill wasn’t hurting anyone, he was knocking on doors, jumping off a balcony, he wasn’t running toward anyone, people were five feet away from him telling him to get inside. He was out it,\" Anderson says. \"For an officer not to see that is crazy to me. It’s common sense for anyone. A child could’ve seen that. It makes me angry.\"\n\nDeKalb Police Chief Cedric Alexander has asked for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to launch an independent probe into Hill's killing and all other shootings involving his department's officers. GBI Director Vernon Keenan this week stated that the agency, which has taken on numerous investigations into police-involved shootings in metro Atlanta, needs more resources to continue doing such work.\n\nAnderson, who's had her life turned upside down, would like to see justice served for Hill's in the form of an indictment or even jail time. If that doesn't happen, she hopes that his death will change government policies that save the lives of others.\n\n\"I don’t hate Officer Olsen, but there should be some kind of penalty for him,\" Anderson says. \"I tried to forgive him in my heart.

He won an Emmy for his under water documentary \"Attack Of The Sea Slugs\".\n\nHinton said he was working on a four year long documentary, that he called \"Ozark Underwater\", when his body was found in a one-thousand gallon tank about 2 and a half feet deep. Inside the tank was a 200-pound turtle.\n\n\"He was filming, I think he referred to it as, his river monster which was his 200-pound permitted turtle that he's had for probably almost four years. He was going to let it go this weekend but he wanted to do some additional footage for his documentary.\"\n\nFriday at 7:08 p.m., Williams posted a picture of his breathing tank with this caption:\n\n\"I've got a date with a 200-pound river monster tonight!

We don't know if there was a malfunction. Either gasses over took him and he drown or obviously something happened and that's what took his life.\" Hinton said.\n\nFamily members said Williams was filming inside of the tank.\n\n\"I know they are having a hard time right now retrieving footage off the camera that was going when his accident happened because it's so high-tech.

  "latent_5697": "UPDATE: 7:55 PM EST: The march ended without any major acts of violence. There were tussles, but the Houston Police Department did a great job keeping things from escalating.\n\nAt one point there was a disagreement between the New Black Panther Party and fellow marchers from the Occupy movement. One of the Occupy protesters began marching in front of Quanell X, so a few Panthers asked the man to move–to let Quanell lead. The Occupy member said he didn’t see why Quanell X had to be in the front.\n\nAt the end of the event, people recognized Breitbart News’ Brandon Darby and asked him to hang himself and directed numerous slurs toward him. The police had to intervene to keep Darby safe from the crowd.\n\nAnother journalist asked a question: “Would this be happening if Trayvon were white?” Upon asking the question this journalist was surrounded by many in the “Justice for Trayvon” crowd, who began to chant, “go away KKK.”\n\nThe protesters accosting Darby and the other journalist were members of Occupy, not the New Black Panther Party.\n\nUpdate: 6:45 PM EST: After what seems to be two miles of marching there are at least 400 people–the majority of whom are black and there are members of anarchy groups in the mix as well. At one point in the march someone standing along the side of the road held up a sign that said people in hoodies weren’t welcome in his neighborhood.\n\nQuanell X saw the sign but did nothing. Moments later the man was almost captured by others marching with the New black Panther Party before he narrowly escaped behind police lines.\n\nThe Houston Police are doing a great job. The march has been peaceful to his point.\n\nUpdate: Police already have two helicopters flying over the area with well over 100 police visible mainly on horses. The people in the pro-Zimmerman march are predominantly white, while the Justice for Trayvon marchers are predominantly black.\n\nA “Justice for Travyon” rally being held in the River Oaks neighborhood of Houston, TX is headed by radical New Black Panther Party leader Quanell X — and concealed carry counterprotesters are headed in their direction.\n\nBreitbart News’ Brandon Darby is on scene and reports:\n\nThis is significant because Quanell X is a former criminal who came across the Nation of Islam in the 1990s and became a prominent speaker for the group. But he was kicked out of the Nation of Islam after he began advocating that black people go and mug rich white people in River Oaks. That is the same neighborhood through which he is marching into today.\n\nHe is known to be so radical that black leaders organizing for Al Sharpton events on the July 20 did not want anything to do with him. Many people from River Oaks as well as pro-Zimmerman citizens have come to the rally in River Oaks as a counter protest. At some point in the next two hours, the march of 200-400 New Black Panther Party supporters will collide with the concealed carry counter protesters.\n\nHouston Police Chief Charles McClelland said he expects “a peaceful protest,” but is “encouraging” citizens to stay away from River Oaks on July 21.",

It was just as emotional as the first.\n\nSome members, such as Wildrose MLA Mike Smith, chose to take his allotted time to speak passionately against the notion of assisted death.\n\n“Love — not this motion, not these regulations, not physician-assisted death — is the answer,” he said.\n\nOthers, such as Lethbridge-East NDP MLA Maria Fitzpatrick, told of the deaths of loved ones.\n\nThe main complaints opposition parties have with Motion 17 doesn’t seem to be the regulations themselves, but the lack of consultation in developing them, and what they see as a last-minute solution.\n\nBy releasing regulations at the eleventh hour, McIver said, the opportunity to consult with constituents has been lost.\n\n“It’s done. It’s over. You blew it. There’s no coming back from this one,” he told the NDP government.\n\nSimilarly, PC MLA Sandra Jansen accused the government of “not listening,” and called the lack of consultation “unforgivable.”\n\nHealth Minister Sarah Hoffman said Wednesday the government is working “as quickly as possible” to get the regulations in place.\n\nMore than 15,000 people gave feedback in a survey on the issue, she said, and the province wants to get it right.\n\n“It’s really important we get feedback from the opposition members, which is why we’ve engaged in this debate,” she said.\n\n“We’re the only province in Canada that’s even brought this level of transparency to the discussion.

  "latent_6112": "Finally, some good news about gene therapy. And just in time for the holidays.\n\nA recent study showed that giving hemophilia patients blood clotting genes can partially make up for their deficiencies and reduce bleeding. Hemophilia B is a heredity disorder caused by a defective gene for the blood clotting protein called factor IX. Researchers in Britain successfully treated six people with hemophilia by giving them a gene with a functional form of factor IX. Previous clinical trials have attempted to treat hemophilia with gene therapy, but expression of the vital factor had been short-lived. In the current study the researchers used a modified viral vector – the carrier DNA into which the factor IX DNA is inserted – that targeted the DNA specifically to the liver where factor IX is normally produced. Other studies had shown that the vector could be expressed in the livers of large animals for at least 10 years. The strategy worked, at least a year out after treatment. The participants in the study all had severe hemophilia B, meaning their bodies produced less than one percent normal factor IX levels. In a dose-dependent manner the gene raised factor IX levels in the participants between 2 and 12 percent. Not spectacular increases, but effective nonetheless. Severe hemophiliacs have to receive injections of the factor IX protein two to three times a week to avoid severe bleeding. Four of the participants were able to stop treatment injections altogether and the other two were able to extend time between injections.\n\nHemophilia is probably not talked about as often as many other disorders. But for people with the disease, it can be a debilitating, daily grind. Listen to Sebastian Misztal, one of the trial participants, talk about how the therapy has changed his life in the following video.\n\nThe study comes more than half a century since scientists first linked hemophilia B to a factor IX deficiency. The patient was a 10-year-old boy named Stephen Christmas. Henceforth, the disease was called “Christmas disease.” The gene therapy, however, was not without side-effects. One high-dose participant showed increased levels of transaminases, a sign of possible liver damage. Another showed a small increase in liver enzymes. The researchers treated them both with steroids.\n\nGiven that there is already a treatment for hemophilia B – factor IX concentrate injections – a fair question is: why pursue a gene therapy? One answer is cost. The cost to severe hemophiliacs who receive injections when they need them – when they’re bleeding – is about $150,000 per year. The cost for those who receive injections regularly as a prophylactic is about $300,000 per year. Over an entire lifetime the cost can exceed $20 million. The cost of the therapy is estimated at $30,000 per patient. Even if the patient has to receive multiple treatments throughout his or her lifetime it will still be the cheaper alternative by far.\n\nOne out of about every 30,000 newborn babies will have Hemophilia B. In the United States about 3,000 people have the disease. The severity of bleeding ranges widely. In the more severe cases, symptoms will be apparent early on such as when a baby is circumcised. More mild cases might not be noticed until later in life when the person experiences a trauma or undergoes surgery. It also affects men more than women as the gene for factor IX is found on the X chromosome. As with all X-linked diseases, having two X chromosomes gives women double the chance of having a normal form of the gene.\n\nHemophilia A, caused by a defect in clotting factor VIII, is actually much more prevalent than hemophilia B and accounts for about 80 percent of all hemophilia patients. Gene therapy scientists are starting with factor IX because it is much smaller than the factor VIII gene and more feasible to work with.\n\nHearing about hemophilia can conjure images of British royalty, as it is often taught in schools as the disease passed from Queen Victoria to her royal descendants all over Europe. I can still remember all those squares and circles on the science class pedigree. In 2009 scientists exhumed bones from the graves of Russian Czar Nicholas II and his family members and analyzed their DNA. The “royal disease” had been transmitted to the family from Queen Victoria. They confirmed that family members had a defective form of factor IX, or hemophilia B. Isn’t history with molecular biology fun?\n\nBut the first documentation of hemophilia goes back quite a bit further. In the Babylonian Talmud, written in the second century, Rabbi Judah commanded that “If she circumcised her first child and he died, and a second one also died, she must not circumcise her third child.”\n\nLucky for the third child they hadn’t yet begun to insist on an n of 3.\n\nThe current study, carried out by scientists at the University College London Cancer Institute and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It’s a rare triumph for gene therapy, all too often delivering maladies instead of miracles. The field has proceeded much more cautiously since two French boys developed leukemia and one University of Pennsylvania teenager died after receiving gene therapy. Only six people were involved in the current study, so there’s still plenty of ground to cover before the factor IX vector can be considered a safe and effective treatment. Let’s hope the current results are not a fluke, but an indication of things to come.\n\nvideo: gene therapy",

So, let's assume the top 2% (isn't that what Master league consists of?) make it into Master league at the beginning of the season. Then, as the season progresses, people who WOULD get promotions cannot because the top 2% is already filled. Normally, players would be demoted out of Master league and players would be promoted into Master league. Or is it that the players who -WOULD HAVE- gotten demoted from Masters will stay in it and be ignored for the \"top 2%\" while players still get promoted from Diamond, thus making master league technically larger than 2%?\n\nWhile I don't like to get demoted because master league so kewl man, I disagree with the idea.

Normally, players would be demoted out of Master league and players would be promoted into Master league.

  "latent_6338": "Twitter is alit today, it seems, with news of Google neutralising AdBlock Plus. The popular extension, originally created by Wladimir Palant in 2006, is used by many to bypass ads hosted on the internet, including the video ads served by Google's video streaming site.\n\nIt has drawn the ire of many web publishers and websites alike for allegedly curtailing their revenues significantly. In an attempt to shore up the almost non-existent profits from YouTube, Google might have finally found a way of skirting the extension. Multiple Twitter users are now posting their accounts, including images, of Chrome circumventing the extension's ad-averse net:\n\nSo YouTube has finally clamped down on Adblock, if Adblock is active on the page, the pre-roll ad will play without a skip option. — SteeScribbles (@SteeScribbles) September 6, 2015\n\nA 3 min ad? Really? I have adblock also how is this even possible? pic.twitter.com/3BmqZAGzIr — revVGC (@r4rev2) September 7, 2015\n\nYouTube now treats ads as pre-videos on the site, and only the skip ad button is seen as an ad by adblock. GENIUS! Good job guys! :D — Jordi v/d Bussche (@Kwebbelkop) September 5, 2015\n\nGoogle's workaround seems to be applicable to all similar extensions and isn't exclusive to just AdBlock Plus.\n\nThe company has not stopped at just skirting the extension, however. Users with AdBlock enabled will now have to see full-length video ads with no option to skip them half-way through, a feature YouTube has offered for a very long time. The only way to get the option back is to disable AdBlock, or to whitelist YouTube.\n\nEver-industrious, the internet has already found a way of bypassing Google's own bypass, though:\n\nFixed it. It seems to be just a Chrome thing. According to Adblock, uninstalling the \"YouTube\" \"app\" resolves the issue. — SteeScribbles (@SteeScribbles) September 6, 2015\n\nThis move is likely to please content creators and publishers, but is obviously a blow at users' ability to choose how they interact with the internet and what content they consume and what they don't. Blocking ads has always been a controversial issue and it will likely remain so in the future.\n\nUpdate: We have been contacted by Rob Wu, a developer on the Chromium project - the open-source foundation for the Chrome browser - who has informed us that this change was not intentional but, rather, an unintended result of fixing a previous security issue (CVE-2015-1297). He confirmed that the issue will only be seen if the YouTube app is installed and that, at the moment, apart from disabling AdBlock or whitelisting YouTube, the only solution, as described above, is to uninstall the app. The problem is expected to be patched in the upcoming weeks or, at least, when Chrome 46 is released.\n\nYouTube logo image via Shutterstock",
  "latent_6352": "Update: Mysterious death of federal prosecutor on Hollywood beach ruled a suicide\n\nA month after the body of federal prosecutor Beranton J. Whisenant Jr. washed up in the surf on a beach in Hollywood, there is still no answer from police about what happened to him — but plenty of unfounded internet speculation.\n\nHollywood police and the Broward medical examiner’s office remain tight-lipped, declining numerous public records requests on Whisenant’s death. In the immediate aftermath of recovering his body on May 24, the department revealed that the highly regarded 37-year-old lawyer in the Miami office of the U.S. Attorney had sustained some type of trauma to his head.\n\nBut investigators haven’t added any information since, starting with the most basic questions: Gunshot or something else? Suicide or homicide?\n\n“[Detectives] are still actively investigating it and are waiting for new evidence to come in,” said spokeswoman Miranda Grossman, explaining the department’s silence.\n\nThe wait for an explanation about what might have happened to the Miramar father of three has left friends and former colleagues searching for clues themselves and has frustrated some family members. One relative, Angela Padgett, the aunt of Beranton’s wife, contacted The Miami Herald to ask about progress in resolving what she said the family believes was a murder — by a gunshot to the head.\n\n“The coroner told Beranton’s wife that he had a gunshot wound in his head when they turned over his body to the family” in late May for funeral services, said Padgett, who lives in Georgia. She said she was a “concerned family member who has not gotten a good night’s rest since Beranton was killed.”\n\nWhisenant’s immediate family members, including his wife, Ebony, a doctor who teaches at Florida International University’s medical school, and his parents, both Jacksonville physicians, also did not return calls and emails seeking comment on a death that remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe lack of information from authorities has opened the door for internet fringe sites that traffic in unfounded political conspiracies. But there is little evidence in the real world or in Whisenant’s personal and professional background to suggest someone would target him. Colleagues scrutinizing past cases during a 13-year career as a lawyer — most dealing with asbestos lawsuits — found only one that had sparked any obvious friction. Whisenant, acting as a guardian ad litem in a Miami-Dade family court custody case, was granted a restraining order against a father who wrote him threatening emails a year ago.\n\nBut there is no indication that the case in family court, where legal disputes can be highly emotional, has even registered on the radar of Hollywood investigators.\n\nA well-known attorney\n\nSomeone walking on Hollywood Beach first spotted Whisenant’s body, still dressed in business clothes, floating off shore before dawn on May 24. He had been at work in the U.S. attorney’s office only the day before.\n\nAlthough he had only been working at the Miami federal prosecutor’s office since January, colleagues who knew him say they were impressed with his commitment and passion, making his death all the more difficult to comprehend. Whisenant was also well known outside the office, having volunteered on Florida Bar committees, taught as an adjunct professor at the University of Miami law school and participated in the Miami-Dade black lawyers’ association.\n\nEarly on the U.S. attorney’s office and FBI determined that it had no connection to his employment as a prosecutor or his federal criminal cases, leaving the death investigation to the Hollywood Police Department. He first did a brief stint in the office’s appellate division, then was assigned to the major crimes section, like all new prosecutors. He handled cases on foreigners illegally entering the country, passport fraud and visa violations, along with a few drug distribution prosecutions.\n\nInevitably, the vacuum of information about his death has led to fake news stories popping up on the Internet: Several sites have circulated unsubstantiated claims that his death was linked to a local lawsuit filed by supporters of Bernie Sanders against the Democratic National Committee, which alleges DNC bias for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary campaign.\n\nDiscredited theories\n\nSome of the same sites also falsely connected the death of the late DNC staffer Seth Rich, fatally shot last year in Washington, DC, to the same suit. Fox News — after complaints and denial from Rich’s family and investigators — wound up retracting another internet-inspired conspiracy theory that Rich’s death had been connected to DNC email hacks that were leaked to help President Trump’s campaign.\n\nThe Whisenant postings focus on the fact that the prosecutor died in the south Broward district of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was chairperson of the DNC during the primary season.\n\nPeople close to Whisenant say they have seen the postings and are “disgusted” with the exploitation of his death, saying he had no connection to the DNC case. For most of his career, he had been in private practice. Whisenant, a graduate of the University of Florida law school, had worked as a state prosecutor in Jacksonville and later for almost a decade at a Miami civil law firm, Foley & Mansfield, before joining the U.S. attorney’s office in January.\n\n“I find that type of behavior disgusting and offensive,” said a close friend, who did not want to be identified. “To use someone’s death to manipulate a scenario that has no basis in truth is disturbing.”\n\nAt his former firm, Whisenant focused on asbestos and other tort litigation but also worked at least once as a guardian ad litem in Miami-Dade County family court, representing the interests of a child in a long-running dispute between a father and mother over financial support, visitation rights and other custody matters.\n\nAfter Whisenant issued his guardian ad litem report early last year, the father began sending the lawyer a series of “hostile” emails, challenging the findings, making “personal attacks” and threatening to sue, according to the attorney’s Jan. 25, 2016, motion seeking sanctions against the father.\n\nWhisenant asked the presiding judge in the case to keep the father away from him. The judge issued the stay-away order the following month.",

  "latent_6449": "An Indiana man is under fire for creating a parade float that depicts Hillary Clinton in an electric chair with Donald Trump pulling the trigger, local TV station WCPO reported Monday.\n\nThe float, which debuted at the Aurora Farmer’s Fair in Aurora, Indiana, had a lot going on. It featured not only a mock execution of Clinton by Trump, but also an Easter Island head painted black and identified as President Barack Obama, a sign listing some of Clinton’s scandals and insults against her, and a Trump/Pence campaign sign (Trump’s running mate Mike Pence is the governor of Indiana).\n\nThe float’s creator, Frank Linkmeyer, told WCPO that he didn’t mean to offend anyone. He said he creates off-the-wall floats for the parade every year and takes jabs at everyone.\n\n“Police officers, judges, nurses, doctors, heart transplant patients — just a variety of things and the people in Aurora and the surrounding area love to see us in the parade,” he told the station.\n\nAs for the float’s apparent political message, Linkmeyer told the station that he could just have easily built the float to show Clinton executing Trump as the other way around.\n\n“Could have had Donald Trump in the electric chair. It was a tossup,” Linkemeyer told WCPO.\n\nTrump supporters and Trump himself have made what many construed as threatening statements towards Clinton this year, including when Trump told a rally crowd that “Second Amendment people” could stop her from appointing Supreme Court justices if she’s elected president.\n\nMany paradegoers were not laughing, telling TV station that they found Linkmeyer’s float racist, sexist and threatening, especially at an event where children and families are present.\n\nThe town’s Lions Club, which organizes the parade, released a statement on its website saying it “regretted” Linkmeyer’s display.\n\n“The parade is a public venue which does not reflect the views of the Aurora Lions Club,” the organization wrote. “As a member of a worldwide service organization, we are proud and standby (sic) our record of service to this community. We appreciate the high levels of support and esteem given to us by our citizens. We will continue to do our best to live up to their standards. We hope the political circus of this year’s election stays with the national media.”\n\nLinkmeyer gave WCPO a half-hearted apology, saying that if people are offended that they can stay home next year.\n\n“It’s all in fun,” he told the news station. “Laughter is the best medicine in life and this country needs more laughter — and the people that are offended by it, I’m sorry. Don’t come to the parade next time.”",
  "latent_6552": "As articulated in the United States Constitution, one of the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment is the right of persons and groups to assemble peacefully. Whether demonstrating, counterprotesting, or showing support for a cause, individuals and groups have the right to peacefully gather. Law enforcement, in turn, has the responsibility to ensure public safety while protecting the privacy and associated rights of individuals.\n\nTo support agencies as they fulfill their public safety responsibilities, the Criminal Intelligence Coordinating Council (CICC) developed this paper to provide guidance and recommendations to law enforcement officers in understanding their role in First Amendment-protected events. This paper is divided into three areas, designed to provide in-depth guidance for law enforcement.\n\nPre-Event Stage—Discusses how law enforcement will plan for an event or demonstration where First Amendment protections are involved, focusing on the activity that begins when law enforcement leadership learns of an event and must determine the level, if any, of involvement at the event, from both public safety and investigative standpoints.\n\nOperational Stage—Focuses on how law enforcement will respond to the event, based on the findings from the Pre-Event Stage, including the development and execution of the Operations Plan.\n\nPost-Event Stage—Addresses how and whether information obtained as a result of the event (both during the Pre-Event Stage and Operational Stage) will be evaluated, disseminated, retained, or discarded, as per agency policy.\n\nAs agencies respond to First Amendment-protected events, law enforcement leadership should be aware of certain “red flag” issues that may arise as they assess whether the agency and personnel should be involved in these events and, if so, what form that involvement should take. As agencies review and understand the concepts and recommendations within this paper, special consideration should be given to these “red flag” issues to ensure that law enforcement agencies and personnel do not infringe on the rights of persons and groups.\n\n…\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide greater awareness and understanding of the appropriate role of law enforcement in events and demonstrations where First Amendment rights are involved. This paper provides guidance and recommendations to law enforcement officers as they prepare for, respond to, and follow up with events, activities, and assemblies that are protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America.\n\nAs officers address these types of events, the three-stage process identified in this paper should be incorporated into agency policies, manuals, and/or directives. This process, while focusing on law enforcement’s response to First Amendment events and activities, is not designed to limit the ability of officers to engage in normal criminal investigations or public safety missions. A law enforcement agency may have special rules and procedures governing the levels of review and approval required to engage in preliminary or full investigations or other activities discussed herein; as such, officers should be aware of and understand these rules and procedures.\n\nFusion Centers\n\nFusion centers can play a valuable role in supporting law enforcement’s involvement in First Amendment-protected events. As part of the Pre-Event Stage, fusion centers can support state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies as they undergo a Pre-Event Assessment. This support may include the completion of an applicable assessment and the utilization of publicly available material (such as social media tools and resources) that pertains to potential threats to the event and/or organizations participating in the event, including potential counterdemonstration groups. If the Pre-Event Assessment does not identify any risk or threat, then the fusion center should not distribute the assessment beyond those customers who are serving a public safety role for the event. Fusion centers may also support the Operational Stage by assisting in information-/intelligence-related inquiries officers may have in response to an event.\n\nIf a criminal predicate or reasonable suspicion is identified or the findings of the Pre-Event Assessment provide specific, actionable intelligence, fusion centers may support agency leadership and law enforcement officers by identifying the collection requirements3 applicable to the event, based on the mission and role of the fusion center. In those limited circumstances, fusion centers should also be involved in any post-event activities, including the information evaluation, dissemination, and retention efforts. Fusion centers should not be involved in post-event evaluation, dissemination, and retention efforts of events that involve only routine public safety issues, such as conflicts between demonstrators or crowd-control problems.\n\n“Red Flag” Areas\n\n“Red flags” are issues and concerns identified throughout the three-stage process that law enforcement should carefully evaluate before proceeding. As agencies utilize the guidance identified in this paper and respond to First Amendment-protected events, there are certain areas that law enforcement leadership must be aware of as they assess whether and to what degree, if any, officers should be involved in these events. Law enforcement leadership should clearly articulate the reason, purpose, and justification for collecting information when addressing these “red flag” areas in the agency Operations Plan.\n\n1. Pre-Event Red Flags\n\n• Collecting information based solely on participants’ beliefs/groups’ actions.\n\n• Collecting names of organizations, proposed participants, or contact organizers (other than event organizers), including counterdemonstration groups.\n\n2. Operational Red Flags\n\n• Sharing information about the group(s) with other law enforcement agencies or criminal justice entities that do not have an applicable law enforcement mission.\n\n• Taking pictures and videos of the event.\n\n– Collecting names or other identifying information (such as license plates) of participants, people in the area, counterdemonstrators, or bystanders watching the event.\n\n3. Post-Event Red Flags\n\n• Retaining information beyond the purpose for which it was obtained or where no indication of criminal activity was found.\n\n• Sharing information about the group with other justice entities.\n\n• Not responding to reasonable inquiries regarding the role of law enforcement at the event.\n\nIt is imperative that law enforcement leadership distinguish between appropriate operational planning for activities where a criminal predicate exists and those activities protected by the U.S. Constitution. Leadership should recognize and consider these issues throughout their planning process and clearly articulate law enforcement’s role (as well as what law enforcement will not be involved in) throughout the planning process. If a legal or justified basis cannot be articulated, further research should be conducted before proceeding.\n\nAs with all law enforcement response, officers should adhere to constitutional protections, both federal and state; court decision(s); state statutes; and local ordinances, as well as agency privacy policies and procedures and other relevant resources, to ensure their response is in line with agency policy and procedures.\n\n…\n\nProhibited conduct may include:\n\nInvestigating and collecting, maintaining, using, or sharing information regarding persons or groups solely because they are involved in constitutionally protected activity.\n\nInvestigating and collecting, maintaining, using, or sharing information regarding persons or groups solely because of the content of their speech (e.g., if there is no reasonable law enforcement purpose, such as criminal conduct advocated or planned or threat to public safety).\n\nInvestigating and collecting, maintaining, using, or sharing information regarding persons’ or groups’ exercise of their First Amendment rights for a purpose unrelated to the event.\n\nInstructing the debriefing of or questioning witnesses, event participants, or arrestees regarding their social, political, or religious views unless specifically related to criminal conduct and then only as necessary to achieve the clearly stated objective in the Pre-Event Work Plan.\n\nCollecting, maintaining, using, or sharing information that is outside the scope of the stated objectives of the investigation unless exigent circumstances justify modification of those objectives.\n\nCollecting, maintaining, using, or sharing information without evaluating it and marking it for source reliability and content validity prior to maintaining, using, or sharing it.\n\nCollecting, maintaining, using, or sharing information (such as names) in political petitions, mailing lists, organizational memberships, or writings espousing a particular view that is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nInvestigating persons or groups solely because of:\n\nAdvocating a position in their speech or writings that an officer finds to be offensive or disagreeable.\n\nSupport for unpopular causes.\n\nEthnic background, race, or national origin.\n\nReligion or religious affiliations.\n\nNoncriminal personal habits.\n\nAssociations with persons that are not of a criminal nature.\n\nAssociation with or being related to persons belonging to an organization espousing views protected by the First Amendment.\n\nInvestigating, disrupting, interfering with, or harassing any person for the purpose of:\n\nPreventing the person from engaging in conduct protected by the First Amendment.\n\nRetaliating against the person for engaging in conduct protected by the First Amendment.\n\nDiscriminating against the person on the basis of conduct protected by the First Amendment.\n\n…\n\nProfessional conduct—The presence of law enforcement officers at an event may arouse concern. Therefore, emphasis should be made regarding the importance for officers to be courteous and respectful. Officers should not:",

  "latent_6698": "I've never cared too much about Legacy. Grand Prix Columbus was my first Legacy event and the only reason I went was because it was close to Gen Con which was the next weekend. I was also trying to collect points to grind pro levels. I luckily made Top 8 but my feelings for the format didn't change. I just played it because I had to.\n\nEverything changed at Grand Prix Providence. Again I was only there because I was Level 8 and in search of pro points. Everyone told me it was foolish to skip the event since it was in the US and was a format most people enjoyed. I sleeved up the same archetype as I did the year prior and once again battled with limited knowledge of the format.\n\nMy results in the two events couldn't have been more different and yet my appreciation for the format also reversed this year. I missed Day Two but I reconnected with someone who had a big impact on my first Legacy experience.\n\nThat person was Drew Levin.\n\nA year ago he was just a name I'd heard and now he's a very good friend. This was all made possible because of Legacy. It's interesting because he had such a big impact on my life and I didn't even know it. It took me almost an entire year to figure it out.\n\nBack at GP Columbus the famous Craig Wescoe incident occurred resulting in Drew's disqualification. It ruined one person's weekend but made another person's weekend amazing.\n\nThat person was me.\n\nI was going to end up in ninth place taking home some cash and four pro points. However the difference between four and five pro points really mattered as the extra point would have put me at 30 points giving me an appearance fee and a free flight to Pro Tour Amsterdam in the next month. It didn't hurt that it would end up tying me for the Player of the Year thing but who's counting?\n\nI knew I couldn't make Top 8 of the event. I took apart my deck and was about to leave the site. All of a sudden I heard my name called and I had no clue how to react. It was mathematically impossible. I decided I was the luckiest man alive and got my deck back in order.\n\nAs I was doing so a kid came up to me and told me to win the whole thing for him. I figured he was just a very big fan and told him I would try. He told me very assertively that \"maybe\" was not a good enough answer and that I would have to win. Again I could only say that I would try and that I had to get ready for Top 8. I had no clue that this was in fact the kid who got disqualified.\n\nI ended up punting in the Top 8 against Tomoharu Saito and losing in the quarters. I didn't make it up to the kid but didn't even know what I was fighting for. All I knew was that I got lucky.\n\nThe next time I talked with Drew was in Providence earlier this year at the GP. I ended up doing poorly because of a bad deck choice and realized that if I'd just spent a small amount of time working on the format I would have known so much more and done much better. As I was talking about this Drew was there and agreed with me. He knew with a little help I'd be able to do something with the format.\n\nWe reconnected again on that weekend when we shared a taxi to the airport. I was on my way to Singapore for more Magic while he was going back to the SCG Open grind ready to dominate more Legacy. He again brought up getting me into Legacy and that he would be more than happy to help.\n\nThis got me thinking. If I was to learn a format from the ground up it would be great to document it and give it to the public as a learning tool. Why not let the world watch me while I learn a rapidly growing format? Also if this goes well I could consider going to Legacy GP in Amsterdam at the end of the year.\n\nI ran this idea by Drew and he liked the idea wanting to help. Drew seems like the kind of person who wants to always improve. He wanted to help me and learn something in the process.\n\nI am very excited about this project because I can write about something new rather than things I already know about. It could be interesting—not only for myself but for others—to find out what questions I have to ask myself and how to go about discovering things. I've never tried focusing on how I learn things before.\n\nWe first thought I could learn the format in a couple weeks. This was foolish because the format is so vast and I know so little. I'm a quick learner but there's a ton of information I need to catch up on.\n\nWe spent hours on the phone talking about the format and I could tell my theory was strong but I couldn't back it up in games. I told him TPS was probably one of the most powerful decks in the format. He countered by playing some games with me.\n\nPlaying a deck and knowing it is good are two different things. Decks in Legacy are nothing like the ones in Standard. Of course all decks take skill to play but piloting Caw-Blade is nothing like piloting TPS. I just stared at my hand and had no idea what I was doing.\n\nI think Drew knew this but wanted to humor himself while crushing me in matches. This was a very rude awakening to say the least. I had never felt so powerless when playing Magic. There were so many decisions to make and I didn't know any of them. Of course this was our first attempt at teaching me Legacy so I wasn't discouraged. I just knew we would need much more time than a couple weeks.\n\nThe other big problem was card availability. We spent days trying to get cards together on Magic Online.\n\nAll of this proved that more time would be needed.\n\nI also realized we might be missing one thing. What if we got the public involved as well? If we had months instead of weeks we could do this.\n\nSo my proposal is this: I won't ask just Drew for help but anyone who wants to take part. My goal is to learn Legacy in the next couple months in order to be strong enough in the format to take that trip to Europe and play in the end-of-the-year Legacy Grand Prix in Amsterdam.\n\nOnce a month Drew and I will talk about our progress and what we want to work on in the coming weeks and we'll take advice from others in the community. Who knows where this will go? But it will be fun to find out.\n\nTo start things off I should tell you what I know about the format.\n\nI have played two Legacy tournaments and both with a version of Junk. Last year the deck seemed fine because wasn't getting as much love but this year it was a terrible deck idea. I at least know that much.\n\nand give blue decks the ability to have some very good starts. It seems that many games can be won just by having these cards in your deck. Not only do they make an opponent play differently but they also force them not to commit too much to a winning strategy. The value this creates is something many cards only dream of.\n\nOn the other side of this some decks probably should get more love; they shouldn't fear death because of these cards. Goblins seems like a very good strategy when decks rely on and Stoneforge Mystic to win. I need more information about the metagames but that deck should be played more than it is these days.\n\nTPS is a very difficult deck to play even though it seems very powerful. I really want to take another crack at this deck once I learn more about the format. This was the worst place to start since it was the first deck with I've played and it seems difficult to cast correctly in this deck.\n\nOn the opposite side of this are U/W Stoneforge decks. These seem very forgiving and very high on power level. Being able to one-for-one multiple times and then cast cards like and is very strong.\n\nwas the one card I wanted to play with last year and is the reason I did well in Columbus. The card used to be very good but seems unplayable now. is just too strong and so are the decks being played right now. I would rather stay away from midrange if it isn't focused on blue cards.\n\nThe first place I want to explore is blue decks. I have stayed away from them thinking there were other decks I could be playing but blue cards seem too powerful not to be playing them. I just don't know which of them I should be playing. Merfolk comes to mind since it seems like it has multiple favorable matchups.

  "latent_6736": "The Guardian reported today that two Israeli groups have set up training courses in subversive Wikipedia editing aiming to 'show the other side' of the Jewish State.\n\nThose who lend their pen to the Palestinian cause know about Wikipedia Jews, a term that was coined a few years ago. It refers to a bunch of rabid and crypto Zionists who constantly vandalise encyclopaedia entries to do with Palestine, Palestinian activists and Israeli atrocities.\n\nAccording to the Guardian two Israeli groups seeking to gain the upper hand in the online debate have launched a course in \"Zionist editing\".\n\nYesha Council, representing the Jewish settler movement ran their first workshop this week in Jerusalem, teaching participants how to ‘rewrite’ and ‘revise’ some of the most “hotly disputed pages of the online reference site.”\n\nThe Wikipideia project is a phenomenal humanist and universalist initiative. Hence, it should not take us by surprise that its biggest opponents are tribal operators, amongst them Zionists, crypto Zionists and the so called ‘Jewish anti Zionists’.\n\nOne Jerusalem-based Wikipedia editor, told the Guardian that publicising the new Zionist conspiratorial initiative might not be such a ‘good idea’. \"Going public in the past has had a bad effect,\" she says. \"There is a war going on and unfortunately the way to fight it has to be underground.\"\n\nOne may be surprised to discover that chief amongst ‘Wikipedia Jews’ is alleged ‘Anti Zionist’ Roland Rance. Rance, is a London based Jewish Marxist who spends most of his time peppering Wikipedia entries with Judeo-centric context. Roland Rance was also one of the leading opponents of Deir Yassin Remembered (DYR), probably the most successful Palestinian solidarity operation in the UK.\n\nHere is a snapshot of Rance’s relentless attempt to vandalise Israel Shamir’s Wikipedia entry last week.\n\nWikipedia Jews have history behind them. According to the Guardian, in 2008, members of the hawkish pro-Israel watchdog Camera who secretly planned to edit Wikipedia were banned from the site by administrators. There is a war going on my own Wikipedia entry. More than once Wikipedia Administrators have been called in just to remove contamination by Rance and other Zionists.\n\nThe Wikipedia project is all about knowledge and the availability of knowledge. Is it a coincidence that political Jews in the right and in the left are united to subvert this project? I do not think so. Once again we come across what seems to be Zionist continuum. They are all united against knowledge.\n\nApparently The organisiers of the Zionist Wikipedia courses, are already planning a competition to find the \"Best Zionist editor\", with a prize of a hot-air balloon trip over Israel. I guess that by now we know who should be the candidate for the blue & white air balloon adventure.\n\n﻿",
  "latent_6788": "SPOILERS for tonight's episode of Star Wars Rebels: Legacy of Mandalore!\n\nAfter tonight's new episode of Star Wars Rebels, fans may be questioning how much more of the show they're going to get. It had a real sense of finality, at least for the character of Sabine Wren, who left the team to go work towards uniting and freeing her people. While Lucasfilm and Disney XD remain mum on any official announcement of Star Wars Rebels Season 4, the show continuing on for at least one more year is likely. After a critically-acclaimed direct connection to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and some teased cameos and story ideas that have been talked about for some time, plus showrunner Dave Filoni teasing that Sabine will return before everything is all said and done, we should get a season 4 official announcement any day now. Until then, however, Filoni was able to address the sense of finality in this episode, and how he and his team are trying to bring this season to a close.\n\n\"I give a pretty good eye to that because I like where we got the end of last year, and it really shook things up,\" Filoni told ComicBook.com. \"Last season ending with kind of a dividing line between who the characters were and what they need to evolve into being, and I feel very good that this season drives us to a point where you can actually look and see these arcs within this season of where, say Kanan and Ezra, everyone started and where they end, and what the future may or may not hold for them. Imagining they survive, what's about to happen?\" It's something Filoni focuses on at the end of each season now more than ever before, due to his experiences with Star Wars: The Clone Wars, the first animated series he showran for Lucasfilm, which ended abruptly.\n\n\"You always have an eye on it, and it's tricky. I have to be honest. It's tricky in TV having worked on a series that frankly didn't really have an all-out end like we had planned it. I'm always a bit wary. I'm thinking, 'Okay, where do we need this to go?'\" he said. \"Because I want to make sure that we take the audience in these Star Wars stories, I think, on this really, I hope, interesting and entertaining journey, and I want them to feel that they get a complete payoff for it, and that it's the story that we intended.\" And while he wouldn't budge on any kind of sudden official announcement, he did imply heavily that the story they intended has more story to tell beyond season 3.",
  "latent_6973": "Many people were surprised by Ivanka Trump’s performance in Berlin. Contrary to the stereotype, the daughter of the US President made a sophisticated and level-headed impression at the panel discussion with Chancellor Angela Merkel, Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, and head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde. The glamorous White House ambassador also cleverly handled a controversial issue.\n\nUS media, however, are focusing on something else: they claim that Ivanka was booed and sneered at. BILD clarifies:\n\nAt the “Women20 Summit”, there was in fact a moment during the panel discussion when the audience began murmuring. Panel moderator Miriam Meckel asked Ivanka whether she was speaking as the First Lady – in Melania Trump’s place – or as the new advisor to the President. Ivanka replied in a disarmingly honest way: „This role is quite new to me, it has been little under 100 days.” She said that she would be happy to bring what she learned here home with her and that she would discuss it with her father.\n\nShe also said: “I am very proud of my father. Long before he came into the presidency, he has been a tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive.”\n\nAt this point, there was some unrest in the audience. There was no booing or heckling at all, however.\n\nAuch Interessant\n\nUS media are outraged about the audience’s reaction\n\nThis makes it even more surprising that US media are painting an entirely different picture of Ivanka’s appearance in Berlin. The murmuring that could be heard as Ivanka defended her father against criticism was interpreted as massive booing of the President’s daughter.\n\nThe alleged hostility toward Ivanka during her visit to Berlin was a lead headline at US outlets such as ABC, CNN, and Fox, along with several major newspapers.\n\nIn a discussion broadcast by the Trump-friendly TV station Fox on Tuesday night (local time), the audience of the Berlin event was heavily criticized. A report on the Fox website featured the headline: “Germans jeer Ivanka Trump for defending her father”.\n\nGroup selfie time before the High Level Panel at #W20summit in #Berlin with Chancellor Merkel and Queen Máxima of the Netherlands pic.twitter.com/GvyvH9eMhH — miriam meckel (@mmeckel) 25. April 2017\n\nThe fact is: Miriam Meckel pointed out that some of Trump’s past utterances with respect to women do raise doubts about whether he in fact supports the empowerment of women.\n\nIn the US, it would be rather unusual to pose such a critical question to the President’s daughter. Ivanka, however, reacted with confidence.\n\nShe stated that she did of course follow the media reports about this issue. She also emphasized that her own experience and the fact that “thousands of women” have been working with, and for, Donald Trump for decades when he was in the private sector “are a testament to his belief and solid conviction in the potential of women and their ability to do the job as well as any man”.\n\nShe herself grew up in a liberal household, said Trump’s daughter. “There was no barrier to what I could accomplish beyond my own perseverance and my own tenacity. There was no difference between me and my brothers.”\n\nObservers and participants agree that the relaxed mood at the summit in Berlin on Tuesday was somewhat rare.\n\nEven the Chancellor seemed to be more relaxed than usual, as did the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, who often makes a tough impression. The great women of world politics welcomed the White House envoy with open arms – and the latter clearly seemed to enjoy herself, laughing, joking, and whispering.\n\nDuring the joint dinner, Merkel and the “First Daughter” also seemed to get along splendidly.\n\nMerkel explicitly thanked the presidential advisor on Tuesday night for her participation in the W20 Summit. “I am very happy that you travelled to Germany. I hope that we were a good audience for you and that you can also travel back with some new ideas,” the Chancellor said during dinner on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Chancellor also promised Ivanka Trump that her idea for a new loan programme for women in emerging countries will be part of the German G20 presidency.\n\nThe brief wave of criticism during the podium discussion did not taint the further course of the debate and the subsequent talks with Chancellor Merkel in the slightest. On the contrary – Ivanka Trump has proven that she can also confidently handle delicate questions.\n\nPS: Sind Sie bei Facebook? Werden Sie Fan von BILD.de-Politik!",

  "latent_7185": "In South Africa, conservationists have had to come up with new and more innovative ways to prevent poachers from killing the local rhinoceros for their horns. Enter the Rhino Rescue Project.\n\nThe trade in rhino horns is immensely profitable; rhinos are huge but not particularly hard to kill, since they need a lot of water and can be reliably found at watering holes. The horns are powdered and used in traditional Chinese medicine, prescribed for fevers and convulsions (not as an aphrodisiac, as is sometimes thought). So the Rhino Rescue Project began investigating something unorthodox: why not make the horns unusable as medicine?\n\nThere's a multi-pronged method here. Materials are not exactly injected but rather, as the Rhino Rescue Project says, \"infused into the horn using a patented high-pressure device.\" No more detail is given about how that works. But the device uses a dye which turns the horn brightly and irrevocably pink, kind of like the dye used in ink packs to secure money at a bank. That makes it useless as a prize or ornament, and even if the horn is ground to a fine powder, it'll still show up in an airport security scanner. Three separate GPS chips are implanted into the horn, kind of like this older project--it's worth mentioning here that a rhino's horn is made of keratin, just like your fingernails, and the animal feels no pain during any of this. And the dye has no adverse health effects on the rhino.\n\nIn the future, the project even plans to add poison--ectoparasiticides, to be exact, which are damaging to neither the rhino nor any animal in the rhino's ecosystem, like ox-pecker birds. But for humans, it's pretty toxic, causing extreme nausea, vomiting, convulsions, and more. So: make it non-desirable to poach (by making it pink), make it hard to move (because it's pink, also because of the GPS trackers and the dye's visibility in scanners), and then make it useless for medicine (because it'll make you sick).\n\nThe project is still in the testing phase, but it's very promising stuff.\n\n[via PSFK]",

  "latent_7310": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nThis story was originally published by Grist and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nThis is going to sound weird, but there’s a wildfire right now in west Greenland. You know, that huge island of mostly ice? Part of it is on fire.\n\nThere’s been nothing even close to this since reliable satellite-based fire detection records began in Greenland in 2000. Very small wildfires can evade satellite detection, and old-timer scientists who have worked in Greenland for decades say that micro-fires there aren’t necessarily uncommon.\n\nThis week’s fire, however, is on another level.\n\n“This is the largest wildfire we know of,” says Stef Lhermitte, a satellite expert at Technische Universiteit in Delft, Netherlands, who did some of the initial mapping of the fire. “For a lot of people, it’s been a bit of discovery on the go.” The fire was first spotted by a local aircraft on July 31.\n\nThe Greenland fire evolution since July 29 as captured by @ESA_EO ‘s #sentinel2 pic.twitter.com/Iuk9blyui9 — Stef Lhermitte (@StefLhermitte) August 9, 2017\n\nWhat’s striking about the Greenland fire is that it fits a larger trend of rapid change across the northern reaches of the planet. A 2013 study found that across the entire Arctic, forests are burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years.\n\nBy American standards, the Greenland fire is small, covering around 1,200 acres (about two square miles)—about the size of midtown Manhattan. The massive Lodgepole Complex wildfire that scorched eastern Montana in July—the largest fire in the country this year—was more than 200 times bigger. But for Greenland, a fire of this size is so unusual that even scientists who study the huge island don’t really know what to make of it.\n\nThe Danish meteorological service (Greenland is technically an autonomously governing part of Denmark) said it has no experts who specialize in Greenland fire. The European Commission has tasked its Emergency Management Service with a rapid mapping of the region of the fire, in part to help local officials assess the risks to public health. Mark Parrington, a meteorologist with the European government, said on Twitter that he “didn’t expect to be adding Greenland into my fire monitoring,” adding that he may need to recalibrate his air pollution models to account for the smoldering way that fire tends to burn in permafrost soil.\n\nA meteorologist with the European government said that he “didn’t expect to be adding Greenland into my fire monitoring.”\n\nRiikka Rinnan, an ecologist at the University of Copenhagen, said her research team had started work earlier this summer on how potential fires could impact Greenland’s tundra, but didn’t expect one so soon. Jessica McCarty, a satellite data expert at Miami University in Ohio, said she’s planning to have one of her students construct what might be the first-ever comprehensive history of fires in Greenland.\n\nAnd yes, as you might expect, climate change probably made this whole thing more likely.\n\n“Everything we know suggests that fire will increase in the Arctic,” climate scientist Jason Box, whose work focuses on Greenland, told me. “It’s fair to say that it’s part of the pattern of warming. We should see more such fires in Greenland.”\n\nThough west Greenland, where the fire is burning, is a semi-arid region, rainfall and temperatures there have been increasing, helping to foster more dense vegetation. Box says this is part of the “shrubification” of the entire Arctic as temperatures warm and the growing season lengthens. Denser vegetation is making large fires more likely, in combination with the simultaneous tendency for longer and more intense droughts and the rise in thunderstorm likelihood due to erratic weather patterns.\n\nBox says he saw a fire in west Greenland back in 1999. “It’s pretty interesting for Greenland, people don’t think about it as a place where that’s possible—nor did I until I saw it with my own eyes.” Once he realized he was watching a wildfire, he said, “It was like, what the heck? What is going on?”\n\nWhat set off this blaze? The scientists I spoke with aren’t sure. The primary cause of Arctic wildfires is lightning, but a lightning storm in Greenland would have been news. Thunderstorms typically need warm, humid air for fuel, and both are in short supply so close to the world’s second largest ice sheet.\n\nAccording to John Kappelen, a Danish meteorologist, the region surrounding the fire has had well below average rainfall since June, making wildfire more likely.\n\n“This time of year, everybody’s going out and picking berries and fishing and hunting,” says Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish meteorological service who conducts frequent fieldwork in Greenland. Maybe someone in the area set a fire that grew into the big blaze. Greenland’s second largest town, Sisimiut, with a population of 5,500, is about 90 miles away.\n\nMottram says that if the fire is burning in peatland, it could rage for weeks. If the winds shift, soot from the fire could be transported up to the ice sheet, where it might speed local melting in the coming years by darkening the surface of the ice, helping it to absorb more energy from the sun. This is something that scientists like Box and Mottram are spending their careers studying, but up to now, they thought that virtually all the soot that’s making the bright white ice darker was transported there from Canada or Russia. Now, a new source may be emerging.\n\nShould wildfires like this one increase in frequency, we may have just witnessed the start of a new, scary feedback loop.",

Tune in every morning from 4am to 8am.\n\nIn March, Sega announced that their upcoming MMORPG, Phantasy Star Online 2 will be smart phone compatible and free to play. In a recent interview with Weekly Famitsu, Phantasy Star series producer, Satoshi Sakai, talked about Sega's somewhat ballsy decision.\n\nApparently, the decision to make Phantasy Star Online 2 free to play came about very early in the game's production. With the increase of free to play online social games for smart phones, the developers were worried that the public perception of online games was becoming distorted. Most free to play online games are made so that the game's full potential cannot be tapped without some monetary investment. The developers at Sega found this trend of game development that favored players who would/could pay over players who wouldn't/couldn't to be troubling and unfavorable to the game market at a whole. Said Sakai, \"By allowing a well made game like PSO to be accessible more people, we felt that we had a chance to teach people that 'This is what online RPGs are supposed to be like.'\".\n\nWhile Phantasy Star Online 2 does have some features that can be bought with money, the developers have restricted these to minor, non-essential areas, like upgrades for players' individual rooms, increased storage space, or trading features. \"There is nothing that requires payment that will take away from the intrinsic game experience if they are not purchased.\" Sakai explained.\n\nSega has always been a game developer that mixes up the pot, and while not every attempt has been successful (some, like the Dreamcast, being ahead of their time), more often than not, they manage to leave their mark. With Phantasy Star Online 2, Sega is seeking to change the online game market itself. \"We are seeking to create a business model that functions while still allowing PSO2 to remain as much of an enjoyable experience as possible.\" Sakai spoke, reflecting on the online gaming market. \"I honestly think that Sega is the only maker that is willing to go this far. Even if we fail, if we can get people to say 'They were 5 years ahead of their time' then I'll have no regrets. I believe that there's meaning in the challenge itself.\"\n\nPhantasy Star Online 2 is currently in closed beta testing, and looks absolutely beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nファミ通.com [ファミ通.com]",

Cook large steaks over large fire. Rip steaks from fire with bare hands, bite down, and allow succulent juices to dribble down chin.\n\nInstructions on how to be a smart man: Start large fire. Cook large steaks over large fire. Rip steaks from fire with bare hands, allow steaks to rest in a warm place undisturbed for 10 minutes. Bite down, and allow succulent juices to dribble down throat.\n\nThis week at The Food Lab, we're going to explore the importance of resting meat. Asides from over/under-cooking/seasoning, not resting meat properly is probably the cooking blunder that we are all most guilty of.\n\nYou mean I have to wait before I can tuck into that perfectly charred ribeye? Unfortunately, yes.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThis is a picture of a steak that was cooked in a skillet to medium rare (an internal temperature of 125°F or 51.7°C). The steak was then immediately placed on a cutting board and sliced in half, whereupon a deluge of juices started flooding out and onto the board.\n\nThe result? Steak that is less than optimally juicy and flavorful. This tragedy can be easily avoided by allowing your steak to rest before slicing.\n\nI've always been told that this happens because as one surface of the meat hits the hot pan (or grill), the juices in that surface are forced away towards the center, increasing the concentration of moisture in the middle of the steak. Once the steak gets flipped over, the same thing happens on the other side. The center of the steak becomes supersaturated with liquid—there's more liquid in there than it can hold on to—so when you slice it open, all that extra liquid pours out. By resting the steaks, you allow all that liquid that was forced out of the edges and into the center time to migrate back out to the edges.\n\nSort of makes sense, right? Imagine a steak as a big bundle of straws, each straw filled with liquid, and representing the muscle fibers. As the meat cooks, these straws start to change shape, becoming narrower, and putting pressure on the liquid inside. Since the meat cooks from the outside in, the straws are pinched most tightly at their edges, and slightly less tightly in their center. So far so good. Logically, if the edges are pinched more tightly than the center, liquid should get forced towards the middle, right?\n\nWell here's the problem: water is not compressible. In other words, if you have a two-liter bottle filled to the brim with water, it is (nearly) physically impossible to force more water into that bottle without changing the size of that bottle. Same thing with a steak.\n\nUnless we are somehow stretching the centers of the muscle fibers to make them physically wider, there is no way to force more liquid into them. You can easily prove that the muscle fibers are not getting wider by measuring the circumference around the center of a raw steak vs. a cooked one. If liquid were being forced into the center, the circumference should grow. It doesn't—it may appear to bulge, but that is only because the edges shrink, giving the illusion of a wider center.\n\nIn fact, the exact opposite is the case. Since the center of a medium-rare steak comes up to 125°F, it too is shrinking, and forcing liquid out. Where does all that liquid go?\n\nThe only place it can: out of the end of the straws—or, the surface of the steak. That sizzling noise you hear as a steak cooks? That's the sound of moisture escaping and evaporating*.\n\n* There are ways to minimize the shrinkage of muscle fibers, thus minimizing moisture loss, but that topic will be covered in a future Food Lab installment.\n\nGive That Theory a Rest\n\nSo why does an un-rested steak expel more juices than a rested one? Turns out that it all has to do with temperature.\n\nWe already know that the width of the muscle fibers is directly related to the temperature to which it is cooked, and to a degree, this change in shape is irreversible. A piece of meat that is cooked to 180°F (82.2°C) will never be able to hold on to as much liquid as it could in its raw state. But once that meat has cooled slightly, its structure relaxes—the muscle fibers widen up slightly again, and it's this small change in shape that makes all the difference.\n\nThis image shows six steaks of identical thickness that were all cooked to an internal temperature of 125°F. I sliced one steak open every 2.5 minutes and placed it on a plate to collect any juices that leaked out.\n\nHere's what's going on:\n\nAfter No Resting: The meat around the exterior of the steak (the parts that were closest to the pan) are well over 200°F (93.3°C). At this temperature range, they are pinched tightly shut, preventing them from holding on to any moisture. The center of the steak is at 125°F. While it can hold on to some of its juices at this temperature, cutting the meat fibers open is like slitting the side of a soda bottle: some juice might stay in there (mostly through surface tension), but liquid is going to spill.\n\nThe meat around the exterior of the steak (the parts that were closest to the pan) are well over 200°F (93.3°C).

While it can hold on to some of its juices at this temperature, cutting the meat fibers open is like slitting the side of a soda bottle: some juice might stay in there (mostly through surface tension), but liquid is going to spill. After 5 Minutes of Resting: The outermost layers of meat are down to around 145°F (62.8°C) and the center of the steak is still at 125°F. At this stage, the muscle fibers have relaxed a bit, stretching open a little wider. This stretching motion creates a pressure differential between the center of the muscle fiber and the ends, pulling some of the liquid out from the middle towards the edges. As a result, there is less liquid in the center of the steak. Cut it open now, and some of the liquid will still spill out, but far less than before.\n\nThe outermost layers of meat are down to around 145°F (62.8°C) and the center of the steak is still at 125°F.

After 10 Minutes of Resting: The edges of the steak have cooled all the way down to around 125°F, allowing them to suck up even more liquid from the center of the steak. What's more, the center of the steak has by this time cooled down to around 120°F, causing it to widen slightly. Cut the meat open at this stage, and the liquid will be so evenly and thinly distributed throughout the steak that surface tension is enough to keep it from spilling out on the plate.\n\nThe difference is dramatic. Just take a look at these two steaks:\n\nIn the steak on the left, all those delicious succulent juices are all over the plate. In the steak on the right, everything stays inside, right where it belongs.\n\nBut wait a minute—how do we know that those juices really are staying inside the rested steaks? Is it not possible that in the ten minutes that I've allowed it to rest that the liquid hasn't simply evaporated, leaving me with a steak that is equally un-moist?\n\nTo prove this is not the case, all you need to do is weigh the steaks before and after cooking. Aside from a minimal amount of weight loss due to rendered fat, the vast majority of weight loss comes from juices that are forced out of the meat.\n\nThe steak loses around 13 percent of its weight just during cooking. Cut it open immediately, and you lose an additional nine percent. But allow it to rest, and you can minimize this weight loss down to around an additional two percent.\n\nLarger Meats\n\nSo that's all well and good for steaks, but what about for larger cuts of meat, say a whole roasted pork loin, or a prime rib? Well, the same principles apply here too. the main difference is they need to rest for longer. How long? Well there are various rules of thumb: five minutes per inch of thickness, ten minutes per pound, half of the total cooking time, etc.\n\nBy far the easiest and most foolproof way to test if your meat has rested long enough is the same way you can tell if your meat is cooked properly: with a thermometer.\n\nIdeally, no matter how well-done you've cooked your meat, you want to allow it to cool down until the very center has reached 120°F (49°C). At this stage, the muscle fibers have relaxed enough that you should have no problem with losing juices. As shown in the graph, In a 1.5-inch-thick steak, this translates to around 10 minutes. For a prime rib, this may take as long as 45 minutes.\n\nCongratulations: Your meat is now seven percent more delicious!\n\nContinue here for Pan-seared Steaks with Red Wine Pan Sauce »\n\nGet the Recipe Pan-Seared Steaks with Red Wine Pan Sauce View Recipe »\n\nThis post may contain links to Amazon or other partners; your purchases via these links can benefit Serious Eats.

  "latent_7559": "EVEN if the new headquarters that Apple is creating in California does not prove to be “the best office building in the world”, as Steve Jobs boasted shortly before his death in 2011, it will be an astounding sight. The main building resembles a flying saucer with a hole in the middle. Through its large, gently curving windows, workers will eventually look out on a wood containing some 7,000 carefully chosen trees. It is as though a race of high-tech beings has landed on a pristine planet.\n\nAnd then, unfortunately, there’s the car park. For 14,000 workers, Apple is building almost 11,000 parking spaces. Many cars will be tucked under the main building, but most will cram into two enormous garages to the south. Tot up all the parking spaces and the lanes and ramps that will allow cars to reach them, and it is clear that Apple is allocating a vast area to stationary vehicles. In all, the new headquarters will contain 318,000 square metres of offices and laboratories. The car parks will occupy 325,000 square metres.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nApple is building 11,000 parking spaces not because it wants to but because Cupertino, the suburban city where the new headquarters is located, demands it. Cupertino has a requirement for every building. A developer who wants to put up a block of flats, for example, must provide two parking spaces per apartment, one of which must be covered. For a fast-food restaurant, the city demands one space for every three seats; for a bowling alley, seven spaces per lane plus one for every worker. Cupertino’s neighbours have similar rules. With such a surfeit of parking, most of it free, it is little wonder that most people get around Silicon Valley by car, or that the area has such appalling traffic jams.\n\nParking can seem like the most humdrum concern in the world. Even planners, who thrill to things like zoning and floor-area ratios, find it unglamorous. But parking influences the way cities look, and how people travel around them, more powerfully than almost anything else. Many cities try to make themselves more appealing by building cycle paths and tram lines or by erecting swaggering buildings by famous architects. If they do not also change their parking policies, such efforts amount to little more than window-dressing. There is a one-word answer to why the streets of Los Angeles look so different from those of London, and why neither city resembles Tokyo: parking.\n\nFor as long as there have been cars, there has been a need to store them when they are not moving—which, these days, is about 95% of the time. Washington, DC, had a parking garage in 1907, before Ford produced its first Model T. But the most important innovation came in 1923, when Columbus, in Ohio, began to insist that builders of flats create parking spaces for the people who would live in them. “Parking minimums”, as these are known, gradually spread across America. Now, as the number of cars on the world’s roads continues to grow (see chart), they are spreading around the world.\n\nThe codes that tell developers how much parking they must provide can be wonderfully revealing of local mores. In Las Vegas, “sex novelty shops” must have at least three spaces per 1,000 square feet (93 square metres) of floor space but “adult entertainment cabarets” at least ten for the same area. Singapore insists on one space for every 500 niches in a columbarium—a place where funerary urns are stored. Chennai’s city plan calls for one parking space for every 20 square metres of marriage hall. Perhaps unwisely, the city of Swan, in Australia, has parking minimums for taverns and wineries.\n\nMight as well do the white line\n\nSome developers are happy to supply parking spaces. Ryan Shear of Property Markets Group builds expensive flats in Miami, which are often bought by Latin Americans. He sometimes creates more spaces than the city requires, because his customers desire a safe place for their precious motors. But most developers create the number of parking spaces they are compelled to build and no more. In 2004 London abolished minimum parking requirements. Research by Zhan Guo of New York University shows that the amount of parking in new residential blocks promptly plunged, from an average of 1.1 spaces per flat to 0.6 spaces. The parking minimum had boosted supply far beyond what the market demanded.\n\nWater companies are not obliged to supply all the water that people would use if it were free, nor are power companies expected to provide all the free electricity that customers might want. But many cities try to provide enough spaces to meet the demand for free parking, even at peak times. Some base their parking minimums on the “Parking Generation Handbook”, a tome produced by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. This reports how many cars are found in the free car parks of synagogues, waterslide parks and so on when they are busiest.\n\nThe harm caused begins with the obvious fact that parking takes up a lot of room. A typical space is 12-15 square metres; add the necessary access lanes and the space per car roughly doubles. For comparison, this summer The Economist will move into a building in central London where it is assumed each employee will have ten square metres of space. In cities, such as Kansas City (see map), where land is cheap, and surface parking the norm, central areas resemble asphalt oceans dotted with buildings.\n\nKerb your enthusiasm\n\nThe more spread out and car-oriented a city, as a result of enormous car parks, the less appealing walking and cycling become. Besides, if you know you can park free wherever you go, why not drive? The ever-growing supply of free parking in America is one reason why investments in public transport have coaxed so few people out of cars, says David King of Arizona State University. In 1990, 73% of Americans got to work by driving alone, according to the census. In 2014, after a ballyhooed urban revival and many expensive tram and rapid-bus projects, 76% drove.\n\nThe rule of thumb in America is that multi-storey car parks cost about $25,000 per space and underground parking costs $35,000. Donald Shoup, an authority on parking economics, estimates that creating the minimum number of spaces adds 67% to the cost of a new shopping centre in Los Angeles if the car park is above ground and 93% if it is underground. Parking requirements can also make redevelopment impossible. Converting an old office building into flats generally means providing the parking spaces required for a new block of flats, which is likely to be difficult. The biggest cost of parking minimums may be the economic activity they prevent.\n\nFree parking is not, of course, really free. The costs of building the car parks, as well as cleaning, lighting, repairing and securing them, are passed on to the people who use the buildings to which they are attached. Restaurant meals and cinema tickets are more pricey; flats are more expensive; office workers are presumably paid less. Everybody pays, whether or not they drive. And that has an unfortunate distributional effect, because young people drive a little less than the middle-aged and the poor drive less than the rich. In America, 17% of blacks and 12% of Hispanics who lived in big cities usually took public transport to work in 2013, whereas 7% of whites did. Free parking represents a subsidy for older people that is paid disproportionately by the young and a subsidy for the wealthy that is paid by the poor.\n\nA few crowded American cities, including San Francisco, have watered down their parking minimums. One shrinking city (Buffalo, in New York state) has abolished them entirely. But most of the country seems to be stuck with a hugely costly and damaging solution to the parking problem. And the American approach to parking is spreading to some of the world’s fastest-growing cities.\n\nIn China, cars park everywhere—in marked spaces, in places where parking is specifically banned, in bicycle lanes, on pavements. In some cities, the fight for parking spaces has become so intense that people install metal barriers to which only they have the key, or persuade their parents to reserve spaces by sitting in them. Beijing’s streets are patrolled by orange-jacketed workers who, in theory, put slips of paper on car windows to mark when the vehicles arrive, and then collect money from drivers when they leave (they also assist novice drivers in the tricky art of parallel parking). In practice, the parking wardens give discounts to drivers who forgo receipts, then pocket the money. Some also make cash from illegal parking spaces.\n\nBeijing’s parking minimums were laid down in 2003, before driving took off, and are modest: just 0.3 spaces per flat in the city centre and 0.5 outside it. They are expected to rise in response to the growing chaos on the streets. Most Indian planners concur that the best way of ameliorating a shortage is to require more off-street parking, says Shreya Gadepalli of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, a think-tank. One reason, she suggests, is that so many of them studied at American universities.\n\nWhether in America or Asia, oceans of free parking might delay a transport revolution. When autonomous cars that are allowed to move with nobody inside them become widespread, demand for private cars could fall sharply. Starting in the morning, one car could take a child to school, a city worker to his office, a student to her lecture, party people to a club, and a security guard to his night shift, all more cheaply than taxis. Cars that now sit idle could become much more active, which would drastically change parking needs.\n\nParking garages would still be needed in a driverless world, predicts Sean Behr, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Instead of storing vehicles for hours at a time, though, garages might become service centres where shared battery-powered cars could be cleaned, repaired and recharged before being sent back on the road. “We will need better facilities for a smaller number of vehicles,” he suggests. These garages need not be in city centres. In the slow hours of mid-morning and early afternoon, driverless cars could trundle to industrial estates in suburbia. Much of the area now allocated to cars in city centres could be turned into homes, offices or parks.\n\nMr Shear is already building flats with drop-off and pick-up areas, to accommodate people who travel by Uber cars. In a radically driverless future, he could perhaps do away with many of his parking spaces. But only if consumers decide to forgo car ownership—and whether they do is connected to parking. Where spaces are expensive, shared vehicles that need not be parked are highly attractive. They are less attractive in cities where parking is plentiful and free, such as Miami.\n\nUnlike Africa and Asia, European streets are for the most part well-policed. Although some cities have parking requirements, these are seldom as extravagant as American ones, and have been progressively weakened. Several cities even have parking maximums, which restrict the amount of spaces. Huge buildings rise with hardly any provision for cars: the Shard in London has 95 storeys but just 48 spaces. Yet European cities are much kinder to cars than they usually admit.\n\nTo ride in one of Amsterdam’s “scan cars” is to witness the epitome of Western parking enforcement. As it moves through the streets, clicking noises confirm that roof-mounted cameras are snapping the number plates of every parked car. If any vehicle has overstayed—which the system knows because Amsterdam’s parking meters are connected to a database, and drivers are required to enter their number plates when they pay—a second officer is alerted. He rides to the scene on a moped and issues a digital fine. Amsterdam’s parking officers describe their system as fair. They mean it is so ruthlessly efficient that it cannot be beaten.\n\nJust the ticket\n\nAmsterdam charges up to €5 ($5.30) an hour for parking on the street. Visitors can also park underneath office buildings or in large, clean park-and-ride garages run by the city. Drivers thus have many choices and the city raises a lot of money—€190m in 2015. Yet this diverse, market-based system covers only a small slice of parking in Amsterdam. Three-quarters of spaces on the streets of the city centre are occupied not by visitors or commuters but by residents. And the people of Amsterdam, who are so keen on pricing parking for others, would not dream of exposing themselves to market forces.\n\nAnybody who lives in a home without a dedicated space is entitled to buy a permit to park nearby for between €30 and €535 a year. This is a good deal and, not surprisingly, the number of takers in many districts exceeds the number of spaces. So Amsterdam has waiting lists for permits. The longest, in the Westerpark area, is 232 months long. To free more spaces, the city has begun to reimburse permit-holders part of the annual fee if they keep their cars in suburban garages. Take-up is encouraging—which suggests that, despite the long queues, many people do not prize the opportunity to park close to their homes.\n\nIt’s a sign of the times in Kolkata\n\nA more obvious solution would be to charge more for permits. But that is politically fraught. Amsterdammers believe they have a right to park near their homes, explains Pieter Litjens, the deputy mayor in charge of transport. (They also believe they should be able to leave their bicycles absolutely anywhere for nothing, which is another headache.) So the queues for permits are likely to grow. Amsterdam expects to build 50,000 more homes before 2025, which will mean between 20,000 and 30,000 more cars.\n\nEven more than in America’s sprawling cities, car parking in Amsterdam is unsightly. “The canals are beautiful, and cars are parked along them all the time,” laments Mr Litjens. The city would love to sweep them away, but that would be unpopular. So in one district, De Pijp, a bold (and expensive) remedy is under way. Engineers have drained a canal and are digging an underground garage with 600 parking spaces into the marshy ground beneath. When the car park is finished and sealed, the canal will be refilled with water. The city will then abolish 273 parking spaces on the streets above.\n\nOther cities lauded for their excellent public transport and enthusiasm for market-based solutions to traffic problems also have a blind spot when it comes to residents’ parking. Much of inner London, for example, is covered with residents’ parking zones. The permits are often even cheaper than in Amsterdam: Kensington and Chelsea charges between £80 ($100) and £219 a year for the right to park anywhere in the borough and on the fringe of nearby Westminster. Visitors, on the other hand, must pay between £1.20 and £4.60 an hour. Given that the average home in Kensington and Chelsea sold for £1.9m last year, residents’ parking represents a gift to some of Britain’s richest people.\n\nDespite being the home of Lyft and Uber, two car-sharing services, San Francisco is similarly generous. It charges just $127 a year for residents’ permits. Unlike Amsterdam, though, San Francisco does not cap the number, and in some neighbourhoods one and a half are issued for every parking space. The result is a perpetual scrap for empty kerb. A survey in 2015 found that 53% of permit-holders had spent at least five minutes looking for a space at the end of their most recent trip, and 7% more than half an hour.\n\nAs San Francisco’s infuriated drivers cruise around, they crowd the roads and pollute the air. This is a widespread hidden cost of under-priced street parking. Mr Shoup has estimated that cruising for spaces in Westwood village, in Los Angeles, amounts to 950,000 excess vehicle miles travelled per year. Westwood is tiny, with only 470 metered spaces.\n\nThere is, however, one exception to the rule that residential parking must never be subjected to market forces. In the 1950s, when it was still far from rich, Japan began to require city-dwellers who did not have parking spaces in their buildings to purchase them. These days anybody who wishes to buy a car must first show a receipt for a space. He or she had better use it: any vehicle without one left on the roadside will be removed by the police in the middle of the night.\n\nParking brake\n\nFreed of cars, the narrow residential streets of Tokyo are quieter than in other big cities. Every so often a courtyard or spare patch of land has been turned into a car park—some more expensive than others. Takaomi Kondoh, who works for a firm that manages buildings and car parks, explains that prices are usually higher close to transport hubs, because commuters compete for those spaces. Near the central station in Tama, a suburb, the going rate is ¥17,000 per month ($150). Ten minutes’ walk away it drops to ¥10,000.\n\nOnce you become accustomed to the idea that city streets are only for driving and walking, and not for parking, it is difficult to imagine how it could possibly be otherwise. Mr Kondoh is so perplexed by an account of a British suburb, with its kerbside commons, that he asks for a diagram. Your correspondent tries to draw his own street, with large rectangles for houses, a line representing the kerb and small rectangles showing all the parked cars. The small rectangles take up a surprising amount of room.\n\nCorrection (April 21st): This article was amended to reflect the fact that San Francisco has not abolished parking minimums city-wide. It has selectively reduced them.",
  "latent_7564": "10.9k SHARES Facebook Twitter Linkedin Reddit\n\nGuinness World Records, an organisation journalling the extraordinary (and often insane) stunts people will pull for notoriety, and now the book has its first virtual reality entry. Watch as Derek Westerman swaps reality for Tilt Brush inside the HTC Vive and stays there for 25 hours straight.\n\nIt’s a desire most of us hold, to do something extraordinary in life. For the most part however, we’re generally content to achieve this by parenting children, going bungee jumping or backpacking around Europe. But there are a select few for whom only documented proof of their unique abilities and/or achievements is enough – they’re the record breakers, as documented since 1955 by Guinness World Records.\n\nDerek Westerman from Super Deluxe, a YouTube collective dedicated to making “Funny and smart videos from funny and smart weirdos who are probably a lot like you”, now joins that somewhat elite (and sometimes dubious) collective. As of April 7th, he holds the Guinness World Record for the longest continuous virtual reality session, and he did it all whilst immersed ‘in’ a single application over a 25 hour period.\n\nBut why? Westerman elucidates for us. “While many people, especially gamers, have spent a lot of time in Virtual Reality, it seemed important to set an official Guinness record with our current “excited-about-VR” climate, so we essentially had an official bench mark to beat.”\n\nVirtual reality has been around a while, but only available in consumer form for a matter of weeks. Therefore this ‘new’ technology is undergoing its largest field test ever, as more and more people receive headsets. No one really knows just what the use of VR over extended periods does to a person, simply because headsets have never been numerous or accessible enough to gain a large enough sample size. That Derek Westerman tried and succeeded in his bid – to spend a continuous 25 hours in virtual reality, without removing his HTC Vive headset – and without going ‘bat shit insane’, is encouraging. “As time goes on, more and more people will be spending a lot more time in Virtual Reality — essentially living in it. And I wanted to be a part of the start of that process,” says Westerman.\n\nAnd whilst some of you out there may positively relish the thought of that kind of time to indulge in your hobby, consider one thing; Derek was only allowed to use a single application for the entire 25 hour stint, Tilt Brush. As incredible as the VR painting app is, he was still stuck for over a day in its grey void with only his digital, virtual creations for company. “Guinness has a whole set of rules and regulations, one of those being ‘one game only the whole time’. I wanted to pick something that gave me the most freedom,” Westerman says, “And painting in 3D space for 25 hours seemed like the best bet.”\n\nInterestingly, Westerman realised that the key to ensuring time didn’t drag horrendously was to engage his creativity, with that in mind, Tilt Brush may well have been a very smart choice after all. That said, judging by Derek’s artistic output towards the end of the mammoth VR stint, I’m concerned as to which reality he may now have accepted as permanent. “There is a definitely a difference between my life before and after spending days in Virtual Reality. I was marked by it. And now, in an exciting way, everything feels slightly superficial or unreal.”",

In the challenge, people agree to be doused with cold water to raise research money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\nThe university band was putting on the fundraiser. The truck was parked on a street on campus near an area of student housing, Campbellsville police Chief Tim Hazlette said.\n\nGrider and Quinn sprayed water from the raised bucket of the ladder truck. After the event ended, the two firefighters were lowering the bucket when it apparently came within the threshold of electricity surrounding a high-power line, Hazlette said.\n\nThere is an area around such lines where electricity can arc to an object, said Allen Johnson, former chief of the Campbellsville fire department and the father of Alex Johnson, one of those who was injured.\n\n\"That voltage will jump feet. Not inches — feet,\" Allen Johnson said. He said he understood the power line involved carried 69,000 volts.\n\nElectricity arced from the line to the bucket, shocking and burning the men, Hazlette said. The bucket did not touch the line, he said.\n\nMarrs and Alex Johnson took control of the ladder from below and were shocked as well, but were able to lower the bucket and help Grider and Quinn, Hazlette said. No students were hurt.\n\nIt's not unusual for firefighters to help with community service events, Allen Johnson said.\n\n\"The job that we do is dangerous,\" he said. \"I hope it never happens, nowhere, to a firefighter again.\"\n\nCampbellsville Mayor Tony Young said all four hurt in the accident are dedicated firefighters. Grider, a 16-year veteran of the department, and Marrs, an 11-year veteran, also serve as paramedics, he said. Quinn is a part-time firefighter, while Johnson, also an emergency medical technician, had been employed with the department for three years, according to a news release.\n\n\"We express heartfelt sympathy and prayers for the families of the two firefighters who were injured,\" Campbellsville University President Michael V.

  "latent_7856": "China's entire fleet of 55 attack submarines conducted six patrols in 2007, up from the two the fleet conducted in 2006 and none in 2005, according to new information obtained by a scientific organization.\n\nThe information was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and posted on the Federation of American Scientists Strategic Security blog. According to the Navy, none of China's ballistic missile submarines have ever made a patrol, 25 years after the country's first nuclear missile capable submarine was built. Chinese submarines in the 1990s conducted an average of 1.2 patrols a year. FAS said the U.S. Navy's submarine fleet conducts more than 100 patrols annually.\n\nThe Navy has been faulted in some quarters for paying insufficient attention to China's growing maritime power, much of which rests on new submarines. At a House Armed Services Committee hearing Dec. 13, 2007, ranking Republican Duncan Hunter of California said the U.S. Navy risks being eclipsed by China's growing maritime power.\n\nIn an exchange with Navy chief Adm. Gary Roughead, Hunter said China was \"outstripping us by 3-1 on submarine production, and your own figures show that they are going to eclipse us in submarine numbers in 2011.\" In response, Roughead said anti-submarine warfare was a top Navy priority.\n\nWhile the Chinese submarine inventory includes a number of older diesel electric boats, the country recently took delivery of eight Russian-built Kilo class, non-nuclear powered submarines, according to the Congressional Research Service. China is building four classes of new submarines including a nuclear powered attack submarine and a nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine, and was expected to have 28 relatively modern submarines in its inventory by 2006.\n\nYet, China's low submarine patrol numbers would appear to call into question the level of training of its submarine crews and the capability of the its submarine fleet to operate much beyond the nation's coastal waters.\n\nThe U.S. Navy currently operates 53 nuclear-powered attack submarines, twice as many as the rest of the world combined, and is building its newest attack submarine -- the nuclear-powered Virginia class -- at the rate of one per year. The service also maintains a fleet of anti-submarine warfare aircraft that has no equal.\n\nThe Navy's annual funding of $137 billion dwarfs China's entire defense budget, which was estimated at $44 billion in 2006, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nIn an analysis of relative global naval power, Robert O.

  "latent_7930": "The arbitration over a dispute about recovery of costs started in 2010\n\nThe government has sought about $3 billion from Reliance Industries, Royal Dutch Shell and ONGC following a \"partial\" arbitration award in its favour over cost recovery in Panna/Mukta and Tapti (PMT) oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea.The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) in May-end slapped the demand notice on them, which included interest and certain other charges over a gross amount it calculated following the October 2016 final partial award (FPA), sources in the government and the PMT joint venture said.The notice does not contain any date for making the payment or the consequences that would follow if the payment is not made, they said.Besides, they added, it was issued without waiting for the arbitration panel to give its final award after hearing rejoinders from the parties to the dispute and, in the last stage, quantifying the amount payable.RIL and Shell had last November challenged in English court a three-member arbitration panel headed by Singapore-based lawyer Christopher Lau's FPA upholding the government view that the profit from the fields should be calculated after deducting the prevailing tax of 33 per cent and not the 50 per cent rate that existed earlier.It also upheld that the cost recovery in the contract is fixed at $545 million in Tapti gas field and $577.5 million in Panna-Mukta oil and gas field. The two firms wanted that cost provision be raised by $365 million in Tapti and $62.5 million in Panna-Mukta.Sources said the government has joined the appeal in the English court, rendering infructuous the process of the arbitration panel giving the final award and quantifying the amount payable.\"The way arbitration works is that the panel first gives a FPA. It then gives time to parties to dispute to file appeals and hears them. The final award is then given. In the final stage, the amount payable is quantified,\" a source said. Since the judicial seat of the arbitration is at London and that the arbitration agreement is governed by the English law, any challenge to the partial award in effect puts on hold the arbitration tribunal's process.So, only after the court disposes of the appeal can the arbitration tribunal work on final award and quantification of the amount payable, the source said.He further added that if the court was to rule that the partial award was not good in law, the panel may decide not to scrap its earlier award and may even be wound-up. RIL and BG Group of UK, which held 30 per cent stake each in PMT fields, had in December 2010 initiated arbitration over a dispute about recovery of cost of operations.Shell became the operator of the field last year after taking over BG.State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which holds the remaining 40 per cent stake, had not joined the arbitration.Neither of the companies responded to emails and calls made for comments.\"Its a partial award based on which DGH has sent demand notices,\" a source said.The three-member London-based arbitration panel, to which India had named former Supreme Court judge B Sundershan Reddy as its nominee, ruled in favour of the government in some of the 69 clauses of dispute that were listed by RIL-BG combine.A few of the clauses went in favour of RIL-BG, another source said.The big-ticket issue of inclusion of certain items in the cost recovery went in favour of the government with the arbitration panel holding that RIL-BG cannot include such items.Operators are allowed to deduct all costs incurred on field operations from oil and gas produced before sharing profit with the government. Disallowing of certain items in the cost would result in higher profit petroleum for the government, he said.The official said the government also won its case for RIL-BG applying exact tax rates and not notional rates for computing statutory dues like royalty etc. Also, it had its way on inclusion of marketing margin charged over and above the wellhead price of natural gas for calculation of royalty.",

  "latent_8180": "The blind cannot see, but wilfull blindness seems important to many people, including sections of the media. A case in point is the interview given by Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar to The New York Times that talks, in passing, about 2002 and Narendra Modi’s responsibility for it.\n\nWhat got picked up and highlighted – with much tut-tutting by card-carrying secularists – was Parrikar’s statement that 2002 was a blot on Modi’s record. This part of his statement was, in fact, a tiny portion of the interview and it reads: “It (2002) should not have happened, the administration should have clamped down on any violence, [If I were in his place] I would have ensured…but Modi was new to the job as chief minister. It was a blot on Modi’s career…”.\n\nThe question is: was Parrikar really criticising Modi or merely stating facts as he saw them?\n\nI suggest that this is what anyone would have said, when asked the same question. Who would say 2002 was a great thing to happen? Who would not assign some responsibility to whoever was at the helm at that time? Even Modi has said if he was guilty of anything, “please hang me.”\n\nThe misreading of Parrikar’s argumental thrust shows how vulnerable we are to our own biases. In a short interview of seven questions published by the NYT, even the balancing parts of the answer to the same question got de-emphasised. And the more important parts of the Q&A, including parts referring to Modi and his popularity, got lost in the heat and dust generated by the singular focus on 2002.\n\nThus, The Times of India chose to headline the interview, “Gujarat riots blot on Modi’s career.” DNA chose to tomtom Parrikar’s alleged boast that he would have done better than Modi in 2002. Firstpost didn’t manage anything different either. The Indian Express offered better balance: even while highlighting the \"blot\" part of the statement, it emphasised Parrikar's point that Modi need not apologise.\n\nConsider how the NYT itself headlined the item: “A conversation with: Goa CM Manohar Parrikar”, in the India Ink section of its website. (Read the full NYT interview here).\n\nNow, let’s read some more of what Parrikar actually said about 2002 while answering the same question about the post-Godhra riots. He begins by specifically saying that Modi cannot be blamed for it fully, and that he does not even need to make an apology. “Administrative failure does not mean everything is blamed on one man, Narendra Modi. What happened then was unfortunate, but that does not require his apology, it requires his correction and he has done that. There were many reasons why people lost control in 2002 after the dead bodies (of Hindu pilgrims from an earlier attack)] were shown on TV.” (Italics mine)\n\nMore importantly, Parrikar is not coy in calling a spade a spade and points out that people believe in targeting Modi because they are afraid of his popularity. He said: “People who oppose him do so because they fear him.”\n\nAnd just in case you think this is par for the course, Parrikar, in his previous question, makes no bones about the fact that Modi is the man to lead the BJP to victory.\n\nAsked about his own candidature and the BJP’s prospects in 2014 given that it does not have too many allies, Parrikar first rules himself out and then suggests that Modi may, in fact, swing a huge majority for the BJP. He said: “There is a 5 to 6 percent vote swing in favour of the BJP, and if you map our party’s demographic, then we have the possibility of winning in 330 to 340 seats (above the 272 majority mark, and enough to ensure Mr Modi as prime minister).\n\nDoes this sound like Parrikar is baiting Modi, or that he is in the anti-Modi camp? A more interesting headline for the Parrikar interview would have been “Goa CM predicts 330 seats for BJP in 2014”. That would be saying something new, not the tired old accusations about 2002.\n\nParrikar also explains why the mood may be swinging towards Modi: “Today the scenario in the country is a (Congress party-led) regime that is not delivering, a regime where the prime minister (Manmohan Singh) is seen as a lameduck. The government has to be pragmatic and get things done, but this government is incapable of doing it, it’s in a perpetual state of suspension. In these circumstances, particularly young people see an alternative model in Modi, and if they want him as prime minister they will have to elect his local representative….I believe a national mood is forming to put the BJP in power and Modi as prime minister.”\n\nAn even more interesting headline, in fact, would be about what Parrikar thinks about the term “Hindu nationalist” – a term for which Modi was routinely pilloried.\n\nParrikar was asked: “You are seen as the moderate face of the Hindu right, but where do you see yourself ideologically? Are you a Hindu nationalist?”\n\nHis reply: “I am a perfect Hindu, but that is my personal faith, it has nothing to do with government. India is a Hindu nation in the cultural sense..A Catholic in Goa is also Hindu culturally, because his practices don’t match with Catholics in Brazil, except in the religious aspect, a Goan Catholic’s way of thinking and practice matches a Hindu’s. So Hindu for me is not a religious term, it is cultural. I am not the Hindu nationalist as understood by some TV media – not one who will take out a sword and kill a Muslim. According to me that is not Hindu behaviour at all. Hindus don’t attack anyone, they only do so for self-defense - that is our history. But in the right sense of the term, I am a Hindu nationalist.”\n\nIn short, when Modi says he is a Hindu nationalist, we think the worst of him, but when Parrikar says more or less the same, with different nuancing, he is a moderate Hindu, a secular Hindu.\n\nThe media has also been busy reporting how there is an anti-Modi camp comprising LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Shivraj Singh Chouhan of Madhya Pradesh, but the last-named anti-Modi camper has already tweeted that he does not oppose Modi’s candidature.\n\nAs for the other two, they make a psychological difference to the BJP’s internal dynamics, but will have no veto on the party’s final decision on naming Modi as its PM candidate, or impact the party's poll prospects. The national mood, as Parikkar explains, is about Modi, and even if Advani campaigns against Modi, it won’t dent the BJP. People will see through the game of trying to suddenly glorifying Advani, once seen as the villain of 1992, just to spite Modi.\n\nThe only people whose views count are those of the BJP's chief ministers, who worry not about Modi’s prime ministerial ambitions, but his early projection, which will then reduce their own stature in their poll-bound states. Remember, Chouhan, Vasundhara Raje and Raman Singh are fighting highly local battles, and conversion of the vote into a national referendum on Modi does not help them at all.\n\nOr, at least, they think so. The media is unable to see what they are really trying to say, and imagines that there is a huge anti-Modi plananx inside the BJP. Sure, there is resistance, but this is the resistance of the weak and irrelevant. Papers tigers were not meant to roar. They will melt away sooner than you can say Narendra Modi.\n\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

  "latent_8352": "This is the ninth in a series of blogs looking at South Korea’s foreign relations for the new Korean administration. The series also includes blogs on relations with North Korea, China, the United States, Japan, the European Union, ASEAN, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.\n\nBy Jenna Gibson\n\nAs a candidate and since he has taken office, Moon Jae-In has paid little attention to Russia, and the few comments he has made have revolved almost entirely around Moscow’s role in North Korea denuclearization talks.\n\nAccording to a policy book released ahead of the election, Moon intends to develop a “strategic partnership” with Russia, which consists of two points: “Strengthen the cooperation to resolve North Korea nuclear issue and develop ROK-DPRK-Russia cooperation accordingly,” and “Expand economic cooperation such as co-developing the North Pole Route, energy, etc.”\n\nIn a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 12, Moon focused on the first point, emphasizing a need to work together with Russian on the DPRK issue and return to the negotiating table, according to a YTN report. And he named lawmaker and former Incheon mayor Song Young-gil, who has received an award from the Russian government for increasing exchanges between the two countries, as his special envoy to Moscow.\n\nBut critics have pointed out that Moon seems to be de-prioritizing the Russian relationship. In his inaugural address, for example, he said “I will not rest until peace is settled on the Korean Peninsula. I will fly to Washington, Beijing and Tokyo, if needed, and I will also go to Pyongyang, if conditions are met.” Note that he has mentioned visiting five of the Six Party Talks member countries – but there is no mention of Russia in the entire speech.\n\nThis oversight likely won’t play well in Moscow, at least according to a forthcoming paper on Russia’s view toward North Korea sanctions by the Carnegie Endowment’s Alexander Gabuev, which he recently presented at KEI.\n\n“A lot of Russian policy is driven by this very emotional feeling of making Russia great again, making Russia seen as an international big player,” he said. So if Russia is sidestepped through things like unilateral sanctions (or being omitted in a policy speech about DPRK policy), that will not play well in Moscow.\n\nFurther, Russia’s goals on the peninsula may be fundamentally different than what Moon has in mind. “Since military strikes on North Korean facilities or removing the leadership is not an option, there is not so much Russia can do to stop it,” Gabuev said, “So literally we pay lip service to the denuclearization mantra, but in real terms Russia doesn’t see it as a realistic option, or as a threat.”\n\nIn order to move forward, President Moon must be careful to include Russia in his strategy and public statements about denuclearization, especially if he maintains his stated goal of resuming the Six Party Talks. And he must also be thinking about how to use Russia’s position of cautious cooperation on the North Korea issue to his advantage.\n\nOne of the ways Moon can do this is to lean more heavily on the second point laid out in his policy paper – increasing cooperation with on the economic front. According to Russia scholar Stephen Blank, Russia’s North Korea policy is intrinsically tied to economics, as he wrote in a KEI paper in 2015. “The fundamental purpose of Russia’s Korean policy is to preserve peace in Korea and Asia generally, as peace is indispensable to any development of Siberia and the RFE [Russian Far East] on the basis of foreign and domestic trade and investment.”\n\nIf President Moon can harness this goal, he can simultaneously fulfill his pledge of remaining open to more engagement with Pyongyang while also giving Moscow more incentive to lean harder on denuclearization.\n\nRussia plays a unique role in the international community when it comes to dealing with North Korea. While Moscow and Beijing generally agree on the imperative of maintaining stability above all else, Russia also feels an underlying need to assert its position at the table to be seen as an important international player. For President Moon Jae-In, keeping this second piece in mind will be key to working with the international community as he begins to shape his North Korea policy.\n\nJenna Gibson is the Director of Communications at the Korea Economic Institute of America.

  "latent_8414": "Diana Walker for TIME U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton records interviews for American TV shows in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Oct. 23, 2011.\n\nHillary Clinton argues in our cover story this week, now available online to subscribers, that America is not so much in decline as adjusting to a world of increasingly diffuse power, where like-minded networked individuals, non-governmental organizations and other non-traditional global actors may steer events as much as great power capitals. Clinton lays out “smart power” strategies for protecting and advancing U.S. interests in that new non-polar world.\n\nWe argue that Clinton is something of an expert at coming up with strategies for maximizing limited power given her life experiences, including being a First Lady with high visibility but little official swat, and a Secretary of State in the administration of her former rival, President Obama, who makes the final call on most major foreign policy and national security decisions with a small group of aides at the White House—and without Clinton.\n\nThe story is told largely through the lens of the very limited war in Libya, which is in many ways Clinton’s war, thanks to her efforts lining up the Arab and European coalitions that fought it. We have some good reporting on her trip there last week, as well as on the internal and external challenges she faced in advancing the cause of intervention. We also lay out the ways in which Libya remains dangerously unpredictable, and underscore areas where her new strategies are more talk than action.\n\nLastly, we polled her against Romney and Perry, and found that she does better, by far, than Obama, leading Romney by 17 points and Perry by 26*. Her closest aides strongly dismiss any 2012 ambitions and say 2016 is very unlikely: she’d be 69 the day of the vote that year. We don’t speculate on the source of her popularity.\n\nOne item that came up in research but didn’t fit with the piece. Clinton has been talking about the limits of power from her first moment on the public stage–her rambling, idealistic speech to the graduating class of 1969 at Wellesley. In it, she refers to her favorite passage from T.S. Eliot’s “East Coker” about trying again and again in the face of resistance. It’s not my favorite poem—I like my inter-war humanism without the religious overlay. But it gives a sense of just how long Clinton has been thinking about power and how to leverage it:\n\n…What there is to conquer By strength and submission, has already been discovered Once or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope To emulate—but there is no competition— There is only the fight to recover what has been lost And found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions That seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss. For us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business.\n\n*A national poll conducted for TIME on Oct. 9 and 10 found that if Clinton were the Democratic nominee for President in 2012, she would best Mitt Romney 55% to 38%, Rick Perry 58% to 32% and Herman Cain 56% to 34% among likely voters in a general election. The same poll found that President Obama would edge Romney by just 46% to 43%, Perry by 50% to 38% and Cain by 49% to 37% among likely voters.",
  "latent_8573": "Highly sensitive people have been labeled a lot of ways in the past, like fragile, over-emotional and intense. But there's more to a highly sensitive person than just excess crying and a whole ton of feelings.\n\nThose with an empathetic personality are actually biologically wired to behave the way that they do. As a result, they also have an entirely different approach to to their physical environment -- and that isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nBelow are just a few ways highly sensitive people interact differently with the world around them than their \"thick-skinned\" counterparts.\n\nThey're easily overstimulated by their surroundings.\n\nLoud noises, big decisions and large crowds don't bode well for HSPs without a little downtime to balance them out. This is because they have a very active emotional response, according to Elaine Aron, author of The Highly Sensitive Person and one of the original scientific researchers of the personality trait.\n\n\"The reason this happens is because they're processing everything around them so thoroughly,\" Aron told The Huffington Post. HSPs process their surroundings or life events based on emotions. In other words, the more overwhelming their circumstances get, the more deeply they feel.\n\nThey pick up on the subtleties in a room.\n\nDid you rearrange your living room? Did your spouse make you upset at a dinner party? Sensitive folks can sense many subtle shifts, whether they're tangible items or emotional moods, Aron says. \"There's just this intuition they have about their environment that other people generally aren't aware of,\" she explained.\n\nThat intuition also guides them in their own relationships as well. HSPs notice different attitudes that may not be picked up on by other people. So if you're using different language or texting more abrasively than normal (think periods instead of exclamation points), chances are a HSP is going to take note.\n\nThey're more emotional in their relationships.\n\nHSPs crave deep connections. According to Aron's research, sensitive people tend to get more bored in marriages than non-HSP couples, mostly due to the lack of meaningful interaction that naturally occurs as time goes on. However, this isn't necessarily bad news. Aron says that the lack of meaning doesn't mean an HSP is going to abandon ship -- it's only going to motivate them to have more stimulating conversations.\n\nThe key to a successful relationship for an HSP is communicating what they want out of a relationship and finding a partner that understands their emotions are part of their nature. \"Sensitive people can't help but expressing what they're feeling,\" she said. \"They show their anger, they show their happiness. Appreciating that is really important.\"\n\nSometimes they prefer to fly solo.\n\nHSPs function best when they're in quieter environments -- particularly in the workplace, according to Aron. \"Open office plans aren't productive for them in most cases,\" she says. This preference to operate alone may even go for leisure activities outside of the office. HSPs may also avoid group sports or physical activities because they feel like their every move is scrutinized, Ted Zeff, a researcher and author of several books on highly sensitive personality traits, previously told HuffPost.\n\nThey might be more sensitive to caffeine or alcohol.\n\nThis certainly isn't always the case, but Aron says on average HSPs may have more of a sensitivity to stimulants like caffeine or substances like alcohol, based on self-tests she's conducted for her research. HSPs are also more easily bothered by hunger, she said.\n\nThey get anxious around conflict.\n\nConflict is a tough road to navigate for HSPs, according to Aron. They have two approaches to dealing with it, and those ideas are often at war with each other. \"Sensitive people get torn between speaking up for what they feel is right or sitting back because they don't want a violent type of reaction [from others],\" Aron said. \"They're very sensitive to environments where they're being judged for their sensitivity or for anything else.\"\n\nOn the other hand, HSPs have a way of managing disagreements in a rational way. Because of their high levels of empathy, sensitive folks can often put themselves in the other person's position and see their side of the argument, Aron explained.",
  "latent_8577": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday held a rare town hall event in New Hampshire that looked a lot like a trial run for Sunday’s second presidential debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut the softball questions selected from a Trump-friendly crowd offered little practice for a nominee who desperately needs to overcome his widely panned performance in last week’s debate.\n\nTrump rarely appears before small audiences, preferring raucous campaign rallies in large arenas, so Thursday’s town hall provided him an opportunity to practice speaking in a more intimate setting and to prepare for Sunday’s town hall-style event with Clinton.\n\nThe GOP nominee insisted that Thursday’s gathering, moderated by conservative radio host Howie Carr, a Trump supporter, “has nothing to do with Sunday.”\n\nMike Segar / Reuters\n\nHe was correct.\n\nThe event lasted just over 30 minutes, and the questions, selected from an invitation-only crowd, were complete softballs, bearing little resemblance to what he will encounter from moderators Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz, and audience members during Sunday’s debate.\n\nSunday’s matchup is crucial for Trump. He had been closing in on Clinton until his poor performance in last week’s debate, which appears to have cost him dearly in polls. He now trails Clinton by more than 6 percentage points, according to HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates all available public polls.\n\nHere is a sampling of questions put to Trump in New Hampshire:\n\n“What would you say to convince Hispanics who are deceived by Obama, Clinton and the biased media to vote for you?”\n\n“How will you win over the conservative holdouts not on the bandwagon?”\n\n“What advice would you give to young Americans looking to achieve the American Dream?”\n\n“What is your favorite childhood memory? Go Donald.”\n\nTrump fielded a question on how he would fix the VA health care system from Al Baldasaro, his adviser on veterans issues.

We recognize the decision greatly affects other teams, especially Purdue. It is not our intention to slight them or their performance this season. We know the feeling of doing the work necessary to earn a bid in the regular season, only to have it made unavailable. And it’s a tough situation. We wish Purdue the best of luck in the Series this year.\n\nDuring the decision making process, we contemplated the various pros and cons of attending the conference championship, as has been discussed at length in the community. Our team has a long-term goal of attending the National Championship tournament, and we feel attending our conference championships this year gives us the best chance to one day achieve that goal.\n\nIn the coming days, we’ll be requesting any accommodations or considerations from USA Ultimate regarding the forfeiture rules and that might allow for us to advance to subsequent rounds of the College Championship Series, should we perform well enough at Conference Championships, per rule III.B.11.a.iv of the 2017 Season Guidelines.",
  "latent_8680": "Like drugs, genes can be harmful at the wrong dose. Down Syndrome is caused by a gene-dose problem: patients carry three copies of chromosome 21, instead of two, giving them toxic levels of hundreds of genes that are best had only in moderation. Last week, a team of scientists made headlines with a technical breakthrough that could potentially solve the gene dose problem in Down Syndrome. They found a way to shut down the entire extra copy of chromosome 21 in cells taken from a Down Syndrome patient. The scientists hacked a natural chromosome shut-down system that is itself an evolutionary hack of a previous system.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nMuch like the extra chromosome 21 in Down Syndrome, sex chromosomes present a dose problem: Males of nearly all mammal species have one X chromosome, while females have two copies. As shown by comparisons with the platypus genome, our modern mammalian system of sex chromosomes began to develop less than 166 million years ago, when the Y chromosome appeared on the scene.\n\nA team of scientists recently made headlines with a technical breakthrough that could potentially solve the gene dose problem in Down Syndrome.\n\nThe Y chromosome is essentially a hacked copy of the X chromosome, created by the accidental acquisition of the male sex determination gene SRY, the master control switch in mammals for creating a male. Once the incipient Y chromosome got its hands on the controls, it hijacked the role of sex determination, demoting the chromosome that was previously in charge of this function and creating what we now know as “the male mammal.” One long-term evolutionary consequence of this reckless highjack is that the Y chromosome eventually became a shriveled-up copy of its former self, shedding most of the genes that aren’t needed for specifically male functions like testis development, and raising questions about its future prospects.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nThe Y chromosome’s downward spiral left the X chromosome as the sole carrier of Y’s former genetic content, causing a gene dosage problem: Male mammals have only one copy of the roughly 1,700 genes on the X chromosome, while females get two copies.\n\nGenes on the X chromosome are important to the biology of both sexes, and males and females generally need the same gene dose. Nature solved this dose problem using a gene called Xist to create a system, called X inactivation, which, itself a hack, shuts down one of the two X chromosomes in females, leaving them at X chromosome parity with the males of the species.\n\nScientists were able to hack this X inactivation system—hacking a hack—by engineering a copy of Xist into the extra chromosome 21 in the cells taken from a Down Syndrome patient.\n\nA chromosome is a large feature in a cell, and putting an entire chromosome into storage is no small undertaking. Based on comparisons of X inactivation in marsupials and placental mammals, scientists have suggested that packing away the X chromosome in early mammals was a complicated, piecemeal affair, before the whole process finally fell under the control of the Xist gene. And, naturally, Xist arose as an evolutionary hack of a set of previously existing genes.\n\nThis convoluted backstory to last week’s breakthrough in Down Syndrome research illustrates evolution’s modus operandi of creating new systems by hacking existing ones. The approach is spectacularly successful, but the results are nightmarishly complex; this means that, unlike the engineering of inanimate objects, bioengineering succeeds primarily by modifying biological systems that have already been worked out by evolution. And therefore biological engineering aimed at curing diseases, making biofuels, or manufacturing drugs is made possible by research into some of the more obscure corners of biology, like elephant genomes and ocean bacteria, as well as basic principles of evolutionary biology. As is true of many areas of science, the biomedical research that benefits us directly is built on a foundation of basic research whose social benefits only become clear in hindsight.",

  "latent_9144": "Some folks just don’t get it. Conservative radio giant Rush Limbaugh is in ever-deepening doo-doo over his verbal assault on Georgetown student and activist Sandra Fluke, despite what appears to be a forced non-apology. In his zeal to celebrate Limbaugh’s predicament at having denigrated women with a reprehensible gender-based slur, liberal filmmaking giant Michael Moore…hit Limbaugh with a reprehensible gender-based slur, tweeting “Rush – As soon as u started losing the big $$ from your hate speech, you caved & obeyed the men who pay u. Who’s the prostitute now, bitch?”\n\nRush Limbaugh certainly deserves every bit of trouble he’s bought himself, as his comments were not only disgusting and slanderous to Sandra Fluke, they were a dangerous insult to all women. Even though his audience is mostly male, which means that not many women actually have to hear this garbage, by casting women who use contraception as “sluts” and “prostitutes,” and by demanding the sexual gratification of compulsory amateur porn, he’s creating a sexually hostile environment for every woman who encounters one of his legion of “Dittoheads.”\n\nWhat’s incomprehensible to me is how anyone could choose to criticize Limbaugh by creating a similarly hostile atmosphere. Michael Moore, whose concern for women seems to depend on the political points to be scored, hammered Limbaugh with a Twitter barrage that he was so proud of, he posted it on his website with the weird third-person headline “Michael Moore Tweets About Rush Limbaugh’s ‘Apology’ to Sandra Fluke.”\n\nTommy Christopher Blockquotes Michael Moore’s Tweets: (emphasis mine)\n\nI guess Romney knew that Rush, who made the mistake of saying what most Republicans think (women as sluts), had cost him the Nov. election. Or after losing 6 sponsors yesterday Rush decided he loved $ more than he loved calling women prostitutes. Musta been a tough call, eh Rush? Some sponsors don’t care how much Limbaugh apologizes: mmflint.me/Awf562 (I know – what were they doing there in the 1st place?) RT @pattonoswalt Ayn Rand would be very pleased with how the free market bitch-slapped Limbaugh today. Dear Rush: Please don’t stop! You say what the R candidates don’t. Voters must hear every day til Nov what Republicans truly think of women. Don’t give up, Rush! It’s a WAR ON WOMEN & you’re the Supreme Leader. Keep reminding voters how hate & violence drives the Republican agenda Rush – As soon as u started losing the big $$ from your hate speech, you caved & obeyed the men who pay u. Who’s the prostitute now, bitch? And BTW Rush, your vile & vicious attacks on me over the years – I wear them as a badge of honor. You are sad & sick & I’ve always pitied u.\n\nThe most obvious problem is Moore’s use of the word “bitch” as an insult to Limbaugh, which, in this context, is intended to simultaneously feminize Limbaugh, and to mock that feminization. Earlier in his barrage, he also retweets the use of the phrase “bitch-slapped,” which not only employs the same epithet, but also makes light of violence against women.\n\nNow, both of these usages are quite common in popular culture, and people who use them are oftentimes probably not thinking about what they’re saying (although they should be). But when you’re taking someone to task for using sexually hostile language, there’s really no excuse for it.\n\nLess obvious is Moore’s slam at prostitutes, specifically that they “obey the men that pay” them. However you feel about the morality of prostitution, this comment displays several levels of fundamental ignorance about the trade. Many of the women who engage in prostitution do so under the constant threat of violence, come from violent, sexually abusive backgrounds, and have no protection under the law. Call it a “choice” if you want, but even those who “choose” such a life don’t do so with the understanding that they must “obey” the men who pay them; a woman who has been paid can still say “no.”\n\nIn any case, the moralistic point of view that leads Michael Moore to insult Limbaugh as a “prostitute,” rather than as the never-insulting “gigolo,” is the same one that led Limbaugh to call women who use birth control sluts. Sex is a choice for men, and a shame for women.\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",

You have to cover them, especially in light of — CONWAY: How is that, though? How is it an issue of potential national security? What is the basis for saying that? CUOMO: The efforts by and on behalf of Russia to interfere in the election, and what they may have tried to do, whom they may have tried to cultivate in furtherance of their efforts, are very important questions. They have to be investigated. And from the president’s perspective, he should want them investigated, because if he is cleared by the special counsel, that’s the best validation he could hope for. Is it not? CONWAY: Well so far, he is clear. Let’s make that very clear. But secondly, the president and his counsel have said repeatedly, including today, anything that accelerates this investigation to its conclusion, we’re all for, and also everybody has agreed to comply.\n\nTo be clear, politicians in both parties have broadly called Russian cyberattacks on the 2016 presidential election an act of war.\n\nConway is essentially saying that it is not a national security matter if foreign powers attack the United States — which is pretty much the definition of a national security matter.\n\nAnd while Conway claims that the Russia matter is insignificant and that they are eager to cooperate with the investigation, Trump has been sending out his surrogates to smear Mueller for weeks, which would appear to contradict both notions.\n\nConway and the rest of Trump’s team know they have their backs against the wall.

Now there is a plant growing in their country called cannabis, which closely resembles flax, except that cannabis is thicker-stemmed and taller. In Scythia, in fact, it is far taller. It grows wild, but is also cultivated, and the Thracians use it, as well as flax, for making clothes. These clothes are so similar to ones made out of flax that it would take a real expert to tell the difference between the two materials. Anyone unfamiliar with cannabis would suppose that the clothes were linen.\n\n75. The Scythians, as I said, take cannabis seeds, crawl in under the felt blankets, and throw the seeds on to the glowing stones.

  "latent_9363": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage shows the moment the bomb exploded, as Daniel Sandford reports\n\nA suspected female suicide bomber has set off explosives on a bus in the southern Russian city of Volgograd, killing at least six people.\n\nOfficials believe the woman was from Dagestan in the North Caucasus and was the partner of an Islamist militant.\n\nThe blast, which happened just after 14:00 (10:00 GMT), also injured more than 30 people, some of them seriously.\n\nAn Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region has led to many attacks there in recent years.\n\nThe BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says the bombing has raised fears that militant groups may be planning to step up attacks in Russia in the run-up to the Winter Olympics in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi next February.\n\nStudents\n\nIt is believed there were about 40 people on board the bus.\n\nAnalysis The last significant attack on Russia's transport system was the devastating bomb blast that killed 37 people at Moscow's Domodedovo airport almost three years ago. The death toll from today's attack was much lower. But with just four months to go to the Sochi Winter Olympics, its significance will not have gone unnoticed in the Russian government or the international Olympic movement. If indeed the explosion is linked to the North Caucasus region of the Russian Federation and its troubled republics of Dagestan, Chechnya and Ingushetia, it is a reminder of how easy it is for a single suicide bomber to cause multiple deaths in any part of Russia. The speedy identification of a suspect will not reassure anyone that the situation is under control, and everyone will be hoping this was a one-off and not the start of a bombing campaign.\n\nOur correspondent says that all buses in Volgograd have been ordered back to their depots to be searched for any sign of explosives.\n\nOne man whose daughter survived the explosion told Moscow Echo radio: \"It was a powerful explosion - a huge blast. There were lots of students on the bus.\"\n\nAnother man, who was driving behind the bus, told Rossiya-24 television: \"There was a blast - a bang - all the glass flew out of the windows. The cloud of smoke quickly dissipated and then I saw people start to fall out and run out to escape the bus. It was a horrible sight.\"\n\nEarlier reports had suggested the blast might have been caused by an exploding gas canister.\n\nVolgograd lies about 900km (560 miles) south of Moscow and 650km north of the North Caucasus.\n\nVladimir Markin, of the Investigative Committee - Russia's equivalent of the FBI - told the RIA Novosti news agency: \"A criminal case has been opened under articles outlining terrorism, murder and the illegal use of firearms.\"\n\nMr Markin was later quoted by the Interfax agency as identifying the suspected suicide bomber as a woman from Dagestan.\n\nHe said: \"According to preliminary information, the self-explosion was carried out by a 30-year-old Dagestani native, Naida Akhiyalova.\n\n\"According to investigators' information, the woman entered the bus at one of the bus stops and, almost right after that, the bomb went off. That is also confirmed by one of the passengers who survived.\"\n\n'Black widows'\n\nIn recent years, Russia has seen a number of attacks by women suicide bombers known as black widows, who are often related to Islamist militants and carry out attacks to avenge their deaths.\n\nFemale suicide bombers struck at two underground railway stations in Moscow in 2010, killing more than 35 people.\n\nThey were also believed responsible for explosions on two passenger jets at a Moscow airport in 2004 that killed about 90 people.\n\nSeparatists in Chechnya have fought two wars with Russian forces over the past two decades.\n\nBut the violence has spread across the North Caucasus in recent years, including to mainly-Muslim Ingushetia and Dagestan.\n\nHundreds of people, including members of the government and security services, have been killed.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has stepped up security in the North Caucasus ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics, which open in Sochi on 7 February.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Russian TV broadcast footage said to show the moment the bomb went off",
  "latent_9705": "Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach A newly published batch of stolen emails shows a close relationship between Google and members of Hillary Clinton's campaign staff.\n\nThe private emails were apparently stolen from John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, and published by WikiLeaks. They contain several references to Google and its parent company Alphabet's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt.\n\nThe emails reveal a relationship with Schmidt dating back to at least 2008 and show that Google loaned its jet to members of Clinton's campaign staff on several occasions.\n\nAccording to a February 2015 email to Podesta from Tina Flournoy — who serves as Bill Clinton's chief of staff — Google planned to lend its company jet for a trip to Africa. Podesta wrote, \"FYI. They are donating the Google plane for the Africa trip.\"\n\nIt's not clear what trip they're talking about, but the email chain also said that Schmidt wanted to meet \"WJC,\" shorthand for \"William Jefferson Clinton.\" Given the timing, they may be talking about Bill Clinton's nine-day trip in May 2015 to Tanzania, Kenya, Liberia and Morocco. The annual trek to Africa included a group of 20 donors and supporters, several of whom were \"expected to give generously\" to the Hillary Clinton campaign, according to Politico.\n\nBoth Podesta and Flournoy wrote that the Google plane has a bad habit of breaking down. While Podesta said it would be a \"nice way to travel,\" both of them mentioned issues with the plane in the past.\n\n\"Yes, until it breaks down in Ethiopia — as it did the last time we used it,\" Flournoy wrote.\n\nPodesta responded: \"Funny, the only time I was on it, it broke down in Rwanda and we had to fly Ethiopian Airlines home.\"\n\nThe emails also say that Schmidt had met with Hillary Clinton and spoken with Podesta.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSchmidt's involvement\n\nIn April 2014, Schmidt sent Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills a detailed plan for the 2016 campaign, writing \"If we get started soon, we will be in a very strong position to execute well for 2016.\" The plan laid out ideas for the campaign, like where it should be headquartered and who should be hired.\n\nIn an email to Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook the same month, Podesta wrote that Schmidt seemed eager to be a part of an exploratory committee and \"clearly wants to be head outside advisor, but didn't seem like he wanted to push others out.\" Podesta wrote that Schmidt was \"ready to fund, advise recruit talent, etc.\" and was \"more deferential on structure than I expected.\"\n\nPodesta encouraged Mook and Mills to meet with Schmidt to discuss his involvement with the campaign. According to Podesta, Schmidt pressed Podesta to look for young coders \"preferably in outer borough NYC\" and thought Northern California was too expensive for any kind of Clinton campaign home base.\n\nSchmidt publicly endorsed Clinton in June.",
  "latent_9768": "Donald Trump’s spokesperson, Sean Spicer, has denied making false assertions, insisting: “Our intention is never to lie to you.”\n\nSpicer, 45, was catapulted to celebrity on Saturday when he launched a fierce attack on the media for its coverage of Trump’s inauguration. The press secretary claimed it had the biggest audience in history despite evidence from photos, crowd scientists, TV ratings and the Washington Metro network.\n\n#SpicerFacts jokes flooded Twitter and were used with relish by public announcers at sports games across the US.\n\nBut on Monday, in his first question and answer session at the White House, Spicer was far from apologetic. He attempted to turn the tables on the media by pointing out errors in its own reporting.\n\nAsked if it was his intention to always tell the truth from the west wing podium, Spicer replied: “It is. It’s an honour to do this and yes, I believe we have to be honest with the American people.”\n\nIn a curious remark, he added: “I think sometimes we can disagree with the facts ... But our intention is never to lie to you.”\n\nSpicer, more amiable than when he delivered Saturday’s diatribe, said there are times when media organisations make mistakes and are forced to publish corrections. “We’ll do our best every time we can,” Spicer said. “I’m gonna come out here and tell you the facts as I know them.”\n\nIf a mistake is made, it will be corrected, he added. Apparently referring to his comment on Saturday that the White House will hold the media accountable, he said: “But as I said the other day, it’s a two-way street.”\n\nSpicer backed down on his use of Metro statistics to back his claim about the inauguration crowd, but he stuck to his guns about the overall audience. “Sure, it was the most watched inaugural... There were tens of millions of people that watched that online... It’s unquestionable.”\n\nThis included on phones, TVs, tablets, on Facebook and YouTube, he argued. “I’d love to see any information that proves that otherwise... I don’t think there’s any question that it was the most watched inauguration ever. I think I’m right in saying [Ronald] Reagan didn’t have YouTube.”\n\nTurning his fire on the media, Spicer criticised a mistaken media report that Trump had removed a bust of civil rights leader Martin Luther King from the Oval Office. “We have a tweet go out about Martin Luther King. Think about how racially charged that is... Where was the apology to the president of the United States?\n\n“There’s a point at which we have a right to go out there and correct the record... We want to have an open and healthy dialogue with the press corps and the American people.”\n\nAsked about the massive women’s marches in Washington and other major cities, Spicer said: “He has a healthy respect for the First Amendment. This is what makes our country so beautiful.”\n\nThe briefing room in the West Wing was as crowded as for Barack Obama’s farewell press conference five days earlier.\n\nSitting at his right side were White House staff including Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway and director of strategic communities Hope Hicks. He began with a broad grin and an upbeat, “Good afternoon, everyone!” – apparently from the Conway playbook.\n\nWhy did Spicer take no questions on Saturday? “I came out to read a statement,” he said. “I’m here today and I’m going to stay out here as long as you want. You guys might want to leave before I do.”",

  "latent_10144": "Like many Americans, Jill hadn’t thought much about where transgender people go to the bathroom. A 60-year-old Trump voter who lives in Ohio, she generally supports LGBT rights but is hung up on the trans issue. She called it “confusing.” Jean, also 60, agreed. She doesn’t want “a male in [her] restroom.” But when these voters had the opportunity to have their concerns addressed in a meaningful way and dialogue about these issues, a new study found that they were able to be flipped in favor of trans equality.\n\nIn May, Working America and Pride at Work surveyed 784 middle- and working-class voters in the Buckeye State about an LGBT nondiscrimination bill proposed in the state legislature earlier this year. Senate Bill 100 would ban anti-LGBT discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations. According to these groups, more than a quarter of conservatives were willing to sign a petition supporting SB 100.\n\nAfter putting down her signature, Lisa said, “Sometimes you just gotta go!”\n\n“Except for the most conservative of voters, people were relatively consistent in their support levels,” Matt Morrison, the deputy director of Working America, told The Advocate. “If you lined everyone up from 1 to 100 based on what their partisan inclination is — 100 being the most progressive and 1 being the most conservative — the top 80 percent of people were equally likely to be supportive. Even people within that 1-20 range, what we saw was that 27 percent of them were inclined to sign.”\n\nTo tabulate the partisan leanings of those surveyed, the groups used Catalist’s Vote Choice Index, which affixes a rating of 1 to 100 based on one’s economic and social views. The survey found that voters with a VCI score over 20 “were as likely as those with a score of 70 and above to support the measure,” showing broad support except among the staunchest conservatives.\n\nAmong the most ardent GOP voters, three patterns emerged. Those who were reluctant to sign a petition supporting LGBT rights were concerned that a nondiscrimination law would (1) violate their religious beliefs, (2) allow “men in dresses” to enter women’s restrooms, and (3) permit these entrants to target women and children using the bathroom. One Republican respondent, Laura, told canvassers, “I have a granddaughter, so I'm a little worried about men in the women’s room.”\n\n“The picture of a man in a dress is a very visceral thing for these folks,” said Jerame Davis, executive director of Pride at Work. “As soon as you start talking about the issue in any way, that’s immediately where a lot of [Republicans] go. It’s because of the way the right is using their talking points and bringing that image up repeatedly.”\n\nAlthough there’s never been a confirmed case of a trans person attacking someone else in a public bathroom, GOP campaigns opposed to equal rights for transgender people have frequently painted trans restroom users as dangerous predators intent on harming others. In the case of Houston’s failed Equal Rights Ordinance, an advertising campaign paid for by local conservative groups depicted little girls being preyed on by an invisible threat. Another commercial portrayed trans people as hairy freaks — a laughable and disgusting cartoon.\n\nThese tactics worked. The ordinance, which would have also prevented Houstonians fron being fired because of their gender identity or sexual orientation, was voted down by a margin of 61 percent to 39 percent. And the Ohio survey shows that they have remained effective since — thanks to disinformation campaigns like those around North Carolina’s House Bill 2, passed last year.\n\nBut canvassers found that when they gave voters the correct information, many of them were willing to have their minds changed.\n\n“My religion tells me no, but, hey, everyone has the right to pee,” Laura said after a conversation in which canvassers debunked the widely disseminated bathroom myths. “Everyone has their own sins to deal with. I don't think Jesus was against peeing.”\n\n“We didn’t want to correct their bad information,” Davis said. “We wanted to help give them new information. The average voter has not thought about this issue very deeply. Our project shows that when we give them the opportunity to think about it in a nonjudgmental way and allow them to air their concerns and grievances and talk them through the issues they have, we can move them to a supportive stance. If we do that, we have the opportunity to make change.”\n\nIn addition to the more than a quarter of conservatives who signed the petition, Working America and Pride at Work found that about half of all voters were supportive of trans rights. Overall, 41 percent of registered voters the organizations spoke with were willing to sign a petition supporting SB 100. Fifty-six percent of SB 100 supporters were female, and 74 percent lived in a household that earns over $75,000 a year.\n\nSome of the findings confirmed what LGBT advocates already know: Younger people were more likely to support nondiscrimination legislation, as were voters who self-identify as Democrats. Voters under the age of 50 were more than twice as likely as those over 50 to sign the petition in favor of SB 100. While 54 percent of Democrats offered their support for the bill, just 29 percent of Republicans did. Many of these voters were concerned about the perceived “threat” of allowing transgender people to use women’s bathrooms.\n\n“Folks, by and large, disagree with discrimination,” Morrison said. “They know that it’s a bad thing. They don’t want to be on the wrong side of the issue.”\n\nOfficials with the National Center for Transgender Equality see these results as further evidence that the more people know about trans lives, the less likely they are to support laws targeting their rights. According to a poll the Human Rights Campaign conducted in 2016, around 35 percent of Americans have a friend, neighbor, or coworker who is transgender. This group is statistically more likely to support LGBT equality, including the right of trans people to use public bathrooms consistent with their gender identity.\n\n\"The more voters have the opportunity to put themselves in their trans neighbors shoes, the more supportive they are,” said Harper Jean Tobin, director of policy for NCTE. “As with other minorities, there are fears and misconceptions that come from simply not having the chance to get to know a transgender person.”\n\nThe survey is just the latest to show that Americans are widely supportive of LGBT rights, even in the face of national and state attempts to roll back progress. A 2016 poll from the Harris Foundation found that 67 percent of respondents were in favor of laws that would prevent LGBT people from being terminated from their job or denied housing because of who they are. Over 70 percent said that they were more likely to support or even work for companies viewed as supportive of queer and trans people.\n\nDespite popular support for pro-LGBT initiatives, the GOP continues to push legislation targeting the community. The American Civil Liberties Union estimates that over 200 bills of this nature will be introduced in state legislatures this year, a record number. A federal appeals court just allowed a \"religious discrimination\" bill in Mississippi to go into effect, which will allow businesses, individuals, and nonprofit to deny service to LGBT people and others because of the individual or institution's religious beliefs.\n\nNext month the Texas legislature will hold a special session to debate a bathroom bill similar to North Carolina’s HB 2. Senate Bill 6 would force trans people to use the public restroom that corresponds with their “biological sex” in schools and buildings operated by the state. That legislation would have a disastrous impact on trans students — and could lead to lower test scores, higher rates of bullying, and higher dropout rates.\n\nDespite SB 6 being a “top priority” for the governor, a majority of voters in a Texas Tribune poll say the bill isn’t important. That tally includes 41 percent of non-Tea Party Republicans.\n\nThe Texas special session begins July 18.",
  "latent_10187": "Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nDETROIT – I spent the day wondering the best way to ask No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz about his suddenly deformed shooting stroke. I wanted to be respectful and empathetic and mostly just not blurt out, “What’s wrong with you?”\n\nAfter answering a few questions about his shot, Fultz himself brought up that he’s aware of all the “rumors” about his free throws. Sounding comfortable and confident – working against a popular theory that he has the yips – Fultz explained a shoulder injury is still hindering him. As soon as his shoulder heals, he’ll return to the form he used at Washington, where he made 65% of his free throws.\n\n“I do what I’ve got to do to get the ball on the rim,” said Fultz, who’s 6-of-12 from the line this season (50%).\n\nFultz was less direct about his jumper.\n\nHe can shoot 3-pointers right now, he insists. But after attempting more than five per game in college, he has taken no shots from at least 15 feet – let alone beyond the arc – in 76 NBA minutes.\n\nThough he professed confidence in his open jumper, even his close-range jumpers are a mess. He’s 3-of-16 from outside five feet, and shooting just 33% overall.\n\nMore jarring are the shots he isn’t taking. A smooth mid-range operator and aggressive shot hunter at Washington, Fultz looks like a shell of himself. He sometimes drives, mostly to set up teammates, and he sets screens. But his biggest strengths have been neutered.\n\nAs a result, defenses can sag off him, and the 76ers’ offense has crated with him on the court. They’ve scored a woeful 80.4 points per 100 possessions when he plays. Rotations aren’t to blame, either. No matter which teammate Fultz is paired with, during the duo’s minutes together, Philadelphia has scored at what would have been a league-worst rate last season.\n\nYet, the 1-3 76ers continue to play Fultz at least a third of each game. They’re trying to win for the first time since The Process began, but they also have young talent like Fultz to groom.\n\n“There’s no book that tells you how to combine win and develop,” Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. “They are very mutually exclusive.\n\n“Normally, the link is you’ve got to play them and you’ve got to live with some stuff.”\n\nFultz said he isn’t worried about developing bad habits while shooting through his shoulder injury. Neither is Brown, who has consulted with medical personnel.\n\n“Nobody has any fears,” Brown said. “…You don’t just walk a certain way for a long period of your life and all of a sudden start to limp.”\n\nBut it’s not so easy to dispel doubt for several reasons:\n\nAs the No. 1 pick, Fultz receives outsized attention. Even coming off the bench to begin his career, joining the ranks of Anthony Bennett and Andrea Bargnani, immediately generated pessimism.\n\nBecause the Celtics traded the No. 1 pick while Fultz was the consensus choice, many Boston fans are openly rooting for Fultz to fail. Not because they hold any specific ill will toward him, but just because they want their team to be right.\n\nPoint guards drafted after Fultz – Lonzo Ball, De'Aaron Fox and Dennis Smith Jr. – are off to much better starts to their careers.\n\nTeammates Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, who had a triple-double in his fourth game, are balling. Fultz is the weak link of Philadelphia’s young three-headed core.\n\nFultz, against the 76ers’ wishes, reworked his jumper over the offseason. That’s what makes it so hard to completely discount the possibility of a larger mental block.\n\nSo, the articles of concern are rolling in. Jokes are being cracked about his Shaq-esque free throws. More serious people are actually fretting about his long-term value.\n\nBrown’s advice to Fultz is simple: “This is not going to define you.” The coach wants Fultz to focus on everything but his jumper – defense, running the offense, getting to his spots in the pick-and-roll.\n\n“At the end of the day, I know what I can do,” Fultz said. “My teammates know what I can do. My coaches know what I can do.”\n\nMaybe someday soon, he’ll get to show it.",
  "latent_10189": "Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown speaks at a party rally in Glasgow, Scotland September 12, 2014.The referendum on Scottish independence will take place on September 18, when Scotland will vote whether or not to end the 307-year-old union with the rest of the United Kingdom. REUTERS/Paul Hackett The United States is just starting to think about the upcoming elections (for whatever reason, the vast majority of people don't focus on politics until after Labor Day), but there is another election happening \"over the pond,\" where the polls have just made everybody do a double-take. I am of course referring to the referendum on Scottish independence, which will be held next week. Voters opposing the measure were a clear majority for months, but their numbers began slipping a few weeks ago; and as of last few days the contest is basically even, with the election probably to be decided by the undecided.\n\nA \"yes\" outcome would have significant ramifications not just for the United Kingdom but for all of Europe. Can a region of a country just decide it wants to be independent? You take a vote and that's it? To everyone's credit in the United Kingdom, they are being quite civilized about it. However, I imagine if Scotland votes to leave, the negotiations will be rather less cultured. There will be a big bill to be paid before everybody gets to leave the restaurant. Just who ran up what part of the tab over the last 300 years is an issue that has the potential to turn into a rowdy soccer - pardon me, football - match.\n\nIn today's Outside the Box we explore a few aspects of the potential break-up. And not just what it would mean for the United Kingdom (it would not be good) but for all of Europe. Note that Spanish bonds are beginning to fall as people wonder what it might mean for Scotland to be allowed to declare independence. There are a couple regions in Spain that would very much like to do the same. And frankly, the Catalan region has a much better economic rationale for being on its own than Scotland does. (From this side of the pond, I cannot see what Scotland would have to gain economically from independence. They are a net consumer of taxes. But the whole independence thing is clearly about more than just economics, so this is one bar fight among friends where I think I'll just retreat to my corner and watch.)\n\nFirst, let's look at a few comments from Bloomberg:\n\nSpain's government bonds fell, undermined by the Catalan region's crescendoing push for independence, as polls 1,000 miles away in Scotland showed increased support for its own bid to break from the U.K.…\n\n\"It's a question of raising the flag to more event risk,\" Harvinder Sian, a fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London, said today by phone. \"Where the U.K. government has decided to guarantee all government debt, the Catalonia region is too large for the rest of Spain to absorb. It's a much more problematic issue for Spain with regard to its debt markets.\"…\n\n\"If Catalonia were to become independent it would be a strong drag on Spain's growth and doubts would resurface regarding the sustainability of Spanish public debt,\" said Marius Daheim, a Munich-based senior fixed-income strategist at Bayerische Landesbank. \"Liquidity rules.\"\n\nToday's OTB features a piece by Stratfor's George Friedman on the implications of an independent Scotland. Do the Belgians get to split their country in two? Which regions of Spain might move for independence? How about the Northern League in Italy? What about the rest of the world? Can parts of Ukraine simply take a vote and leave? Where does it end?\n\nThen Anatole Kaletsky over at GaveKal thinks about the implications for British politics. You could have the odd situation of Scotland's representatives in Parliament, who are overwhelmingly from the Labour Party, voting with a possible labor majority to put into place a very liberal policy agenda and then leaving Parliament after less than a year, which might then leave the Conservatives in the majority. Were those votes really legitimate if it was already known that Scotland was leaving? Exactly how does that work?\n\nBefore putting you in George and Anatole's capable hands, let me offer two additional links, from opposite sides of the political spectrum. The first is from my friend Niall Ferguson, here, musing back in 2007 on the question of what it takes to make a nation-state. Then, I offer this link to Paul Krugman's blog in the New York Times. Paul gets my vote for best line I've read so far about the election:\n\nWell, I have a message for the Scots: Be afraid, be very afraid. The risks of going it alone are huge. You may think that Scotland can become another Canada, but it's all too likely that it would end up becoming Spain without the sunshine.\n\nSpain without the sunshine, indeed. This may be one of the few occasions on which you will find Niall Ferguson and Paul Krugman in agreement.\n\nRight now the London bookies still think the vote for independence will fail. I think that conclusion is largely based on the assumption that many Scottish citizens who say they are \"yes\" voters today will go into the polling booth and realize at the last moment that their personal economic interests lie in remaining in the union. But as of today, it looks to be very close. Just the fact that they can take a vote on such a question is really rather remarkable. I don't remember there being a vote in the movie Braveheart.\n\nMy father told me that our family was kicked out of Scotland and then kicked out of Ireland before we made it to the colonies (back when they were still colonies). The name was Muldoon in Scotland and Ireland and was Americanized when we hit these shores. We can't find any records to prove the family legend, and it's been a few centuries since anyone in the family had the right to vote over there. But there's a part of me that might be looking at the numbers a wee bit sentimentally, so let me close by wishing my Scottish friends Go n-éirí an bóthar leat! (That's Gaelic, which is as close to an ancient Scottish language is there is, though it's more commonly thought of as Irish.)\n\nYour wondering if I'll need a passport to see Edinburgh again analyst,\n\nJohn Mauldin, Editor Outside the Box subscribers@mauldineconomics.com\n\nStay Ahead of the Latest Tech News and Investing Trends... Click here to sign up for Patrick Cox's free daily tech news digest. Each day, you get the three tech news stories with the biggest potential impact.\n\nBy George Friedman, Stratfor September 9, 2014\n\nPolls released today showed for the first time that a majority - an extremely small majority, but a majority nonetheless - of Scots favor independence, although other polls suggest the no camp remains in the lead. A poll is not the election, which will be held Sept. 18, but it is still a warning that something extraordinary might happen very soon. The political union between Scotland and England might be abolished after 300 years. The implications of this are enormous and generally ignored.\n\nObviously, this raises a host of question about how such a divorce might take place, whether the expected time frame - divorce by 2016 - will be adhered to, and how state property might be divided. It also raises the question of Scottish foreign policy. Will Scotland remain in NATO? Will it have membership in the European Union? Will it continue to use the pound sterling, and if not, how will it roll out its own currency?\n\nThese are important questions, but far more important issues will follow. One of the principles of the postwar world was the inviolability of Europe's borders. Border disputes were the origin of centuries of war, and so Europe's borders were frozen after World War II to avoid discussion. This may have left some people of one nationality on the wrong side of a border, but this was accepted since the risk of opening the door to border redefinition was considered far greater than any discomforts stemming from the borders that were locked in place.\n\nThis principle has been weakened since the end of the Cold War. Still, though the disintegration of the Soviet Union created fully independent states, these were recognized republics within the context of the Soviet Union. One could argue that this did not in fact represent border change. Later, the \"Velvet Divorce\" of Czechoslovakia into Czech and Slovak successor countries represented another shift, but in a country that had only existed since the end of World War I. The separation of Kosovo from Serbia was a more radical shift but was justified by claims of Serbian oppression. Though each shift weakened the principle of inviolable borders, each came with an asterisk - that is, each had an aspect that stopped it from being the definitive case.\n\nScotland separating from England, by contrast, can't be minimized. If that centuries-old union can be revised, then anything can be revised. Scottish separatists' reason for splitting is that they are a separate nation, that each nation has the right to its own state and the right to determine its own destiny, and that they no longer choose to be in union. But if they have the right to determine this, why shouldn't others in Europe enjoy the same right?\n\nFor example, modern Spain is an amalgam of regions. One, the Catalan region - which contains Barcelona - has a strong separatist movement. If Scotland can leave the United Kingdom, then why shouldn't Catalonia be allowed to leave Spain? Farther east, the Treaty of Trianon gave Romania and then-Czechoslovakia large portions of Hungary along with the Hungarians living there. Why shouldn't Hungarians living in those territories have the right to rejoin Hungary? Meanwhile, if French-speaking Belgians and Dutch-speaking Belgians wish to part ways and return their two regions to their respective countries of origin, why should they not be allowed to? And why shouldn't the eastern part of Ukraine be allowed to secede and join Russia?\n\nRaising the stakes, this is an issue that goes far beyond Europe. There are seemingly innumerable separatist movements in India, China, Africa and so forth. If Scotland has the right to leave the nation-state it is part of and form a new one based on ethnic identity, why can't anyone follow suit? And if anyone can do it, but they are blocked by the state they wish to leave, is resorting to violence in pursuit of independence legitimate?\n\nThe Scottish issue - the claim that the Scots are a separate nation and that all nations have a right to self-determination - simply cannot be asterisked. Having this happen in the heart of Western Europe would set a clear precedent that would expand geographically and conceptually. It would legitimize similar movements globally and force a reconsideration of what a nation is. Ultimately, a nation would be whatever the majority says it is.\n\nIt is doubtful that the Scottish precedent could be contained in Europe. And it is hard to imagine how this precedent might not lead to conflict somewhere, not in the British Isles but somewhere where the existing state would be less inclined to grant the right of self-determination to a separatist movement.\n\nOf course, the separatists in Scotland may well lose, sentiment might change in the post-election negotiations, and so on. But if England and Scotland divorce, the right to separate will become an integral part of international custom - and it will arouse other movements.\n\nBy Anatole Kaletsky, Gavekal\n\nThe probability that the United Kingdom will break apart now appears to be at least 50%. The weekend's crop of opinion polls agree with each other, and support last Tuesday's poll showing a powerful swing in favor of a 'Yes' vote in next week's referendum on Scottish independence. Given that up until last Tuesday most investors and analysts (including me) saw no more than a 10%-20% probability of independence, what has happened in the past few days amounts to a genuine exogenous shock of seismic proportions. In response to such a shock it is reasonable to expect further large market movements, especially in the pound, which has now fallen 2.4% against the US dollar in just one week\n\nThe biggest risk to the pound sterling and gilts lies not in the economic uncertainties that will be generated by future arguments about Scotland's relationship to sterling, the sharing of the UK's national debt, or the distribution of North Sea oil revenues. These are all issues with relatively marginal investment impact, which will only be felt in the long term.\n\nMuch more important are three political questions, not about abstract ideology, but of a kind that is highly relevant to investors:\n\n1) What will a Scottish independence vote mean for British politics and economic management in the next nine months?\n\n2) What will be the impact on the 2015 UK general election and subsequent economic policies, especially taxation?\n\n3) What will all this imply for Britain's membership of the European Union?\n\nThe answers to all three questions are more alarming than almost anyone would have predicted a week ago:\n\n1) If the Scots vote for independence it is likely that David Cameron will feel forced to take responsibility and resign as prime minister. If he fails to stand down, a putsch against him by right wing Tories is almost certain. A mutiny may or may not succeed, but Conservative Party politics is extremely febrile and ruthless, and the risk to Cameron's position is not remotely discounted in the markets. In September 1990 nobody imagined that Margaret Thatcher was vulnerable; less than two months later she was ousted by her closest supporters. Whether Cameron is replaced or not, Britain's government will be reduced to lame duck status between now and the May 2015 election. The only issues on the political agenda will be the terms of Scottish separation and apportioning blame for the referendum debacle.\n\n2) The sense of shock and national failure resulting from an independence vote would make it much more difficult for the present coalition to win the 2015 election. The probability of a Labour-led government would rise from 40%-50% today to something like 70%. This prospect should be very alarming to investors in sterling. Labour will campaign on a platform of higher taxes and public spending, a tougher property tax regime, hobbling and shrinking the City of London, and abolishing the concessions to foreign residents which make Britain one of the world's most effective tax havens. If anything, the Liberal Democrats, who would probably be Labour's coalition partners, would be even tougher both in terms of personal tax reform and in their antagonism to the financial sector. To make matters worse, a Labour or Lab-Lib government would lack the political legitimacy to enact the measures promised in its manifesto, since the government's majority would rely on Scottish members due for expulsion from the English parliament in 2016. A constitutional crisis would therefore ensue. Presumably Labour would respond by promising another general election in mid-2016, immediately after the Scottish secession. The result would be two years of unprecedented political and fiscal uncertainty for all businesses and investors in Britain.\n\n3) Even in the unlikely event that the Conservative Party or a Conservative-Liberal coalition is re-elected in a 2015 election after a Scottish independence vote next week, the political consequences would be dire. In the event of such an unexpected victory, the Conservative Party would regard its hold on power as assured following the expulsion of Scotland's 59 members of parliament (only one of whom is Conservative). As a result, the party would swing decisively towards the Euro-skepticism favored by its grassroots activists. A referendum on EU membership would be held in 2017 in which the new prime minister (who might conceivably even be David Cameron after a Damascene conversion to Euro-skepticism) would either adopt a neutral position or actively campaign for an exit. Either way, the odds on the UK leaving the EU would climb above 50%.\n\nIn the more probable scenario discussed in option (2)—that a Scottish independence vote would lead to a Labour-Liberal victory in the May 2015 general election—there would be no EU referendum in 2017 as promised by the Conservatives. At first that might seem to offer some relief on the European front. In reality, however, it would do nothing to secure Britain's EU membership. On the contrary, a Lab-Lib government would have to call another general election immediately after Scottish secession in 2016; an election in which EU membership would be straight back on the agenda. The Conservatives, emboldened by their 'natural' majority in the UK-minus-Scotland would swing towards outright Euro-skepticism and campaign for an immediate post-election referendum, laying down conditions for renegotiating EU membership which Brussels, France and even Germany would be sure to reject.\n\nThus a Conservative victory in a 2016 election would make Brexit almost certain a year later. If, as is quite possible, the Euro-skeptics overplayed their hand and the Tories lost the 2016 election, the UK would be saddled with a high tax Labour-Liberal government until 2021.\n\nAs a result, if Scotland does vote for independence next week, it is hard to come up with a positive scenario for British assets, whatever happens subsequently. Of course, there is always the hope that the polls may be wrong or the Scots will change their minds at the last moment once they realize what a Pandora's box of political uncertainties they are about to open. But hope is not a strategy. We recommend selling sterling and other British assets, apart from those such as resource shares which have little exposure to British politics and which benefit directly from a weak pound.\n\nLike Outside the Box?Sign up today and get each new issue delivered free to your inbox.

  "latent_10317": "The 400 richest people in the US have a greater collective wealth than 36 million ordinary US households, study finds\n\nThose rich enough to make it onto Forbes 400 list this year are worth as much as all the cat owners in America, according to a new study.\n\nA report released by the Institute for Policy Studies on Wednesday found that the Forbes 400 list of America’s richest people have more wealth than 36m US households whose net worth is on average $81,000.\n\nUS overtakes Caymans and Singapore as haven for assets of super-rich Read more\n\n“That’s as many households in the United States that own cats,” wrote Chuck Collins, director of institute’s program on inequality and the Common Good, and Josh Hoxie, head of the institute’s project on opportunity and taxation.\n\n“We believe that these statistics actually underestimate our current national levels of wealth concentration. The growing use of offshore tax havens and legal trusts has made the concealing of assets much more widespread than ever before.”\n\nHere is another way to put it: the 400 wealthiest Americans have as much wealth as the entire African American population in the US combined and more than a third of the Latino population combined.\n\nAmong the wealthiest Americans are Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, the Koch brothers, the heirs to Walmart fortune, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Michael Bloomberg and Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Who’s got most of the money? These guys. Photograph: Institute for Police Studies\n\nThe 20 people on top of the Forbes 400 list – “a group that could fit comfortably in one single Gulfstream G650 luxury jet” according to the report’s authors – own more wealth than the bottom half of the American population, which is about 152 million people. That’s about 57m households, or a population of 40 US states.\n\nTo reduce this extreme wealth inequality, the US should close wealth escape routes such as offshore tax havens and reduce the concentrated wealth by taxing the rich, the report’s authors recommend.\n\n“To even more accurately depict our current wealth divide, we need further research into the tax-evading strategies the the super wealthy employ. But we already know enough to know that our current extreme inequality represents a clear and present danger to our social and economic well-being,” wrote the reports’ authors. “We have before us a serious policy options for creating a much fairer economy. As Thomas Piketty reminds us, inequality will only continue to grow if we do not act.”",

Like so many women, I’ve been pulling for Palin, wishing her the best, hoping she will perform brilliantly. I’ve also noticed that I watch her interviews with the held breath of an anxious parent, my finger poised over the mute button in case it gets too painful. Unfortunately, it often does. My cringe reflex is exhausted. Palin filibusters. She repeats words, filling space with deadwood. Cut the verbiage and there’s not much content there.\n\nParker, who if nothing else has increased her visibility, concludes her column with her call for Palin to \"bow out [of the national race] for personal reasons, perhaps because she wants to spend more time with her newborn.\"\n\nThose on the left with a conspiratorial bent may wonder if the latest developments in the Palin saga are part of a hidden effort to create an environment in which she can't help but exceed expectations in her Thursday debate with Joe Biden.\n\n-- Don Frederick\n\nPhoto credit: Associated Press",

  "latent_10433": "We are not going to mince words here - Sony is the current king of battery life when it comes to brand-name smartphones. We did our grueling battery benchmark on the Xperia Z3 over the weekend, and it broke all records in its respective category, just as we suspected it would do, given Sony's consistent performance in that department this year.\n\nThe phone lasted for nearly nine and a half hours of screen-on time when we ran our tasking battery benchmark, putting it comfortably ahead of any other flagship big-screen phone or phablet we've tested at the moment.\n\nAs mentioned, this is more than any other flagship we've measured so far - phone or phablet - and even more than the Ascend Mate7 , which comes equipped with a whopping 4100 mAh juicer, while the Z3 has an \"only\" 3100 mAh piece in a 7.3mm thin waterproof body.\n\nThe Z3 battery endurance is also better than the one of the Z2 , which already has a great battery life, so kudos to Sony here - it managed to squeeze much more life out of a tad smaller battery, compared to the Z2, and make a truly \"two-day battery\". The charging time, on the other hand, is much longer than the average, at close to four hours with the paltry stock 850 mA charger\n\nIf you think that what Sony did is by accident, then a simple look at our top ten endurance champs will tell you that this is not the case. Sony phones are currently occupying six of the top ten slots in our battery benchmark ranking, and these range from low-ends, like the Xperia C , through midrangers like the slim T3 , all the way to the Xperia Z3 flagship. The \"culprit\" must be Sony's displays, which might not be the best out there when it comes to color representation and viewing angles, but are apparently using an extremely frugal technology, and screens are the pesky components with the highest battery consumption in our smartphones, so kudos to Sony here.\n\nWe measure battery life by running a custom web-script, designed to replicate the power consumption of typical real-life usage.

  "latent_10463": "Industrial development is on the rise in ocean waters. So-called ocean spatial planning seeks to balance development and ocean protection by using science to identify the most delicate ocean areas and directing industry elsewhere.\n\nTo many people, the oceans remain an enigma, a blank sheet of sparkling water beneath which we can imagine all is well. But in many places, all is not well: temperatures are rising, corals are bleaching, the oceans are turning more acid from absorbing excess CO2 pollution, land-based pollution is fouling salt water, overfishing has left fish stocks diminished and habitat damaged from trawlers. Already, it's a death by a thousand cuts.\n\nBut industrial activities in oceans can also harm ecosystems: oil and gas extraction, sand and gravel mining, installation of underwater pipelines and utility cables, commercial shipping, aquaculture. New activities are also popping up: offshore wind, wave and tidal energy. When too many of these projects cluster in close proximity, it results in industrial sprawl, putting further pressure on already distressed natural habitats.\n\nBecause the oceans are governed by many different agencies and laws, balancing ecosystem protection and economic development can be difficult.\n\nTo facilitate these projects while protecting the ocean’s natural resources — which provide us with many useful ecosystem services — Massachusetts thought it needed a plan. Leading on this issue in the United States, Massachusetts developed the Mass Ocean Plan as part of the Massachusetts Oceans Act of 2008. The management plan was formed with input from state legislators and agencies, fishing groups, the energy and utility industries, and environmental groups. Rhode Island followed suit in 2010.\n\nBut state waters only extend three miles offshore. Federal waters have much greater reach, from three to 200 miles offshore. In 2009, President Obama created an Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force to study and recommend strategies for better stewardship of U.S. ocean waters, coasts, and the Great Lakes.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:\n\n“Coastal and marine spatial planning identifies areas most suitable for various types or classes of activities in order to reduce conflicts among uses, reduce environmental impacts, facilitate compatible uses, and preserve critical ecosystem services to meet economic, environmental, security, and social objectives.”\n\nThe result, last year, was the first national ocean policy (PDF) and the establishment of the interagency National Ocean Council (NOC). Under it, federal agencies, ocean users, industries, and coastal communities are developing regional ocean use plans, including action recommendations. Marine spatial plans are to be developed by nine regional planning bodies as early as 2015.\n\nThe ocean business community has hurried to participate in ocean spatial planning. The recently formed World Ocean Council held the “first ever meeting of ocean industries” this summer in Washington, D.C.: the National Business Forum on Marine Spatial Planning. WOC’s goal is to make sure business’ voice is heard at the table as these policies are developed. It says:\n\nIn a global, interconnected ocean \"commons,” the actions of one company or even an entire sector are not enough to address cumulative impacts of growing ocean use by a diverse range of industries. There is clearly a need for ocean industries to collaborate within and across sectors to address impacts, reduce conflicts, develop proactive ocean sustainability leadership, and constructively engage other stakeholders.\n\nWOC promises member businesses reduced risk, a louder voice, and an improved image. Marine spatial planning is also developing in Australia, Europe, and other areas.",

In that event, he was expected to seek withdrawal of the entire measure, to the relief of some Democrats from coal-producing or heavy industrial states.\n\n\"We are going to have Democrats voting to end debate on what they call the most important issue facing the planet and Republicans voting to continue debate on it,\" said Don Stewart, communications director for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nSome Democrats were worried yesterday that the GOP might try to block withdrawal of the legislation to prolong a debate that many Democrats think no longer works to their political benefit. Republicans have pounced on the high price of gasoline and have stressed that the climate legislation, by introducing a price on carbon dioxide emissions, would further raise the price of gas along with that of all other fossil fuels.\n\nJames M. Inhofe (Okla.), the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement, \"Now Democrats are on record as supporting legislation that would significantly increase prices at the pump and in our homes.\"\n\nDozens of amendments will die along with the bill. Several sought to impose tariffs on developing countries, such as China, that do not price carbon dioxide emissions. McConnell sought an amendment to allow the energy and transportation secretaries to suspend parts of the legislation if they believed it had raised gasoline prices.\n\nRead the full article here :http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/05/AR2008060503603.html",
  "latent_10587": "Johnny Cash once called 1968 the happiest year of his life. It was the year his masterpiece At Folsom Prison came out, the year he was named the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year, and the year he married the love of his life, June Carter. So it was a fortunate time for a young filmmaker named Robert Elfstrom to meet up with Cash for the making of a documentary.\n\nElfstrom traveled with Cash for several months in late 1968 and early 1969. The resulting film, Johnny Cash: The Man, His World, His Music, is a revealing look at Cash, his creative process and his ties to family. Elfstrom followed along on a tour that took Cash and his group (including, at different times, Chet Atkins and the Carter Family singers) to a wide range of places, including a prison, an Indian reservation and Cash's own native soil in the American South. Cash and Carter visit his parents and other family members, and in one moving scene Cash returns to his abandoned childhood home in Dyess, Arkansas, a cotton farming town that was created under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program in the 1930s to give poor families a chance to start over.\n\nThe film gives some sense of the complexity of Cash's personality. There is one scene near the beginning, for example, in which Cash goes hunting and wounds a crow. He then cradles the injured bird in his hands and talks friendly to it. \"That scene, to me, says a lot about who Johnny Cash is,\" Elfstrom told PBS in a 2008 interview. \"John was not always warm and fuzzy like a panda bear all the time. He's like that part of the time, but he also has a sharp edge and steeliness to him.\" Elfstrom went on to describe the situation:\n\nOne day, we were hanging out in his house, and he said, \"I want to go hunting.\" He grabbed his shotgun and was walking through the land around his house when he spied a crow and whipped off a shot. John was a dead shot, so he wounded the crow, and the bird hit the ground. When he picked up the crow, you could feel that something was going through John's head; he'd almost killed something that maybe he shouldn't have, and he felt badly about it, but that instinct to hunt and wound was a part of him too. So John carried the crow and sat down in the shade, and I could see he was kind of pissed off at himself. I kept some distance from him, and the next thing I knew, he was writing a song to the crow.\n\nOne of the most striking things about Elfstrom's film is the way it manages, despite the constraints of the cinéma vérité form, to connect the events of Cash's life to his music. For example, at one point Cash is walking through the barren village of Wounded Knee in South Dakota, listening to the story of the massacre of 1890 from one of the descendants of the victims, and in the next scene he is singing \"Big Foot,\" his song about the tragedy. The film shows Cash's generosity toward unknown musicians. It also offers a glimpse of his close friendship with the young Bob Dylan. When Cash and Dylan got together in February of 1969 for a recording session in Nashville, Elfstrom was there. He documented the scene as the two men recorded Dylan's \"One Too Many Mornings.\" Elfstrom told PBS:\n\nJohn and Bob had gotten close at that point. John was saying, \"Gee, I wish Bob would move down here to Tennessee. I've got a lot of land, and we could be neighbors!\" So that was fascinating. We recorded the two of them very late at night, and they were doing a duet of one of Dylan's songs. In the middle of the song, both John and Bob forgot the lyrics. So the recording session stopped while people scampered around the Columbia Records building trying to find the lyrics to a Bob Dylan song. When the lyrics were finally found, the two of them got together again and did some great recording. It was really an amusing session because John and Bob were teasing each other all the time.\n\nThe film was originally named Cash, and was slightly longer than the version above. In 2008 it was re-edited and renamed Johnny Cash: The Man, His World, His Music for broadcast on PBS. It's a revealing portrait of the country music legend, but Elfstrom allowed his subject certain areas of privacy. In particular he avoided documenting Cash's well-known addiction to drugs. \"Even back then, the powers-that-be wanted me to emphasize the substance abuse stuff, and I had to fight the entire time to stay clear of that,\" said Elfstrom. \"I didn't want that pollution to confuse the message of what John was doing. I was totally willing to take John at face value, and I think he himself recognized that early on and trusted me. He was a man struggling through life like all of us, doing his best, trying to come out on top.\"\n\nJohnny Cash: The Man, His World, His Music will be added to our collection of 500 Free Movies Online.",
  "latent_10589": "Rob Fahey Contributing Editor Tuesday 13th December 2016 Share this article Share\n\nThe following article is part of a series of daily year-end content on GamesIndustry.biz analyzing the most notable news and trends we've observed over the last 12 months\n\n\"Keep Politics Out Of My Games\" was a snappy rallying cry, but it was never an option. The intertwining of our medium with politics far predates the gruesome hatred of Gamergate or weasel-worded hand-wringing over \"identity politics\". Since the very earliest years of its existence, the games industry, its creatives and its consumers have been impacted by and involved with the broader movements of political society. From the economic conditions and policies that drive broad consumer trends, to the opening up of new markets like China and Eastern Europe, through to the censorship debates which raged through the 1990s and 2000s, politics has always, always been closely connected to videogames.\n\nWhat's been somewhat different in recent years is that the influence has started flowing both ways, at least to some degree. The massive growth of videogames' audience has turned them into a mainstream part of culture comparable with, if not yet equivalent to, film and television. Game consumers, especially core game consumers, are connected to communities of shared interest to a far greater degree than movie or TV consumers tend to be, which gives them the capacity to organise and to influence. While publishers and their representative bodies continue the ordinary political lobbying and media relations work that's common to any such industry, their consumers have been slowly feeling out the limits of their own collective power.\n\nSometimes, the outcomes have been wonderful; videogame consumers acting collectively have backed tremendously worthy charities, supported game creators and one another when hard times struck, and through crowdfunding, have taken the lead in establishing systems of patronage for the work of talented creators. These positive outcomes only make the negative outcomes feel all the more depressing; considering the harassment, the bigotry, the outright dishonesty and the malign stupidity of something like Gamergate, and how grossly large it and its progeny loom over the community landscape of videogames, the positive stories feel like dispatches from a brighter, better future that we might have had if we hadn't screwed it all up.\n\n\"Even as the scale of the harassment involved became apparent, and started to gain negative attention from outside the industry, few in positions of authority in the industry spoke out openly against what was happening; many of those who did speak only did so obliquely\"\n\n2016 has been a rough year in many ways, especially economically and politically, but what is most notable and most disquieting from our perspective is that it was the year in which tactics field-tested by videogame-related hate groups came to be writ large on the political stage. In a superb piece for The Guardian earlier this month, Matt Lees described Gamergate as \"the canary in the coalmine\" for the fascist, white supremacist movements that have wracked the United States this year and threaten to engulf several European states in 2017.\n\nThat the paths of fascist figureheads such as Steve Bannon and Milo Yiannopoulos ran through Gamergate is no coincidence. The strong online communities formed by videogame culture lacked immunity to their tactics. What began by stoking the flames of the \"edgelord\" trolling groups that have been the disaffected, grotesquely bigoted underbelly of the gaming world for years ballooned into something far more dangerous as the self-appointed leaders of the movement realised that the balkanisation of media consumption left many game consumers willing, even happy, to believe even the most facile and easily disproven lies, as long as they supported their personal biases and narratives.\n\nEvery time this year that you read about how political discourse has become \"post-truth\", about \"fake news\" flooding the Internet and the worrying degree to which people seem unable to judge the reliability of their sources, remember that it started in our communities, with game consumers. Gamergate didn't invent online mobs, and it certainly didn't invent the resurgence of fascism, but it was the proof of concept for turning those things into tools of a mainstream political campaign. Gamergate took disaffected, bored youths - primarily white, male, straight and harbouring discomfort with social progress and its impact on their personal social standing - and it radicalised them. It fed them a diet of dishonesty, reinforcing the importance and closeness of their community and then lying to them about malicious conspiracies designed to destroy that community.\n\nThis is how radicalisation works; it's how it works for Islamic jihadists, it's how it worked for the IRA, it's how it worked in Japan and Germany in the 1930s. Tell men, especially young men, who are so often isolated, that they're part of a big, important community; then tell them their community is under attack. Once it worked for Gamergate, it didn't take a genius to realise that it could work for a far broader group.\n\nIt's common to criticise the games industry for not doing more to combat Gamergate, and although there's some revisionism here - a lot of critical voices were raised, right from the outset - it's not entirely unfair. There was some degree of cowardice driving a spiral of silence during the whole sorry affair. Gamergate and its message had very, very few supporters among game creators - indeed, it was notable that the only \"industry\" supporters the movement could dig up were uniformly embittered and angry men with failed careers they desperately wanted to blame someone else for. Yet even as the scale of the harassment involved became apparent, and started to gain negative attention from outside the industry, few in positions of authority in the industry spoke out openly against what was happening; many of those who did speak only did so obliquely.\n\nIn retrospect, though, after all that's happened in 2016, it's harder to blame the industry for Gamergate. The entire American political and media establishment was left slack-jawed and helpless by the self-same tactics; nobody, anywhere, has yet figured out how you combat people who don't care if the things they believe are true, and who view calm, factual rebuttal as an aggressive attack on their identity. That's the outcome of radicalisation; it was never a fight that a stern put-down from a few videogame luminaries was going to win, though it would at least have provided some relief and cover to those most viciously targeted by the mob.\n\n\"Game development is risky enough as it is, publishers and creators reasoned, without taking stances on social issues that might be controversial... for years, the industry's mainstream titles have not just avoided social stances, but have entirely failed to keep up with the reality of the world\"\n\nWhat game creators do need to think about is the context they created around those communities, communities which turned out to be so susceptible to fascist radicalisation. It's not very original to poke fun at the people who shouted \"get politics out of my games!\" before going back to don the virtual boots of a heavily armoured white US soldier shooting wave after wave of nondescript brown people in a dusty, bombed-out Middle Eastern village - but the failure to recognise that a blind acceptance of the status quo is every bit as political as a challenge to the same status quo isn't the only problem here. As games became a bigger, more important and more influential medium year on year, it continued to pump out games like that; games that powerfully reinforced negative stereotypes of non-whites, especially Arabic peoples, that reduced the majority of their female characters to male fantasy objects, and that erased the existence of other minorities almost entirely, or introduced them merely to be the butt of outdated punchlines.\n\nI know why that happened. We all know. Games didn't keep up with the progress of modern America (or Europe, or even Japan). Doing so would be a risk; it might cause a backlash. It might hurt profits. Game development is risky enough as it is, publishers and creators reasoned, without taking stances on social issues that might be controversial. In so thinking, they ended up actually being regressive; for years, the industry's mainstream titles have not just avoided social stances, but have entirely failed to keep up with the reality of the world. Even Hollywood, even comic books, for god's sake, have managed to make incremental, if imperfect, improvements in reflecting the world in its diversity instead of constantly lionising the straight white American male and treating everyone else on the planet as something for him to shoot, screw or laugh at. Meanwhile games continued to turn out experiences that pretended the world hadn't progressed since the 1980s.\n\nNot All Games, of course, but plenty, representing a majority of the industry's sales. Is it any surprise that people uncomfortable with that progress found themselves coalescing around games - around a medium that quietly, by omission rather than commission, told them that their discomfort was okay? Is it any surprise that they were easy to coax to fury, to harassment and to aggression directed at people trying to make that medium more open, more representative?\n\nNobody, least of all me, is saying that Call of Duty should have replaced its burly marines with a gay choir who sang Sondheim numbers to bring about world peace and that all the Spartans in Halo games should have addressed each other with gender-neutral pronouns (though, you know, why not have one who was addressed that way? Wouldn't that have been interesting?). But the endless waves of games which painted the world in black and white and aimed to accomplish nothing more meaningful than fulfilling the power fantasies of a very specific demographic group did help to normalise regressive views and create a climate that was ripe for abuse. This is not the same as the insistence of censorious types years ago that games like GTA and Manhunt would directly inspire young men to kill; that was never credible or supported, and the industry and the specialist media was right to oppose it whole-heartedly.\n\nThe normalisation of people's views through the media environment, on the other hand, is well-documented and understood, and while no game has ever made someone kill (unless we're counting occasional bizarre murders over in-game item thefts, I guess), a steady, relentless diet of games over the past decade has not been the healthiest of media environments for a young mind to mature surrounded by. That's a concern that goes well beyond Gamergate; games reach tens if not hundreds of millions of consumers, after all.\n\n\"The games industry needs to take positive steps to make sure that it's never again used as an incubator for hate and fascism; it could start by properly managing its communities, effectively protecting its female and minority employees, and engaging positively with minority groups over issues of representation\"\n\nIn thinking about how we got here and where we go next, there are two histories which, while extreme by comparison, are thought-provoking. Say the name DW Griffith and most people's instant association is with racism and the Ku Klux Klan; Leni Riefenstahl, similarly, is most easily associated with Nazi propaganda. Yet both were supremely talented and visionary early pioneers of film, considered among the greats of the time - but utterly tarnished, forever, by their involvements with Birth of a Nation (Griffith's white supremacist blockbuster) and Triumph of the Will (Riefenstahl's propaganda film about Adolf Hitler). At crucial, early points in the history of film as a mainstream medium, these prominent and brilliant artists turned the power of film to the service of bigotry, racism and fascism, with which they will forever be associated, their technical and creative accomplishments largely forgotten.\n\nThe sin of mainstream videogames, thus far, has been to be overly cautious to the point of being utterly regressive; to stick to what they knew, ignoring the changing world around them, forgetting that their audience, too, had always been a diverse one. None have gone to the kind of extreme that Riefenstahl or Griffith did, by making overt propaganda; most of these games are of the kind that we'll look back on and think \"oh god, did we really not know any better\", rather than seeing them as tools for the promotion of fascism. Yet; sometimes, they come close. Games like Homefront and Call of Duty have skirted the margins, even by accident - as have several others. It's far from being beyond imagining that some game, some talented creator, even by omission and gutlessness rather than by chest-thumping fascism, is on the way to being our medium's Griffith or Riefenstahl - both of whom, after all, were very commercially successful, and won many awards, even as they supported and promoted a political status quo that we now recognise as utterly horrifying.\n\nGames can do better. They must do better. Games have a power no other medium can match; they can connect us, transport us together to new worlds, let us experience different ways of living and take part in grand events from many perspectives. They can teach us about subjectivity and diversity and perspectives beyond our own. Yet this possibility, when it is fulfilled at all, is almost always left to indie titles that struggle for attention in the shade of blockbusters that rumble along, lobotomised, their defaults set to white male and their voices saying nothing other than \"might is right, and different is wrong\". The games industry needs to take positive steps to make sure that it's never again used as an incubator for hate and fascism; it could start by properly managing its communities, effectively protecting its female and minority employees, and engaging positively with minority groups over issues of representation. We can't fix the world with videogames; but for a 2017 new year's resolution, I'd settle for trying to make sure we aren't helping to break it.",

(CBS/AP) Police say two Montana teens with no apparent \"street smarts\" tried to score some marijuana, but they made one little mistake - texting the sheriff.\n\nAuthorities say a Helena teen sent out a text message last week in search of marijuana, but instead of contacting the drug dealer, he hit a wrong number and accidentally sent the message that read, \"Hey Dawg, do you have a $20 I can buy right now?\" to Lewis and Clark County Sheriff Leo Dutton.\n\nDutton told the Helena Independent Record that he thought the text was a joke at first, but he then realized it was a real request for drugs. He replied to the text and a detective pretending to be the dealer organized a meeting with the boy last Wednesday.\n\n\"The kids knew that they were going to be at a particular store at a particular time,\" Dutton told The Associated Press.\n\nWhen the detective spotted the two boys, who were 15 and 16, and a man at the store he called the phone number three times to ensure that he had the right person.

  "latent_10708": "It’s no secret that I love the ease and convenience of Uber and have been using the app for years. What I like most about Uber is that it’s a cashless service. I love the convenience of getting in and out of the car and not having to deal with digging for my wallet at the end of the ride. However, unlike Lyft, there is no way to add a tip at the end of the ride using the Uber app.\n\nDespite all of the good things to say about the app, Uber has been receiving a lot of negative press recently, and I believe it’s rightfully so.\n\nLast year, I blogged about the correlation between tipping and your Uber rating, and the comments section alone is definitely worth a read. Then I’ve discovered first-hand that more and more Uber drivers are calling ahead to ask for your destination to see if it’s “worth it” to pick you up.\n\nI personally have been canceled on many times, especially rides from my home in New Jersey into NYC. Le Chic Geek recently blogged about her fishy experience, and Pizza in Motion further warns people to stop agreeing to cancel rides when drivers request to.\n\nNow let’s talk about some new shadiness: Uber drivers aggressively hustling for a tip.\n\nLet me tell you about my last 2 Uber rides.\n\nRide 1\n\nBefore I even sat down in the car, my Uber driver called my phone and asked for my destination (red flag). I told him it was against policy to do that and if he was planning on canceling my ride, he should do that now so I don’t have to waste any more time. I still told him where I was going and he decided it was “convenient” for him, so he picked me up.\n\nI kid you not, as soon as I sat down, he started aggressively demanding a tip. He tried to be sly with it at first by saying ,”Can I just give you my 2-second Uber spiel?”. He then proceeds to give me a sob story about how he used to work on Wall Street and how he thinks it’s BS that he gets paid so little from Uber, and that he prefers cash tips at the end of the ride, especially since he is “doing all he can” to make sure I arrive at my destination safely.\n\nHe went on for 15 minutes of the ride. At first I nodded and tried to keep quiet, but after he didn’t stop after I put my headset on and texted my mom asking her to call me so he would shut up, I finally said “look – instead of making your riders feel uncomfortable, why don’t stop driving for Uber all together and get a job that makes you a happier person”. He responded by saying, “you must work for Uber with that response”. I have never been happier to be home after that ride.\n\nRide 2\n\nI recently requested a ride in Atlantic City to go from the Tropicana to The Golden Nugget. As soon as I was assigned a driver, I received this text: I give the driver an A for effort for cleverly for trying to “trick” people into thinking it was an automated message, but I very well know he typed it and sent it to me himself because it appeared under an older text thread between me and another Uber driver on a different ride.\n\nIt didn’t end there though. When my friend and I stepped into the car at 2 in the morning, we immediately noticed HUGE signs soliciting for tips that looked like it was Uber-branded marketing material. If those tactics weren’t obvious enough, he says, “hey ladies, I will turn on the light so you can take a minute to read the signs”.\n\nWhile I understand drivers may want tips, it is so beyond awkward and ridiculous to make a rider feel like they are being exhorted for money at the end of the ride. One recent MarketWatch article states: “Drivers accept tips and, at least anecdotally, a growing number seem to be expecting them”\n\nFirst the record, there have been many instances when I have tipped my Uber driver… especially when I am traveling with my kids and the bulky double stroller. I’ve also tipped on other random trips too when I’m feeling extra generous or if the driver truly does something spectacular. But I will be the first to say that I don’t usually tip at the end of my Uber rides. Mainly because I don’t carry cash, but I definitely won’t when I feel forced to.\n\nA fair solution would be for Uber to install an in-app option to add a tip.\n\nIn general, still think the tipping culture in America is getting out of control. There’s nothing more frustrating than being in a taxi cab in Las Vegas, having an $8 ride, and being charged a $3 “convenience fee” for using your credit card… and then on top of that, a 25% tip “suggestion” automatically highlighted before you reach the final payment screen. Talk about a joke!\n\nHave you noticed an upward trend in Uber drivers aggressively asking for a tip?

  "latent_10821": "Advertisement Gathering of the Juggalos won't come to Mo. campground People living near CryBaby campground raise objections to festival Share Shares Copy Link Copy\n\nJust two weeks ago, organizers of the yearly festival headlined by the rap-metal Insane Clown Posse announced that the multiday concert event would be staged at a mid-Missouri campground after seven years of sometimes sketchy times in southern Illinois.But it appears that folks around the CryBaby Campground near Kaiser, Mo., didn't want any part of the so-called Gathering of the Juggalos, a moniker for the band's fans, who'll have to wait again to hear where the show lands.Psychopathic Records, the Insane Clown Posse duo's Detroit-area promoters, announced that CryBaby Campground's operators have withdrawn from hosting the event, citing a backlash from locals worried about the several-day gathering marked over the years by unruliness, drug overdoses, fights, arrests and deaths.In a posting on its website, Psychopathic said owners of the campground on a 300-acre family farm near Kaiser, about 170 miles west of St. Louis, had embraced the Juggalos since last month's signing of the contract to host the event.But many in that area \"began to raise hell\" about the prospect of the August event coming to Kaiser - \"enough to bring a lot of heat to the owners of the campground,\" according to Psychopathic's posting. Some threatened to boycott the campground, making for \"just too much of an onslaught of negative energy coming at (CryBaby's proprietors) to handle.\"\"They really tried to make this work but with (the) threat of their business suffering long after we have left, it's understandable why they chose to do what they did,\" Psychopathic wrote.Psychopathic said people who already have purchased tickets or rented a CryBaby campsite will get full refunds as the gathering's organizers pursued what was called their \"Plan B\" of a couple of new potential sites they say they already have identified. Those locations haven't been made public.A message left Thursday with Psychopathic Records spokesman Jason Webber wasn't immediately returned. Attempts to reach CryBaby's operators were not successful.Psychopathic had said the Missouri site, near the Osage River would offer an experience similar to what Hogrock Campground in southern Illinois offered the last seven years. But CryBaby Campground also has amenities the Illinois location lacked, including cellphone reception and nearby hotels and shops, the promoters said.It was not immediately clear whether Hogrock again would be an option for hosting the next gathering. A message left with that campground Thursday wasn't returned.Publicized trouble at recent gatherings has sullied the reputation of the get-togethers.In 2010, fans pelted actress Tila Tequila with stones, bottles and feces, and a fan was stabbed. One attendee drowned the following year while trying to swim in the nearby Ohio River. And last year, a 24-year-old fan, Cory Collins, of Harrisburg, Ill., was found dead on the festival's grounds, where dozens of attendees were arrested on drug-related and disorderly conduct charges.The festival organizers considered the site in Missouri's Miller County appropriate and undeserving of scrutiny, noting that the motorcycle club Hell's Angels had convened there twice before. Yet it also had the makings for a culture shock in rural Missouri, where the sheriff, Bill Abbott, recently asked a reporter if the festival would feature Willie Nelson-style music.Sheriff's Capt. Louie Gregory said the department would have been ready to handle the festival and its fans.\"We researched them,\" Gregory said. \"We were learning new stuff every day.\"",

  "latent_11603": "LONDON – Running the opening leg for Team USA in Thursday morning’s 4x400m relay semifinal, Manteo Mitchell (Cullowhee, N.C.) was a pivotal part in helping his team to the final.The Bahamas and United States finished 1-2 in the heat in identical times of 2:58.87, the fastest time ever run in the first round of the relay at the Olympic Games.Without a doubt, it was the fastest time ever run in the Olympics by a team whose leadoff runner broke his leg midway through the race.Mitchell, 25, was part of the Team USA relay pool after placing fifth in the 400m at the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team Trials in Eugene, Ore. Earlier this week in the Olympic Village, he slipped on a stairway and didn’t think much of it – until Thursday.“Three days ago I was going up the stairs and I kind of missed one and landed awkwardly,” Mitchell said. “I got treatment and I was fine. I did workouts, and when I warmed up today I felt really well. I felt I could go 44 (seconds)-low. I got out pretty slow, but I picked it up and when I got to the 100-meter mark it felt weird. I was thinking I just didn’t feel right. As soon as I took the first step past the 200-meter mark, I felt it break. I heard it. I even put out a little war cry, but the crowd was so loud you couldn’t hear it. I wanted to just lie down. It felt like somebody literally just snapped my leg in half.“I knew if I finished strong we could still get it (the baton) around,” he continued. “I saw Josh Mance motioning me in for me to hand it off to him, which lifted me. I didn’t want to let those three guys down, or the team down, so I just ran on it. It hurt so bad. I’m pretty amazed that I still split 45 seconds on a broken leg.”After the race, Mitchell was taken to the Athlete Village medical area, where his leg was x-rayed and diagnosed by team doctor Bob Adams as a break of his left fibula bone.“Manteo has become an inspiration and a hero for his teammates,” CEO Max Siegel said. “Without his courage and determination to finish, Team USA would not be at the starting line in the final. The team has rallied around him and we are all looking forward the final days of competition.”Team USA will announce the final lineup for the men’s 4x400m Friday morning.Visit www.usatf.org for a bio of Manteo Mitchell.",

Filbey PhD\n\nSchool of Behavioral and Brain Sciences\n\nCenter for Brain Health University of Texas at Dallas\n\nDallas, TX\n\nMedical Research: What is the background for this study? What are the main findings?\n\nDr. Filbey: Most studies exclude tobacco users from participating, but 70% of marijuana users also use tobacco. We were interested in investigating the combined effects of marijuana and tobacco. Our research targeted the hippocampus because smaller hippocampal size is associated with marijuana use. We chose to study short term memory because the hippocampus is an area of the brain associated with memory and learning. The main finding was surprising. The smaller the hippocampus in the marijuana plus nicotine user, the greater the memory performance. We expected the opposite, which was true of the non-using control group.\n\nMedical Research: What should clinicians and patients take away from your report?\n\nDr. Filbey: It is important to note that substances interact with each other, and, therefore, combined use could lead to complex effects. More research needs to be done to fully understand the effects of marijuana on the brain. Very rarely are individuals using one type of substance and it is very difficult to generalize findings from these studies across the board. It is hard to know what the effects are of marijuana, for instance, if we don’t take into account other substance use such as tobacco.\n\nMedical Research: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this study?\n\nDr. Filbey: Future studies should consider directly examining the combined effects of these highly prevalently co-used substances. More research is also needed to further characterize the relationship between the hippocampus and memory in combined users – for instance brain connectivity, and the role of other brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex.\n\nCitation:\n\nFrancesca M.

  "latent_11754": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nMark Zuckerberg, co-founder of Facebook, has made his money — his billions of dollars in a short span of time — and now? Now, he wants yours.\n\nHe’s after a global tax to give every man, woman and child a certain amount of money — for the simple reason of being born.\n\nIn a message to Harvard graduates, Zuckerberg first acknowledged how the free market helped him. Then he turned and bit the free market hand that fed.\n\n“Let’s face it,” he said, referencing the time he attended Harvard himself, Wired reported. “There is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars in 10 years while millions of students can’t afford to pay off their loans, let alone start a business.”\n\nNo, actually, there’s not. That’s called success — that’s called an example of America’s great capitalistic system at work.\n\nThat could even be called realizing a God-given talent.\n\nBut now that Zuckerberg’s got his, he wants to take yours — under guise of helping. Liberals and their helping. Why does it always lead down the path of socialism?\n\nZuckerberg, in his gosh-darned earnest, gosh-darned wealthy way, now wants the rising generation to go forth and work for the global good — and as part of that higher purpose, to jump on base with what he called a “universal basic income” notion.\n\n“We should have a society that measures progress not just by economic metrics like GDP, but by how many of us have a role we find meaningful,” Zuckerberg said, Boston.com reported. “We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new things.”\n\nThat means the government — by taxes — provides each and every citizen in the world a basic level of money, no work required. The money’s freely given — by taxes — to all those who are alive, just for the simple fact they’re alive.\n\nIsn’t that great. One of the world’s wealthiest taking a little time-out to come down to the regular folk level and preach global taxation as a means of eradicating poverty. Does that seem a bit condescending to anyone else?\n\nBut liberals-slash-socialists, especially the uber-wealthy ones, like George Soros, are always trying to mask their controlling ways in a do-good cloak. They pretend to want to help the little guy — in the least painful way possible to themselves.\n\nIf Zuckerberg wants to end world poverty, if he wants to help some of the poorest in the world achieve the financial success he’s seen — or at least take a step or two in the direction of self-reliance and independence — he can certainly reach in his own pocket and start the disbursement line.\n\nBut for Zuckerberg, and people like him who want the kudos that goes with philanthropy but not the self-sacrifices that typically mark true charity — that mark the heart of a genuine helper — there’s always government. Zuckerberg calling for a universal basic income is a global tax and redistribution scheme. And that means control and power for the few at the expense and salaries of the many.\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.",

If we fail to do this, the fate of humanity and the planet is literally in the balance. It is possible, people in this country and around the world are desperately yearning for and need something different, for something that is truly in their highest interests. We must draw our courage from those who are standing up around the world.

  "latent_12457": "Paid family leave is finally getting serious attention in Washington and on the campaign trail, as politicians are waking up to the financial struggles of people who need time away from work to care for newborns, newly adopted children or sick relatives. But efforts to create laws guaranteeing paid leave are running into opposition from conservatives and business groups who say, among other things, that such programs will burden business and drag down the economy.\n\nNow a new report has come to the exact same conclusion that past research has: The fears of conservatives and business owners are misplaced.\n\nThe report focuses on Rhode Island, which in 2013 became the third state to approve a paid leave law. Its program allows all private sector and some public sector workers up to four weeks of leave and pays out about 60 percent of salary during that time, with a cap of $790 in replacement wages a week. To qualify for the program, employees must have worked previously in Rhode Island and earned at least $11,520 there. To finance the benefits, the state imposed a small payroll tax, which officials calculated would cost just 64 cents a week for the typical employee making $40,000 a year.\n\nRhode Island’s program took effect one year ago, and the timing of the report, one of the first to assess aspects of the law’s impact, is perfect. Paid family leave has come up repeatedly in the presidential campaign, with both former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calling for legislation that would guarantee leave to all workers in all states -- and several Republicans coming out against such proposals. “I think maternity leave and paternity leave are wonderful things. I support them personally,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in the fall. “But I don’t think the federal government should be in the business of mandating them.”\n\nProponents argue that paid leave laws have multiple beneficial effects, and they have a lot of evidence on their side. Studies have shown that paid leave laws increase the likelihood that new parents who want to work, particularly women, can stay in the workforce over the long run. Other studies have found that access to paid leave leads to better child health, possibly because it increases the likelihood that new mothers will breastfeed -- or because paid leave allows new parents, fathers as well as mothers, to be more attentive to their newborns’ health and medical needs.\n\nIn every other developed country, paid leave is a universal right. In most of the U.S., paid leave is at the discretion of the employer, which is why just 13 percent of employees have access to it right now, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families. Low- and middle-income workers are the least likely to have paid leave, since their employers are the least likely to offer the benefit. Of course, those workers are also the ones who need it the most. They’re the ones living paycheck to paycheck, using every dollar just to cover rent, food and other basic necessities. Without some kind of income, they can’t take extended time away from work.\n\nThe conservatives and business leaders who oppose paid leave laws don’t generally dispute the benefits for workers and their families. They warn, instead, about the new taxes and -- especially -- the burden paid leave laws put on employers, who must fill lengthy vacancies whenever workers take time off. Such arguments came up repeatedly in 2013 in Rhode Island, when legislators there were debating about their paid leave bill. \"I think it will raise holy hell for small businesses,\" David Bates, a Republican state senator, told the Associated Press at the time. \"There is just no way this is good for the employer.\"\n\nThe new report, which the U.S. Department of Labor helped to finance, represents an attempt to see whether such dire predictions came true. From the looks of things, they haven’t, at least not so far.\n\nThe study actually has two parts. One compared small- and medium-size businesses in Rhode Island to counterparts in two neighboring states, Connecticut and Massachusetts. It focused on the food and manufacturing industries and found no signs that the law had affected Rhode Island’s firms adversely -- although, as the authors concede, the small data size meant that they couldn’t say so definitively.\n\nHuffPost Infographic by Alissa Scheller.\n\nThe other, more significant finding came from a survey of Rhode Island employers that the researchers conducted. The poll asked respondents what they thought of the new law. Sixty-one percent said they strongly supported or were somewhat in favor of the law, while another 15 percent said they had no strong feelings either way. Twenty-four percent said they opposed the program, somewhat or strongly -- a significant portion, to be sure, but still a clear minority. And the survey doesn't even include large employers who, because they have such vast workforces, can most easily accommodate extended absences from individual employees.\n\nIt's just one survey. But the findings echo media reports from Rhode Island over the last few months. Based on those accounts, the program has been a hit with employees and hasn’t bothered most employers. Even some state legislators who voted against the law say they are rethinking their opposition. “I’ve had a chance to see it in effect,” Christopher Ottiano, a Republican state senator, told The New Republic’s Rebecca Leber. Ottiano, a physician who specializes in spinal problems, said he has noticed relatives of his elderly patients using the program to take time off. Had he been considering the policy today, Ottiano said, “I’d probably vote for it.”\n\nThe new study is also consistent with other research and media accounts, including studies of California’s program, which offers up to six weeks of paid leave and has been in place for more than a decade. The debate leading up to the enactment of that program also featured predictions of economic problems that never materialized.\n\nJane Waldfogel, a Columbia University professor of social work and co-author of the report on Rhode Island, told The Huffington Post, “I think our findings -- consistent with those from California -- suggest that these state laws are not having a negative impact on employers. So that’s good news. And we find that a majority of employers -- even small ones -- support the law. That’s good news too.”\n\nOne key difference between the existing state laws and the national proposals from Democrats is the maximum duration of leave. The leading proposal in Congress would allow workers to stay away from work for as many as 12 weeks. The Democratic presidential candidates say 12 weeks of leave is their goal as well.\n\nBut the data shows that most workers in the U.S. take only a portion of allowed time, and in other countries, governments guarantee paid leave that can last for months -- or even more than a year. Research on those programs showed that the result was higher productivity and workforce participation for women, and their economies don’t appear to be suffering as a result.",
  "latent_12465": "Ten years ago, Chris Roberts, creator of Wing Commander, Privateer and Freelancer, left the games industry and seemed to take the whole space combat genre with him. While Eve Online has built a cult following, we never again saw narrative interstellar dog-fighting adventures achieve mainstream success. The genre that materialised so thrillingly with Elite and that gave us some of the absolute best Star Wars ties-ins of ALL TIME, seemed to just disappear into a crushing black hole.\n\nBut now, everything is okay: Roberts has returned. After almost a decade as a film producer, the Manchester-raised developer has announced Star Citizen a vast online multiplayer space game, which he says will combine all his previous classics into one multifaceted universe. Players wlll be able to take part as combat pilots, mercenaries, merchants, bounty hunters and a range of other classes, all with their own missions and side-quests.\n\n\"Basically I've always made games because I'm a gamer,\" he says. \"If there was a game that I wanted to play but that didn't exist, I would make it. Even when I was off making movies I always had the most recent consoles and high-end gaming rigs, playing the latest games. It got to the point two years ago when I felt that the power and fidelity would allow me to do the stuff I wanted to do. I was feeling that, yeah, I want to see this sort of game and no one is doing it.\"\n\nSo a year ago, he started prototyping his concept for a multiplayer online space combat title, employing a small development team that includes several ex-staff from his previous studios, Origin and Digital Anvil. Then, very recently, he started teasing his return to games, setting up the Roberts Space Industries website and releasing snippets of the Star Citizen backstory. Now the project is taking shape.\n\nSet in the year 2942, the game takes place within Earth's vast cosmic empire, which is now being threatened by an emerging alien civilisation – the Dralthi – on the other side of the galaxy, as well as hordes of barbaric space raiders along its borders. Roberts says the idea is essentially the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, but in the distant future.\n\n\"Citizenship is a big deal in this universe,\" says Roberts. \"Citizenship isn't your birthright. There's a little bit of Starship Troopers in there, but that in itself is modelled on the Roman system. You can win citizenship through military service, or you earn it through civic duties, or by becoming a merchant and buying it. That then opens up a new level of other things you can do in the galaxy.\"\n\nAnd from here, a range of experiences are on offer. \"It's not dissimilar to how Privateer and Freelancer worked,\" says Roberts. \"There will be a combination of more procedurally driven missions, there will be specific story missions that we'll be adding and curating as we go along, then we'll try to build a place where you can hire someone to be your wingman who hire them to take someone out - so players help to make the content too.\"\n\nWithin the game, a full single-player campaign named Squadron 42 lurks. This Wing Commander-like option puts the player on the frontline of a battle along the edge of Earth territory, attempting to get into the eponymous unit – essentially, it's the French foreign legion of space. This can be attempted offline, but if you stay connected, friends can join in to be wingmen in key battles. When you complete it, you enter the persistent universe as an elite warrior, like a Navy SEAL: \"and then you venture out into a Privateer-style world,\" says Roberts\n\nOpt to be a mercenary or merchant, however and it's fortune and glory that drives you rather than military ambition. The game's immense dynamic economy looks to be a key element for Roberts. He acknowledges the work CCP has done in this area with Eve Online but reckons the Star Citizen implementation is very different.\n\n\"With the economy, I want the players to feel like what they do has an impact on the events that unfold,\" he explains. \"It's about ownership: I want players to feel like they're becoming part of the lore, the history of this galaxy. So a lot of the tools we're building for the online persistent world allow us to micro update the content. A lot of online games use these big monolithic updates once every year or two years, my goal is to have something where we're doing constant updates. One week we may add a star system, another we may had five small missions on the other side of the galaxy. Developers have become a modern day version of a dungeon master, where you're riffing off your players.\n\n\"It's also a bit like TV. When you write a new series you start with your bible then write the first five or six episodes and broadcast it – if people like it, you listen to what they're saying, and some of the story lines will be adjusted depending on what the audience likes or does't like. That's part of the idea: players have to feel that the things they're doing can ripple out across the wider universe. There may be a news event somewhere or a spike in prices somewhere else, or a battle will result– people will feel like their actions are having an imprint on the world.\"\n\nRight now, Roberts' small, mostly freelance team has come up with an impressive demo, using a heavily modified version of Crytek's Cry Engine 3 tech, but it's little more than a graphics showcase right now. In the short sequence we saw, the player can explore the vast landing bay of a 1km long space carrier, entering a fighter and flying out to get a better look at the huge mother craft (which is constructed, Roberts says, from seven million polygons). Adopting an external camera view, it's also possible to look in your own smaller craft, where your pilot is visible, using the controls and hitting the throttle when you press the corresponding buttons on the controller. Apparently, the game will support both stereoscopic 3D and the Oculus Rift VR headset to add augment the feeling of being in a small bubble in space.\n\nThe sense of authenticity extends to handling. The craft is a rigid body, propeled through space by thrusters working on the principles of Newtonian physics. If one is damaged by a direct hit, manoeuvrability is affected accordingly. Every moving part on the ship (there are over 60 on a fighter craft alone) has a job, a purpose, whether that's the cables leading to the gatling guns, or the missile systems which show an explosive charge when firing.\n\nThe game will have a fixed upfront fee for the initial download, but there are no subscription fees. Extra income will come from in-game purchases of ship and weapons upgrades, although all of these can also be bought with an in-game currency earned through completing missions. Roberts is clear that he wants this accumulation process to be an enjoyable part of the experience. \"I hate games that use grind, that make it terribly boring to earn in-game money so you want to pay for it,\" he says. \"Maybe it's stupid of me, but I won't do that. You build the game in such a way that, if people don't want to spend ten hours trading they don't need to. But it should be fun to do ten hours of trading - it was fun in Privateer! You should have fun doing everything.\"\n\nHe's also keen to make a game in which the little guy stands a chance. Although participants can level up, being 10 ranks above a competitor in a P vs P space fight won't mean instant victory – smaller craft are able to zip around faster than great big space tanks with massive weapons systems; skilled players can compete at every level.\n\nThe big question many will ask is, well, why didn't Roberts just use the Wing Commander license? It's clear Star Citizen belongs in that universe; the craft and themes all scream that. So why no brand? \"EA own it,\" he shrugs. \"I've had discussions with them about doing Wing Commander, but when I build a game I want to do it on my terms - I don't want to be part of the big machine building it.\"\n\nAnd there will be no console versions – not for a while anyway. The game will be released in 2014 and will probably require today's highest-end machines to run it; that may well test even the next generation machines from Sony and Microsoft. But Roberts is unrepentant. \"I'm a PC game creator,\" he says. \"I've been feeling over the last few years that the PC just isn't getting enough love or respect. For me, it was important to come back and push what they can do\".\n\nAnd he is doing that by building the universe he has been hinting at since the early nineties, in full, online and with spaceships a kilometre long. Wherever these gigantic craft are going, plenty of us will follow.",

  "latent_12601": "Real-Time Cameras - Navigation and Occlusion\n\nBy Mark Haigh-Hutchinson\n\n[Gamasutra is proud to present an excerpt from the book Real-Time Cameras by Mark Haigh-Hutchinson, a veteran Retro Studios staffer who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2008 and passed away in 2009. The book, published posthumously with help from his colleagues and friends, is available now. For more information on the book's creation, please read this blog post .]\n\nThe Camera as an A.I. Game Object\n\nIn many ways, the problems presented by camera navigation have parallels within the domain of artificial intelligence (AI). As suggested earlier [in the book], the camera may be thought of as an AI character, at the very least in terms of the determination of its position and orientation within the game world.\n\nThe camera may be able to move more freely than many types of AI characters, however, since it is typically floating rather than being constrained to moving on surfaces or under the influence of a physical simulation. This freedom of movement is one of the benefits of a virtual camera system when compared to real-world cameras.\n\nYet, even though the camera may determine its path finding in a similar way to that used by AI characters, there are usually additional constraints concerning (for the most part) aesthetic issues such as target object framing, target object distance, and render geometry avoidance.\n\nThere are many interesting areas of AI navigation research, such as robotics, that may be applied to cameras. In particular, research toward autonomous methods of movement determination is highly relevant if we desire to have camera motion that is responsive to dynamic game events. The references at the end of this excerpt contain several pertinent examples such as Borenstein.\n\nSince there are a large variety of environmental types, we will assume here that the camera is constrained to remain within a closed environment consisting of a collision surface representation such as a polygonal mesh, with additional independent game objects. Here closed means that the representation of the environment forms a contiguous surface that constrains all usual game objects (even so, there may still be cases where it is necessary for the camera to be positioned outside of the environment).\n\nThe collision surface may be considered as a separate entity to that of the rendered world (although they may in fact be the same), with additional information regarding surface materials stored on a per-face or sub-surface basis. It is also assumed that mechanisms exist within the game engine to cast rays through the environment returning results as to collision points and the materials found at that point.\n\nAdditionally there may be a need to filter the types of materials that are eligible for detection in any particular ray cast (e.g., some surfaces may allow the camera to pass but not regular game objects). Optimization and organization of collision data is not discussed in this book, but the reader is referred to VandenBergen and Ericson for more information about collision system design and implementation. Additionally, Chapter 9 describes some of the main methods used in camera collision detection and avoidance.\n\nPredictive cameras (as described in Chapter 2) typically have better navigation results than reactive cameras, as they are more likely to anticipate changes to the environment that would occlude the player character. Naturally, this comes at additional performance cost.\n\nNavigation Techniques\n\nFundamental to all navigation methods are the ways in which the camera may request environmental data regarding potential obstructions or paths of motion. The nature of the game environment, its data representation, and facilities offered by the game engine will greatly influence the choice of navigation techniques. We may consider there to be two general classifications: dynamic and pre-defined.\n\nDynamic navigation techniques\n\nDynamic navigation refers to techniques that do not rely on predefined information to position or move the camera. Instead, they question the game world to determine how the camera should be positioned on a per-frame basis. Since this can be computationally expensive, a number of techniques may be required to amortize the processor cost.\n\nAn important consideration when using dynamic solutions is that it is difficult to account for the myriad of positions and actions that may be performed by the player. This means that it is difficult to test all the permutations as well as to be certain that no special case exists that might be problematic for the chosen navigation solution. Let us examine some of the more common dynamic navigation methods.\n\nRay casting\n\nOne of the simplest and most common navigation methods is that of the ray cast, a mathematical projection of a straight line through the virtual environment. By using trigonometry it may be determined if the line would intersect with either the collision geometry corresponding to the environment or that of an object within it. As might be expected, this can be computationally intensive especially given the complexity of many environments.\n\nAn important goal when implementing camera systems is to limit the amount of such testing whenever possible. Amortization of ray casting is entirely possible and can be quite effective in reducing the processor requirements at a cost of limiting the amount of information available to use for navigation.\n\nFortunately, navigation does not require a per-frame updating of such information as its decisions are normally longer lasting and may take more time to evaluate than collision or other immediate concerns. Similarly, reducing the set of data to be compared against (e.g., using spatial partitioning or material filtering) is also recommended.\n\nRay casts can often provide extremely pertinent information for camera systems, for example, collision prediction and player character occlusion. Furthermore, ray casts may be combined together to produce a more detailed view of possible obstructions. On the other hand, since ray casting normally involves (by definition) projection of a 3D line through the game world, it is entirely possible for the ray to pass through small openings and thus not register a collision.\n\nNormally this problem is reduced by simply increasing the number and positioning of the ray casts to cover a larger area, although care must be taken given the potential performance costs. It may also be avoided by having a separate collision mesh that only pertains to camera movement and would thus not include such small openings.\n\nAn alternative solution is to use ray-casting hysteresis, that is, statistical information of the ray cast results gathered over multiple updates. From this history, it is possible to generate a probability graph of likely ray collisions and to reduce the actual amount of ray casts per update. The probability graph is then used to determine the influence applied to camera motion. For example, according to the position of the ray cast relative to the camera, we can deduce that lateral or vertical motion of the camera is probably necessary to avoid a future collision if the ray is prevented from reaching its target.\n\nThe results of the ray casts can then be used to dictate potential camera motion in a variety of ways. First, a weight or influence factor for each ray cast can be applied depending on the success of the ray cast. Thus, rays not reaching the target cause the camera to move in a direction away from their position.\n\nAn alternate method often used is to cast rays from the target object back toward the camera. The results of these ray casts are utilized in a similar manner. If a ray is cut short then once again it influences the movement of the camera. The degree of influence is often based on the proximity of the collision point to the origin of the ray cast, or sometimes simply a pre-defined weighting factor depending on the particular ray cast direction.\n\nOne of the problems with ray casting is that the determination of whether the ray intersects with the environment (or indeed, other game objects) is often computationally expensive. Additionally, it is often necessary to apply property information to the collision surfaces.\n\nThis information may be used to determine if a collision or ray intersection is actually valid. It is common that the game camera may ignore a significant portion of the environment if these filters are set appropriately. This is typically performed by a simple masking operation of desirable properties against the set of properties applied to the surface.\n\nTechnical\n\nA typical implementation of simple ray casts would use a fixed arrangement of source positions around the proposed position of the camera, with the rays extending toward the target object. Care must be taken to ensure the arrangement does not intersect with world geometry.\n\nOften the ray positions are arranged in a grid or other symmetric shape. Each ray is given an influence factor that may be applied horizontally, vertically, or both. If the ray cast fails to reach the future position of the target object, the influence is applied to the desired camera position. The influence may even be calculated according to its position relative to the target.\n\nFor all ray casts\n\nIf ray cast successful\n\nNo influence applied\n\nIf ray cast fails\n\nScale influence factor by distance of ray cast collision from target\n\nAdd influence to desired camera position\n\nEnd\n\nOnce the total influence has been calculated, the camera will move toward the desired position plus this influence. Note that the influence may be calculated differently in each axis, if so desired.\n\nVolume projection\n\nRather than simple rays, this technique projects a volume through the world from the camera position toward its target position. This volume is typically an extruded sphere (sometimes referred to as a capsule); for simplicity and performance, it may be either rectangular or cylindrical. Performance improvements can be gained by simulating the volume using several ray casts around the perimeter of the volume.\n\nAs with other collision determination techniques it is important to filter out any unimportant objects or geometry from the potential collision set. Bounds checking of axis-aligned bounding boxes or similar techniques may be applied to initially cull objects.\n\nVolume projection is often used to determine if the camera would fit within confined spaces, or when determining a new potential position relative to an object (e.g., after a jump cut). It may also be used to ensure that camera motion is valid by projecting a motion volume from the current position to the desired position.\n\nSphere/cylinder collisions\n\nThe camera is often considered a sphere for collision purposes. This is partly because sphere collisions are relatively straightforward, but perhaps also because spheres are likely to slide along collision surfaces. The radius of the collision sphere should be slightly larger than the distance of the view frustum's near plane from the camera, thus preventing interpenetration of the camera with render geometry.\n\nThis is only true, however, if the collision geometry of objects or the environment extend beyond that of the render geometry. Note that this distance is also dependent upon the horizontal field of view. Ideally, the collision volume encompasses all four vertices of the frustum at the near plane.\n\nAlternatively, the camera collision volume may be considered as a simple vertical axis-aligned cylinder. In environments where the camera will not move close to horizontal surfaces such as floors or ceilings, this approximation should provide equal functionality to a sphere at a reduced performance cost. The same caveats apply regarding the near-plane distance, and vertical collision must take into account the elevation of the camera, which might change how geometry would interpenetrate the near plane.\n\nIn the case of first person cameras, no collision volume or testing may actually be necessary since the camera should be completely contained within the collision bounds of the player character (it would also be somewhat disconcerting if the camera was prevented from moving and the player was not).\n\nHowever, it is still necessary to ensure the collision bounds of the player are larger than the near-plane distance to avoid the same manner of rendering artifacts as those prevalent in third person cameras. Interpenetration of the near plane is still possible if there are game elements (such as game AI objects) that do not test for collision against the player, or that have render geometry protruding from their collision volume.\n\nDynamic path finding\n\nReal-time or dynamic path finding has obvious similarities to solutions used for AI object navigation of the game world. However, path finding for cameras is more stringent than AI path finding -- aesthetic constraints play a large part. The underlying idea is that precomputed information is available that defines the volumes of space available for motion through the world. The data structure used to represent these volumes can vary but usually includes methods to traverse the volumes through connectivity information (which may also be directional in nature).\n\nTraditional search algorithms such as A* or Dijkstra's Algorithm (as described in many AI or computer science text books) may be used to determine the most efficient path through the volumes, given weighting values that dictate the desirability of a particular path. The desirability determination for camera motion is likely to be quite different from that of an AI object, however.\n\nOnce a path has been generated, the camera will follow the path until it reaches the desired position or the movement is interrupted by a new request. Usually this occurs when the path is recomputed on a regular basis, to account for player motion or environmental changes and so forth. Often the path searching occurs at two levels. The high-level solution determines the overall motion of the camera between volumes, combined with a low-level solution to avoid game objects, proximity to collision geometry, and so forth.\n\nThe difference between this solution and ones used for AI is that the latter tend to deal with longer paths of motion along surfaces (though sometimes flying or jumping), whereas cameras are normally relatively close to their target positions. In the case of cameras, the path information is used more for collision avoidance rather than a complete motion path. Longer motion paths such as those used during non-interactive cinematic sequences are most often pre-defined and do not require any type of navigation logic to be applied.\n\nDynamic path generation\n\nPath generation differs from the path finding previously mentioned because the shape and length of the new path is not determined according to pre-determined information built into the game world. Rather, information about the game world is dynamically determined according to the current situation and used to generate the most appropriate path when required. Moreover, it is likely that this path will change over time, although this may cause unwanted camera movements. Dynamic paths are typically used in situations where standard navigation is unable to determine an appropriate movement.\n\nAnother technique for dynamic path generation is to use information garnered from the motion of the player character. In many situations, a history of player movement data may be used to derive a potential movement path for the camera. If it is known that the player has passed through a confined space (e.g., a doorway), the camera may clearly follow the same path.\n\nHowever, such a path would likely present a very different view of the player than normally seen. Therefore, it may be necessary to generate a volume around the player movement points to find the potential limits of valid camera motion (e.g., as an extruded cylindrical volume). This volume would be used to present a view in keeping with the expected displacement of the camera from the player character.\n\nVisibility and rendering solutions\n\nWith the advent of hardware-assisted rendering, a new variety of solutions became available for determination of the desired camera position. We start with the assumption that the final position for the camera will be somewhere relative to the target object, and that the desired position should have an unobstructed view of the target object.\n\nNext, we add constraints for the distance and elevation of the desired position relative to the target object. This produces a cylindrical band of potential positions around the target object. Further constraints can be layered on top of these requirements, such as only allowing a certain angular displacement relative to the target object.\n\nGiven all these constraints, we now have a small subset of potential positions to be tested for viability. If we were to render the world from each of these potential positions such that the camera was oriented toward the target object, it would result in scenes that may or may not show the target object according to occluding geometry or game objects.\n\nIf, instead, we render these views so that the target object is drawn in an easily distinguishable (and unique) color, the rendered screen buffer may be analyzed to determine if the target object was occluded. If the object is sufficiently non-occluded, then we can consider the rendered camera position as a viable position. Other hardware-accelerated techniques may be used to determine the occlusion of the target object from each of the potential positions, including depth buffer analysis.\n\nBy exploiting the parallel nature of the graphics hardware, the cost of this determination may be significantly amortized. There are, however, some caveats to this approach. First, the setup for rendering the scene from each potential position may be prohibitive.\n\nSecond, although rendering via hardware is fast, it is certainly not free. The GPU and CPU cost may be reduced by techniques such as rendering the scene flat-shaded (i.e., no lighting), changing the view frustum to restrict the scene to only the area around the target object (including far clip plane distance), and reducing the resolution of the rendered scene.\n\nOnce we have determined which of our original potential camera positions is the most preferred, we can then calculate a path or other movement method to take the camera from its current position to the desired position. Although this technique works well in determining the position, it does not take into account geometry intervening between the current position and the desired position. Additional constraints may be applied to avoid these problems. A practical implementation of these techniques may be found in Halper.\n\nColliders\n\nColliders are a variant upon the standard ray casting techniques as previously mentioned. The principle here is that the positions from which the ray casts are made are variable. Each of these positions is enclosed within a small collision volume (typically a sphere or approximated to this by another ray cast).\n\nThese position objects are referred to as colliders, since they are constrained to stay within the environment. Usually the colliders will be arranged in a particular pattern around the camera, such as a circle or semi-circle. The colliders are constantly attempting to regain their desired positions relative to the camera's ideal position as the camera moves through the environment.\n\nThe arrangement of the colliders influences how the camera will react to the environment. Each collider casts a ray toward the look-at position of the camera, or alternatively some other pre-defined point relative to the player character. The result of the ray cast is used to offset the desired position of the camera motion. The amount of influence exerted by a collider may be based on a number of factors:\n\nThe physical distance of the collider from the camera possibly calculated in local camera space and applied in the same manner.\n\nA pre-defined influence factor per collider determined according to the position of a particular collider within the entire group.\n\nThe distance from each collider to the point at which its ray cast struck geometry.\n\nThe acceleration or velocity of the player character, possibly only in one axis depending on desired behavior (e.g., change elevation according to player speed).\n\nSome combination of the above factors may be applied to some or all colliders. Often there are several groups of colliders, each influenced by different factors. The ways in which the influence is applied also varies, possibly using a weighted average or a centroid calculation. Some experimentation will be required according to the types of environment encountered in a particular game.\n\nDiffering arrangements of these colliders may be used according to the type of behavior required for the environment. Circular or semicircular arrangements are common, as are horizontal ones. The arrangement may vary according to changes in the player character, most commonly velocity.\n\nColliders and other ray casting techniques are susceptible to \"noise\" produced by ray casts that collide with incidental environmental features that should not adversely affect camera motion. Some knowledge of the environment may be used to filter out results that should not influence camera motion. Tagging of surface properties may also be used to ignore or apply a reduced influence on the camera position determination.\n\nAlternatively, surfaces may be tagged to act as motion constraints or to otherwise prevent the camera from approaching. The arrangement of the colliders and the amount of influence each applies may require changing according to the environment properties (e.g., confined spaces, vertical columns, etc.) or game play mode (e.g., to match changing movement characteristics of the player character).\n\nTechnical\n\nSince the arrangement of colliders may vary considerably, here is only an outline of the algorithm used to determine their influence upon the desired camera position:\n\nstl::vector influence;\n\n// might be useful as a class\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < colliders.size(); ++i)\n\n{\n\ninfluence.push_back(colliders[i].offset *\n\ncolliders[i].GetWeighting());\n\n// the weighting depends on line of sight and/or\n\n// other factors such as the relative collider\n\n// position\n\n}\n\n// will need to get an average or similar\n\nreturn GetCentroid(influence);\n\nThe arrangement of colliders will change the calculation method used to determine the average amount of influence to apply. A centroid calculation works well if the colliders are constrained to a plane, but however the final influence is calculated, it must also be applied in the same space as the collider's offsets.\n\nPre-defined navigation techniques\n\nMany of the problems associated with camera collision can be avoided by pre-computation of potential camera movement or by using pre-defined assistance based on knowledge of the environment (whether defined explicitly by the camera designer or otherwise automatically pre-calculated).\n\nCamera navigation pre-computation may take many forms, usually at a cost of both memory overhead and time to compute the allowable camera positions, although the latter is not generally as important. Pre-computation typically has an advantage in lower processor overhead during run-time.\n\nAssistance for navigation is often in the form of game script objects placed by designers and therefore tailored to the specific requirements of both game play and environmental concerns. Chapter 6 discusses scripting and its application to camera motion and positioning; however, it is possible to derive navigation assistance information from other game objects than those specifically designed to control camera behavior.\n\nThere are a variety of ways in which both types of information may be used to assist camera navigation and collision avoidance. Many of these schemes share common ground with AI or robotic research techniques, and the bibliography outlines some of the relevant papers.\n\nSome of the more common solutions are as follows.\n\nPre-defined paths\n\nThe most common solution for pre-computation is to literally store entire motion paths. Several games have used this effectively since it also allows complete control over camera position (and possibly orientation), irrespective or directly according to player action. Nevertheless, path motion can be somewhat restrictive and could potentially result in the player experiencing a sensation of lack of control.\n\nConversely, the ability to directly specify the position of the camera is a boon when dealing with motion through a complex environment, especially if the determination of the position can be varied according to player position or action. A full description of path-based camera motion may be found starting with the section Path in Chapter 7.\n\nPath motion behaviors\n\nAlthough the camera may be constrained by using a path to completely define its motion, the interpretation of how the spline actually constrains the motion offers several alternatives.\n\nConstrained path camera. A constrained path camera is one that moves precisely along a defined path within the game world. The camera is typically not allowed to leave this path under any circumstance, unless the path is no longer active. This is one of the most typical uses of path cameras, so the camera position may be absolutely controlled to avoid collision or interpenetration with environmental features, and so forth. Non-interactive movies are often driven by this type of camera (as well as stationary or slaved position cameras).\n\nA constrained path camera is one that moves precisely along a defined path within the game world. The camera is typically not allowed to leave this path under any circumstance, unless the path is no longer active.

Non-interactive movies are often driven by this type of camera (as well as stationary or slaved position cameras). Follow path camera. In many cases, the motion of a camera on a constrained path may not appear as \"organic\" or \"natural\" as required by the game designers, even though the motion along the path may be smooth. However, we may still wish to restrict camera motion in some fashion. A follow path camera provides a mechanism to both restrict camera motion yet allow some variance. In this case, the path only dictates a desired position -- how the camera reaches that desired position can be defined in a number of different ways -- i.e., the camera is not locked directly to the path. This may be likened to a \"carrot\" being dangled in front of the camera. The camera will seek to the location defined by the current evaluation of the path, but is allowed to move in a direct line toward that position (note that this same technique may be applied regardless of the position determination method).\n\nAlternatively, we can use rules to control the distance away from the desired path that the camera is allowed to move; for example, the path now becomes a tube (typically cylindrical) although the cross section may not be circular (e.g., ellipsoidal or rectangular). Indeed, information about the shape of the path volume may be contained within the knots themselves to allow for variance of camera motion along the path (including the radius of the tube).\n\nAnother approach is to use a parametric curve with the input parameter as the position of the camera along the path. These methods allow local control over the camera without having multiple paths. When restricting the motion of the camera away from the follow path, it is normally best not to use \"hard\" constraints as this will likely lead to unwanted motion artifacts. A damped spring or attractor/repulsor may be used to provide a more analog response to the distance restriction.\n\nPre-defined volumes\n\nCamera motion may also be restricted such that the camera is confined by the extents of a pre-defined volume. The actual definition of the volume is somewhat variable. It may consist of a simple convex shape such as a sphere, cylinder, ellipsoid, or cube. Alternatively it may be derived from a complex collision mesh, much as would other game entities.\n\nComplex shapes, of course, make navigation a more difficult proposition. The desired position within the volume may be defined in a number of different ways. Clearly, we can use the same techniques as mentioned earlier in this chapter regarding player character-relative positions with the additional constraint of remaining within the volume.\n\nThis approach is applicable to most of the dynamic determination methods, so that the pre-defined volume constraint is applied after the initial determination has been made. It is typically easier to use fixed dimension volumes, but these could be varied according to game play requirements; for example, the position of the player relative to a reference frame.\n\nIn the same manner as path behaviors, directly constraining the camera position may lead to non-continuous motion and often benefits from the use of forces or damped springs to keep the camera within the volume.\n\nAttractors/repulsors\n\nEffective navigation assistance may be obtained by using attractors or repulsors, where the camera is literally attracted to (or repulsed from) pre-defined positions, regions, or other game objects. Often these positions are defined explicitly using script objects that are placed by the camera designer. Alternatively, offline analysis can be made of the environment to determine automatic placement; in practice this can be a difficult prospect without explicit rules governing their usage.\n\nBoth attractors and repulsors function by applying forces to the camera depending on the proximity (and possibly orientation) of the player or camera.\n\nNote that these forces may not be implemented as part of the physical simulation (even if such a facility is available); rather they may simply influence the determination of the desired position or act as hard constraints during the actual camera motion.\n\nThe use of proximity as part of the calculation of forces suggests that the attractor or repulsor is spherical in nature, but this is not necessarily appropriate. Cylindrical shapes are frequently the most useful, often with their major axis aligned to the world up-vector.\n\nSimplistic shapes are common because of the relatively low cost in the calculation of the proximity of game objects, and thus the forces required. Spheres, cylinders, and planes are common choices.\n\nOne specific example that is often problematic for cameras is navigation through doorways, particularly if the character moves quickly. Other than the problems of ensuring that the door does not physically close either between the camera and its target or on top of the camera, doorways are frequently a problem because they are often confined spaces and there are many opportunities for the player character to move in ways that may cause the camera to be left behind.\n\nVertical doorways are the most common case encountered, where the door is aligned with the up-axis of the game world. Horizontal doorways have additional challenges especially regarding camera orientation due to the potential for gimbal lock. Additional problems occur when external events may cause the door to close rapidly, leaving the camera behind the closed door (or worse, interpenetrating the door geometry).\n\nTo cope with such situations it is generally preferable that the door is held open while the camera is on the opposite side compared to the player, but this is not always possible. Thus, it is often necessary to implement a fail-safe to ensure that the camera is never left on the wrong side of a closed door.\n\nIf the camera system is able to track the proximity of the camera to doorways or otherwise be informed of how the camera is positioned and oriented relative to the doorway (e.g., by means of a trigger volume), an axis-based attractor may be used to help guide the camera motion through the doorway.\n\nA proportional attractor can apply forces to the camera dependent upon the camera position relative to the axis of desired motion through the doorway. Care must be taken to ensure that these forces do not impart oscillation and that they are only applied when appropriate.\n\nConsidering the general case once again, the direction in which forces are applied by attractors or repulsors is also variable. Common usage would have the forces acting in relation to the physical shape of the attractor or repulsors; for example, a spherical attractor would pull objects toward its origin.\n\nThey can be based on a world-relative orientation; a cylindrical repulsor may determine its force from the player character's proximity to the central axis of the cylinder yet apply the repulsion force based on a fixed world orientation.\n\nAttractors and repulsors are sometimes attached to (or form part of) other game objects. Thus, they may vary in their position and effects.\n\nAs with any force-based solution, care must be taken to ensure that such objects only apply their forces when appropriate. Stout discusses this in detail. Ensuring that forces do not adversely influence the camera is the most difficult part of their usage.\n\nCameras do differ somewhat from AI objects in this determination however, since there are additional aesthetic considerations to consider (such as the requirement to ensure smooth motion whenever possible). Thus if the camera incidentally moves past an attractor, it is not necessarily appropriate that it should be influenced. If the camera were moving away from the attractor, for example, we would not wish to apply any forces.\n\nBy careful choice of the attractor positions, camera motion can be made to avoid geometry or pass through confined environments without the necessity for complicated hand-scripted camera solutions. Indeed, the attractor or repulsors can be combined with regular game objects (such as doors) to assist camera motion without any additional scripting support.\n\nFlow fields\n\nFlow fields are sparse arrays of vectors (i.e., directions), normally spaced apart in a grid across a 2D plane or within a 3D volume. The spacing of the vectors is not necessarily uniform. As the camera (or other object) passes through the flow field, vectors that are close to the camera affect its motion by applying a force in the direction of their orientation. The strength of force may be dependent upon the distance of the camera from the plane or some other factor.\n\nThe name derives from the fact that the array of vectors is akin to a stream or other moving body of water that flows around objects. By adjusting the direction of the vectors, we can ensure that the camera will move around obstacles in much the same manner.\n\nThus, it is important to ensure that the direction of the vectors will not cause situations to arise where the camera remains stationary as competing vectors cancel out their influence, or prevent the camera from clearing obstacles.\n\nThe use of flow fields is usually applied as an additional influence on camera motion, rather than the sole factor. In addition, it is necessary to determine when the additional influence should be applied. For example, the vectors could be uni- or bi-directional.\n\nIf the camera is able to navigate through the flow field in different directions relative to the flow field vector directions, the influence might only be applied when the camera motion is parallel to the direction of the vector. Additionally, the amount of influence may also be proportional to the velocity of the camera.\n\nInfluence maps\n\nInfluence maps are another sparse array, similar to flow fields in some regards. However, the mapping of the camera position from the influence map is normally based upon the position of the target object relative to the influence map rather than the camera itself. Each position on the influence map corresponds to a different position in space for the camera to occupy.\n\nThe desired position derived from the influence map is used as an interpolant so that the motion of the camera from its current position will be smooth. In some ways, spline motion can be considered a one-dimensional variant of the influence map. In this case, the target object position relative to the spline maps back to a position that the camera should occupy on the same (or a different) spline. Influence maps may be explicitly positioned or generated offline from collision or visibility information.\n\nPotential fields\n\nDerived from research into robot navigation, potential fields are a promising approach to dynamic camera navigation and collision avoidance. While this is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this book, a brief overview might be helpful. Potential fields are based on the principle of electrostatic forces; that is, forces whose effect on objects is proportional to the distance of the object from the force applier.\n\nEssentially, these forces are applied to the active camera to prevent its approach toward collision or render geometry. Additionally these force components are added to the motion of the camera, aiding navigation through confined spaces and often avoiding many of the problems caused when the camera might be in collision with geometry.\n\nThe forces may be defined explicitly as points or plane surfaces and thus placed within the environment by designers in a similar manner to attractors and repulsors as previously mentioned. Alternatively, their position and orientation may also be automatically generated as part of the cooking of world data.\n\nSimilarly, the collision geometry may be used to generate forces. However, the complex nature of collision geometry would likely make determination of the forces closest to the camera computationally expensive. One possible solution is to generate an implicit surface that approximates the collision geometry in a smooth and continuous manner and facilitates rapid determination of the closest positions to the camera. See Bloomenthal for an introduction to implicit surfaces.\n\nRobotics research has explored these techniques with mixed results (e.g., see Koren). There are some notable limitations regarding the complexity of the environments, especially regarding dead-ends. There may also be oscillation problems when the forces are applied from opposite directions simultaneously (e.g., in a narrow corridor).\n\nRefer to Stout for more information on the practical application of potential fields within games. An alternative and very promising solution is offered in Borenstein, using vector field histograms (VFH). Briefly, VFHs store information regarding the distance of obstacles from the object determined by infrared or other sensors.\n\nThese sensors are typically mounted either at fixed angular offsets or rotate around a central point, effectively casting rays into the environment. The distance information returned at each angular offset may then be analyzed over time. A histogram of known obstacles is thus constructed, providing sufficient information to determine potential collisions.\n\nBibliography\n\n[Bloomenthal97] Bloomenthal, Jules (ed.).

The still image at right is from the video, which can be seen here (but be forewarned; this is not suitable for children — or many adults, for that matter).\n\n[ The Times has published a highly relevant article describing how legislatures in a dozen states have enacted or proposed bills making such videotaping on farms a crime.]\n\nHere’s the dolphin researchers’ not-so-surprising prime conclusion:\n\nThis killing method does not conform to the recognized requirement for “immediate insensibility” [some background is here] and would not be tolerated or permitted in any regulated slaughterhouse process in the developed world.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course given that these are wild, big-brained animals rounded up with methods made infamous in the crusading and Oscar-winning documentary “The Cove,” even if a slaughterhouse standard were met, the controversy would hardly fade. (Watch my 2010 interview with the film’s director, Louis Psihoyos.)\n\nHere’s the abstract of the paper, followed by a brief interview with one author, Diana Reiss, a cognitive psychologist at Hunter College who was an adviser on the documentary and has made no secret of her campaign to end cruelty to this species:\n\n“A Veterinary and Behavioral Analysis of Dolphin Killing Methods Currently Used in the ‘Drive Hunt’ in Taiji, Japan” Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, Volume 16, Issue 2, 2013 (DOI: 10.1080/10888705.2013.768925) Andrew Butterworth, Philippa Brakes, Courtney S. Vail & Diana Reiss Annually in Japanese waters, small cetaceans are killed in “drive hunts” with quotas set by the government of Japan. The Taiji Fishing Cooperative in Japan has published the details of a new killing method that involves cutting (transecting) the spinal cord and purports to reduce time to death. The method involves the repeated insertion of a metal rod followed by the plugging of the wound to prevent blood loss into the water. To date, a paucity of data exists regarding these methods utilized in the drive hunts. Our veterinary and behavioral analysis of video documentation of this method indicates that it does not immediately lead to death and that the time to death data provided in the description of the method, based on termination of breathing and movement, is not supported by the available video data. The method employed causes damage to the vertebral blood vessels and the vascular rete from insertion of the rod that will lead to significant hemorrhage, but this alone would not produce a rapid death in a large mammal of this type. The method induces paraplegia (paralysis of the body) and death through trauma and gradual blood loss. This killing method does not conform to the recognized requirement for “immediate insensibility” and would not be tolerated or permitted in any regulated slaughterhouse process in the developed world.\n\nHere are my questions and Reiss’s responses:\n\nQ. Can you tell me in a few words what this analysis means to you in the larger context of human/animal relations? A. . Dolphins are a cognitively and socially complex species that exist in their own societies in the seas. To see any animal treated in this way is shocking. Given what we know scientifically about the awareness, sensitively, cognitive and social prowess of dolphins, this treatment is unjustifiable and unacceptable and needs to be stopped immediately. In the larger context of human and non-human animal relations, the methods used to herd dolphins and then kill them is off-the chart in terms of any concern for animal welfare. At a time when most countries are concerned for the conservation and welfare of dolphins and whales it is strange and disturbing to see a modern country like Japan continue to ignore scientific knowledge and concern for these species. In most modern countries these mammals are protected but sadly we see these exceptions. Our scientific knowledge needs to transcend cultural and geographic boundaries and these species need global protection. Q. One of the standard replies from Japan on this issue (whether with whales or dolphins) is that we, for example, cherish bison but eat bison burgers. Is there a distinction? A. You cannot compare bison to dolphins in the cognitive domain. However, bison are not killed in this inhumane manner. Nor are lab rats. In cases in which animals are domesticated for food, most modern countries are striving for better animal welfare practices that minimize pain and suffering during the killing process with the goal to render an animal unconscious quickly before it is killed. This is not the case in the dolphin drive hunts. These are not domesticated animals; they are wild dolphins that are captured within their social groups, mother and young, and slaughtered using a technique that actually prolongs death, pain and suffering. The herding procedures themselves are inhumane and may include forced submersion as the dolphins are dragged by their tails to shore to be killed. This is not to say that dolphins should be killed. They should not.\n\nFor more on Reiss’s views, I encourage you to read Claudia Dreifus’s 2010 interview with her for Science Times and watch Reiss’s recent TEDx talk on dolphin intelligence.\n\nIn an interview last month with the journalist David Kirby, Mark Palmer, the associate director of Earth Island Institute’s International Marine Mammal Project, estimated that the dolphin hunters of Taiji killed nearly 900 dolphins and pilot whales this season and kept nearly 250 to sell for alive to the aquarium trade (which is booming in the Middle East and Asia).\n\nIn dolphin research, as in climate change science, a move from research to a mix of science and activism can create complex dynamics. To explore, read Erik Vance’s 2011 Discover Magazine feature, “It’s Complicated: The Lives of Dolphins & Scientists,” which chronicled how Reiss’s shift played out.",

  "latent_13342": "In this series, an American in Paris pits the French welfare state against the U.S. market economy in five key categories: childbirth and health care, preschool, higher education, immigration, and shopping. Read all the entries in the series here.\n\nIlustration by Robert Neubecker\n\nI started the New Year in Paris with a mission: to enroll my daughter in école maternelle, France’s universal preschool program. This required a visit to our local city hall. As I walked across the park that sits between it and my apartment, I felt a little emotional—Sophia had just turned 2 in November, and now in just a few months she’d be headed off to school? It didn’t seem possible.\n\nBut I had no second thoughts about sending her to maternelle in the fall. Though school isn’t mandatory in France until age 6, all 3-year-olds are guaranteed a place in maternelle, and over 95 percent of French 3-to-5-year-olds attend. It’s the one part of France’s educational system that everyone seems to agree is great. It’s also remarkably cost-efficient: France paid 12.8 billion euros in 2007 to educate just over 2.5 million preschool age children—a cost of about 5,000 euros per student, or about $6,700. (By way of comparison, the state of New Jersey spends about $13,000 per student in their own, nonuniversal pre-K program, and Mayor de Blasio proposes allocating about $10,000 per student in New York City.) In the U.S., fewer than three in 10 4-year-olds are enrolled in pre-K programs, and we rank in the bottom third of developed countries in early childhood education, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n\nUniversal preschool has become a hot topic in the U.S. this year, with everyone from Barack Obama to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to conservative Oklahoma legislators coming out in favor of some form of public pre-K education. Politicians, economists, and educators are citing two studies, the Perry Preschool Study and the Abecedarean Project, both of which followed low-income kids who’d received public preschool education. Both studies found enormous benefits in early education; the children who received it were much more likely to hold down jobs, have savings accounts, and stay out of prison than their non-preschool-educated counterparts. Soft skills learned in preschool—how to regulate emotions, how to work in a group—were shown to be helpful later in life and harder to train into people as they got older. Many economists, among them Nobel laureate James Heckman, have advocated for preschool as one of the most efficient uses of education dollars.\n\nFrance has been all over this for nearly two centuries. The first écoles maternelles began here in the 1830s, initially intended as a combination of child care and schooling for the children of poor families. Gradually they grew into a fundamental building block of the French education system. The three-year curriculum is designed to move kids from the free play of the early years toward the more structured world of elementary school.\n\nMuch of maternelle focuses on language, and on achieving a level of fluency for all children regardless of background. Dominique Fortier, a maternelle teacher in the Paris suburb of Asnières, sees this as a major equalizing force. “Children who come from families where they don’t speak French will learn French, and the idea is to bring everyone to a sort of moyenne—a middle ground,” Fortier says. Having two years to bring a diverse population into universal fluency can make a big difference when children start to learn to read and write. As an immigrant myself, raising a bilingual child, I’m happy that Sophia will have concentrated classroom time spent mastering the language, even if it means she’ll probably be correcting my French by sometime next year.\n\nFrench public schools have no official ranking system, which is in keeping with the égalité part of “Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité.” Because all schools are funded by the state under the same standards, they are therefore all equal; it would be unjust to try to evaluate one over another. Also, French schools are not explicitly funded by property taxes, as they are in many parts of the U.S. So at least theoretically, there should be less difference in the quality of schools from neighborhood to neighborhood. Very few families petition to go to a school in another district, and by and large these requests are not granted. Private schools do exist, but the vast majority of the population—more than 85 percent—avails itself of the public options.\n\nThe lack of independent evaluation is pretty disconcerting for an American; and by “an American,” I mean me. I want a U.S. News and World Report ranking system for the maternelles in my neighborhood, so I’ll know which ones are definitively the best for my daughter. I feel both ashamed of this impulse and also frustrated that there’s no way to really find out. I talked to parents in the neighborhood, all of whom assured me that my daughter’s maternelle is great, and all of whom gave me that quizzical Gallic look that made me feel like a crazy American for even asking. I also found out that my family is in a ZEP area, which stands for Zone Economique Prioritaire, referring to traditionally poorer districts where the government acknowledges that the schools might need a bit more help with extra funding and somewhat smaller class sizes.\n\nI’m happy about this, because French maternelle classes are big—25 to 32 children, often with only one teacher. A strong emphasis is placed on children being autonome, or independent, and 3-year-olds must be able to do many things by themselves: go to the bathroom, put on shoes, carry their lunch tray in the cantine. As an added benefit, though, the teachers sit with the children at lunchtime and teach them how to eat in the traditional French way. A recent lunch menu at my local maternelle, posted on the door outside the building, included a first course of leeks vinaigrette and a dessert of cheese and fruit. “My 3-year-old son knows how to eat pasta with a fork and spoon,” my friend Hannah told me. “I don’t even know how to do that.”\n\nThe flip side of this enforced independence is also an explicit teaching of the concept la vie ensemble: learning to live with others. Some of this may be a function of class size, some of it part of a general philosophy that places less emphasis on the individual and their needs. French people are wary of creating l’enfant roi: “A 5-year-old should be aware that he’s in an environment where there are rules that make it possible for us to live together,” Fortier says. “With 30 people in one small room, before you are an outspoken child, you should be able to listen. I have concern for every individual, but I need a group.” By contrast, studies of American preschools (notably by anthropologist Joseph Tobin in Preschool in Three Cultures) show an emphasis on the child as an individual, and on individual choice and self-expression.\n\nIn general, I like that kids in France are taught this kind of social awareness, but it can go too far. There’s not a lot of coloring outside the lines in France, both literally and figuratively. This hints at the one area where France seems to struggle: special education. The emphasis is very much toward mainstreaming. A 2005 French law similar to the Americans with Disabilities Act calls for the integration of special-needs children into mainstream education, and a report last year for the French ministry of education shows that this integration is happening, especially for younger children. This is a laudable goal, but hasn’t been met with the budget to provide enough support staff; as a result, kids with mild to moderate learning disabilities (which include Asperger’s and Down syndrome) can be left to fend for themselves in a large class with a single teacher. In her class this year, Fortier has two children she describes as “seriously disabled” and she has no teaching aides or other help. She is conflicted about this. On the one hand, Fortier says, “the kids should know what a disability is, and if you have a disabled child in your class, it can help normalize this for other children.” But, she adds, “if you have 29 other children …” Fortier trails off.\n\nThough more and more large cities are providing public preschool programs in the U.S., it remains a world of haves and have-nots. According to a 2006 report from the anti-crime organization Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, the average cost of part-time preschool in California is more than the cost of a semester at one of the state’s public universities. Tuition for these often part-time programs can top $10,000 a year. Clearly, people who can send their children to a costly preschool can also afford to give them many other advantages. Universal preschool is an economically efficient way to narrow our widening gap between rich and poor, both by getting kids to a level playing field earlier in their lives, and by giving working families some relief from the ever-increasing cost of child care. Though the U.S. will never be able to implement a centralized government plan with the efficiency of the French, this is one area we should try to push forward—with or without lessons in table manners.",

They hold the record for the most top division titles with 31, however they suffered a forced relegation in 2015 due to financial trouble.\n\nIn Football Manager you take over a recently promoted CSKA side who have returned to the top division and will be looking to take back their crown that Ludogorets have taken firm control of.\n\nThe following post is an overview of the club should you choose to take them on in Football Manager 2017. Go on, be someone new!\n\nThe Squad\n\nTop Players\n\nColombian winger Gustavo Culma is a 23 year-old with good all-round attributes. He is a new player at Sofia and is a fairly low earner. He could be a good performer for you should you play a system with wide men, though he can also play in central attacking midfield too.\n\nDeep lying playmaker Ruben Pinto is perhaps your best asset. He is very versatile in that he can play in most positions down the spine of the team and has very good attributes both in defence and attack.\n\nIn addition to Pinto, you also have three other impressive Portuguese players to use. These three are midfielders, meaning that as a team you have a very good set of midfielders but should look to strengthen in both defence and attack.\n\nHot Prospects\n\nOur first hot prospect in the Sofia ranks is Kiril Despodov. He could, and perhaps should, be used as one of your first choice strikers this season. With a lack of depth up top, Kiril could take advantage of this and really push on towards his potential.\n\nFull-back Stoycho Atanasov is another hot prospect that will benefit hugely from first team football this season and beyond. His attributes look promising; a year of first team football will really help his development.\n\nLike Despodov, Tonislav Yordanov is a hot prospect in attack. At 17, he could be too young for a full season in the first team but it won’t hurt to throw him in the mix occasionally. One for the future.\n\nThe Club\n\nFacilities\n\nGood Training Facilities\n\nGood Youth Facilities\n\nGood Junior Coaching\n\nExtensive Youth Recruitment\n\nFinances\n\nContinental qualification is crucial for this save as you will need to continue investing in players and your facilities. Take advantage of foreign youngsters, in particular Brazilian and Argentine youngsters, who are looking to get into European football.\n\nThe Rivals\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nYour Goal\n\nCSKA Sofia will be playing their football in the top tier of Bulgarian football once more this season and will be looking to find their best form to challenge for the title.\n\nYour goal is to rebuild the squad and dominate the league with Sofia. Eventually you should begin to challenge in Europe and become a European powerhouse.\n\nTake a look at our Social Networks | Follow our Twitter or Like our Facebook Page\n\nThank you for reading our club guide to CSKA Sofia.

In case you've forgotten this is what teenage Cheerilee looks like in the show:Cheerilee is made from minky with a combination of machine embroidery and applique for her eyes and cutiemark. I figured out how to make embroidered lashes also be 3D, so that was exciting! Her accessories are made from various satin, cotton, felt, and sweater-knit fabrics.

Tehran has always denied seeking nuclear arms.Gabriel praised the agreement as \"a first big step\" and said it was now possible for trade between the countries to increase.\"The agreement reached between the E3+3 and Iran in Vienna has laid the foundations for a normalization of economic relations with Iran,\" Gabriel said before setting off earlier on Sunday. E3+3 refers to the group of countries that negotiated with Iran.\"The precondition for this is that the steps foreseen in the agreement are now implemented,\" said Gabriel.German industry groups have said exports from Europe's largest economy to Iran could as much as quadruple in the next few years due to the nuclear deal and companies like Volkswagen and Siemens as well as thousands of smaller family-owned firms are eager to claw back their dominant role in shipments to Iran.Germany was once Iran's leading supplier from outside the region but in 2007 it lost that position to China, which now sends 15 to 20 times as many goods there as Germany does.Eric Schweitzer, head of Germany's DIHK chambers of trade and commerce, said Gabriel's trip was \"a very good sign\" for business and while German-Iranian trade would not immediately soar, it could more than double to a value of 6 billion euros within around two years.In the medium term it could even jump to 10 billion euros, Schweitzer said.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

Should English MPs alone vote on matters to do with England in Parliament?\n\nThe demand \"English votes for English law\" is reasonable, according to Northern Ireland MPs who have been interviewed by the BBC's The View programme.\n\nBut they also argue, it is not as simple as it sounds.\n\n\"The problem I have with it,\" said the DUP's East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson, \"is how do you define 'English only' legislation? There are lots and lots of grey areas.\"\n\nMr Wilson pointed out a large infrastructure project in England might have consequences for his constituents seeking to bid for contracts.\n\nHe also cited changes in welfare in England and Wales, and how that would automatically have a knock-on effect across the UK, both in terms of policy and finances.\n\n'Difficult to monitor'\n\nEast Belfast MP, Naomi Long, of Alliance agreed. She said the expansion of Heathrow Airport would, on the surface, appear to be a matter for England. But she pointed out this development would have a huge impact on Belfast City Airport in her constituency, and on the wider economy. \"It affects the whole of the UK in terms of how we connect to the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe SDLP's Mark Durkan, MP for Foyle, said it would be very difficult to monitor who was voting on what.\n\n\"It would be a bit like on our driving licence, where we have all the different categories of vehicles. Different MPs would have to check on who's allowed to vote on what,\" he said.\n\nImage caption Some commentators have suggested setting up an new English Parliament or Assembly, separate from the House of Commons, to deal with matters affecting England\n\nThe Foyle MP added that the logic of the argument for change opens other questions about our form of government.\n\n\"What I can't understand,\" said Mr Durkan, \"is why people now campaigning very hard to stop elected members in the Commons voting on some matters seem to be quite content to have a lot of unelected members from all over the place in the House of Lords deciding legislation.\n\n\"So if you are going to reform things in the House of Commons then it makes the case for reform or even abolition in terms of the House of Lords.\"\n\nHe suggested one solution could be giving cities more power to make decisions.\n\n'Recipe for deadlock'\n\nOthers suggest an English parliament or assembly, separate from the Commons which would deal with defence and foreign affairs, for example.\n\nProfessor of politics Rick Wilford, from Queen's University, Belfast, said this poses problems, not least if you had an English first minister who hailed from a different party than the prime minister. He said it could be a recipe for deadlock.\n\nThere are also warnings that opening the debate over political reform will lead to change in how the UK money pot is distributed.\n\n\"With a very low taxable base and with an underdeveloped private sector that could lead to the gradual further impoverishment of Northern Ireland... I'm not being a Cassandra here - but that is a potential risk.\"\n\nAll agree, however, that the status quo is not an option.\n\n'Fair voice'\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron has promised to devolve more powers to Scotland within months, with promises of UK-wide reform also, though the latter will take longer.\n\nIn the wake of the Scottish vote, Mr Cameron said: \"I have long believed a crucial part missing from this discussion is England. We have heard the voice of Scotland and now the millions of voices of England must now be heard.\"\n\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage has said there is no choice. \"I'll tell you something. If we don't give the English a fair voice, we won't have a union. England will break away. England will say 'enough is enough is enough'. To save the union we need devolution that works for everybody,\" he added.\n\n\"We are on the cusp of major constitutional reform,\" according to Prof Wilford.\n\nThe challenge is for our politicians to reach agreement on what is best for Northern Ireland and then make their case at the table.",

The cost of natural gas for home consumption (-8.4 per cent) and electricity (-5.5 per cent) also fell,” he said.\n\nHirsch said a general easing of inflation due to lower demand could still be seen in Alberta in the coming months.\n\n“Low price pressures are often a sign of a feeble economy and weak consumer spending. Despite a much softer economy in Alberta this year, faltering consumer demand doesn’t yet appear to be a factor in overall inflation” he said.\n\nStatistics Canada said lower energy prices continued to moderate the year-over-year rise in the CPI across Canada, led by the gasoline index which was down 12.6 per cent from a year ago. Consumers paid 3.6 per cent more for food in August compared with the same month a year ago, it said. Prices for food purchased from stores were up 4 per cent.\n\nThe Bank of Canada’s core index was up 2.1 per cent in the 12 months to August.\n\n“Overall, this latest inflation reading is unlikely to sway (the Bank of Canada) one way or the other regarding its neutral outlook on rates,” said David Madani, economist with Capital Economics. “But that could all change quickly if the economy underperforms the Bank’s growth assumptions as we expect.\n\n“In addition, with the U.S. Fed dilly-dallying and the Canadian dollar nudging higher, we still think that there is a good chance that the Bank will cut rates by another 25 basis points before year end.”\n\nDina Ignjatovic, of TD Economics, said oil and gasoline prices remain well below levels seen a year ago and continue to weigh on headline inflation.\n\n“However, the significant depreciation in the Canadian dollar over the last year has made imported goods more expensive, which has helped to keep core inflation above the Bank of Canada’s two per cent target,” she said.\n\nmtoneguzzi@calgaryherald.com\n\nTwitter.com/MTone123",
  "latent_14110": "If you try to install the TokuDB storage engine on a modern Linux distribution it might fail with following error message:\n\n2014-07-17 19:02:55 13865 [ERROR] TokuDB will not run with transparent huge pages enabled.\n\n2014-07-17 19:02:55 13865 [ERROR] Please disable them to continue.\n\n2014-07-17 19:02:55 13865 [ERROR] (echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled)\n\nYou might be curious why TokuDB refuses to start with Transparent HugePages. Are they not a good thing… allowing smaller kernel page tables and less TLB misses when accessing data in the buffer pool? I was curious, so I asked Tim Callaghan this very question.\n\nThis problem originates with TokuDB using jemalloc memory allocator, which uses a particular trick to deal with memory fragmentation. The classical problem with memory allocators is fragmentation – if you allocated a say 2MB chunk from the operating system (typically using mmap), as the process runs it is likely some of that 2MB memory block will become free but not all of it, hence it can’t be given back to operating system completely. jemalloc uses a clever trick being able to give back portions of memory allocated in such a way through madvise(…, MADV_DONTNEED) call.\n\nNow what happens when you use transparent huge pages? In this case the operating system (and CPU, really) works with pages of a much larger size which only can be unmapped from the address space in its entirety – which does not work when smaller objects are freed which produce smaller free “holes.”\n\nAs a result, without being able to free memory efficiently the amount of allocated memory may grow unbound until the process starts to swap out – and in the end being killed by “out of memory” killer at least under some workloads. This is not a behavior you want to see from the database server. As such requiring to disable huge pages is a better choice.\n\nHaving said that this is pretty crude requirement/solution – disabling huge pages on complete operating system image to make one application work while others might be negatively impacted. I hope with a future jemalloc version/kernel releases there will be solution where jemalloc simply prevents huge pages usage for its allocations.\n\nUsing jemalloc and its approach to remove pages from resident space also makes TokuDB a lot different than typical MySQL instances running Innodb from the process space. With Innodb VSZ and RSS are often close. In fact we often monitor VSZ to ensure it is not excessively large to avoid danger of process starting to swap actively or be killed with OOM killer. TokuDB however often can look like this\n\n[root@smt1 mysql]# ps aux | grep mysqld\n\nmysql 14604 21.8 50.6 12922416 4083016 pts/0 Sl Jul17 1453:27 /usr/sbin/mysqld –basedir=/usr –datadir=/var/lib/mysql –plugin-dir=/usr/lib64/mysql/plugin –user=mysql –log-error=/var/lib/mysql/smt1.pz.percona.com.err –pid-file=/var/lib/mysql/smt1.pz.percona.com.pid\n\nroot 28937 0.0 0.0 103244 852 pts/2 S+ 10:38 0:00 grep mysqld\n\nIn this case TokuDB is run with defaults on 8GB system – it takes approximately 50% of memory in terms of RSS size, however the VSZ of the process is over 12GB – this is a lot more than memory available.\n\nThis is completely fine for TokuDB. If I would not have Transparent HugePages disabled, though, my RSS would be a lot closer to VSZ causing intense swapping or even process killed by OOM killer.\n\nIn addition to explaining this to me, Tim Callaghan was also kind enough to share some links on this issue from other companies such as Oracle, NuoDB , Splunk, SAP, SAP(2), which provide more background information on this topic.",
  "latent_14267": "A clique of individuals, many of whom hold themselves out as advocates of the Syrian rebels, pressured a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter at the University of North Carolina and convinced the chapter to cancel an event with journalist Rania Khalek.\n\nThe individuals employed pressure in the same manner that pro-Israel students and groups typically employ pressure to shut down pro-Palestine events that they perceive to be unjustifiably against Israel.\n\n“An Evening With Rania Khalek” was scheduled for February 27. It was co-sponsored by the Black Student Movement and Criminal Justice Awareness and Action. It was promoted as an opportunity for students to hear about the “role Israel plays in training the U.S. police force and how this impacts the lives of disenfranchised communities from Palestine to Baltimore and beyond.”\n\nShe was also expected to highlight Israel’s influence on the “United States’ border security and its use of drones as weapons of destruction.” The chapter expected her to address the implications of President Donald Trump’s election on Palestine.\n\nEvent organizers described Khalek as “an outspoken independent journalist known for her groundbreaking work covering Palestine and Syria,” but at no point was Khalek planning to talk about the conflict in Syria.\n\nOn February 26, she was informed the event was canceled after several complaints, which were primarily posted to the Facebook page for the event.\n\n“They received several complaints that I’m pro-Assad and that I’m anti-Muslim,” Khalek told Shadowproof.\n\nAccording to Khalek, organizers invited her to speak at an event in January. She had to reschedule the event to February, and the February date was set a couple weeks ago. The intense pressure against SJP did not publicly manifest itself until February 25.\n\n“After receiving much feedback and after careful consideration, we have decided to cancel tomorrow’s event with Rania Khalek,” the UNC SJP chapter announced. “We do not endorse nor reject her views on the Syrian civil war as they remain relatively unclear, according to our members’ diverse opinions of Rania’s analyses.”\n\n“Although Rania was not going to speak about Syria, we understand the Syrian conflict is a contentious issue and the invitation was met with a lot of anger. We appreciate the concerns of those who have reached out to us, especially our Syrian supporters, and believe her invitation would mistakenly imply SJP to hold such views. SJP supports liberation movements for all oppressed people and recognizes their right to self-determination,” the chapter added.\n\n“Enemies Of Mankind”\n\nThe cancellation was celebrated by Idrees Ahmad, a journalist whose work has been published by The Guardian, The Nation, The Daily Beast, Vice News, The New Republic, and The Atlantic. Sarab Abu Adib al-Jijakli, a Syrian American community organizer, advertising executive, and the national president of the Network of Arab American Professionals, praised the chapter.\n\nMichael D. Weiss, a Daily Beast contributor, was pleased. Sana Saeed and Amr Kawji, both affiliated with AJ Plus, were glad the chapter canceled the event. But none was as proud of the students in the UNC SJP chapter as Oz Katerji.\n\nKaterji works for the Turkish State Broadcaster, TRT World, and when asked how much damage he would like to see inflicted upon Khalek and her journalistic career, he responded, “I will never stop fighting against Assad’s propaganda campaign, over my dead body.”\n\nAsked if Katerji would like to see nobody donate to her work ever again, he admitted, “Yes, that would be preferable. Maybe one day you will all apologize for your shameful politics but that won’t stop me.”\n\n“I will never stop. Not with any of you. I will never rest while you are given platforms or publishing opportunities,” Katerji proclaimed. He maintained Khalek is “no journalist” but rather a “shill” for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Iran. He described people like Khalek as enemies of mankind and hoped God would have mercy on her because he had no plans to show mercy.\n\nKaterji has not publicly indicated whether he contacted the SJP chapter to lobby for the cancellation of Khalek’s event. Regardless, his conduct exemplifies the kind of overzealous and malicious nature of activists, who are committed to inflicting a kind of economic violence against people who offer effective nuanced analyses about Syria and refuse to toe their line.\n\n“A tightly-knit network of Syrian regime change activists has composed a de facto blacklist of those who have refused to toe their ruthlessly enforced, hyper-sectarian ideological line,” journalist Max Blumenthal wrote. “Their goal is to deny the message by destroying the messenger.”\n\nAccording to Blumenthal, who has also had his professional career targeted by Katerji, he has “worked enthusiastically with Israeli aid organizations and demonized leading Palestine solidarity activists as anti-Semites, including the founder of Electronic Intifada. He freely admits that a Canary Mission-style campaign is being organized to silence ideological foes like Rania.”\n\nCanary Mission is a shadowy outfit that engages in modern-day McCarthyism to vilify individual Palestinian solidarity activists in the United States. They have directed their attention particularly at students in groups on college campuses, like SJP, and aim to prevent students who engage in pro-Palestinian activism future employment opportunities (just like Katerji and others did to Khalek in this case).\n\nThe effort to silence Khalek escalated substantially in recent months, especially when she traveled to Syria to see for herself what was happening to Syrians in Aleppo. She went on a delegation with Western journalists to a conference in Damascus organized by a nongovernmental organization known as the British Syrian Society, which was co-founded by Assad’s father-in-law. She had her name added to a program as a speaker without her consent. So did a number of other journalists, however, after the program circulated online, she was the only one who was targeted by this faction.\n\nAs a result, Khalek was forced to resign from the editorial board of The Electronic Intifada. She had to leave Damascus and never attended the conference. She subsequently found it impossible to convince major progressive media outlets to publish her reporting from Aleppo, even though it was topical and frequently in the news last November.\n\nKhalek criticized Salafism and Wahhabism, which are ultra-conservative strains of Islam. These ideologies inspire jihadist groups like al Qaida and the Islamic State. She faced a backlash from people accusing her of Islamophobia for negatively writing about these modern far-right ideologies on social media. And, whether coincidental or not, that is when the pressure to cancel her event really escalated.\n\n“Why Is It That I Have To Fight On All These Fronts?”\n\n“I feel bad for the students,” Khalek shared. “They were put under a lot of pressure, and they really wanted to have me come talk but ultimately they voted to cancel it. The reasoning was they didn’t want to have to deal with all this controversy around Syria.”\n\n“I don’t agree with the fact that they canceled it, however, I totally understand. They already deal with an immense level of backlash for their Palestine work on their campuses. So, it’s really not fair that they should have to deal with pressure group attacks from people who want regime change in Syria” as well.\n\nShe expressed immense frustration at the fact that media outlets, which cover Palestinian issues or issues of free speech, have not covered or spoken up more forcefully to condemn what happened.\n\n“Why is it that I have to fight on all of these fronts?” Khalek said. “I’m being completely silenced. I already lost my job because of the Syria trolls. Because all I did was question the narrative around the rebels and challenged it. I lost my job because I went to Syria and tried to see for myself what was happening. I lost my job because of an insane smear campaign as a result of going to Syria. Now, I’m being canceled and no-platformed as if I’m Milo [Yiannopoulos] or something.”\n\n“I’ve never been as marginalized and ostracized as I have been by these pro-regime change in Syria pressure groups. This includes my reporting on Palestine. That never got me this much backlash, ever,” Khalek added.\n\nAmr Kawji said to the SJP chapter, “Save yourselves the embarrassment and cancel your event with Rania Khalek—an Islamophobic pro-Assad propagandist. So ashamed.”\n\n“As a Syrian American (and former SJP member),” he wrote on their Facebook event page, “I am asking you kindly to either cancel this event with Rania Khalek or replace her with a coherent speaker. Rania’s comments on Syria and Islam have been extremely hurtful to many people, and she should not be allowed to continue to spew her propaganda. Save yourselves the embarrassment and please cancel the event or find someone else.”\n\nAdam Sabra, a professor at the University of California in Santa Barbara, also wrote on the Facebook event page, “I share other people’s concerns about inviting Rania Khalek to campus. In particular, her support for the Syrian regime undermines her credibility to speak on behalf of the Palestinian cause. I ask you to reconsider.”\n\nShadowproof reached out to Sabra for examples of what concerned him about Khalek and whether he considered the kind of precedent this pressure to shut down Khalek’s event might set on the UNC campus. Sabra did not respond to the request for comment.\n\nHussam Ayloush, the executive director for CAIR-LA who openly wished a Russian military jet that crashed had killed more military personnel and later apologized, declared, “As a lifelong advocate for freedom and justice in Palestine, I applaud you for refusing to throw the Syrian people and their just struggle for freedom and dignity under the bus. Palestine is too just and noble of a cause to allow an Assad apologist to taint it, even if she claims to stand for Palestinian freedom.”\n\n“We stand for freedom for the people of Palestine, Syria, and all those oppressed. Supporters of tyranny can never be true allies,” Ayloush added.\n\nAs may be evident, when those committed to shutting down Khalek condemn her alleged views, there are zero specifics given. Labels are attached to vilify her without any attempt to back up those labels whatsoever.\n\nSustained Attacks On A Journalist’s Economic Livelihood\n\nWriter Carl Beijer argued people like Katerji are “engaged in a deliberate, continuing campaign of attacks on Rania Khalek’s economic livelihood in order to force her to abandon a political position.” Their hope is to “leverage capitalism towards inflicting as much violence on her.” They effectively, through their actions, are okay with threatening her with “food insecurity,” “unsafe living conditions,” and loss of health insurance. They intend to force her into poverty.\n\nThis is economic violence, Beijer asserted, and why “people of conscience should find this behavior absolutely revolting.”\n\nKhalek considers what she is dealing with to be a form of “economic terrorism.”\n\n“People like Oz are trying to sabotage any prospect for me to ever be able to make money, to ever be able to feed myself and put a roof over my head,” Khalek stated. “It’s McCarthyism at its worst. And it should not be met shrugs and silence because people are scared of the Syrian issue. This is where people need to have solidarity with journalists.”\n\nWhat people like Katerji do works. It has worked against Khalek. “There is a soft boycott of me.”\n\nPart of the attack on her included outrage that she commented on sects of Islam when she is not Muslim. There was outrage that a secular non-Muslim Arab woman condemned Salafism and Wahhabism.\n\nTo Khalek, this weaponization of identity politics to destroy her reputation is similar to how pro-Israel groups target Palestinian voices and work to suppress their work.\n\nHer family is from Lebanon and have Druze heritage. These religious ideologies, according to Khalek, are led by figures, who call for the death or enslavement of Druze people.\n\n“As a minority from the region, I have every right to speak out against the religious ideologies that call for my death. I don’t know how else to say it.”\n\nFinally, while a number of people came to her defense and condemned the decision by the SJP chapter, she believes if a Zionist or pro-Israel group had shut down her event there would be much more attention to the cancellation. But apparently, “It’s perfectly okay for someone to cancel talks because they don’t like someone’s reporting on Syria. I just don’t see why that’s not as big of a deal.”\n\n*Note: The UNC SJP chapter was contacted for comment. They did not respond before publication.",

They were also invited to allow their genetic data and survey responses to be used for research. Only data of customers who signed IRB-approved consent documents were included in our study. Survey introductions are explicit about their applications in research. For example, the ethnicity survey introduction text states that the survey responses will be used in ancestry-related research ( Table S1 available online).\n\nSelf-Reported Ancestry\n\n23 Klimentidis Y.C.\n\nMiller G.F.\n\nShriver M.D. Genetic admixture, self-reported ethnicity, self-estimated admixture, and skin pigmentation among Hispanics and Native Americans. , 44 Bamshad M.\n\nGuthery S.L. Race, genetics and medicine: does the color of a leopard’s spots matter?. 45 Perez A.D.\n\nHirschman C. The changing racial and ethnic composition of the US population: emerging American identities. It is important to note that ancestry, ethnicity, identity, and race are complex labels that result both from visible traits, such as skin color, and from cultural, economic, geographical, and social factors.As a result, the precise terminology and labels used for describing self-identity can affect survey results, and care in choice of labels should be utilized. However, we chose to maximize our available self-reported ethnicity sample size by combining information from questions asking for customer self-reported ancestry. We used two survey questions, with different nomenclature, to gauge responses about identity, which here we view as “the subjective articulation of group membership and affinity.”\n\nThe first question is modeled after the US census nomenclature and is a multiquestion survey that allows for choice of “Hispanic” or “Not Hispanic,” and participants were asked “Which of these US Census categories describe your racial identity? Please check all that apply” from the following list of ethnicities: “White,” “Black,” “American Indian,” “Asian,” “Native Hawaiian,” “Other,” “Not sure,” and “Other racial identity.” For inclusion into our European American cohort, individuals had to select “Not Hispanic” and “White,” but not any other identity. For inclusion into our Latino cohort, individuals had to select “Hispanic,” with no other restrictions. For inclusion into our African American cohort, individuals had to select “Not Hispanic” and “Black” and no other identity.\n\nThe second question on identity is a single-choice question, where respondents were asked to choose “What best describes your ancestry/ethnicity?” from “African,” “African American,” “Central Asian,” “Declined,” “East Asian,” “European,” “Latino,” “Mideast,” “Multiple ancestries,” “Native American,” “Not sure,” “Other,” “Pacific Islander,” “South Asian,” and “Southeast Asian.” Because individuals could select only one response, we included individuals who selected “European” in our European American cohort, those who selected “African American” in our African American cohort, and those who selected “Latino” in our Latino cohort.\n\nSome African American participants included in this study were recruited through 23andMe’s Roots into the Future project (accessed October 2013), which aimed to increase understanding of how DNA plays a role in health and wellness, especially for diseases more common in the African American community. Individuals who self-identified as African American, black, or African were recruited through 23andMe’s current membership, at events, and via other recruitment channels.\n\n45 Perez A.D.\n\nHirschman C. The changing racial and ethnic composition of the US population: emerging American identities. In the present work, we do not include individuals who self-report as having multiple identities, because this represents only a small fraction of individuals in our data set. Low rates of reporting as multiracial or multiethnic is in line with previous studies; an analysis of the 2000 US Census shows that 95 percent of blacks and 97 percent of whites acknowledge only a single identity.Future studies including multiracial individuals might further illuminate patterns of genetic ancestry and the complex relationship with self-identity.\n\nDifferences among states, where different proportions of people self-report as mixed race, might explain some regional differences in genetic ancestry. However, we note that, first, proportionally fewer people identify as mixed race than as a single identity, and second, it remains important to establish regional differences in genetic ancestry of self-reported groups even if these differences are driven, to some degree, by regional changes in self-reported identity. More work is needed to determine to what extent regional differences are a result of how people today report their ancestry. Lastly, when available, we excluded individuals who answered “No” to a question whether they are living in the US. In total, our final sets included 5,269 African Americans, 8,663 Latinos, and 148,789 European Americans.",
  "latent_14392": "Supererogation (Late Latin: supererogatio \"payment beyond what is due or asked\", from super \"beyond\" and erogare \"to pay out, expend\", itself from ex \"out\" and rogare \"to ask\") is the performance of more than is asked for; the action of doing more than duty requires.[1] In ethics, an act is supererogatory if it is good but not morally required to be done. It refers to an act that is more than is necessary, when another course of action—involving less—would still be an acceptable action. It differs from a duty, which is an act wrong not to do, and from acts morally neutral. Supererogation may be considered as performing above and beyond a normative course of duty to further benefits and functionality.\n\nIn Catholicism [ edit ]\n\nIn the theology of the Roman Catholic Church, \"works of supererogation\" (also called \"acts of supererogation\") are those performed beyond what God requires.[1] For example, in 1 Corinthians 7, Paul the Apostle says that while everyone is free to marry, it is better to refrain from marriage and remain celibate to better serve God. The Roman Catholic Church holds that the counsels of perfection are supererogatory acts, which specific Christians may engage in above their moral duties. Similarly, it teaches that to determine how to act, one must engage in reasonable efforts to be sure of what the right actions are; after the reasonable action, the person is in a state of invincible ignorance and guiltless of wrongdoing, but to undertake more than reasonable actions to overcome ignorance is supererogatory, and praiseworthy.\n\nAccording to the classic teaching on indulgences, the works of supererogation performed by all the saints form a treasure with God, the \"treasury of merit,\" which the church can apply to exempt repentant sinners from the works of penitence that would otherwise be required of them to achieve full reconciliation with the church.\n\nIn Protestantism [ edit ]\n\nMartin Luther's opposition of this teaching seeded the Protestant Reformation. The Church of England denied the doctrine of supererogation in the fourteenth of the Thirty-Nine Articles, which states that works of supererogation\n\ncannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety: for by them men do declare, that they not only render unto God as much as they are bound to, but that they do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants[2]\n\nLater Protestant movements followed suit, such as in the Methodist Articles of Religion.[3]\n\nIn Islam [ edit ]\n\nA Muslim must complete a minimum of the five daily prayers, each typically lasting an average of 5 to 10 minutes. Supererogatory prayers beyond these are known as nafl prayers, and praying them is considered to bear additional reward. There are also several other supererogatory acts in Islam, such as fasting outside of the month of Ramadhan, or giving sadaqah (charity, consisting of simple acts of kindness to financial assistance) that is not obligatory.\n\nDiscussion [ edit ]\n\nWhether an act is supererogatory or obligatory can be debated. In many schools of thought, donating money to charity is supererogatory. In other schools of thought that regard some level of charitable donation to be duty (such as with the tithe in Judaism, zakat in Islam, and similar standards in many Christian sects), only exceeding a certain level of donation (e.g. going above the common 2.5%-of-capital-assets standard in zakat) would count as supererogatory.\n\nIn criminal law, it may be observed that state prohibitions on killing, stealing, and so on derive from the state's duty to protect one's own citizens. However, a nation state has no duty to protect the citizens of an adjacent nation from crime. To send a peacekeeping force into another country would be — in the view of the nation doing it — supererogatory.\n\nSome schools of ethics do not include supererogatory acts. In utilitarianism, an act can only be better because it would bring more good to a greater number, and in that case it becomes a duty, not a supererogatory act. The lack of a notion of supererogation in utilitarianism and related schools leads to the demandingness objection, arguing that these schools are too ethically demanding, requiring unreasonable acts.\n\nReferences [ edit ]",
  "latent_14432": "Every well-run firm has to engage in succession planning, but not everyone has to plan for The Succession, as Britain’s royal family is patiently doing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Prince Charles, along with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, accompanied Queen Elizabeth to the houses of parliament for the queen’s speech. Much was made of the fact that it was Charles’s first time to do so for 17 years; even more that the duchess wore a tiara that once belonged to the Queen Mother, loaned for the day by the queen.\n\nThe image of the queen travelling in the Irish State Coach with Charles and Camilla from Buckingham Palace prompted febrile chatter of abdication, or the creation of a regency.\n\nFor now, such speculation is merely that – even if Wednesday’s events came after news that Charles will take his mother’s place at November’s Sri Lanka Commonwealth summit.\n\nPressed with questions about her intentions, Buckingham Palace denied that there had been discussion about a regency, saying that the queen’s robust health continues.\n\nNow 87, she still carries out 400 engagements and went riding in Windsor last Friday, courtiers “let it be known” this week, as these things are done in the world of royalty.\n\nRegencies, in any event, have only ever been established when a monarch has been too ill to reign – although Britain’s last experience in the early 19th century was not a happy one. Then, George III was deemed unfit, leaving his son, George, the Prince of Wales, to take over, where he continued the dissolute life that he had led as understudy.\n\nIf a regency is unacceptable to the queen, an abdication – following the example of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands last month – is unthinkable.\n\nFirstly, she believes strongly that she swore to a lifetime of duty, while, just as importantly, talk of abdication evokes unwelcome childhood memories of the abdication of her uncle Edward VIII in 1936. Then just 10, the chapter was “exceptionally unsettling” for her, says constitutional expert Prof Noel Cox of the University of Aberystwyth.\n\n“When I broke the news to Margaret and Lilibet that they were going to live in Buckingham Palace, they looked at me in horror,” recounted their nanny Marion Crawford. “ ‘What?’ Lilibet said. ‘You mean forever?’ ”\n\nNevertheless, there is a changing of the guard taking place, slowly but perceptibly. The younger royals, William, Kate and Harry, were sent on foreign duty last year for the diamond jubilee.\n\nSo far, the strategy has been a glorious success, from the point of view of the royal family – “‘The Firm”, as Queen Elizabeth’s father, George VI, described it. Indeed, 2013 should mark another good year for royalty, topped by the birth of a child in July to Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nSignificant sections of the British public remain lukewarm about Prince Charles’s accession to the throne, although perhaps less so than they once were. Meanwhile, talk of change has come in a week when the Guardian has gone back to court to challenge the British government’s refusal to disclose Charles’s letters to ministers.\n\nDubbed “the black spider memos” because of his hand- writing, they are known to be frank, opinionated and often seen as interfering by some of those who have received them over the years. Refusing to release them under the Freedom of Information, attorney general Dominic Grieve has said publication would “damage the Prince of Wales’s preparation for kingship”.\n\nOnce on the throne, Charles will pass the title of Prince Wales on to his eldest son, William. He is expected not to reign as King Charles but rather George VII, given the unhappy ends for Charles 1 and II.\n\nMost importantly from William’s point of view, he and his wife will become the Duke of Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge, not just of Cambridge.\n\nWhile the title of Prince of Wales brings rank, the Duchy of Cornwall brings the wealth that has funded the household of the heir-in-waiting for centuries. The duchy is in good health, with its income rising in 2010 – the last year for official figures – to £17 million, which led to Charles receiving a tax bill of £4.5 million.\n\nIn an archaic quirk, Prince Charles is entitled to the assets of those who die in Cornwall without leaving a will – which saw him receive £450,000 in the last year alone.\n\nHowever, even royalty is not completely immune to economic woes, judging by the prince’s decision this week to close a vegetable shop in Tetbury in Gloucestershire, which has sold produce from his Highgrove estate for the last eight years.\n\nBesides the patronage of the prince, the store became well- known for selling perfectly edible if oddly shaped organic produce – the kind that would not pass muster with inspectors from the supermarkets. Three jobs will go, but Highgrove is hopeful that two can be created by expanding home deliveries of vegetables and meat – although that service has been suspended because the absence of spring has meant that there are no vegetables to sell.",

As we work hard to break welfare dependency and get young people ready for the labour market, we need businesses to give them a chance, and not just fall back on labour from abroad.\"\n\nHe said that while immigration played a \"vital role\" in helping bridge skills gaps, there were many foreign nationals in low-skilled or semi-skilled jobs that could easily be done by unemployed Britons.\n\n\"We have to ensure that our immigration system works in the interests of Britain, enabling us to make a realistic promise to our young school leavers,\" he said.\n\nHe said the immigration system must give unemployed people \"a level playing field.\"\n\nIn 2007, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown pledged to create \"British jobs for British workers\" - but the Conservatives said that was illegal under EU law.

If an employer discriminates against somebody on the basis of their nationality, and they are from within the EU, they could end up in legal deep water.\n\nHe added: \"I do not think it is the role of employers to discriminate on that basis, it is the role of employers to take on the best person for the job.\"\n\nDirector General of the British Chambers of Commerce, David Frost, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that employers needed the \"best people\".\n\n\"They expect young people to come forward to them who are able to read, write, communicate and have a strong work ethic and too often that's not the case,\" he said.\n\nAnd Habib Rahman, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said Mr Duncan Smith was issuing \"a disingenuous and populist call for tighter immigration laws, when his perceived problem is from an area the UK government is powerless to affect - EU immigration.\"",

  "latent_14725": "When the Department of Transportation decided to decommission a bridge spanning a creek in rural farming country, they told a local farmer whose properties spanned both sides of the creek that he needed to find a new route to access his property. The farmer, who had been transporting agricultural equipment across the bridge for years, asked if instead he could pay for and perform bridge maintenance himself, or have ownership of the bridge transferred over to him and remove the state’s liability — any solution that would keep him from having to drive four miles out of his way, wasting time and fuel, to use the next nearest bridge. The state’s response was blunt: The farmer was not allowed to repair the bridge, changing ownership of the bridge was not possible and any further use of the bridge would be subject to fines.\n\nWe all want equitable solutions to the problems we face, but increasingly, urban and rural Americans are speaking different languages and operating within separate ideological silos. From the farmer’s point of view, it feels like the powers that be are unreasonable, incapable of equitable compromise, and, to make matters worse, they are adding thousands of dollars to the cost of business every year. We talk a lot about national security, but seem to miss urban-rural disparity as a matter of national stability. We are paying the price with societal discord, heightened political polarization and fiscal imbalance.\n\nIt wasn’t always like this.\n\nTo better understand the source of these challenges, it is helpful to understand the origins of rural culture. Rural philosophy has always placed a strong value on capability. Prior to the rise of city living, the ability to accomplish what must be done on one’s own, often in the face of significant adversity, was a basic necessity for survival. The fact that you may not (even today) have ready help after a destructive storm or devastating fire means you must be resourceful.\n\nAnother deeply rooted value that is still very much alive in rural culture is dependability. No matter how capable you may be, you will inevitably need help at some point, and you need to be able to trust your neighbors to follow through on their commitments and work toward common goals. Without that trust, you might end up in serious trouble.\n\nThe values of capability and dependability underpin other rural values such as practical “common sense” solutions, mutual respect, hard work and community support. Together these ideals define what it means to be a “good citizen” — an important ideology at the heart of the rural ethos.\n\nIf any of this sounds like the cultural backdrop to a nostalgic Norman Rockwell painting, I assure you it’s not. The rural citizens I know are not stuck in the past, but many are also not convinced that America is evolving in ways that are good for everyone. They have serious concerns about our national debt; cumbersome government programs and excessive policies; political gridlock and foggy transparency; decline in living wage jobs; how litigious we are as a society; and how compromise for the common good has become culturally synonymous with weakness.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nThe first and most important step is ongoing dialog, a cross-sector exchange of ideas from government officials, business people and residents alike. This kind of genuine, honest, communication happened more organically prior to the 21st century, but today we need to be more intentional about it. We can’t rely solely on surveys and statistics.\n\nSecondly, more urban and rural people need to attend (and better yet, participate in) cultural and civic events beyond their respective regions. Coming from an urban environment, a rural arts or community event can be a fun and endearing experience. Likewise, attending an urban civic festival is equally amazing from a rural perspective. Again, I’m talking about being intentional, about personal invitations and cross-fertilization that build knowledge and relationships, while deconstructing silos and misperceptions.\n\nLastly, urban and rural cultures have always been different. We can choose to find frustration or beauty in that truth. It’s not enough to build a bridge between silos when what we need is to meet on the ground between them. Only on common ground can urban and rural Americans learn effectively from each other and collaborate as a force of collective wisdom toward greater national success. The greatest potential for attaining the balance that America needs today is in rebuilding and strengthening our urban-rural relationship.",
  "latent_14915": "Although there are many admirable strengths and qualities in Spain's reigning world and European champions, arguably the fundamental basis of the team's success over the last few years has been the midfield quartet of Sergio Busquets, Xabi Alonso, Xavi and Andres Iniesta.\n\nSpain's midfield trio Thiago Alcantara: 22-year-old midfielder, scored a hat-trick in U21 final. Plays for Barcelona, linked with Man Utd. Father Mazinho won World Cup in 1994 with Brazil.\n\n22-year-old midfielder, scored a hat-trick in U21 final. Plays for Barcelona, linked with Man Utd.

One full cap.\n\n21-year-old attacking midfielder, started at Valencia and is now at Malaga. Linked with Real Madrid and Man City. One full cap. Asier Illarramendi: 23-year-old deep-lying midfielder, spent entire career at Real Sociedad. Linked with Arsenal.\n\nWith Busquets calmly protecting the back four, Alonso alongside him to arrow pinpoint passes all over the park, Xavi providing a smooth and stylish link between midfield and attack, and Iniesta weaving his mercurial magic around the edge of the penalty area, those four players have won a combined total of 369 international caps to lay the foundations for a magnificent team.\n\nThe bad news for 'La Roja' (and the good news for the rest of the world) is that three of the group - Alonso (aged 31), Xavi (33) and Iniesta (29) - will probably all be playing in their last World Cup finals in Brazil next summer. The current team is approaching the final straight of its memorable era.\n\nHowever, Spain's mightily impressive European Under-21 Championship campaign - culminating in Tuesday's emphatic 4-2 victory over Italy - strongly suggested that ready-made replacements are waiting in the wings, with this week's title-winners powered by a trio of midfielders who bear remarkable similarities to the players in need of replacing.\n\nThey are not exact replicas - nobody ever could be - but these three young men are poised to become major stars in their own right.\n\nStep forward Asier Illarramendi, Thiago Alcantara and Isco.\n\nTHE NEW XABI ALONSO: ASIER ILLARRAMENDI\n\nA classy, composed, ball-playing midfielder who started his career with local club Real Sociedad, rising to fame by playing a key role in their surge to Champions League qualification.\n\nIllarramendi Age: 23 Club: Real Sociedad Linked with: Arsenal\n\nThose words can be equally applied to both Xabi Alonso, whose reputation blossomed during Sociedad's La Liga runners-up campaign in 2002-03 before departing for Liverpool, and Illarramendi, the midfield driving force behind the Basque club's hugely unexpected fourth-place finish last season.\n\nIllarramendi is one of the more unsung members of the Under-21 side's success in Israel, but for many observers he was also the most important, and it has been no surprise to see a club of Arsenal's calibre linked with his signature in the aftermath of Spain's success in Israel.\n\nLike Alonso, he is the heartbeat of the team, sitting in front of the back four to dictate the game's flow and tempo with a wonderful range of passing.\n\nHis selfless discipline and positional sense provide a firm base for the team's more attacking players to perform with freedom, and the first of many senior international caps is surely just a matter of time.\n\nTHE NEW XAVI: THIAGO ALCANTARA\n\nTo say that Barcelona midfielder Thiago comes from a footballing background is an understatement: his father Mazinho was a Brazil international who won the World Cup in 1994 and his younger brother Rafael - better known as Rafinha - is another product of the Barcelona academy who has made a handful of first team appearances so far.\n\nThiago Age: 22 Club: Barcelona Linked with: Manchester United, Bayern Munich\n\nThiago was born in Italy during his father's playing spell with Lecce, later spent much of his childhood in Brazil and finally moved to Spain as a teenager, progressing through Barca's famed youth system to make his first team debut a month after his 18th birthday.\n\nHe captained the Under-21s during this month's triumphant European Championship campaign, catching the headlines with a first-half 'connoisseur's hat-trick' (head, left foot, right foot) in Tuesday's 4-2 victory over Italy in the final.\n\nThat performance was somewhat misleading because goalscoring isn't usually Thiago's forte - he has only once previously managed a two-goal haul in a senior game, never mind a hat-trick.\n\nBut the 22-year-old is an astonishingly adept technician, possessing a sublime first touch and all the flicks, tricks, stepovers and turns in the book. He's also a wonderful passer, albeit occasionally a little too ambitious, and has long been regarded by Nou Camp insiders as Xavi's natural heir.\n\nSpain at the Euro U21s 6 June: Spain 1-0 Russia\n\nSpain 1-0 Russia 9 June: Germany 0-1 Spain\n\nGermany 0-1 Spain 12 June: Spain 3-0 Netherlands\n\nSpain 3-0 Netherlands 15 June: SF - Spain 3-0 Norway\n\nSF - Spain 3-0 Norway 18 June: Final - Italy 2-4 Spain\n\nHowever, Thiago has become frustrated with his inability to establish a regular starting place for Barca and his failure to play in 60% of this season's fixtures means that the buy-out clause in his contract has dropped from a prohibitive 90m Euros to a bargain-basement 18m.\n\nManchester United and Bayern Munich are among those battling it out for his signature, while the Catalan media has started a belated campaign to encourage him to stay.\n\nEven the man who has effectively blocked his path to more regular first team football, the legendary Xavi, was recently moved to eulogise the young star, enthusing: \"Thiago is an extraordinary player. He is not just a player for the future, but someone who can make an impact right now as well.\n\n\"I'd advise Thiago to stay patient because he is bound to be a success at Barca.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Barcelona, those pleas will probably fall on deaf ears, with Thiago expected to confirm his decision to leave the Nou Camp in the near future.\n\nTHE NEW ANDRES INIESTA: ISCO\n\nWinner of the 2012 'Golden Boy' award for the best young player in Europe; winner of the 2011-12 La Liga Breakthrough Player award; winner of the 2013 European Under 21 Championship MVP award... Francisco Roman Alarcon Suarez is a very, very special talent.\n\nIsco is a lifelong Barcelona fan and has a dog called Messi, but he grew up idolising Andres Iniesta - and it shows.\n\nIsco Age: 21 Club: Malaga Linked with: Manchester City, Real Madrid\n\nLike his hero, the Malaga star is a mesmerising dribbler who possesses balletic balance and can slice open any defence with a sudden burst infield from the left wing followed by a perfectly released pass or accurately curled shot.\n\nFrighteningly, one area where he's even better than Iniesta is goalscoring. He registered a total of 17 goals for club and country last season, including three in the Under-21 Championship and three more in Malaga's magnificent march to the Champions League quarter-finals.\n\nHis talents are such that the 35m Euros buy-out clause in his Malaga contract is nowhere near enough to deter potential suitors, with Manchester City and Real Madrid in the driving seat to secure his services.\n\nEarlier this week, Isco admitted that offers from those two clubs \"are on the table\" and his future will probably be decided by the end of June, with the current expectation being that he will follow former Malaga manager Manuel Pellegrini to Etihad Stadium. If that happens, City fans are in for an absolute treat.\n\nThe move will receive the blessing of his old dressing room, with even one of his team-mates, defender Weligton, recently admitting that Isco is simply too good for Malaga.\n\n\"Isco deserves to be at a superior club,\" the veteran Brazilian stated. \"For his talent and his age, it is the right time for him to leave.\"\n\nWith Illarramendi, Thiago and Isco among those ready to make the step up to senior international level, it's clear the Spanish supply of talent is showing no signs of coming to an end.\n\nAnd it doesn't stop there: the Fifa Under-20 World Cup gets under way in Turkey this weekend.

Perfectly buffed groomers for your pleasure, empty lift lines and a sunny deck… left, right, left, right. And again.\n\nScrew the powder, hell with all the fantasy-life heli-skiing, peak-slaying, deepest day ever stuff. Sometimes it’s the ordinary that’s the reward. On this sunny empty day in early December, I’ve got all the time in the world to ski social hot laps with friends, to smile at pretty girls, and stay right in this crystalline moment in time, to savor it like the pause before the roller coaster starts dropping and I am flung into the swirling white blur of true winter’s frenzy.\n\nLeft, right. Left, right… and it becomes increasingly clear. We are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There’s no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.\n\nIf you need me I’ll be relaxing around the hill on a pair of old Super G’s and experiencing myself subjectively while condensing my energy to a slow vibration.

  "latent_15256": "Cecil replies:\n\nActually, they’re not cropping up more and more — you’re just frequenting a broader variety of public restrooms. Most major American manufacturers discontinued women’s urinals for various reasons decades ago. They were introduced into this country from Europe in the early 30s (along with the bidet, which is still being made), and were intended as a convenience for women who did not want their delicate flesh coming into contact with yukky public toilet seats. They came in both floor- and wall-mounted models, in the latter manifestation looking very much like men’s urinals, and could be used either with stalls or lined up like their male counterparts. Basically the urinals featured a protruding narrow bowl that the user was expected to straddle while facing the wall, having first lowered her panties and hiked up her skirt, whereupon she could do her thing. I’m not getting a good picture in my mind of how this was supposed to work, and frankly I don’t think I want to. Women apparently had the same problem, because the popularity of the fixtures declined significantly in the 60s, resulting in their ultimate demise. One problem may have been that women’s underwear manufacturers never managed to come up with an equivalent to the male underpant, which is (well, was) laden with useful apertures that facilitate the use of urinals. Another likely factor was the increasing popularity of women’s pants, which made using a urinal something of a trial. You still see the fixtures around once in a while, since proprietors of public lavatories are loath to discard serviceable equipment, but they are gradually being replaced by the ordinary flush toilet.\n\nSend questions to Cecil via cecil@straightdope.com.",
  "latent_15414": "We take a look at five Texas Rangers who are participating in winter ball.\n\n*Jake Smolinski, LF: Playing in the Mexican leagues, Smolinski has 10 RBIs on the season, all with runners in scoring position. Overall, Smolinski is hitting .276/.333/.414. He missed a good portion of the Rangers season with a small fracture in his foot but once he returned, he displayed good speed and ability to hit the ball consistently. He will compete for a starting job, left field, or could become the No. 4 outfielder in 2015.\n\n*Tomas Telis, C: The switch-hitting catcher is in Venezuela and currently has a five-game hitting streak. He has just three RBIs the last 10 games and is hitting .265/.350/.441. Telis is the projected No. 2 catcher for 2015 and the Rangers were impressed with how he called a game. Telis just needs to work on some consistency behind the plate in terms of throwing out runners. That will happen with more opportunities.\n\n*Roman Mendez, RHP: It's a small sampling but the reliever has pitched in just two games in the Dominican Republic. He's pitched in 1 2/3 innings, allowed one hit and struck out one. Mendez had a 2.18 ERA in 30 appearances for the Rangers in 2014 and his K/BB ratio was 1.29. Mendez has a chance to make the roster as a middle reliever, but there will be plenty of competition for those spots.\n\n*Nick Williams, LF: He's second on the Arizona Fall League team with 25 total bases. He's hitting .267/.290/.417 in 15 games. But he's just 4-for-20 in the last five games and is just 3-for-15 vs. LHP. Williams played in 15 games for Double-A Frisco last season and most likely will start there again next season.\n\n*Lisalverto Bonilla, RHP: He was solid in the big leagues last season, winning his first three starts and becoming the first pitcher in franchise history to do so. He's got a bright future. In three Arizona games, Bonilla has a 5.40 ERA. In his last outing on Oct. 23, he allowed four runs on seven hits with two walks and six strikeouts in 4 2/3 innings. In his previous outing on Oct. 17, Bonilla threw shutout ball for four innings, giving up just one hit with three walks and two strikeouts.",

  "latent_15597": "Forking is Freedom\n\nMatthew Campbell Blocked Unblock Follow Following Dec 21, 2017\n\nWhat do blockchains, video games, and operating systems have in common?\n\nWhen the creators of a video game change the rules of the game, the users usually can’t do anything about it. But in Ultima Online, the users decided to take it into their own hands and created their own game server. When Android set out to make a new operating system, they didn’t start from scratch, they forked Linux. Bitcoin has a large number of followers, but the community couldn’t agree on how to scale transactions, so groups like Bitcoin Cash have sprung up to add new features that the core community didn’t agree with.\n\nForking is the fundamental mechanism that allows users to break free from tyranny and start their own community. Forking is when a group disagrees with the centralized control structure and decides to break off and go their own way.\n\nWhenever something is controlled by a single entity, the centralization of power ultimately hurts the users.\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin cried himself to sleep the night “World of Warcraft” maker Blizzard Entertainment altered his “beloved warlock’s Siphon Life spell.” After that he realized the horrors of centralized services and decided to quit.\n\nFamous Forks\n\nAsheron’s Call\n\nFinal moment of Asheron’s Call\n\nAsheron’s Call was a long running online RPG, and it closed its doors in early 2017. The game lasted for over 12 years, and at the end, there was still a strong community.\n\nWhen the studio forcefully shut the game down, a group got together and started to record all the game packets. They captured over 131 million packets containing over 224 million total game messages. They had to painstakingly recreate the game server from this data. Its like trying to recreate the ancient Egyptian language from just the writing on walls.\n\nIf this was run on the blockchain, the community could have forked the data, and as long as the community still existed the game would still exist.\n\nThe community captured over 131 million packets containing over 224 million total game messages to recreate the game.\n\nUltima Online\n\nDread Lord — Ultima Online\n\nUltima Online is an online multi-player RPG (MMORPG) that’s still running from 1998. In the early days, they had Dread Lords, which were evil characters that terrorized normal players when you left towns.\n\nOver time, they changed the game play aspects to gimp this, and players revolted and created their own legacy “shards”, or forks, of the game world.\n\nHowever, since they had no access to the game server, just like with Asheron’s Call, they had to rebuild the entire game server from scratch. Luckily, they were able to reuse the client and game assets.\n\nLinux\n\nLinux has been forked more times than anything else imaginable. Even Android started out as a fork of linux. Linus Torvalds is the ultimate arbiter of the main linux chain, but there is nothing stopping Redhat having their own, or Ubuntu. This gives freedom to their users to continue running code for old outdated computers, or in the case of Android add experimental features that couldn’t come into the mainline.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin Fork\n\nBitcoin forks like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Segwit2x are a clear indication there is not a strong consensus among the core players in the Bitcoin world. I think it’s extremely healthy for these forks to exist, as they allow new features to be experimented on within smaller environments, and they make it so a small group can’t just control the future of the blockchain.\n\nGame Economies\n\nOne of the biggest problems with games is that game assets, such as gold, armor, and rare items are not fixed in supply. Even when they are rare, code changes and bugs could alter this rarity at any moment.\n\nIn Diablo 2 there was a valuable item called a “Stone of Jordan” that was used as currency because it was rare. However, someone found an item duplication bug and created tons of them. Developers can also simply change the algorithm that creates these items, and markets can be destroyed in moments.\n\nThe solution to this is running on a blockchain that can be forked. If there was a bug that changed the supply of Bitcoin, a fork would fix it as long as the community agrees. If the developers of Bitcoin wanted to mint more Bitcoins tomorrow, they would have to convince every single node to run their new software.\n\nFurthermore, by putting these assets on a blockchain, we could track all the items in a game and allow them to be traded on ‘exchanges’ independent of the original authors of the game.\n\nRight now the coins we get in games can be diluted forever. The armor we spent hours working to get, can be taken in a moment. Censorship happens frequently when it is run by a single company. If it becomes more profitable for them to mint new items, they will do it.\n\nWe need to put the power back into the hands of the users.\n\nAnatomy of a Fork\n\nLet’s start with a game. What elements are included in a fork?\n\nGame client Client visual assets, like artwork Client/Server Protocol Server Code Database of users and characters Collectible items: swords, shields, magic, etc.\n\nWhen any of these is closed source, the users of the application have to rebuild the whole thing from scratch. Sometimes this is impossible.\n\nOne really extreme example of this was the Nintendo Satellaview games. Where they literally streamed video games over a Satellite and downloaded them to the memory of a cartridge. You could only play the game for 30 minutes, and then it was just lost to time.\n\nLuckily, someone made a video of some of the playthroughs so others could recode the games. There were unique Legend of Zelda games that were just lost to the passage of time.\n\nDepending on how motivated people are, they will recreate one or many more of the pieces listed above.\n\nIn the future we can compel game creators to store all of these assets on a blockchain for longevity.\n\nBlockchain Games\n\nWhy the Blockchain Solves These Problems\n\nRecently, CryptoKitties introduced unique items on Ethereum blockchain called ERC721 tokens. These tokens are unique and can’t be duplicated. Users can fork the blockchain and create their own copy. The full state of the game is inspectable for users to build add-ons for the game.\n\nAs another example, if we look at the Steemit blockchain, it’s basically a reddit clone that runs on top of a blockchain. Anyone can clone the entire blockchain with all the comments and posts in it, and then build interesting applications on top of it. No wonder there are more Steemit add-ons than other blockchain, despite being less popular.\n\nWhat if we could make a copy of an entire game database in a game like World of Warcraft? We could build new quests. We could build guild management tools. We could nerd out for a decade customizing and growing the game, more than the original author ever could have imagined.\n\nHowever, this is still not without issues. How can we possibly keep game assets that are in the 10s of gigabytes on the blockchain? Would it be with IPFS, BitTorrent, or would we just accept centralized solutions and store the hashes on the blockchain? We will explore this more in our future articles.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have seen so many examples of companies abandoning their products when they stop being profitable, or sometimes they change the dynamics of how the game works to appease certain people. In the future, games will run on top of the blockchain, so users can experience the same kind of freedom as those who use Linux.\n\nWhat will that look like? Will we store all the collectible items on Ethereum, or on sidechains? Can we possibly run a MMORPG on the blockchain? Future entries in this series of articles will explore the details of how that will work.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nMatthew Campbell is the CEO of a blockchain startup called Loom Network, which is providing a way for people to build scalable sidechains for deploying Ethereum DApps.

  "latent_15642": "The 2014 Atlantic Hurricane Season is likely to feature a near-to-slightly-below average number of tropical storms, hurricanes and intense hurricanes, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said Thursday.\n\nSpecifically, the agency, which runs the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, said there is a 70% chance that the hurricane season will see eight to 13 named storms (with sustained winds of 39 miles per hour or higher), three to six of which will strengthen into hurricanes (with sustained winds of 74 miles per hour or higher), and one to two hurricanes that will intensify into major storms, with sustained winds of 111 miles per hour or higher.\n\nThe outlook calls for a 50% chance of a below-normal season, a 40% chance of a near-normal season, and just a 10% chance of an above-normal season. The hurricane season kicks off on June 1 and runs through November 30, although storms can form in the Atlantic during December too.\n\nDespite the fact that the North Atlantic Ocean has been in an active period of storm activity since 1995, NOAA officials said that two factors suggest that this won't be a blockbuster season.\n\nThe outlook for the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThe first is the expected development of El Niño conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which can act to increase atmospheric wind shear across the tropical Atlantic. Wind shear refers to winds that change direction or speed with height, or both, and developing tropical storms and hurricanes are sensitive to high amounts of wind shear, undergoing weakening trends when they encounter such conditions.\n\nEl Niño can also increase the trade winds that blow from east to west across the tropical Atlantic, and make the atmosphere more stable, which limits the ability of tropical waves coming off of Africa to intensify into tropical storms or hurricanes.\n\nThe second factor that suggests this hurricane season will be a below average one, in terms of the number of storms, is the sea surface temperatures in the area where such storms typically develop. In recent years, sea surface temperatures have been unusually mild across the Atlantic Ocean, but this year they are likely to be near to below average. Since hurricanes derive their energy from warm ocean waters, cooler seas can further dampen hurricane activity.\n\nNOAA unveiled the hurricane outlook at a press conference at New York City's Office of Emergency Management, in order to highlight advances in hurricane forecasting and warning communication that have taken place since Hurricane Sandy struck the region in October 2012.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS), working with the National Ocean Service, which is another NOAA agency, plans to roll out storm surge inundation maps that will be updated every six hours beginning two days before a hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall.\n\nWhen Hurricane Sandy struck, storm surge information was only made available via text products, which subsequent research found confused many people and made it difficult to tell which parts of the city would be underwater.\n\n“Visual tools are critical,” said Holly Bamford, the director of the National Ocean Service.\n\nSince the storm, New York has established six hurricane evacuation zones that include about 3 million New Yorkers, according to Joseph F. Bruno, the commissioner of the city's Office of Emergency Management. Bruno told reporters that the new storm surge inundation maps can be overlaid on top of the evacuation zone maps to inform city officials of which areas will need to be evacuated ahead of a storm.\n\nIn addition to the storm surge maps, the NWS is also working to roll out targeted storm surge warnings, which would be separate from hurricane watches and warnings, in 2015. Storm surge flooding typically kills more people than a hurricane's winds do.\n\nThe agency has also been making upgrades to the computer models that help forecasters predict the track and intensity of hurricanes, according to NWS director Louis Uccellini. In the past two decades, meteorologists have made great strides in improving storm track forecasts, but intensity forecasts have lagged behind. The newly enhanced computer models, which have a higher resolution that can simulate small scale features such as a hurricane's eye wall, for example, may finally help make intensity forecasts more reliable, he said.\n\n“We’re optimistic now that we’re gonna start seeing a trend of improvements,” Uccellini said.\n\nOfficials cautioned that the hurricane seasonal outlooks don't provide information on where hurricanes might strike this year.\n\nIn addition, the outlooks are often wrong. Last year, for example, NOAA projected that there would be an active to very active season, with between 13 and 20 named storms, and seven to 11 hurricanes.\n\nHowever, only 13 named storms occurred, just two of which became hurricanes, and none became major hurricanes. It turned out to be the least active Atlantic hurricane season in 30 years.\n\nNOAA experts and emergency management officials cautioned that it only takes one landfalling storm for a hurricane season to be remembered as a destructive one.\n\n\"And even though we expect El Niño to suppress the number of storms this season, it's important to remember it takes only one land falling storm to cause a disaster,\" said NOAA administrator Kathryn Sullivan.\n\nThere is one unscientific reason to believe that this year will see a major hurricane make landfall in the U.S. No major hurricane has struck the U.S. since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, which is a record 9-year run without such an intense storm hitting the coast. (Although it was extremely destructive, Hurricane Sandy was only a Category One storm when it approached the New Jersey Shore. Sandy had characteristics, such as its massive size, that made it have impacts similar to a much stronger hurricane, but it technically was not a \"major\" hurricane as defined on the official scale.)\n\nAt some point, America's major hurricane luck is bound to run out.",

  "latent_15785": "Rasheed Wallace, who hasn't played since Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals, will come out of retirement to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers, according to CSN New England.\n\nReports surfaced last month that Wallace was serious about returning to the game.\n\nThe big question with Wallace, 37, given his status as one of the most skilled big men of his era and ability to shoot and defend, is whether he's in shape to play. It's the same question that dogged him during his final season with the Boston Celtics, who, according to CSN, had no interest in bringing him back. That apparently is not an issue—Wallace has reportedly worked out hard and is in better shape than he was before his retirement.\n\nIf Wallace indeed signs with the Lakers, the next question becomes whether the team is bringing him in as a potential replacement for Pau Gasol, who has been the subject of trade rumors and drama for the entire season. Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak said Monday that the team would continue exploring trade proposals after Kobe Bryant stated that it was time for the team to either move Gasol or take him off the block.\n\nGasol, in his 11th season is averaging a career-low 16.6 points and has said the rumors have bothered him. One Western Conference executive told Hoopsworld that the Lakers are overvaluing him.\n\n“I doubt Pau goes anywhere,” the executive said. “I love Pau, but the Lakers are asking for way too much.”\n\nAdditionally, one front-office executive source told CSN that Wallace's days as a starter are over—a fact that likely means that Gasol will be unaffected.\n\n\"His days as a starter in this league are gone,\" said the source. \"I think he knows that, and so do the Lakers. But think about it. Of the big men that are available, is there one that's really better? And if he's gotten himself in shape, adding him becomes a huge get for them.\"\n\nIn 15 seasons with Washington, Portland, Atlanta, Detroit and Boston, Wallace averaged 14.6 points and 6.7 rebounds.",
  "latent_15925": "The Associated Press\n\nCAIRO -- Angry relatives and residents rampaged through an Egyptian port city Saturday in rioting that killed at least 27 people after a judge sentenced nearly two dozen soccer fans to death for involvement in deadly violence after a game last year.\n\nThe unrest was the latest in a bout of violence that has left a total of 38 people dead in two days, including 11 killed in clashes between police and protesters marking Friday's second anniversary of the uprising that overthrew longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.\n\nPresident Mohammed Morsi canceled a scheduled trip to Ethiopia Saturday and instead met for the first time with top generals as part of the newly formed National Defense Council.\n\nThe violence in Port Said erupted after a judge sentenced 21 people to death in connection with the Feb. 1 soccer melee that killed 74 fans of the Cairo-based Al-Ahly team. Executions in Egypt are usually carried out by hanging.\n\nAll the defendants - who were not present in the courtroom Saturday for security reasons - can appeal the verdict.\n\nJudge Sobhi Abdel-Maguid did not give his reasoning when he read out the verdicts for 21 out of the 73 defendants Saturday. The verdict for the remaining 52 defendants, including nine security officials, is scheduled to be delivered March 9. Some have been charged with murder and others with assisting the attackers.\n\nDie-hard soccer fans from both teams, known as Ultras, hold the police at least partially responsible for February's violence, which was the world's worst soccer violence in 15 years, saying officers at the game did nothing to stop the bloodshed. They also criticize Egypt's President Mohammed Morsi for doing little to reform the police force or the judiciary since he took office in July.\n\nThe opposition says Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected and civilian president, and his Muslim Brotherhood allies in government have failed to restore stability amid continued political turmoil and crime, and point to a worsening economy.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, the main opposition National Salvation Front said it holds Morsi responsible for \"the excessive use of force by the security forces against protesters.\" They threatened to boycott upcoming parliamentary elections if Morsi does not meet their demands that include amending articles in the new constitution.\n\nThe Brotherhood said in its statement that \"misleading\" media outlets were to blame for \"enflaming the people's hatred for the current regime and urging them to act violently.\"\n\nImmediately after Saturday's verdict was read live on state TV, two policemen were shot dead outside Port Said's main prison when angry relatives tried to storm the facility to free the defendants. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets, as well as live rounds, at the crowd outside the prison.\n\nIn other parts of the city, residents tried to storm the governor's office, police stations, the power station and the main court building. Residents occupied one police station in the east of Port Said.\n\nThe director of hospitals in Port Said, Dr. Abdel-Raham Farah, said two local soccer players were shot to death as they were apparently on their way to practice. He identified them as Mahmoud Abdel-Halim al-Dizawi, who played for the city's Al-Marikh club, and Tamer al-Fahla, who used to play for the city's main Al-Masry team. Al-Diwazi was shot three times, the doctor said.\n\nThe club they were training at is near the prison that residents tried to storm.\n\nThe military was deployed in Port Said to try to restore security, but assaults continued into the evening. The army was widely used to keep order by top generals who took over after Hosni Mubarak, but the military has kept a much lower profile since Morsi was elected.\n\nEgyptian military forces also were sent into the canal city of Suez after eight people died in Friday's clashes between security forces and protesters opposed to the new president and the Brotherhood. Another protester was killed in Ismailiya, and security officials told the state news agency MENA that two policemen were killed in Friday's protests.\n\nMany of the young men who led the protests and clashes hail from the Ultras. They often come from poor neighborhoods and view the police force that was the backbone of Mubarak's authoritarian rule as their nemesis.\n\n\"The police are thugs!\" yelled relatives of the deceased inside the courtroom before the judge took the bench.\n\nNear Cairo's Tahrir Square, where tens of thousands had amassed to mark the two-year anniversary a day earlier, Ultras Al-Ahly waved their team's red flag as they clashed with police who fired tear gas to disburse the crowd near Cabinet headquarters and Parliament.\n\nUnderlining the distrust that lingers between much of the public and the police, survivors and witnesses say Mubarak loyalists had a hand in instigating last year's attack, which began after Port Said's home team won the match, 3-1, and that the police at the very least were responsible for gross negligence.\n\nAl-Masry fans stormed the pitch after the game ended, attacking Cairo's Al-Ahly fans. Authorities shut off the stadium lights, plunging it into darkness. In the exit corridor, the fleeing crowd pressed against a chained gate until it broke open.

Both sides blame police for failing to perform usual searches for weapons at the stadium.\n\nAnger is boiling in Port Said, where residents say they have been unfairly scapegoated.\n\nA lawyer of one of the defendants given a death sentence said the verdict was political.\n\n\"There is nothing to say these people did anything and we don't understand what this verdict is based on,\" Mohammed al-Daw told The Associated Press by telephone.\n\n\"Our situation in Port Said is very grave because kids were taken from their homes for wearing green T-shirts,\" he said, referring to the Al-Masry team color.\n\nAl-Daw and other defense attorneys said all those sentenced were Al-Masry fans. As is customary in Egypt, the death sentences will be sent to the nation's top religious authority, the Grand Mufti, for approval, though the court has final say on the matter.\n\nFans of Al-Ahly, whose stands were attacked by rival club Al-Masry in the incident in Port Said, had promised more violence in the days leading up to the verdict if the death penalty was not handed down.\n\nBefore the judge could read out the names of the 21, families erupted in relief, yelling \"Allahu Akbar!\" Arabic for \"God is great,\" with their hands in the air and waving pictures of the deceased. One man fainted while others hugged one another. The judge smacked the bench several times to try to restore calm in the courtroom.\n\n\"This was necessary,\" said Nour al-Sabah, whose 17-year-old son Ahmed Zakaria died in last year's melee. \"Now I want to see the guys when they are executed with my own eyes, just as they saw the murder of my son.\"\n\nThousands of Al-Ahly fans gathered outside the Cairo sports club for the verdict, chanting against the police and the government.\n\n\"We are not really that happy,\" Mohamed Ahmed, a survivor of the attack, said. \"The government helped the Ultras of Port Said by blocking the gates of the stadium until people suffocated to death.",
  "latent_16009": "Oil production has been increasing in the U.S. for the past few years, primarily driven by expanding production from the Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas. The oil that is being produced from these shale formations is sometimes improperly referred to as shale oil. But when some people speak of hundreds of billions or trillions of barrels of U.S. oil, they are most likely talking about the oil shale in the Green River Formation in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. Since the shale in North Dakota and Texas is producing oil, some have assumed that the Green River Formation and its roughly 2 trillion barrels of oil resources will be developed next because they think it is a similar type of resource. But it is not.\n\nPeople are often confused about the overall extent of U.S. oil reserves. Some claim that the U.S. has hundreds of billions or even trillions of barrels of oil waiting to be produced if bureaucrats will simply stop blocking development. In fact, in a recent debate between Republican candidates contending for Gabrielle Giffords' recently vacated House seat, one candidate declared \"We have more oil in this country than in Saudi Arabia.\" So, I thought it might be a good idea to elaborate a bit on U.S. oil resources.\n\nAlthough the oil in the Bakken and Eagle Ford is being extracted from shale formations, the term shale oil has been used for over 100 years to describe a very different resource. This has led some to confusion over the differences between current production in North Dakota and potential production in Colorado. The oil in the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations actually exists as oil, but the shale does not allow the oil to flow very well. This oil is properly called \"tight oil\", and advances in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) technology have allowed some of this oil to be economically produced. (For more details, I discuss resources, reserves, fracking, shale gas, and oil shale in some detail in my new book Power Plays: Energy Options in the Age of Peak Oil).\n\nThe estimated amount of oil in place (the resource) varies widely, with some suggesting that there could be 400 billion barrels of oil in the Bakken. Because of advances in fracking technology, some of the resource has now been classified as reserves (the amount that can be technically and economically produced). However, the reserve is a very low fraction of the resource at 2 to 4 billion barrels (although some industry estimates put the recoverable amount as high as 20 billion barrels or so). For reference, the U.S. consumes a billion barrels of oil in about 52 days, and the world consumes a billion barrels in about 11 days.\n\nLike the Bakken, the Eagle Ford formation in Texas consists of oil (and natural gas) in tight formations that is being accessed via fracking. The amount of technically recoverable oil in the Eagle Ford is estimated by the U.S. Department of Energy to be 3.35 billion barrels of oil.\n\nWithout a doubt, these two formations are a major factor in the current resurgence of U.S. oil production. But the Green River formation is the source of talk of those enormous oil resources -- larger than those of Saudi Arabia -- and it is a very different prospect than the tight oil being produced in North Dakota and Texas. The oil shale in the Green River looks like rock. Unlike the hydrocarbons in the tight oil formations, the oil shale (kerogen) consists of very heavy hydrocarbons that are solid. In that way, oil shale more resembles coal than oil. Oil shale is essentially oil that Mother Nature did not finish cooking, and thus to convert it into oil, heat has to be added. The energy requirements -- plus the fact that oil shale production requires a lot of water in a very dry environment -- have kept oil shale commercialization out of reach for over 100 years.\n\nThus, while the U.S. might indeed have greater oil resources than Saudi Arabia, U.S. oil reserves (per the BP Statistical Review of World Energy) are only about 1/10th those of Saudi Arabia. The distinction is important.\n\nSummarizing the Definitions\n\nTo summarize, let's review the definitions for the important terms discussed here:\n\nOil resource -- the total amount of oil in place, most of which typically can't be recovered\n\nOil reserve -- the amount of oil that can be recovered economically with existing technology\n\nOil shale -- sedimentary rock that contains solid hydrocarbons called kerogen (e.g., Green River Formation)\n\nShale oil -- the oil that can be obtained by cooking kerogen\n\nTight oil -- liquid hydrocarbons that are obtained by hydraulic fracturing of shale formations (e.g., Bakken Formation and Eagle Ford Formation)\n\nConclusion: Resources are not Reserves, and Tight Oil isn't Shale Oil\n\nIt is pretty clear that at current oil prices, developments in the tight oil formations will continue. It is not at all clear that even at $100 oil the shale in the Green River formation will be commercialized to produce oil, although a number of companies are working on it and will continue to do so. Oil shale is commercially produced in some countries like Estonia, but it is primarily just burned for power.\n\nIn order to commercially convert the oil shale into oil, a more energy efficient method of producing it must be found (or, one would have to have extremely cheap energy and abundant water supplies to drive the process). I have heard from multiple industry sources that the energy return for producing oil from oil shale is around 4 to 1 (lower than for oil sands production), and that is before refining the oil to finished products. At this sort of energy return, oil sands will continue to be a more economical heavy oil option.\n\nThus, my prediction is that despite having an oil shale resource that may indeed be far greater than the oil resources of Saudi Arabia (I don't think I have seen an estimate of Saudi's total oil resources), the reserve will continue to be close to zero for the foreseeable future because there are still many technical hurdles to overcome to realize a scalable, commercially viable process.\n\nFinally, I would say that if a commercially viable process for shale oil production from the Green River formation is developed, the environmental blowback will be enormous. The production of shale oil is more energy intensive (i.e., has higher carbon emissions) than for the oil sands, it has a high water requirement in a dry climate, and it is potentially a huge new source of carbon dioxide emissions. The environmental protests that would arise in response to a growing commercial shale oil operation would make the Keystone XL pipeline protests pale in comparison.",

  "latent_16049": "by Bruno Magana – all photos by author\n\nDendrobates Leucomelas, or commonly referred to as simply “Leucs” are one of the more robust species of arrow frogs. These frogs are one of the most prolific and brilliantly colored species, and make excellent occupants in tropical vivariums. Stout in appearance, bumble bee arrow frogs are also one of the larger species of the genus Dendrobates and are marked with brilliant yellow and orange bands on a shiny black body. Although one of the most common species of arrow frogs kept in captivity, anyone who has had the opportunity to keep them knows without a doubt how this frog has kept and maintained its popularity in the hobby. It is an undeniably exciting arrow frog whether you’re new to the hobby or an experienced enthusiast. Like all poison arrow frogs, bumble bee arrow frogs live in the tropical rainforests of South America.\n\nDifferent localities of this species range throughout Venezuela, southeastern Colombia, Northern Brazil, and Guyana. The common or ‘standard’ variety of the bumble bee arrow frog has a near equal balance of black and yellow coloration, with large blotches of black breaking the the lighter coloration. Through decades of selectively breeding bloodlines of the standard Leucomelas, there tends to be a peculiar (but non detrimental) color variation in which an orange color brings just a little more definition to the yellow, sometimes to the extremes of being almost orange and black in color. Unlike the standard variation of bumble bee, the ‘Fine spotted’ variety has bright yellow covering the majority of its black ground color. They are characterized by the many small black spots that are scattered across the frog’s back. Although this variety is not as commonly available in the pet trade when compared to the standard variety, they are certainly not impossible to find! There is also another very attractive ‘Banded” variety of bumble bee arrow frog. Thickness and color of the bands varies dramatically within the bloodline, but no black spots are present within the yellow bands going across the frogs torso.\n\nA bumblebee with a very attractive pattern\n\nThese frogs inhabit lush tropical rainforests at high elevations in fallen logs, plants, leaf litter, and other debris. Bumble bee arrow frogs are known for being ground dwellers, but for their short and stout build they are surprisingly good climbers. They are active throughout the day during spikes of high humidity, at which time they engage in social behaviour and forage for food. In the wild bumble bee arrow frogs have a long wet season that lasts during the warmertimes of year, but is then followed by a very brief cool and dry season. The males of this species can be quite vocal, its soft spoken trill could easily be mistaken for an exotic bird. Because this behaviour is limited to what seems to be scheduled times of day, it is easy to enjoy the pleasant sound without being disturbed. In fact, to many enthusiasts the male’s singing is truly music to one’s ears. The frog’s main intention with his song is to attract females. This courting behaviour happens during the wet times of year, when food and water is plentiful. Water is key to the rudimentary stages of their life cycle. Eggs can only survive in moist conditions and larvae (or tadpoles) start life aquatically in small shallow pockets of water. For these reasons, it is easily understood why adult bumble bee arrow frogs time their courting behaviour with seasonal conditions. During the the dry season, bumble bee arrow frogs will reduce overall activity and will usually hide under debris to protect their permeable skin from the dry air. Following pockets of moisture, the frogs will continue to eat small prey items throughout the dry season. Luckily many small insects have to follow the same pockets of humidity in this season, so the occasional meal is never far.\n\nHaving a general idea of the seasonal habits and behaviour of these frogs is an important factor to keep this animal happy in captivity. Although the bumble bee arrow frog does thrive in social groups, one must not go overboard with housing this frog with too many tank mates.\n\nThey do best if kept in female heavy groups of five or less individuals depending on the size of the enclosure you provide for them. It is possible to keep a steady group of younger frogs in a heavily planted ten gallon tank, but it is recommended to go big if you intend to breed bumble bee arrow frogs as adults. Keeping in mind that although this frog spends lots of time on the ground, they will also climb so it is best to make a vertically oriented vivarium to allow these frogs to indulge in their natural activities.\n\nA glass tank measuring 18 x 18 x 24” can provide a suitable habitat for a group of three adults. Make sure to add some foliage to the vivarium, live or plastic, as this will reduce stress and encourage natural behaviour.\n\nLike all amphibians, water is a necessity that encourages regular activity so be sure to mist the cage with water two to three times a day and always provide a small and shallow water source for bathing (they will rehydrate by soaking their bodies). The goal is for the humidity to spike around 60% during the day, and somewhere around 90% at night.\n\nIt is important to remember that humidity is not supposed to stay consistent so go easy on yourself when misting your enclosure. This routine can be made simple by using an automatic misting system to help schedule humidity spikes. Using distilled water will keep hard water stains from distorting the visibility of the glass enclosure and is much safer than using dechlorinated tap.\n\nBumble bee arrow frogs usually feed after it rains, so it is best to mimic their natural routine and feed them a good meal once a day after a nice shower. Bumble bee arrow frogs will eat a variety of available foods like small or pinhead crickets, fruit flies, and springtails. It is also recommended to use a fine powdered multivitamin and calcium with D3 to sprinkle on feeder insects (best used on crickets), this supplementation should ensure the frog is getting the necessary nutrients from its diet. Supplementing the diet can be done once a week, but only use one supplement at a time to ensure the frogs can metabolize the meal properly.\n\nBumble Bee Arrow frogs will readily breed year round if the right conditions are provided, but it is recommended to have an off season to mimic the dry season the would experience in the wild. This dry season happens between the months of January and February, but remember, the word “dry” is only relative considering the tropical climate. You still want levels of humidity to spike at around 50 % during the day and 60% at night for at least three to 6 weeks. Maintain regular feeding routines, even though your frogs may be hiding, they will still need to eat duringtimes of slow activity. After this cycle or dry season, regular routines can start again. Bumping up humidity will increase the frogs behaviour, and your frogs should soon engage in courting rituals. Males will call after humidity spikes during the day. If more than one male is present, they will often call after the other to establish territory and compete for any nearby females. Calling sites are usually near suitable egg laying sites. Once a female decides to enter a male’s territory, he will take immediate interest in showing the female the chosen site, usually done by taking short jumps towards an interested female. Nesting sites are are usually smooth surfaces with heavy moisture present. In captivity, these frogs will nest in plants such as fallen leaf litter or bromeliads, black film containers, and in petri dishes under coconut hides. Once the frogs have entered a nest site, spawning will take place usually out of sight, and may stay in the nest for a few days after.\n\nMany people have relative success in raising frogs by simply keeping up with regular routine for the vivarium. Letting the adults handle business, it’s possible to one day realize there are a couple of new additions to your arrow frog vivarium. Of course, letting this happen creates a big range of possibilities that you as a keeper have no control over. For example, two new froglets could have possibly have been six if the eggs were removed from the cage and incubated artificially in a moist petri dish. Having that control will increase the success rates of rearing arrow frog larvae. and raising young metamorphs. Of course there is a lot of work involved in maintaining water quality, temperatures, and food for tadpoles on a daily basis – being involved with this amazing process is not only rewarding for the species, but also rewarding to you as the keeper. Whether your goal is to produce a number of frogs, or simply to have a little piece of paradise in your room, the bumble bee arrow frog is a wonderful species to work with for enthusiasts of all levels of experience.",

Mike Segar/Reuters\n\nDespite months of outreach aiming to educate Americans about how to sign up for health insurance plans through new statewide exchanges and multiple speeches given by President Barack Obama encouraging them to do so, many uninsured people – who stand to benefit the most from the Affordable Care Act – have never even heard of the health insurance exchanges, according to a new nationwide survey.\n\nAmong more than 1,000 people between the ages of 18 and 64 who answered an online questionnaire about the Affordable Care Act in November 2013, 31 percent of those who didn’t have health insurance had never heard of the health insurance marketplaces, according to the Transamerica Center for Health Studies, a Los Angeles-based health care non-profit organization.\n\nThat’s compared with 15 percent of those surveyed overall who weren’t aware of the health insurance exchanges launched on Oct. 1, where those who don’t have insurance coverage through their jobs can buy individual or family plans that kick in on Jan. 1.\n\nThe findings echo a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation which found that among more than 1,500 adults interviewed in September — just weeks before the exchanges were set to open — only 12 percent of uninsured people and 15 percent overall were able to correctly answer that the health-insurance marketplaces open Oct. 1.\n\nPresident Obama’s signature health care law creates health insurance marketplaces in each state where people can shop for plans among numerous offerings from participating insurance companies. It also expands Medicaid programs for low-income adults in the states that have accepted federal funding for it, both of which are boons for the approximately 47 million Americans who did not have health insurance in 2012.\n\nSince people who don’t currently have insurance coverage, then, are the ones who are set to benefit from the exchanges, the fact that nearly one-third of the uninsured people polled by the Transamerica Center don't know the exchanges exist does not bode well.\n\n“More Americans are informed and prepared for the March 31, 2014 mandatory health coverage date, but a significant number have yet to actually sign up for health insurance in the exchanges or in the traditional insurance market,” said Hector De La Torre, executive director of the Transamerica Center for Health Studies, in a released statement. “The uninsured continue to be the least active, which could be because they feel the least prepared and also are the least satisfied with the health care system.”\n\nAmong the findings of the survey were that 61 percent of those uninsured people who were polled said they have done “nothing” within the last 12 months to prepare for the launch of the ACA. Just 35 percent of uninsured people said they were “somewhat” or “very” prepared for the new health care exchanges, a significant drop from the 53 percent of uninsured people who said so in a similar survey conducted by Transamerica in July.\n\nSix percent of all people polled said they intended to buy health insurance through the new exchanges, but only 2 percent had already done so.\n\nThe Healthcare.gov website, where residents of the 36 states whose exchanges are operated by the federal government are supposed to sign up for individual and family health insurance plans, has been riddled with errors and delays.\n\nAs a result, enrollment numbers have been low, although the Obama administration says most of the kinks have been ironed out.

Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) a quarterstaff, or (b) a shortsword\n\n(a) a sling, or (b) two daggers\n\n(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack\n\nLeather armor Earth's Fortitude Your innate connection to the earth increases your resilience. While your are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. Additionally, if you are wearing Light armor, your Wisdom modifier may replace your Dexterity modifier when calculating your AC. Stone Strokes Starting at 1st level, you may spend a bonus action to coat your limbs in nearby rock, giving you 2 'Stone Strokes' charges. You may take this bonus action once, and must complete a short or long rest before you can do so again. So long as you have at least 1 charge available, you can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strikes. This die changes as you gain Earth Seer levels, as shown in the Stone Strokes column of the Earth Seer table. Additionally, whenever you hit a creature with a spell attack or unarmed strike, you may expend a charge and add its damage die to the damage total as bludgeoning damage. 1\n\nKi Starting at 2nd level, in similar ways to a monk, your connection to the earth allows you to harness the mystical energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your Earth Seer level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Earth Seer table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features.\n\nYou start knowing three such features: Refresh and two earth seer spells. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Refresh You may spend 1 ki point to manifest your stone strokes, without the need to complete a short or long rest. Cantrips Starting at 2nd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the earth seer spell list. You learn additional earth seer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Earth Seer table. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher From 2nd level onward, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the earth seer spell list. The Spells Known column of the Earth Seer table shows when you learn more earth seer spells of your choice. The maximum spell level for these spells is shown between parentheses. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the earth seer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the earth seer spell list, which must also be equal or lower to your maximum spell level. Casting Earth Seer Spells Unlike other classes adept in the use of magic, Earth Seers (and monks trained in the Way of the Four Elements) tap into their ki to bring forth magic. To cast a spell, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components unless they have a listed price. Casting a spell expends ki points equal to the spell level + 1. You can cast a spell at higher levels, expending one additional ki point for each spell level above the spell's original level. Cantrips require no ki point to cast. When you use ki to cast a spell at spell level 6 or higher, you must complete a long rest before you can cast another spell at the same spell level. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Earth Seer spells, as your magic draws upon your connection to- and the understanding of the very earth itself. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell or class feature refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for your earth seer features and spells you cast, and when making an attack roll with them.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +\n\nyour Wisdom modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +\n\nyour Wisdom modifier Seer Structure At 3rd level, you choose to identify with a Seer Structure: the Structure of Sand, the Structure of Soil or the Structure of Stone, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th and 17th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Terrene Athlete At 5th level, you have learned to empower your feats of athletics by moving the earth beneath your feet to propel you. So long as you are touching rock or earth, your walking speed increases by 10 and you are always considered to have a running start when jumping. Additionally, if grounded, you may spend 1 ki point to take the Dash action as a bonus action. Seismic Strikes Once you reach 7th level, your unarmed strikes are considered to deal both Bludgeoning damage and Thunder damage simultaneously, so long as you have at least one active charge of stone strokes. A creature that resists one, but not both types of damage takes damage as if it had no resistance to either. If both types are resisted, resistance is applied as normal. Elemental Understanding Starting at 9th level, you may spend a ki point to speak with rocks and earth related golems as if you shared a language, for up to 10 minutes. Additionally, you learn to speak and write the Primordial language. Tremorsense Starting at 10th level, your connection with the earth has become strong to the point where you can sense its very vibrations. You gain tremorsense, allowing you to detect any corporeal grounded or burrowing creature within a range of 30 feet. A creature that spends its turn without disturbing the earth cannot be detected in this fashion. Heightened Focus Starting at 13th level, whenever you manifest your stone strokes charges, you can expend a ki point to manifest an additional charge. You can never hold more than 4 charges at any one time. In addition, you can now expend any number of stone strokes charges upon dealing damage to a creature with an attack or spell, increasing the bonus damage accordingly. 2\n\nImproved Earth's Fortitude From 14th level onward, your body has adapted to resist even the most potent of poisons. You gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. Timeless Body At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water. Gravity Weaver Starting at 18th level, you have learned to manipulate your personal gravitational influence. You may take an action to impose a Strength saving throw on all creatures within 30 feet. Doing so requires you to expend 2 ki points. Choose one of the effects below. All creatures that fail to save take 3d6 Force damage and suffer the effect. Gravitation. Affected creatures are moved 10 feet directly towards you. Repulsion. Affected creatures are moved 10 feet directly away from you. Planar Fissure Strike At 20th level, your connection to the earth has become so powerful, your attacks tear rifts to and from the elemental plane of Earth. Whenever you hit a creature with a spell attack or unarmed strike, you may expend a charge of stone strokes to deal an additional 4d12 Force damage as part of the attack. Additionally, if the attack reduces the target to 50 hit points or less, you banish it to the elemental plane of Earth. A creature that is already on this plane instead vanishes into a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. It remains there for 1 minute, before it reappears in the space it left, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. After reappearing, a creature cannot be banished again for twenty four hours, though subsequent Planar Fissure Strikes deal damage as normal. You can use this feature 2 times, regaining expended uses when you complete a long rest. Seer Structures Three Structures of Earth Seers exist throughout the multiverse. Each harbors seers that specialize in its respective field of expertise, though conclaves of all three structures are hosted sporadically, to discuss discoveries or issues with one another, or share pleasantries. All three structures share the same foundations, allowing their students to be schooled together until it is time for them to dedicate themselves to a particular structure. the Structure of Sand Seers of the Structure of Sand focus on discovering the mysteries within the depths of the sands. Most live a nomadic life in deserts, though some spend time on the ocean floor, in search of treasures of both wealth and knowledge. Scorpion's Sting Starting when you choose this Structure at 3rd level, whenever you take the attack action, you may make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. The attack may use your stone strokes damage die, even if you have no charges left. Ambush Predator At 6th level, you gain a burrowing speed of 40 feet. In addition, whenever you burrow 20 feet straight toward a target right before hitting it with a melee weapon attack, the target must succeed a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. A creature you have surprised has disadvantage on the saving throw. Extra Attack Also at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Sidewinder At 11th level, you can instinctually navigate deserts and other large masses of sand. Traveling in arid environments does not cause you to gain levels of exhaustion and you gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks when trying to navigate the desert. Additionally, you can always tell the time, and which way is north, from the position of the sun and moon. Kurara's Wrath Starting at 17th level, You may take an action to cast Sand Storm at 9th level without expending ki points. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. 3\n\nthe Structure of Soil Those that join the Structure of Soil often do so to better understand and control the earth. Members of this structure often go out of their way to uphold balance in the universe, and their fighting style of weaving in spells between strikes reflects this. Ki Efficiency Starting when you choose this structure at 3rd, and again at 6th and 11th level, your maximum amount of spells known increases by 1. In addition, whenever you take an action to attack or cast a spell, you may spend 1 ki point to cast a cantrip from the earth seer spell list as a bonus action. Arcane Disruption From 6th level onward, you may choose to expend 2 additional ki points whenever you cast a spell that can deal damage. Choose 1 creature affected by the spell. The excess arcane energy lingers within its body for up to 1 hour. If the creature casts a spell or is hit by a melee weapon attack, the arcane energy detonates. The creature takes Force damage equal to 3 x your stone strokes damage die and must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails the saving throw, it is also stunned until the end of your next turn. If it succeeds the saving throw, it becomes immune to the stun effect until it completes a long rest. Arcane Overdrive At 11th level, you have learned to use your ki at maximum efficiency, relaying the excess energy straight to your muscles. Once per turn, if you spend ki to cast a spell, your speed increases by 10 feet and you suffer no movement penalty when traversing difficult terrain. This effect lasts until the end of your turn. Orbital Reach Starting at 17th level, you have become so adept at manipulating the earth, your influence stretches even beyond the atmosphere. You gain access to the Meteor Swarm spell. This spell does not count towards your amount of spells known, and you are immune to any damage you would take from being in its area of effect. Multiclassing Prerequisites Wisdom 13 Multiclassing Proficiencies (a) Jeweler's Tools or, (b) Mason's Tools Optional: Starting Wealth 2d4 x 10 gp the Structure of Stone Seers of the Structure of Stone are renowned for their expert stonework and gem cutting. Artisans live as clans, in large, beautiful bastions and castles. Others roam the land to study stone and precious minerals in the field from within the relative safety of their stone constructs. Rock Juggernaut Starting when you choose this Structure at 3rd level, you gain superior control over rock, allowing you to muster up enough material to cover your entire body when you activate your stone strokes feature, increasing your size by 1 stage. This second skin of rock can be made to have whatever appearance you desire. Your rock juggernaut form grants you temporary hit points equal to 10 plus twice your Earth Seer level. These hitpoints do not absorb Poison, Psychic or Thunder damage. Once the temporary hitpoints are depleted, or you dismiss your stone strokes feature as a bonus action, the form collapses into a small pile of rubble. If the temporary hit points granted by your rock juggernaut form absorbed any damage, the temporary hit points granted by the form is reduced by that much, next you manifest it. Whenever you roll a hit die to regain hit points, you can choose to forego the ordinary healing to replenish an equal amount of temporary hit points granted by your rock juggernaut form, instead. Completing a long rest resets the number of temporary hit points granted to the maximum amount. So long as your rock juggernaut form is active, your more precise movements are restricted, and you cannot provide somatic spell components. Adept Mountaineer Starting at 6th level, you gain a climb speed of 40, and you make Wisdom (Survival) checks to navigate mountains with advantage. Form Detonation From 11th level onward, you may take an action to expend all your remaining charges of stone strokes (2 minimum) to have your rock juggernaut form explode. Reduce your rock juggernaut hit points to 0. All creatures (except you) in a 15 foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. You deal (5 x your stone strokes damage die) bludgeoning damage to all creatures that fail the save, and half this amount to those that succeed. This damage increases by 1 die for every third Earth Seer level beyond the 11th, and for each charge of stone strokes you expended beyond 2. Additionally, the rubble left behind by the explosion causes the affected area to become difficult terrain until it is cleared. You may activate Form Detonation whenever your Rock Juggernaut hit points are reduced to 0, without spending an action to do so. Diamond Juggernaut At 17th level, you have learned how to safely subject your stone outer skin to extreme pressure. You may take an action to compress and harden your rock juggernaut form. This grants you resistance to all piercing, bludgeoning and slashing damage, and damage can no longer bypass your rock juggernaut hit points. 4\n\nEarth Seer Spells Cantrips (0 Level) Druidcraft\n\nFlintlock\n\nMagic Stone\n\nMending\n\nMinor Illusion\n\nMold Earth\n\nPitfall\n\nResistance\n\nSword Burst\n\nTectonic Slam\n\nThunderclap\n\nTrue Strike 1st Level Absorb Elements\n\nCatapult\n\nDetect Magic\n\nEarth Tremor\n\nEnsnaring Strike\n\nEntangle\n\nFeather Fall\n\nJump\n\nMagic Missile\n\nTenser's Floating Disk 2nd Level Cloud of Daggers\n\nDust Devil\n\nEarthbind\n\nFind Traps\n\nHold Person\n\nKnock\n\nLevitate\n\nLocate Animals or Plants\n\nMaximilian's Earthen Grasp\n\nPass Without Trace\n\nRope Trick\n\nShatter\n\nSpider Climb\n\nSpike Growth 3rd level Earth Servant\n\nElemental Weapon\n\nErupting Earth\n\nFeign Death\n\nLeomund's Tiny Hut\n\nMeld Into Stone\n\nMelf's Minute Meteors\n\nNondetection\n\nTiny Servant\n\nWall of Sand 4th Level Banishment\n\nBlight\n\nConjure Minor Elementals\n\nElemental Bane\n\nFabricate\n\nFreedom of Movement\n\nGuardian of Nature\n\nHallucinatory Terrain\n\nSandstorm\n\nStone Shape\n\nStoneskin\n\nMordenkainen's Private Sanctum 5th Level Animate Objects\n\nBigby's Hand\n\nConjure Elemental\n\nDanse Macabre\n\nDestructive Wave\n\nHold Monster\n\nLegend Lore\n\nPasswall\n\nTelekinesis\n\nTransmute Rock\n\nWall of Stone 6th Level Blade Barrier\n\nBones of the Earth\n\nDisintegrate\n\nFind the Path\n\nFlesh to Stone\n\nInvestiture of Stone\n\nMove Earth\n\n7th Level Mirage Arcane\n\nMordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion\n\nPlane Shift\n\nReverse Gravity\n\nSequester\n\n8th Level Demiplane\n\nEarthquake\n\nMaze\n\nMighty Fortress\n\nTsunami\n\n9th level Astral Projection\n\nGate\n\nImprisonment\n\nInvulnerability\n\nMeteor Swarm (Exclusive to Structure of Soil) 5\n\nFlintlock Transmutation cantrip Casting Time: 1 action\n\n1 action Range: 120 feet\n\n120 feet Components: V, S\n\nV, S Duration: Instantaneous You kick up a small stone and launch it towards a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage. This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). Pitfall Conjuration cantrip Casting Time: 1 action\n\n1 action Range: 30 feet\n\n30 feet Components: S, M (A shovel)\n\nS, M (A shovel) Duration: Instantaneous You create a small vacuum beneath the soil.

Tectonic Slam Transmutation cantrip Casting Time: 1 action\n\n1 action Range: 5 feet\n\n5 feet Components: V, M (a rock weighing at least 5lbs.)\n\nV, M (a rock weighing at least 5lbs.) Duration: Instantaneous As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and a crust of rock that previously covered your weapon explodes, sending shrapnel towards creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of the primary target. The second creature takes piercing damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage to the target, and the piercing damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level. 6",
  "latent_16457": "Oroville >> Former Paradise police officer Patrick Feaster was arraigned Wednesday in Butte County Superior Court on a charge of manslaughter, more than two months after he shot an unarmed man suspected of drunken driving.\n\nFeaster, 31, appeared in Judge James Reilley’s court at 8:30 a.m., after District Attorney Mike Ramsey decided to bring manslaughter charges against the former officer. Feaster was charged with a single felony count of involuntary manslaughter while armed.\n\nFeaster, dressed in a dark-colored suit, did not enter a plea.\n\nThe charges come two days after Paradise Police Chief Gabriela Tazzari-Dineen announced Feaster was no longer on the payroll. The chief said she couldn’t say whether Feaster was fired because of state law outlined by the Peace Officers’ Bill of Rights.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter whether Feaster quit or was fired, Ramsey said only that Feaster did not resign.\n\nFeaster shot Andrew Thomas, 26, just before midnight on Thanksgiving eve. Thomas was shot as he exited a vehicle after a rollover accident on Pearson Road that killed his estranged wife, Darien Ehorn, 23, of Paradise.\n\nFeaster was booked and released Wednesday from Butte County Jail. He remains out of custody, released on his own recognizance. He is next scheduled to appear in court Feb. 24, when he could enter a plea.\n\nFeaster’s attorney, Brett Sherman, did not comment.\n\nThe charge of involuntary manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of four years in county jail, a change from state prison as a result of the prison reform bill Assembly Bill 109. The additional allegation of being armed with a firearm carries the potential of an additional year in custody.\n\nRamsey announced at a Dec. 10 press conference that he would not seek criminal charges against Feaster because investigators determined that the shooting, while possibly negligent, was “not criminally so.” Feaster told a supervisor at the scene of the wreck that his .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol accidentally fired.\n\nAt that same press conference, Ramsey said that had Thomas been killed, the claim Feaster didn’t mean to shoot him would not necessarily be a defense.\n\nThen on Dec. 19, Thomas died at Enloe Medical Center in Chico. Ramsey had said in light of Thomas’ death, he would re-examine potential manslaughter charges against Feaster.\n\nThat investigation, Ramsey said, hinged partly on Thomas’ autopsy report.\n\nOutside of court Wednesday, Ramsey said an autopsy showed Thomas died from complications stemming from the gunshot wound to his spine.\n\nRamsey added no other significant injuries from the rollover crash led to Thomas’ death.\n\nDashboard and body camera video of the shooting showed Feaster did not notify his supervisor that he had fired his weapon until 11 minutes after the fact.\n\nMedical personnel and first responders said Feaster’s 11-minute lapse did not result in additional injury to Thomas or contribute to a delay of medical help, according to a press release issued Wednesday by the District Attorney’s Office. It did, however, factor into the Paradise Police Department’s internal investigation.\n\nSince the shooting, protests have been held outside the Paradise Police Department and District Attorney’s Office. Protesters had called for Feaster’s firing, as well as Ramsey’s job.\n\nRamsey said protesters, before Thomas had died, were well-meaning but confused about the law.\n\n“We showed them what the law was,” Ramsey said. “From an emotional standpoint, prior to Mr. Thomas dying, they still wanted something done.”\n\nRamsey said public pressure that followed Thomas’ death played no role in his charging decision. He said the decision to charge Feaster was reached about a week ago, after prosecutors received forensic and legal reports, in addition to Thomas’ autopsy report.\n\n“Most likely, he would be alive if he was not shot by officer Feaster,” Ramsey said.\n\nJoshua Turner, who has organized protests and was a friend of Thomas’, said he believes demonstrators helped bring action against Feaster.\n\n“I’m very happy,” Turner said. “Everybody involved with the protest is happy.”\n\nDemonstrators intend to organize a celebratory event soon and plan to attend future court proceedings in Feaster’s case, he said.\n\nCommunity members, however, remain unsatisfied with Ramsey, Turner said. The next step, he said, is to continue efforts to recall the district attorney. If that fails, it’s hoped someone will challenge Ramsey should he decide to run for re-election.\n\nRamsey has been Butte County’s district attorney since 1987.\n\n“We just hope that this starts the domino effect across the nation,” Turner said, “of having cops being held accountable for their crimes.”\n\nContact reporter Andre Byik at 896-7760.",
  "latent_16476": "Since Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, seven other states and the District of Columbia have followed suit. Next year, California, Maine, and Massachusetts will begin sales, potentially tripling the size of the legal pot market.\n\nBy the end of 2018, 20 percent of Americans will live in a state where adults can legally buy and sell cannabis. Yet big problems remain unresolved, including a persistent black market that legalization was supposed to help undermine.\n\nThere are also fights between states in favor of legalizing weed and localities that oppose it. And of course marijuana remains illegal under federal law, casting a shadow over the industry.\n\nState tax revenue from marijuana sales exceeds $1 billion. California alone anticipates another $1 billion in annual tax revenue from legalization. But with an impending January 2018 deadline to begin issuing permits, there are signs that growers and retailers may not join the state-regulated system.\n\nHezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association, estimates that just 3,500 of 40,000 farmers have signed up for permits but says that’s primarily because local governments haven’t issued them or have banned marijuana businesses outright.\n\nThis creates problems for state regulators.\n\n“We have to work with over 500 different cities and counties over the state,” says Lori Ajax, chief of California’s Bureau of Cannabis Control. “For us to issue a license, we have to make sure it’s not in violation of a city or county ordinance, and because of our size, that’s a challenge.”\n\nCalifornia grows 13.5 million pounds of marijuana annually; less than 20 percent of it is consumed there. Growers may have to downsize as new rules ban out-of-state exports. If California’s markets open in January and many existing growers are left out, tax revenue could fall short, and a robust black market will persist.\n\nTo become legal, marijuana businesses have to secure building permits and water rights and establish record-keeping protocols unfamiliar to an industry that’s long operated in the shadows.\n\nDon’t miss our reviews of strains, vape oils and other cannabis products.\n\n“It’s going to take decades for California to regulate its cannabis industry,” says Allen. “It’s been decades that we’ve been making this mess, and it’s going to take us a while to clean it up.”\n\nIn Maine, where a legalization ballot measure passed in 2016 by less than 1 percentage point, localities retain broad power to ban marijuana cultivators and retailers, potentially hindering the growth of the state’s cannabis industry.\n\nMassachusetts has a July 2018 deadline to issue its permits. That’s already been delayed once. In July state lawmakers established the independent Cannabis Control Commission to develop regulations. Even with the extension, the commission’s chairman, Steven Hoffman, says the July deadline is “a pretty tight time frame.”\n\nEarly difficulties are common for recreational marijuana. Nevada faced product shortages when its markets opened in July 2017. Alaska’s first year brought in $1.2 million in tax revenue, short of a projected $2 million.\n\nColorado and Washington both took in less tax revenue than expected in their first year, but revenue has grown every year since and now exceeds projections. Colorado’s effective tax rate is around 30 percent, and Washington has a flat rate of 37 percent.\n\nJoseph Bishop-Henchman of the Tax Foundation says these relatively high taxes have allowed a significant black market to persist by making legal pot expensive. States that have legalized more recently have set the rate lower. In Oregon, it’s 17 percent. Maine and Massachusetts have proposed rates of about 20 percent, while California is planning for a 15 percent levy.\n\nThere isn’t enough data to measure the impact of lower taxes, but Maine state Senator Teresa Pierce believes that Maine will “hit a sweet spot” and be able to undercut black market prices.\n\nSpecial report: Cannabis & fitness\n\nAs momentum behind legalization grows, a federal crackdown appears less likely. To avoid prosecution under federal law, state legislatures adhere to the 2013 Cole Memorandum, a document issued during Eric Holder’s tenure as U.S. attorney general essentially assuring states that the feds won’t intervene as long as they follow their own rules. But the Cole Memo isn’t legally binding, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a long history of opposition to marijuana.\n\n“I think the Justice Department may rearrange the deck chairs a little bit, but ultimately, they’re not going to change direction too much,” says John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “It seems like a not-so-popular approach to an issue that most Americans don’t see as a problem.”\n\nMarijuana’s ambiguous legal standing limits the ability of businesses to operate normally. Major banks are still unwilling to service growers and dispensaries. Marijuana companies are also ineligible for common tax deductions.\n\nThis August, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker introduced a bill that would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act, legalize it federally, and withhold prison funding from states with racial and class disparities in their marijuana arrest rates. With Republicans in charge of Congress, the bill is largely symbolic. That leaves states that have legalized pot trying not to attract undue attention from a potentially adversarial Trump administration.\n\n“I think as long as we keep our noses clean, we’ll be good,” says Republican Washington state Senator Ann Rivers.\n\nTo subscribe to The Cannifornian’s email newsletter, click here.",
  "latent_16693": "DragonVale Giant Habitats are here!\n\nI like to think that BackFlip is listening to its fans, because almost every time you encounter a pain point in the game, here they come with a solution. Running out of space? 8th Island Getting all of your Shrines to “Gold” becoming a grind? Upgrade to Gold for gems. In a similar vein, they have recently released new Giant versions of each of the Elemental Habitat types, to finally solve the problem of small gold caps, and limited dragon quantities for high end players. Woo hoo!\n\nBut which habitat should I upgrade?!?!\n\nEach upgrade costs 25 gems, and even if you’ve got a stash of them, you’ll probably have to make some choices about which habitats to upgrade first. When making this choice, I suggest evaluating three criteria and considering what is most important to you.\n\nHow much will the gold capacity increase?\n\nHow fast will the new habitat hit the max (with best dragons)?\n\nHow many more dragons will fit?\n\nGold Capacity\n\nWhen you take a look at the increase for each habitat, there are clear winners and losers. Probably like most of you, I went straight for the Plant habitat and said “never again, you lowly 500 gold piece of #!#$… payday here I come.” As you can see though, the Plant habitat comes in almost dead last for the amount of capacity increase. Instead, Air comes out a big winner with a huge increase – and the two ranking earners in the “Large” category (Earth and Metal) come in a close second. This will be important when considering the next point.\n\nTime to Full\n\nFor this chart I considered the current “best” dragons with best boosts for each of these habitats, all at level 15. Fully loading even one habitat with level 20s costs a fortune, so I did not include that here, but I did the math and it doesn’t affect much. For reference, the dragons and boost combos I uses are:\n\nPlant: Paper Dragon, 2 Boosts\n\nEarth: Panlong Dragon, 2 Boosts\n\nFire: Panlong Dragon, 2 Boosts\n\nCold: Paper Dragon, 2 Boosts\n\nLightning: Butterfly Dragon, 3 Boosts\n\nWater: Panlong Dragon, 2 Boosts\n\nAir: Panlong Dragon, 2 Boosts\n\nMetal: Copper Dragon, 2 Boosts\n\nWhat you can see is, most habitats fill up in right around an hour. Metal is the one big exception. This means, the caps pretty much dictate how much money you will make off of each habitat, once you have some pretty good dragons in that habitat. If you are checking faster than once an hour, you will start to see a difference – but you also have a problem and should seek help :). If you slow down to about 3 checks per day with a little more than 7 hours between each check, the Metal habitat joins the rest of the pack in that it’s output is dictated by hitting the habitat gold capacity.\n\nGiven these two data points, the result is that the Air Habitat is the big winner getting a huge relative bump in capacity that you can benefit from on pretty much every park check. Earth and Metal would be the next runners up with sizeable capacity increases, although you’ll benefit less from Metal if you check your park less often.\n\nIt’s not about the money, man\n\nIf the raw economic power of your habitats isn’t your only focus, you might also consider the number of dragons added. Here it is a pretty even story, with Earth and Cold benefiting just slightly more than the others. If you’ve got a huge back catalog of those dragon types that you are just dying to show off, maybe those habitats move up in line.\n\nSummary\n\nIf you’ve managed to avoid the temptation to upgrade your Plant habitats to Giant, consider waiting till you’ve hit some of the others first, especially Air, Earth, and Metal. If showing off your dragons is more your thing, they are all pretty good choices – but Earth and Metal have the slight edge.\n\nBack to WOTS DragonVale Hub…..\n\nCheck out the Current List of Limited Dragons…..",

According to the news release announcing 30 new European service centers and stores, Telsa notes that it expects the combined sales in Europe and Asia to be twice as high as sales in North America.\n\nThe proposed expansion comes after a recent trip to Europe by Elon Musk who stated at the time Europe will soon be covered in Superchargers. “By the end of this year, we expect you will be able to travel almost anywhere in Europe using only Superchargers,” Musk said.\n\nThere are currently 14 Superchargers on the continent, mostly covering Norway and Central Europe.\n\nThe company states that it’s dialing up its commitment to Europe. It represents a “priority market” for Tesla, which will soon introduce a right hand drive Model S for the UK.\n\nThe 30 new service stations and stores would more than double the budding car company’s presence in Europe.

  "latent_17219": "THIS is a strange moment for sex in America. We’ve detached it from pregnancy, matrimony and, in some circles, romance. At least, we no longer assume that intercourse signals the start of a relationship. But the more casual sex becomes, the more we demand that our institutions and government police the line between what’s consensual and what isn’t. And we wonder how to define rape. Is it a violent assault or a violation of personal autonomy? Is a person guilty of sexual misconduct if he fails to get a clear “yes” through every step of seduction and consummation?\n\nAccording to the doctrine of affirmative consent — the “yes means yes” rule — the answer is, well, yes, he is. And though most people think of “yes means yes” as strictly for college students, it is actually poised to become the law of the land.\n\nAbout a quarter of all states, and the District of Columbia, now say sex isn’t legal without positive agreement, although some states undercut that standard by requiring proof of force or resistance as well.\n\nCodes and laws calling for affirmative consent proceed from admirable impulses. (The phrase “yes means yes,” by the way, represents a ratcheting-up of “no means no,” the previous slogan of the anti-rape movement.) People should have as much right to control their sexuality as they do their body or possessions; just as you wouldn’t take a precious object from someone’s home without her permission, you shouldn’t have sex with someone if he hasn’t explicitly said he wants to.\n\nAnd if one person can think he’s hooking up while the other feels she’s being raped, it makes sense to have a law that eliminates the possibility of misunderstanding. “You shouldn’t be allowed to make the assumption that if you find someone lying on a bed, they’re free for sexual pleasure,” says Lynn Hecht Schafran, director of a judicial education program at Legal Momentum, a women’s legal defense organization.\n\nBut criminal law is a very powerful instrument for reshaping sexual mores. Should we really put people in jail for not doing what most people aren’t doing? (Or at least, not yet?) It’s one thing to teach college students to talk frankly about sex and not to have it without demonstrable pre-coital assent. Colleges are entitled to uphold their own standards of comportment, even if enforcement of that behavior is spotty or indifferent to the rights of the accused . It’s another thing to make sex a crime under conditions of poor communication.\n\nPhoto Credit Yu Man Ma\n\nMost people just aren’t very talkative during the delicate tango that precedes sex, and the re-education required to make them more forthcoming would be a very big project. Nor are people unerringly good at decoding sexual signals. If they were, we wouldn’t have romantic comedies. “If there’s no social consensus about what the lines are,” says Nancy Gertner, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School and a retired judge, then affirmative consent “has no business being in the criminal law.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPERHAPS the most consequential deliberations about affirmative consent are going on right now at the American Law Institute. The more than 4,000 law professors, judges and lawyers who belong to this prestigious legal association — membership is by invitation only — try to untangle the legal knots of our time. They do this in part by drafting and discussing model statutes. Once the group approves these exercises, they hold so much sway that Congress and states sometimes vote them into law, in whole or in part. For the past three years, the law institute has been thinking about how to update the penal code for sexual assault, which was last revised in 1962. When its suggestions circulated in the weeks before the institute’s annual meeting in May, some highly instructive hell broke loose.\n\nIn a memo that has now been signed by about 70 institute members and advisers, including Judge Gertner, readers have been asked to consider the following scenario: “Person A and Person B are on a date and walking down the street. Person A, feeling romantically and sexually attracted, timidly reaches out to hold B’s hand and feels a thrill as their hands touch. Person B does nothing, but six months later files a criminal complaint. Person A is guilty of ‘Criminal Sexual Contact’ under proposed Section 213.6(3)(a).”\n\nFar-fetched? Not as the draft is written. The hypothetical crime cobbles together two of the draft’s key concepts. The first is affirmative consent. The second is an enlarged definition of criminal sexual contact that would include the touching of any body part, clothed or unclothed, with sexual gratification in mind. As the authors of the model law explain: “Any kind of contact may qualify. There are no limits on either the body part touched or the manner in which it is touched.” So if Person B neither invites nor rebukes a sexual advance, then anything that happens afterward is illegal. “With passivity expressly disallowed as consent,” the memo says, “the initiator quickly runs up a string of offenses with increasingly more severe penalties to be listed touch by touch and kiss by kiss in the criminal complaint.”\n\nThe obvious comeback to this is that no prosecutor would waste her time on such a frivolous case. But that doesn’t comfort signatories of the memo, several of whom have pointed out to me that once a law is passed, you can’t control how it will be used. For instance, prosecutors often add minor charges to major ones (such as, say, forcible rape) when there isn’t enough evidence to convict on the more serious charge. They then put pressure on the accused to plead guilty to the less egregious crime.\n\nThe example points to a trend evident both on campuses and in courts: the criminalization of what we think of as ordinary sex and of sex previously considered unsavory but not illegal. Some new crimes outlined in the proposed code, for example, assume consent to be meaningless under conditions of unequal power. Consensual sex between professionals (therapists, lawyers and the like) and their patients and clients, for instance, would be a fourth-degree felony, punishable by significant time in prison.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt’s not that sex under those circumstances is a good idea, says Abbe Smith, a Georgetown law professor, director of the school’s Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic, and an adviser to the American Law Institute’s project on sexual assault. “It’s what my people would call a shanda, mental health professionals having sex with their clients,” says Ms. Smith. (“Shanda” is Yiddish for scandal.) But most of these occupations already have codes of professional conduct, and victims also have recourse in the civil courts. Miscreants, she says, “should be drummed out of the profession or sued for malpractice.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt’s important to remember that people convicted of sex crimes may not only go to jail, they can wind up on a sex-offender registry, with dire and lasting consequences. Depending on the state, these can include notifying the community when an offender moves into the neighborhood; restrictions against living within 2,000 feet of a school, park, playground or school bus stop; being required to wear GPS monitoring devices; and even a prohibition against using the Internet for social networking.\n\nWe shouldn’t forget the harm done to American communities by the national passion for incarceration, either. In a letter to the American Law Institute, Ms. Smith listed several disturbing statistics: roughly one person in 100 behind bars, one in 31 under correctional supervision — more than seven million Americans altogether. “Do we really want to be the world leader of putting people in cages?” she asked.\n\nAffirmative-consent advocates say that rape prosecutions don’t produce very many prisoners. They cite studies estimating that fewer than one-fifth of even violent rapes are reported; 1 to 5 percent are prosecuted and less than 3 percent end in jail time. Moreover, Stephen J. Schulhofer, the law professor who co-wrote the model penal code, told me that he and his co-author have already recommended that the law do away with the more onerous restrictions that follow from being registered as a sex offender.\n\nContinue reading the main story Recent Comments taopraxis 1 hour ago You're out with a woman and you sense a mutual attraction.Stop!Just don't go there...

See All Comments\n\nWrite a comment\n\nI visited Mr. Schulhofer in his office at New York University Law School to hear what else he had to say. A soft-spoken, thoughtful scholar and the author of one of the most important books on rape law published in the past 20 years, “Unwanted Sex: The Culture of Intimidation and the Failure of Law,” he stresses that the draft should be seen as just that — notes from a conversation in progress, not a finished document.\n\nBut the case for affirmative consent is “compelling,” he says. Mr. Schulhofer has argued that being raped is much worse than having to endure that awkward moment when one stops to confirm that one’s partner is happy to continue. Silence or inertia, often interpreted as agreement, may actually reflect confusion, drunkenness or “frozen fright,” a documented physiological response in which a person under sexual threat is paralyzed by terror. To critics who object that millions of people are having sex without getting unqualified assent and aren’t likely to change their ways, he’d reply that millions of people drive 65 miles per hour despite a 55-mile-per-hour speed limit, but the law still saves lives. As long as “people know what the rules of the road are,” he says, “the overwhelming majority will comply with them.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe understands that the law will have to bring a light touch to the refashioning of sexual norms, which is why the current draft of the model code suggests classifying penetration without consent as a misdemeanor, a much lesser crime than a felony.\n\nThis may all sound reasonable, but even a misdemeanor conviction goes on the record as a sexual offense and can lead to registration. An affirmative consent standard also shifts the burden of proof from the accuser to the accused, which represents a real departure from the traditions of criminal law in the United States. Affirmative consent effectively means that the accused has to show that he got the go-ahead, even if, technically, it’s still up to the prosecutor to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he didn’t, or that he made a unreasonable mistake about what his partner was telling him. As Judge Gertner pointed out to me, if the law requires a “no,” then the jury will likely perceive any uncertainty about that “no” as a weakness in the prosecution’s case and not convict. But if the law requires a “yes,” then ambiguity will bolster the prosecutor’s argument: The guy didn’t get unequivocal consent, therefore he must be guilty of rape.\n\nSO far, no one seems sure how affirmative consent will play out in the courts. According to my informal survey of American law professors, prosecutors and public defenders, very few cases relying exclusively on the absence of consent have come up for appeal, which is why they are not showing up in the case books. There may be many reasons for this. The main one is probably that most sexual assault cases — actually, most felony cases — end in plea bargains, rather than trials. But prosecutors may also not be bringing lack-of-consent cases because they don’t trust juries to find a person guilty of a sex crime based on a definition that may seem, to them, to defy common sense.\n\nContinue reading the main story 51 Comments\n\n“It’s an unworkable standard,” says the Harvard law professor Jeannie C. Suk. “It’s only workable if we assume it’s not going to be enforced, by and large.” But that’s worrisome too. Selectively enforced laws have a nasty history of being used to harass people deemed to be undesirable, because of their politics, race or other reasons.\n\nNonetheless, it’s probably just a matter of time before “yes means yes” becomes the law in most states. Ms. Suk told me that she and her colleagues have noticed a generational divide between them and their students. As undergraduates, they’re learning affirmative consent in their mandatory sexual-respect training sessions, and they come to “believe that this really is the best way to define consent, as positive agreement,” she says. When they graduate and enter the legal profession, they’ll probably reshape the law to reflect that belief.\n\nSex may become safer for some, but it will be a whole lot more anxiety-producing for others.",

  "latent_17300": "Authored by Daisy Luther via The Organic Prepper blog,\n\nIf you ever wondered what life was really like in a post-collapse society, look no further than Venezuela. Today, I’d like to share a first-hand report of everyday life there.\n\nThe country has been on the way down since a socialist government destroyed the economy. Here’s a quick timeline:\n\nIt appears there is no end in sight to the tribulations of the Venezuelans.\n\nA reader from Venezuela took the time to comment and tell us what life is really like there. You can find her story below. (I’ve edited for spacing to make them easier to read, but please keep in mind that English is a second language.)\n\nDaisy Thank you so much for this content.\n\nI’m a venezuelan mom of a 1 year old baby. And we are living a war here.\n\nYou can’t go outside to buy food or supplies or medication because each activity is a high risk and more with a baby. So I stay home as much as I can. There are a lot people outside trying to live normaly, trying to go to work and buy foods and continue there lives. But when you are working or whatever thing your doing you dont know is you will be able to come back home safe… people continues to work to get whatever miserable pay to buy some food.\n\nEverything is so expensive. Perhaps the beans and rice are affordable but still not cheap and is so hard to find food. options are limited because of the price… you can only buy one item or two of pasta, rice, like I say the less expensive food , and you have to wait in long long lines at your own risk because there are a lot of fights in this store. imagine tones of people wanting to buy the same product. this have being worst since perhaps about 5 years now… because of scarcity.\n\nMalls and big stores are basicly alone because there are places where “colectivos” use to attack, with bombs and there is a group of about 40 men in motorcicles that have been creating chaos in the whole city, every day the take the city they have plenty of arms and the just go through the city shooting building houses, stealing stores, people on the streets, batteries of cars, everything the want… this situation is far worst that we ever imagine. they kill people every day and they are pay mercenaries from the goverment because no one does nothing.\n\nthe goverment people is also killing inocents. kids… teenagers, the youth. we are panicking. We bough a land 3 years ago. I got pregnant and we decided to wait. the land is a safe zone but is 5 hours from here. is a very small town 11. 000 people. I live ib a city with about 3 million people. at least for now the town are peaceful but there isnt electricity and the isnt an asfalt road so this doesnt sound lovely for thief that are now looking for biggest fish to cash. according to our neighbours the town is in calm nothing has happen. We need to go as soon as possible. I am scared because what you say is also true. But in the city there are no options at least not now. . what do you thnk we should do? I realize appreciate what you recommend.\n\nI’m sorry for my bad english I’m trying to write this while playing with my baby.\n\nVenezuelan houses are already bunkers. This has being like this ever since I can remember. Perhaps 20 years… Every regular house is made like bunkers. Pure concrete from the botton to the walls to everything. Every house has also 2 to 3 security doors really big and heavy ones and on top of that we have fences and electric fences on top Of BIG GATES. And trust me is not enough to be safe.\n\nThe army has damaged gates and has entry to different houses looking for students, or rebels… and also innocents people has died because they were sadly in the middle of this events. I don’t doubt that country land might have problems too. But so far cities are pure anarky and maddness.\n\nThere are several groups creating chaos… the army, the mercenaries, the thiefs, and the rebels that want to kill chavismo and politics and whatever on their way. A few days they put a bomb into a propane gas distribution cargo and it blew away and this have being affecting every single thing, they steal cargo transporting food or gas and even fuel… so there is no much to do now.\n\nCommunities in the city are not organize since they really need to find food and basic resources so each indivual is waiting in long lines to buy a bread or a medicine or whatever they need… and people doesnt want to organize they dont see this could go like this for years… I assume that we got used to live in some sort of chaos and violence.\n\nBut the true is most people is praying and just wishing this will pass soon. that this will pass as the moment a new presindent arrive.\n\nAnd what if it doesnt? Let’s be clear that we have so many resources, and Canadá and USA are pulling all of the gold and all minerals now so no country really matters what we are suffering as long as they can get they way.\n\nWe really feel hopeless.",
  "latent_17332": "Hello, my dear readers!\n\nThis is the second of three posts about the Big Freelancing Three – Elance, Fiverr and PeoplePerHour. Today, we take a look at Britain-based PeoplePerHour!\n\nHow it works:\n\nThe home of the creepy, expressionless orange smiley face is similar to its blue-and-white-themed cousin, but it has its own nuances as well.\n\nOnce you set up a profile on PeoplePerHour, there are two ways to go about finding work.\n\n1. You can search multiple job categories (writing, IT, administrative assistance, etc.) and send a proposal in the much the same way as you would on Elance. You send a cover letter, the price, some portfolio samples and you’re done! A free account on PeoplePerHour gives you 15 credits per month used to apply for jobs. In the past few months, though, I’ve been given 85 and an email saying they think I’m going to be one of their top sellers. I’m not sure if I’m tooting my own horn here because I don’t know if this is something they send out to everybody at some point or what…\n\n2. You can also sell Hourlies – fixed price jobs clients can purchase like any other online product. For example, one of my Hourlies that’s been doing well recently here and on Fiverr is screenwriting. I set up and Hourlie that says I will write so many words of a screenplay for such a price; it’s as if my clients buy little “packets” of work. I haven’t tested the price limits on said “packets” so I can’t tell you how high it can go; it goes as low as $10USD, though.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages-a-plenty when it comes to this Fiverr-Elance hybrid.\n\nWhat PeoplePerHour Does Right:\n\nOverall, it’s a healthy blend between Elance and Fiverr in the way it operates.\n\nUnlike Elance, you can apply for jobs in any category even if you only specialize in one or two.\n\nYou have the option of getting an email notification if the job you applied for is awarded to another freelancer.\n\nThe portfolio system makes it easy to send prospects documents/samples without having to re-upload them over and over again.\n\nAsking for a deposit on a job is a default setting, a feature not found on Elance.\n\nClients have the option of having freelancers answer specific interview questions during the proposal-writing process.\n\nWhat PeoplePerHour Does Wrong:\n\nThis has less to do with the site and more to do with my own observations, but the competition seems especially tight.\n\nseems especially tight. A 15 percent service fee taken out of the final earnings? And a 1.9-percent fee for PayPal transfers? No thank you.\n\nThe proposal submission system would really benefit from giving freelancers the option of including a schedule. A simple calendar system like Elance would do.\n\nA more detailed reviewing system for both freelancers and clients would be nice.\n\nThe portfolio system isn’t what it could be; it doesn’t let you describe each individual sample in very much detail.\n\nA free PeoplePerHour account only gives you 15 credits per month. (UPDATE: They’ve since changed this to 45, in my experience. I’m currently CERT Level 4.)\n\nFinal Word: My experience with PeoplePerHour has been all right. There are flaws in the system and room for improvement and there does seem to be more (or at least quicker in terms of applying for jobs) competing freelancers, but I still find it a viable site for making connections, expanding your portfolio and, of course, making money.\n\nLast Week: Elance\n\nNext Week: Fiverr\n\nHave you had experience with PeoplePerHour?

  "latent_17335": "Review article\n\nAbstract\n\nThe burden of low back pain disability has increased steadily over the last few decades in western countries. The high social and economic cost of low back pain is related to the minority of individuals who lose more than six months from work. Although the risk factors for low back pain have been well delineated, methodologic obstacles have hindered the collection of information on factors associated with a chronic course. The most reliable data are those generated by prospective studies involving multivariate analyses. Advanced age is associated with an increased risk of chronic pain, as is male gender (except in some recent studies). Weight and height are not related to chronicity. Disease-related factors predictive of chronic pain include presence of multiple functional symptoms, evidence of nonorganic disease, pain in the legs, significant disability at onset, a protracted initial episode, multiple recurrences and a history of low back pain or inhospital treatment. Occupational factors have a very substantial impact: workers in blue-collar jobs, those involved in heavy labor or in jobs that require efforts beyond their physical capabilities and those who have a low level of job satisfaction or poor working conditions, who are new at their job, or who are not well rated by their superiors are more likely to develop chronic pain. A history of compensation for a spinal condition, receipt of work-related sickness payments, or litigation about compensation are also associated with an increased risk of chronic pain. Social and economic factors predictive of a chronic course are a low level of schooling, language problems, a low income and an unfavorable family status. The impact of psychological factors is controversial. Depression, a number of specific coping strategies and a sensation of being \"sick all the time\" may be associated with an increase in the risk of chronicity. Overall, progression to a chronic pattern of pain is more closely dependent on demographic, psychosocial and occupational factors than on the medical characteristics of the spinal condition itself. Simple questionnaires can be used to identify patients at a high risk for chronicity. Treatment should be prompt and comprehensive in these patients since the likelihood of a return to work decreases rapidly as sick leave duration increases.",
  "latent_17359": "Those crazy folks on Madison Avenue had a difficult task getting this year’s Super Bowl ads ready. At $3 million per 30-second spot, these commercials have to deliver humor and entertainment and pitch the product in some shape or form to consumer concerns. Unfortunately for advertisers, this meant trying to address the recession worries that seem to overshadow pretty much everything else nowadays. Recession = downer = not funny. So how did advertisers pull off funny commercials while tackling the recession? Let’s just say some did better than others.\n\nWorkplace anxiety\n\nSlapstick has been a huge favorite of advertisers lately. In this spot, however, the slapstick goes to the side of frightening. Employees throw a heavy snow globe through a glass vending machine window and then at a fellow employee. Given all the stress that’s will be building in America’s offices over the next few months, this ad is just not that funny. Today it’s snowglobes, tomorrow it’s an AK-47.\n\nPower Fantasies\n\nSome advertisers obviously figured that, in a time when people feel helpless, the best commercial should fulfill that need for control. So they created this piece about a creepy guy who uses an omnipotent bag of Doritos to fulfill his criminal desires. See also the GoDaddy.com pervert spot (not shown here).\n\nInspiration\n\nFor decades, Budweiser has relied on the Clydesdale to awe consumers into buying a six-pack.

  "latent_17397": "Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\n\nOffice of Research and Analysis\n\nPublication No. FMCSA-RRA-07-017\n\nJuly 2007\n\nThe Large Truck Crash Causation Study\n\nThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted the Large Truck Crash Causation Study (LTCCS) to examine the reasons for serious crashes involving large trucks (trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating over 10,000 pounds). From the 120,000 large truck crashes that occurred between April 2001 and December 2003, a nationally representative sample was selected. Each crash in the LTCCS sample involved at least one large truck and resulted in a fatality or injury.\n\nThe total LTCCS sample of 963 crashes involved 1,123 large trucks and 959 motor vehicles that were not large trucks. The 963 crashes resulted in 249 fatalities and 1,654 injuries. Of the 1,123 large trucks in the sample, 77 percent were tractors pulling a single semi-trailer, and 5 percent were trucks carrying hazardous materials. Of the 963 crashes in the sample, 73 percent involved a large truck colliding with at least one other vehicle.\n\nDefining Causation\n\nMotor vehicle crashes are complex events. Usually they involve two or more vehicles. Elements that influence the occurrence of a crash may take place hours, days, or months before the crash. They include driver training and experience, vehicle design and manufacture, highway condition and traffic signaling, and weather conditions. Other elements may take place immediately before a crash, such as a decision to turn in traffic, a tire blowout, or snow. Crash reconstruction experts rarely conclude that crashes are the result of a single factor.\n\nFatigue, drinking alcohol, and speeding are major factors in motor vehicle crashes overall. Although their presence does not always result in a crash, these three factors, as well as other driver, vehicle, and environmental factors, can increase the risk that a crash will occur. In the LTCCS, 'causation' is defined in terms of the factors that are most likely to increase the risk that large trucks will be involved in serious crashes.\n\nData Collection\n\nData for the 963 crashes in the LTCCS sample were collected at 24 sites in 17 States. A crash researcher and a State truck inspector traveled to each crash site as soon as possible after the crash occurred. The researchers collected crash scene data through interviews with drivers, passengers, and witnesses, and the inspectors conducted thorough inspections of the trucks, the drivers' logbooks, and other documentation. After leaving the crash scene, the researchers collected additional data through interviews with motor carriers and, when the actual drivers could not be interviewed, surrogate drivers. The researchers also reviewed police crash reports, hospital records, and coroners' reports and revisited the crash scenes.\n\nFor each crash, data were collected on up to 1,000 elements, including the condition of the truck driver and the other drivers involved before the crash; the drivers' behavior during the crash; the condition of the trucks and other vehicles; roadway factors; and weather conditions. Data were coded by crash experts, difficult cases were reviewed by FMCSA and NHTSA staff, and completed cases were put into a publicly available electronic database on FMCSA's Web site.\n\nNational Crash Estimates\n\nAccording to NHTSA's estimate, there were approximately 120,000 fatal and injury crashes nationwide during the 33-month study period that involved at least one large truck; 141,000 large trucks were involved in those crashes. Each of the 963 LTCCS study cases was assigned a sampling weight, which allows for national estimates of total fatal and injury truck crashes during the study period.\n\nAll study results presented here are national estimates for the 141,000 large trucks that were estimated by NHTSA to have been involved in fatal and injury crashes during the study period. The estimates may differ from true values, because they are based on a probability sample of crashes and not a census of all crashes. The size of the difference may vary, depending on which LTCCS sample is the focus of a particular table or analysis.\n\nCoding Crash Causation Variables\n\nMany variables were coded from the hundreds of data elements collected on each crash. Three key variables were coded for assessing crash risk:\n\nCritical Event: The action or event that put the vehicle or vehicles on a course that made the collision unavoidable. The critical event is assigned to the vehicle that took the action that made the crash inevitable.\n\nCritical Reason: The immediate reason for the critical event (i.e., the failure leading to the critical event). The critical reason is assigned to the vehicle coded with the critical event in the crash. It can be coded as a driver error, vehicle failure, or environmental condition (roadway or weather).\n\nAssociated Factors: The person, vehicle, and environmental conditions present at the time of the crash. No judgment is made as to whether any factor is related to the reason for a particular crash, just whether the factor was present. The list of the many factors that can be coded provides enough information to describe the circumstances of the crash.\n\nCritical Events\n\nThree major types of critical events were assigned to large trucks:\n\nRunning out of the travel lane, either into another lane or off the road (32 percent of the large trucks in the LTCCS sample were assigned this critical event)\n\nVehicle loss of control due to traveling too fast for conditions, cargo shift, vehicle systems failure, poor road conditions, or other reasons (29 percent)\n\nColliding with the rear end of another vehicle in the truck's travel lane (22 percent).\n\nCritical Reasons\n\nThe percentage of large trucks coded with a critical reason depends on the type of crash:\n\nOf the large trucks involved in all LTCCS crashes (single-vehicle and multi-vehicle), 55 percent were assigned the critical reason in crashes.\n\nOf the large trucks involved in two-vehicle LTCCS crashes between one truck and one passenger vehicle (a car, van, pickup truck, or sport utility vehicle), 44 percent were assigned the critical reason.\n\nTable 1 shows the critical reasons assigned, by major categories.\n\nCritical Reasons Number of Trucks Percent of Total Driver 68,000 87% Non-Performance 9,000 12% Recognition 22,000 28% Decision 30,000 38% Performance 7,000 9% Vehicle 8,000 10% Environment 2,000 3% Total Number of Large Trucks Coded with Critical Reason 78,000 100% Total Number of Large Trucks Not Coded with Critical Reason 63,000 — Total Number of Large Trucks Involved in Crashes 141,000 —\n\nNotes: Results shown are national estimates for the 141,000 large trucks estimated to have been involved in fatal and injury crashes during the study period. The estimates may differ from true values, because they are based on a probability sample of crashes and not a census of all crashes. Estimates are rounded to the nearest 1,000 large trucks.\n\nDriver critical reasons are coded in four categories:\n\nNon-Performance: The driver fell asleep, was disabled by a heart attack or seizure, or was physically impaired for another reason.\n\nRecognition: The driver was inattentive, was distracted by something inside or outside the vehicle, or failed to observe the situation adequately for some other reason.\n\nDecision: For example, the driver was driving too fast for conditions, misjudged the speed of other vehicles, or followed other vehicles too closely.\n\nPerformance: For example, the driver panicked, overcompensated, or exercised poor directional control.\n\nAssociated Factors\n\nHundreds of associated factors were collected for each vehicle in each crash. In descending order, the top 10 factors coded for large trucks and their drivers were:\n\nBrake problems\n\nTraffic flow interruption (congestion, previous crash)\n\nPrescription drug use\n\nTraveling too fast for conditions\n\nUnfamiliarity with roadway\n\nRoadway problems\n\nRequired to stop before crash (traffic control device, crosswalk)\n\nOver-the-counter drug use\n\nInadequate surveillance\n\nFatigue.\n\nRelative Risk\n\nRelative risk analysis of the data on associated factors, using the critical event and critical reason coding, allows the sorting out of factors into those merely present at the time of the crash and those that increase the risk of having a crash. The trucks involved in LTCCS crashes can be divided into two groups: those that were assigned the critical event and critical reason and those that were not. When the presence of associated factors coded to the two groups is compared, the relative risk of each factor can be assessed, as the following examples illustrate:\n\nIf 30 percent of the trucks assigned the critical reason for a crash were coded with the driver associated factor 'traveling too fast for conditions,' while only 5 percent of the trucks that were not assigned the critical reason were coded with the same associated factor, it can be concluded that speed is a factor that increases the risk of being involved in a crash.\n\nIf 30 percent of the trucks assigned the critical reason for a crash were coded with the driver associated factor 'prescription drug use,' while 30 percent of the trucks that were not assigned the critical reason were also coded with the same associated factor, it can be concluded that prescription drug use is not a factor that increases the risk of being involved in a crash.\n\nTable 2 shows the 19 associated factors that were coded most frequently for large trucks in the LTCCS, where there was a statistically significant association between the factor and the assignment of the critical reason. The order of the factors in the table is based on the number and percentage of trucks assessed with each factor. The relative risk number is a ratio of the critical reason coding for trucks coded with the factor, compared with trucks not coded with the factor. Thus, Table 2 shows that a truck with brake problems was 170 percent more likely to be coded with the critical reason for a crash than a truck that was not coded with the brake problems associated factor.\n\nTable 2\n\nAssociated Factors Assigned in Large Truck Crashes and Their Relative Risk Importance\n\nFactors Number of Trucks Percent of Total Relative Risk Vehicle: Brake problems 41,000 29% 2.7 Driver: Traveling too fast for conditions 32,000 23% 7.7 Driver: Unfamiliar with roadway 31,000 22% 2.0 Environment: Roadway problems 29,000 20% 1.5 Driver: Over-the-counter drug use 25,000 17% 1.3 Driver: Inadequate surveillance 20,000 14% 9.3 Driver: Fatigue 18,000 13% 8.0 Driver: Felt under work pressure from carrier 16,000 10% 4.7 Driver: Made illegal maneuver 13,000 9% 26.4 Driver: Inattention 12,000 9% 17.1 Driver: External distraction 11,000 8% 5.1 Vehicle: Tire problems 8,000 6% 2.5 Driver: Following too close 7,000 5% 22.6 Driver: Jackknife 7,000 5% 4.7 Vehicle: Cargo shift 6,000 4% 56.3 Driver: Illness 4,000 3% 34.0 Driver: Internal distraction 3,000 2% 5.8 Driver: Illegal drugs 3,000 2% 1.8 Driver: Alcohol 1,000 1% 5.3\n\nNotes: Results shown are national estimates for the 141,000 large trucks estimated to have been involved in fatal and injury crashes during the study period. The estimates may differ from true values, because they are based on a probability sample of crashes and not a census of all crashes. Estimates are rounded to the nearest 1,000 large trucks.\n\nOf the top 10 associated factors coded for large trucks, 3 do not appear in Table 2. For those three associated factors—traffic flow interruption, prescription drug use, and required to stop before crash—there was no significant difference in the frequency at which trucks with and without the factors were coded with the critical reason for a crash.\n\nIt is important to note both the number of times an associated factor is coded and its relative risk ratio. For example, the brake problems associated factor is the most frequently coded (29 percent), but it has a lower relative risk ratio than those for 13 other factors. Pre-crash cargo shift, with the highest relative risk ratio (56.3), was reported for only 4 percent of the large trucks involved in LTCCS crashes.\n\nOf the 19 factors listed in Table 2, 15 are driver factors. Those 15 driver factors can be divided into two major groups. One group—fatigue, illness, and drug use (both legal and illegal)—reflects the condition of the driver before the crash. The other group—excessive speed, inadequate surveillance, illegal maneuver, inattention, distraction (outside the truck and inside the truck), and following too close—reflects driving mistakes.\n\nLarge Truck – Passenger Vehicle Crashes\n\nOne-half of the LTCCS crashes involved collisions between a large truck and a passenger vehicle (car, pickup truck, van, or sport utility vehicle). In those crashes, the same associated factors coded most often for the large trucks usually were also coded most often for the passenger vehicles. For both large trucks and passenger vehicles, there was a statistically significant link between the following 10 associated factors (listed in descending order according to how often they were coded for the large truck) and coding of the critical reason:\n\nInterruption of the traffic flow\n\nUnfamiliarity with roadway\n\nInadequate surveillance\n\nDriving too fast for conditions\n\nIllegal maneuver\n\nInattention\n\nFatigue\n\nIllness\n\nFalse assumption of other road user's actions\n\nDistraction by object or person inside the vehicle.\n\nThere are some important differences in the coding of associated factors between the two vehicle types. For large trucks, but not passenger vehicles, following too closely (a traffic situation that required a stop before the crash) and distraction outside the vehicle were statistically related to assignment of the critical reason. In addition, vehicle factors that were not coded or examined for the passenger vehicles (brakes, tires, jackknife, and cargo shift) were statistically linked to assignment of the critical reason for large trucks.\n\nFor passenger vehicles, but not for trucks, alcohol and illegal drug use have a statistically significant association with coding of the critical reason. These factors, combined with fatigue (coded twice as often for passenger vehicles as for large trucks) and illness (coded five times more often for passenger vehicles), show that passenger vehicle drivers were subject to adverse physical conditions more often than truck drivers were before the crashes occurred.\n\nStudy and Data on FMCSA's Web Site\n\nMore information on the Large Truck Crash Causation Study can be found here.

  "latent_17485": "Corey Crawford’s rise up Canadian ranks a ‘special’ feeling\n\nTORONTO — For the 52nd time on Wednesday night, Jonathan Toews slipped on a Team Canada sweater and played a meaningful game for his country.\n\nFor Corey Crawford, it was the very first time.\n\n“Watching it as a kid, watching the Olympics and the World Juniors, it was a pretty special feeling to put that jersey on,” Crawford said after making 19 stops in Canada’s 4-1 win over Team Europe, clinching the top spot in Group A. “Having friends and family, my parents here, it was a great feeling.”\n\nCrawford demurred when asked if it meant a little more to him than his teammates, given the rest of the roster has a combined 51 gold medals — 21 at the Olympics, 16 at the World Championships, and 14 at the World Juniors. Crawford said everyone in the dressing room feels that same sense of pride when donning the famed maple leaf, and that “it’s nothing but smiles and good times in that room.”\n\nBut Crawford is the lone Canadian on the roster without previous international experience. And while triple-gold winners such as Toews, Sidney Crosby, Patrice Bergeron and Corey Perry have been representing Canada since they were teenagers, Crawford took the long road to Toronto. He spent four full seasons in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, then the bulk of the next five seasons in the American Hockey League with just a handful of NHL games to his credit. By the time he broke into the NHL for good in 2010-11, he already was 26 years old.\n\nNow, the longtime minor-league journeyman who has been doubted and dismissed his whole career is not just a two-time Stanley Cup champion, but the No. 2 goalie on possibly the greatest team ever assembled, a key cog in the new red machine — behind only gold-medalist Carey Price. He dressed for all three World Cup games ahead of reigning Vezina Trophy winner Braden Holtby.\n\nThe long-running Corey Crawford Doesn’t Get Any Respect story line is now just a footnote in the hockey history book. And even Crawford couldn’t deny it’s been a gratifying rise to the top.\n\n“Definitely,” he said. “I’ve always wanted to play for Team Canada. It’s always been a goal of mine. It’s pretty special to wear that jersey in a game.”\n\nAt the outset of the World Cup, Crawford sounded like a guy who was just happy to be here, the likely No. 3 goalie who was just trying to get in a few extra drills after practices. But Canada coach Mike Babcock saw first-hand how good Crawford can be under pressure during the unforgettable 2013 Blackhawks-Red Wings series, and always has been one of Crawford’s biggest boosters. Canada already had clinched a spot in the semifinals before Wednesday night’s game, but the top seed in Group A was still on the line.\n\nBabcock cited Crawford’s two Cups when asked why Crawford got the call.\n\n“It’s hard, anybody could start for us, they’re all really good goaltenders,” Babcock said. “But its what Crow’s résumé is all about — composure under pressure and winning situations.”\n\nStill, even though he’s played in 83 Stanley Cup playoff games, Crawford admitted to genuine nerves on Wednesday night. After all, it was something he’s been waiting for basically his whole life.\n\n“Wearing the jersey, being on the ice with all those guys, it got me pretty nervous,” Crawford said. “It’s special. I’ve always wanted to be a part of that. To play in the game was awesome.”\n\nCrawford didn’t face a ton of action — he saw just four shots in the first period, thanks to Canada’s stifling defense and masterful puck-possession game — but after a long summer, the high-level competition in games and practices can only help him get off to a quick start when the NHL season begins.\n\n“There’s so many good players out there,” Crawford said. “You have all the best players in the world here playing, so it’s really at a high level right now.”\n\nA level that now, finally, includes Crawford himself.\n\nEmail: mlazerus@suntimes.com\n\nTwitter: @marklazerus",

  "latent_17546": "This post originally appeared on VICE Canada.\n\nThe story of today's prescription opioid overdose crisis didn't start this year, or ten years ago, or even 100 years ago. It starts with a plant—the opium poppy—that has been a part of human civilization for thousands of years.\n\nPapaver somniforum, literally, \"sleep-bringing poppy,\" is the scientific name for the type of poppy that produces opium, which humanity has relied on since before history was even a concept. Along with wheat, the opium poppy is one of the world's oldest cultivated plants, with some estimates suggesting that humans have been growing it for 10,000 years or more. It's been cultivated so widely we don't even know where it originates. Some think it's indigenous to the Eastern Mediterranean or the Swiss Alps, but frankly nobody really knows. What's clear, though, is that the relationship between humans and this strange and hardy plant (it can grow basically anywhere) goes beyond curiosity and into the realm of symbiosis.\n\nThere's a line from Lars Von Trier's Antichrist: \"Nature is Satan's church,\" and perhaps there's no better example of the curious and uncanny relationships that form across species and time than the one between humans and the poppy. Opioids, the chemicals produced by Papaver Somniforum, somehow fit perfectly into the human body's opioid receptors, which are scattered throughout the brain, spinal cord, and digestive system, and this precise fit makes them exceptionally effective at suppressing pain. The geometry is so exact that some experts theorize that the opium plant and our neural architecture is the result of symbiotic co-evolution (some even think opium poppies shaped the development of human consciousness). The mystical pain-dampening plant on the one hand, the upright ape on the other.\n\nSo when we talk about today's opioid crisis, we're really talking about just the latest chapter in an inter-species relationship that spans millennia. That's important to remember because for all their potential harms, opioids are a critical part of human civilization given their unique capacity to numb our pain. The issue, then, isn't so much how we stop people from using opioids, but instead how we make sure that these drugs bring us the most benefits with the fewest harms.\n\nUnfortunately, over the past few decades, it seems that the harms of opioids are increasingly outweighing their benefits in North America, to the point where governments are declaring public health emergencies in response to epidemics of opioid overdose deaths. In Ontario, one in eight deaths among young adults are the result of opioid overdoses, while drug overdose—driven primarily by opioids—is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. But how did we get here? The answer is a cautionary tale about the power of Big Pharma, the unintended consequences of government intervention, and the tenacity of drug markets.\n\nPurdue Pharmaceuticals. Photo via Doug Healey/Associated Press\n\nOxyContin has been widely hailed as a wonder drug, and in many ways, it is. A prescription drug with billions in R&D behind it, OxyContin was put on the market in 1996 as a fast-acting, controlled release formulation of oxycodone, which is an opioid used to treat moderate to severe pain, and which was originally designed to treat cancer patients. In its first year on the market, OxyContin sales reached $48 million; in 2000—just four years later—annual sales had reached almost $1.1 billion, representing an increase of roughly 2,200 percent. It remained among the top 20 best-selling drugs in the US until 2013, when it was taken off the market. By the conventional metrics of the pharmaceutical industry, then, OxyContin was a massive and highly profitable success.\n\nPart of that success, though, wasn't just a natural result of OxyContin's effectiveness as an opioid painkiller. Purdue Pharma, the pharmaceutical giant that developed the drug, also threw millions behind marketing the drug to its key customer base: medical doctors. This meant, for instance, holding more than 40 all-expense-paid conferences for more than 5,000 attendees and paying out $40 million in bonuses to Purdue sales reps in the first five years OxyContin was on the market. In some cases, the marketing strategies verged into the ridiculous, as with Purdue Pharma's creation of a promotional song—\"Get in the Swing with OxyContin\"—to try to entice doctors to prescribe the drug.\n\nOther strategies went further. One of the major breakthroughs in expanding the number of OxyContin prescriptions came with Purdue Pharma's decision to switch focus from marketing OxyContin as a drug to manage cancer-related pain—a relatively stable market—and instead promote it as an effective and safe treatment for the more nebulous class of \"chronic non-malignant pain\" (a.k.a., non-cancer pain), a market that was exploding in the late 1990s. It was a masterstroke, and it paid off: Between 1997 and 2002, there was a near tenfold increase in OxyContin prescriptions in the US for chronic non-malignant pain, from 670,000 to 6.2 million annually. It was the opening up of a massive new market for opioids that would prove incredibly profitable: Purdue Pharma made nearly $3 billion in revenues from OxyContin in the first five years it was on the market.\n\nThe true genius, though, was Purdue Pharma's use of granular geographic data to identify doctors with the highest OxyContin prescribing patterns in specific area codes, and then targeting those clinicians with marketing materials that included patient coupons for free 30-day trials of OxyContin prescriptions (as laid out in a American Journal of Public Health review.) The idea was that these techniques would help identify doctors with the highest number of chronic pain patients. Of course, it also opened up the possibility, if not the probability, that Purdue Pharma was pushing doctors who were already over-prescribing OxyContin to ramp their prescriptions up even further.\n\nPhoto via Toby Talbot/Associated Press\n\nIn some cases, Purdue Pharma's marketing verged on the sinister and even crossed into the illegal. Nowhere was this more obvious than in the pharmaceutical giant's downplaying of the addictive potential of OxyContin, which it did in a multitude of ways. In 2010, two doctors at St. Michael's Hospital, a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Toronto's medical school (and where I hold a position), started voicing concerns about pharmaceutical industry involvement in a pain-management course that was part of U of T's med school curriculum. It turned out that the lecturer for the course, Dr. Roman Jovey, was a member of Purdue Pharma's speakers' bureau and was paid by the company to lecture. Worse, a book on pain management that was co-authored by Dr. Jovey and funded by Purdue had been used as a textbook within the class. In the book, free copies of which were given to U of T medical students, oxycodone (the active agent in OxyContin) was described as a moderate-intensity opioid despite the fact that it is twice as potent as morphine. It was also characterized as having a low risk for addiction among non-malignant pain patients, despite the fact that at the time, rates of opioid dependence among patients prescribed OxyContin were soaring.\n\nIn 2007, during a time when the dangers of OxyContin over-prescribing were starting to become clear to public health experts, three top executives at a subsidiary of Purdue Pharma pled guilty to fraud and paid $600 million for \"misbranding\" OxyContin as a result of the company's claims that the drug was less addictive than other comparable opioid-based drugs like Percocet or Vicodin. In internal Purdue Pharma documents dating to before OxyContin was marketed, company officials expressed concerns that they would face resistance from medical doctors concerned about the potential for patients to become addicted. Despite these doubts, Purdue Pharma went full steam ahead in marketing the drug as having a \"reduced-risk\" for addiction; in the court case, it was found that this constituted fraudulent and deceptive marketing, and in a guilty plea, Purdue Pharma agreed, with the company stating that \"[w]e accept responsibility for those past misstatements and regret they were made.\"\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span id=\"selection-marker-1\" class=\"redactor-selection-marker\" data-verified=\"redactor\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\nBy the time public health experts started sounding the alarm about the addictive potential of OxyContin, the damage was done. Beginning in the early 2000s, the infusion of billions of OxyContin pills into the drug market had caused a seismic shift in drug use patterns, with increases in heroin use and injection-drug use among working-class white people in suburban and rural communities across North America for the first time in decades. Purdue Pharma had wedged open a massive new market of people seeking to numb their pain, aided and abetted by a legion of clinicians without the requisite knowledge about the drug's dangers and a lack of expertise in managing the associated risks. But now, the market was out of control. The alarm had been sounded. It was time to act.\n\nThere's a phenomenon to describe the ways that trying to intervene in one part of a drug market can make things worse elsewhere. It's called the Balloon Effect, for the way that squeezing one part of a balloon causes other parts to expand, and it's surprisingly common in the history of the drug war. When the US tried to stop cocaine production by eradicating coca leaf cultivation in Colombia, for instance, all that the aerial spraying and destruction of millions of hectares of farmland did was spread production to Colombia's neighbors, Bolivia and Peru. When a sudden drop in the availability of heroin in Australia occurred in 2001, the number of heroin users plummeted, but was offset by a similar increase in the number of people using cocaine and amphetamines. The problem is, basically, that if you don't first reduce demand for a drug, trying to control supply in a global economy only incentivizes drug traffickers to find new supply routes or new drugs to bring to the market.\n\nSo it has gone with efforts to control North America's opioid problem, and why it is that we are now facing an even graver crisis than in the era when OxyContin prescriptions were at their peak. Instead of meaningfully scaling up effective treatment for people who became addicted to OxyContin, the major policy change was the removal of OxyContin by Purdue Pharma from the North American market in 2012 and its replacement with OxyNEO, which the company claims is tamper-resistant (i.e., harder to crush up, snort, or inject). The timing of this swap out, though, caused some experts to grow suspicious: In Canada, OxyNEO was introduced just a few months before the patent on OxyContin was set to expire, meaning that it was also an effective way for Purdue Pharma to protect its market share.\n\nWorse, efforts by government agencies and medical associations to reduce opioid prescribing failed to make a meaningful dent. How could it, given that doctors had been acculturated into believing that drugs like OxyContin weren't actually that dangerous, and chronic pain patients had grown accustomed—and in many cases, dependent on—a steady supply of opioids? Instead, with OxyContin's removal, fentanyl, an opioid painkiller 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine and which carries an even higher risk of overdose, became the opioid of choice to fill the prescription void.\n\nAnd this is where the Balloon Effect comes into play: Without expanded access to treatment, the demand for opioids hasn't gotten smaller. Reducing the supply of opioids like OxyContin has only served to shift the market to more dangerous ones like fentanyl. As a second wave of alarm has spread about fentanyl, some doctors have become unwilling to treat chronic pain patients at all. The result? The market—this time, contraband fentanyl and lesser known carfentanil (developed as an elephant tranquilizer and 10,000 times more powerful than morphine)—have been filling the void, with deadly but predictable results. The question is, of course, where continuing along this path will get us. If beer was taken off the market, people would drink wine. If wine was taken off, people would drink hard liquor. If hard liquor was taken off, people would drink industrial alcohol. So it goes with opioids, and why we've moved from OxyContin (1.5 times as strong as morphine) to fentanyl (50–80 times more powerful) to carfentanil (10,000 times more powerful).\n\nSo how does this cycle stop? Sadly, there is no quick fix when it comes to opioids. Simply banning painkillers would doom hundreds of thousands of people who are legitimately suffering with pain to a barbaric and excruciating existence. And when the problem was caused by a billion-dollar fraud perpetrated on an unsuspecting public via one of the most trusted pillars—medical doctors—the solution is just too damn big to be easily dealt with. What's clear, though, is that the cycle of squeezing the supply without addressing the demand for opioids will only get us into increasingly more dangerous territory. Instead, we need a broad recognition that the pharmaceutical market is just one part of a larger drug market that includes illegal drugs and regulated substances like alcohol, and that intervening on supply in one part of this larger market will have ripple effects across the whole enterprise. If we fail to come to this realization, we'll be dooming ourselves to the opioid overdose epidemic becoming a permanent fixture of our society. Do we really want to live in a world where we have to worry about one tiny grain of carfentanil killing kids who are experimenting with drugs? In the long history of our symbiotic relationship with opioids, that would be the saddest ending of all.\n\nDr. Daniel Werb is an epidemiologist and policy analyst with expertise in the fields of HIV, addictions, and drug policy.\n\nFollow Daniel Werb on Twitter.",
  "latent_17691": "As some of you may know, I subbed in for CLG this past week of NA LCS. Dexter had problems getting his passport, so I was once again called in for assistance. CLG had reached out to me the previous two weeks, but I thought that the work needed to play at the competitive level was a little too much. I also had other priorities (getting Challenger before it got filled). This week was different because Doublelift personally reached out to me on Skype and used a few highly guilt tripping words to change my heart. “We are screwed” is the most impactful quote that I can remember. Nonetheless, I agreed to subbing in and began to play with the team for two days before coming to the NA LCS. I never thought that I would play competitively again, but to me this was a one time deal to help out my friends who seemed to be in dire straits.\n\nPracticing with the team was very nostalgic. Communication wasn’t amazing by any means, but the team was willing to work together and make calls without an actual shot caller. Since I was now a stranger on the team, it was very refreshing to not have any burden to make any calls. I just did my job and let the game run its course. I felt like we were actually a strong team among the 8 teams of the NA LCS. Even though the environment was slightly different than when I had left, the feeling of the team was exactly the same. The humor and jokes of old CLG still remained, and I did not feel alienated in the slightest. It almost felt as if I had never left. Everything was natural, and everyone was having fun. The camaraderie of the competitive scene is what I will miss most.\n\nThe new LCS studio was a ridiculous upgrade in terms of providing for the players. Originally the old studio had two rooms for the teams that were to play in the next match. Teams rotated out and had to deal with each other’s garbage and arguments before getting on stage. The new studio actually has individual team rooms fully equipped with computers, TV (broadcasting current LCS matches), and bathroom. Privacy is no longer a concern. Down the hall is the player lounge where food is catered (generally pretty good food) and there are couches for players who don’t have much to do on the given day. Outside of the amenities, the biggest change to playing at the studio had to be the crowd. Each week there is a small crowd that watches the players and directly simulates a large LAN event environment. LCS players who have to play at international events will now be very comfortable.\n\nPlaying middle lane against competitive LCS players made me realize a few things that weren’t very clear to me previously. For one, ganks in competitive play are incredibly easy to snuff out if communication is on point. Pressure on the map is pretty much known to everyone in the game based on the ability to 2v2 skirmish on the top side of the map. This makes it so that you can pretty easily predict enemy jungler movement. This is very important because ganks in competitive play are incredibly coordinated relative to solo queue. Junglers can gank at any opportunity you throw at them, which is why passive play is emphasized when jungler can be nearby. As for skill of the enemy laner, LCS mid laners are not that much better than solo queue players in lane. LCS players are way better players overall, but the laning matchup is limited to knowledge of specific matchups. Most LCS players’ matchup knowledge is only vast in the current FOTM matchups which aren’t popular in solo queue.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time playing competitively again. Having time to hang out with the team and interact with the fans gave me a nice refreshing view of what being a pro player entails. I lived this lifestyle for three years, but I am proud to say that I am done with my time being a professional player and will focus on other future endeavors. I wish CLG the best of luck with Dexter returning in the near future. They will be a strong team, and I hope they will progress well in the LCS.\n\nFOLLOW CHAUSTER:\n\nComments\n\ncomments",
  "latent_17848": "Stanford physicists and engineers take first step toward quantum cryptography\n\nStanford researchers demonstrate the first step in a scalable quantum cryptography system that could lead to uncrackable telecommunications.\n\nFurqan M Fazal The spin-photon entanglement experimental apparatus.\n\nQuantum mechanics offers the potential to create absolutely secure telecommunications networks by harnessing a fundamental phenomenon of quantum particles. Now, a team of Stanford physicists has demonstrated a crucial first step in creating a quantum telecommunications device that could be built and implemented using existing infrastructure.\n\nQuantum cryptography relies on the curious aspect of quantum mechanics by which pairs of electrons can become \"entangled.\" Electrons have a property called \"spin\": Just as a bar magnet can point up or down, so too can the spin of an electron. When electrons become entangled, their spins mirror each other.\n\nIf the spin of electron A is found to be pointing \"up,\" then electron B's spin will also point up. If electron A's spin measures \"down,\" so too would electron B's. An amazing feature of entangled electrons is that this pairing persists no matter the distance between electron A and electron B.\n\nThis behavior can be applied to create a perfectly secure communications network, which is of great interest to governments as well as members of private industry, such as banks. If one has a set of electrons in San Francisco and another set in New York, and the electrons can be made to be entangled, then it is possible to distribute cryptographic keys – strings of 1s and 0s, in which the different electron spin directions correspond to either 1 or 0 – between San Francisco and New York. The nature of quantum entanglement means it would be impossible for an eavesdropper to intercept the keys without the original parties noticing.\n\nThe work done by the Stanford research group of Yoshihisa Yamamoto, a professor of applied physics and of electrical engineering, in collaboration with the group of applied physics Professor Martin Fejer, provides a solution to one of the key wrinkles of quantum telecommunications. In the example above, the electrons are thousands of miles apart, so they can't be directly entangled; instead, they become entangled by sending photons between the two over fiber optic cables.\n\nIn this case, the San Francisco-based sender would coax its electron to emit a photon, which would itself be entangled to the electron. The New York-based recipient's electron would also emit an entangled photon, and when the two photons interact, the electrons on either end would then become entangled and share the same quantum spin.\n\nA challenge is that light \"leaks\" from even the best fiber optic cables; current systems employ multiple devices called \"repeaters\" that receive a fading light signal and then amplify and reproduce it to send to the end recipient. In order to transmit quantum messages, scientists need to build \"quantum repeater\" systems that enable entanglement between electrons to be created over many repeater stations between the start and end locations.\n\nQuantum telecommunication networks such as this are still years away, but the new Stanford research – published this week in Nature, with recent PhD graduate Kristiaan De Greve as lead author – demonstrates a critical first step in that chain.\n\nOther researchers have entangled an electron and photon and created a memory using the electron, but those efforts required complex systems that are bulky and difficult to duplicate. The new approach, however, is potentially easier to scale up to systems that have many entangled pairs of electrons, said one of the study co-authors, Peter McMahon, an electrical engineering PhD candidate at Stanford.\n\nThe Stanford group used a quantum dot array – provided by collaborators at the University of Würzburg in Germany – that sits on a postage stamp-size semiconductor chip that contains a layer that is covered with millions of tiny bubbles, or dots. Each of these so-called quantum dots contains a single electron; in essence, each quantum dot is an artificial atom. By focusing a laser on a single dot, the researchers excited the electron inside and caused it to emit a photon. Tests showed that the emitted photon's orientation corresponded to the electron's spin direction, confirming that the photon and electron were quantum entangled.\n\nAn advantage of quantum dot arrays is that they could be produced using standard semiconductor-manufacturing technology. A single chip could contain millions of dots, arranged in a regular grid layout that would allow for the generation of long keys at high speeds.\n\nAnother experimental first achieved by the Stanford group is that the photon entangled with the electron is produced at the optimal frequency for transmission along fiber optic cables. The ability to slide into existing telecommunications networks and the ease of manufacture make Stanford's approach particularly appealing for future research, McMahon said.\n\nThe next step will involve building a receiver and confirming that electrons on both ends become entangled. And though that work could take several years, McMahon and his colleagues are optimistic. \"We have demonstrated a fundamental building block of a quantum repeater node,\" he said. \"It should not be impossible to create the second link.\"\n\nThe paper by Kristiaan De Greve and co-contributors Leo Yu, Peter McMahon, Jason Pelc et al. appears in Nature, Vol. 491. The work was done in collaboration with researchers from the University of Würzburg and Heriot-Watt University.\n\nThe work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology, and the State of Bavaria. Funding also came from the Herb and Jane Dwight Stanford Graduate Fellowship, a David Cheriton Stanford Graduate Fellowship and a Robert N.

The Gangreen Gang looked older and more menacing. Ace had red, rather than black, sunglasses. He also wore a short-sleeved shirt and sported crooked teeth. Little Arturo had two 0's on his shirt and a pink nose. Snake had visible ears, sharp teeth, and a red and yellow cap. Grubber had a pink nose. Big Billy's nose matched his skin color.\n\nIn this short, the Amoeba Boys were capable of committing actual crimes and even knew how to use guns. Bossman had a cigar in his mouth, Slim had sharp teeth and Jr. had freckles. They all had purple spots on their bodies instead of light blue spots. Additionally, their voices were more garbled. In the final series, however, they are completely inept at crime and are more of a nuisance to the Girls than a real threat. Slim's body was a lighter color compared to Bossman and Junior.\n\nThe short has a much smaller cast than the final series, as it was intended as merely a preview to the show that McCracken was pitching to Cartoon Network.\n\nThe Girls had blue, rather than, purple eyelids in this short.\n\nTrivia",
  "latent_18210": "April 22nd was supposed to be a victory lap and the birth of a new movement. That day, the March for Science saw a million scientists and science lovers descend on Washington, D.C. and cities and hamlets around the world, the physical manifestation of a viral online campaign.\n\nIt was the first time scientists had ever mobilized en masse as the centerpiece of movement, spurred by the Trump administration’s attacks on everything from climate change science to diversity and inclusivity. But in the six months since the signs were recycled and the white coats returned to the labs, the March for Science has been dogged by the same problems that plagued it in the run up to April 22nd. On Monday, 15 past and present march volunteers posted an open letter outlining persistent issues with the March, including its approach to inclusivity, organizational dysfunction, and mismanagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We are concerned about ongoing issues related to transparency, undervaluing and mismanaging volunteer labor, and sidelining both diverse voices and the ways science relates to justice and equity,” the authors wrote in their letter. “Though the organization calls itself an open, grassroots movement, it is run like a closed, hierarchical organization.”\n\nThe open letter belies turmoil at an organization that at its conception was seen as the potential dawn of a new movement fusing science with advocacy. Instead, letter signatories and other past and present volunteers have told a story of an organization unable to provide clarity on its day-to-day work as well as its next steps.\n\n“It’s not really one individual but the way the organization is structured,” Amber Ying, a social media volunteer with the March and one of the open letter’s signatories, told Earther. “There’s very little communication about what is going with daily operations.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond the daily grind, the letter signatories also say there are deeper questions about the finances of the organization. There is no public information about what’s happening with the $1.3 million raised by the organization through April 30, the donations that have come in since or, until recently, who is being paid by the national organization.\n\nIn the wake of the open letter, the March for Science updated its people page to reflect that it has nine employees. It does not include all their roles in the organization, though, which stands somewhat in contrast to the transparency the open letter signatories called for.\n\nOne of those paid staffers is Caroline Weinberg, one of the national co-chairs, who has been paid as the interim executive director since late August. The letter signatories said that hiring Weinberg goes against promises made that the co-chairs would have a role on the board but not take paid positions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeinberg told Earther that the search for a permanent executive director will begin December “if not earlier” and more details will become available on the organization’s financials soon.\n\n“Our monthly expenses are $36,870 going towards staff, digital advocacy tools, legal fees, insurance, and things like website hosting and email accounts,” she said. “Our budget will be released this week as part of our [501]c3 application.”\n\nFights about inclusivity have also sapped the March of some of its energy. The March first presented itself as apolitical, which rankled some scientists who view science and politics as intimately entwined. After authoring a diversity statement, Harvard cognitive scientist Steven Pinker accused the bubbling movement of compromising “its goals with anti-science PC/identity politics/hard-left rhetoric.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat started a back and forth on how to represent diversity and politics punctuated by the March taking those issues lightly and at times, flippantly.\n\nThe letter signatories and other scientists also suggest the March continues to push diversity issues to the side. The March for Science came under fire from the right for being too focused on identity politics, and swerved in response to those critiques in a way that alienated researchers who view science, diversity and justice as intrinsically linked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose issues have led a number of scientists Earther spoke with to focus their efforts advocating for science and equality in science elsewhere.\n\n“The Science March could have been a moment where the public and the scientific community came together to redefine what science for all would look like, but I just haven’t seen any concerted efforts to shape that kind of a conversation into a coherent vision I can rally behind,” Maryam Zaringhalam, a molecular biologist who marched in April, told Earther.\n\nZaringhalam is one of the leaders of 500 Women Scientists, another viral grassroots effort that sprung out of an open letter about more inclusivity in science in the wake of Trump’s inauguration. The group initially supported the March for Science and offered to help organizers address diversity after the march was repeatedly criticized for tweets that seemed to make light of serious issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Whenever we tried to offer constructive criticism, we were met with defensiveness, which didn’t help shape the March in a way that aligned with 500 Women Scientists’ mission,” Zaringhalam said.\n\nThat led 500 Women Scientists to eventually dissolve their partnership with the march. Others who see the explicit link between science, politics, and diversity also view the March as still failing to represent the reality that science doesn’t happen in a vacuum.\n\n“Honestly, I can’t tell what the March for Science is up to these days,” Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Washington and early March critic, told Earther. “I have no sense that anything has come out of the March, except a lot of clarity on how American higher education has failed to contextualize for students of science the relationship between science and society.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of these issues have come to a head again at the six-month mark of the March. They also come at a time of increasing politicization of science with the Trump administration rolling back environmental protections, deleting references to climate change from websites and pushing the travel ban, which inherently harms scientists and collaborations.\n\nIt’s a time when civil society, including scientists, should in theory be more engaged than ever with these issues. But the March doesn’t appear to have seized that opportunity, leaving the letter signatories and others frustrated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the March, organizers coordinated a week of intense planning to figure out what was next. The national organization’s social media channels kept tweeting and posting but the site wasn’t updated and until recently, still including information on the Washington, D.C. march route itself, according to Weinberg.\n\nWhile the group drafted proposals in the early summer based on planning sessions and a listening tour, it’s unclear what’s happened with them since to Ying and other letter signatories. In the meantime, many local chapters have taken actions on their own, with little guidance from the national level.\n\n“From my conversations, satellite march leaders have disengaged because they feel time and effort to shape the organization post-march has been ignored,” Aaron Huertas, the former national communications lead for the March who also signed the letter, told Earther. “Unfortunately, the national organization has left a lot of that momentum on the table and it has withered because they haven’t approached it from a grassroots level.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the unrest, the March for Science still has the power to make an impact in the science community and the letter’s signatories believe the letter can be part of that process.\n\n“The systemic communications issues, sidelining, all this is something you’ll find anywhere,” Ying said. “But knowing it is such a common problem, we should be able to talk about it openly and improve our movement going forward.”\n\nYing and Huertas both also advocated for the local chapters of the March to have a greater say in what comes next, and that there are already examples of what that could look like. The Houston chapter, for example, is putting on an event to help schools and donate blood in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. Ying said the national organization could make a meaningful impact by helping financially support events like this in other local chapters and having a clearer message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We never felt like we had a single point of contact at the national level,” Sasha Luks-Morgan, a PhD student at the University of Utah who helped organize the Salt Lake City march, told Earther. “Watching all of the debates about the importance of diversity from afar was extremely disheartening. It felt like the national organizers could never decide who they were, or what they wanted to do.”\n\nThe national organization could also make some headway if it chooses to wade into the politics, an area it has tried to avoid by broad messaging about advocating for science. But that message may be falling on deaf ears on the right.\n\nMatthew Motta, a political science PhD candidate at the University of Minnesota, told Earther science—specifically rejecting science and expertise around issues like climate change—was on the minds of Republican voters in 2016 but it wasn’t for Democrats. Motta’s research shows that the March for Science may have polarized opinions on science further, with liberals becoming more supportive of science and scientists while conservatives became more distrustful of experts (though interestingly, not science itself).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreasing polarization isn’t exactly ideal, but Motta said his findings show that the door could be open for March organizers to play a role in lifting up Democratic candidates in 2018 midterms.\n\n“We see this growth of scientists and academics running for office happening now,” Motta said. “That’s an interesting development showing there’s this express link between science and politics. So if the March for Science can say things like throw your support behind these specific candidates, it could make a dent.”\n\nIt’s still a big tbd if the March for Science goes down that road even as other groups ramp up their actions to support scientists and advocate for equality. That includes the aforementioned 500 Women Scientists, as well as groups like 314 Action that have sprung up to support scientists running for office, and Science for the People, which focuses on the links between social justice and science. The March may have lost its opportunity to be the center of the burgeoning movement of scientists trying to shape policy, but it still has the chance to be a part of it. And the movement will go on regardless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis post was updated to include comments from the Sasha Luks-Morgan, one of the Salt Lake City march organizers.",

Microsoft and its Surface tablet seem to think so, but at least for one high-profile Surface user, you can’t. The New England Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick, is going back to using a pen and paper.\n\nThere’s a lot of technology in use on the sidelines of an NFL game, with various radio mics between players, coaches, press, referees and others, and it all goes wrong on a weekly basis, according to Belichick. But the one thing that annoys him most is the tablets.\n\nIn a five-and-a-half-minute rant, Belichick said: “As you probably noticed, I’m done with the tablets. I’ve given them as much time as I can give them. They’re just too undependable for me.\n\n“I’m going to stick with pictures as several of our other coaches do as well because there just isn’t enough consistency in the performance of the tablets, so I just can’t take it anymore.”\n\nMicrosoft is one of the primary sponsors of the NFL, placing its Surface tablets in the hands of coaches and players on the sidelines, fed from large Microsoft-branded tablet cupboards. But while the NFL seems happy with the tablets, some players and coaches haven’t been quite so pleased.\n\nSome have taken to throwing them on the floor. Belichick, who openly smashed one down on to the edge of an equipment case, was later handed a new one.\n\nRich Hill (@PP_Rich_Hill) Belichick watching this game on a tablet right now: pic.twitter.com/cBM0gb9UWm\n\nBelichick said: “I’ve tried to work through the process but it just doesn’t work for me and that’s because there’s no consistency to it. I’ll use the paper pictures from here on because I’ve given it my best shot.”\n\nMicrosoft says that none of the tablets have failed on the sidelines, even when smashed into the heads of players such as Johnny Manziel, and that at least one of the high profile “failures” has been at the hands of dodgy Wi-Fi rather than the tablet itself.\n\nMelissa Riofrio (@MRiofrioPCW) Microsoft: A Surface that survives Johnny Manziel couldn't fail Pats https://t.co/jRgmijbL5a @markhachman @pcworld pic.twitter.com/IsViOIwntd\n\nEither way it seems that for at least one professional sportsman you can’t get real work done on a tablet.",

To \"increase liquor sales and make money fast,\" the founder of the Hubei-based Nine Springs Ecological Agriculture Development Co., bought 1 kilogram of Sildenafil on the Internet in January, adding the drug -- marketed as Viagra and Revatio -- to alcoholic drinks without mentioning the special ingredient on the label, the state-run China News Agency said Friday. The spirits were marketed as \"nutritional healthy liquor\" and sold around Hubei province at a price of up to 60 yuan ($9.70) per bottle. The founder, identified in the report only by his surname Huang, also allegedly kept 30 bottles of the potion for himself, CNA said. Huang said he thought only an overdose of the drug would be harmful but admitted to knowing that Chinese law forbids adding Sildenafil to liquor, the report added.\n\nHave breaking news sent to your inbox.

MetaX and ConsenSys have jointly created adChain, a blockchain-based open protocol that's programmable to the needs of the digital advertising industry. MetaX plans to launch a token sale for this platform June 26th.\n\nThe utility tokens grant holders the right to participate in the adChain platform. The sale will fund further product development and innovation to help streamline the $175 billion digital advertising supply chain that’s riddled with fraud and transparency issues.\n\n“It’s been nearly two years of ideating and developing adChain to serve as a foundation for MetaX, and other developers, to build out blockchain-aware solutions for the digital advertising industry. The June 26th sale is for adToken (ADT), a utility-based token used for participating in the adChain protocol,” said Ken Brook, co-founder and CEO of MetaX. “We will be applying the proceeds to the continued build-out of the adChain protocol and development of related decentralized applications – a core component of bringing this big vision to life.”\n\nMetaX believes that to solve the digital advertising supply chain transparency issue it’s crucial to move away from dependencies on closed systems. The digital advertising ecosystem must instead embrace the development and adoption of a decentralized approach and truly open technology. Walled-gardens are largely to blame for the state of the industry and current initiatives are still wholly focused on creating more closed systems.\n\nMetaX’s philosophy to build toward decentralization and develop on open platforms aligns squarely with the ethos behind blockchain, and especially Ethereum.\n\n“adChain offers a potential solution to address many of the fundamental flaws in digital advertising's broken state. ConsenSys is extremely proud of the contribution we have made to the adChain protocol and look forward to continue our close collaboration alongside MetaX. We are genuinely excited about the utility of adToken and the transformative design patterns because open protocols like adChain represent a forward leap towards widespread Ethereum adoption,” said Mark D’Agostino, managing partner, ConsenSys Enterprise.\n\nAbout adToken and adChain\n\nadChain is an open protocol on public Ethereum that allows for the building of decentralized and ad-centric applications for the $175 billion digital advertising ecosystem. The first solution of adChain is the adChain Registry, a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain which stores domain names accredited as non-fraudulent by ADT holders. ADT holders will access a token-weighted voting mechanism through a user interface to vote on whether a publisher domain is fraudulent or non-fraudulent. dApps (decentralized applications) utilizing the adChain protocol will enable advertisers and publishers to run campaigns that leverage the power of Ethereum, while maintaining the familiar user experience of legacy tools. These dApps will drive adoption across the thousands of advertisers, publishers and technology providers, in the digital advertising ecosystem.\n\nVisit https://adtoken.com for more details on the adToken (ADT) mechanism and to download the newly released adChain white paper.\n\nLegal disclaimer: With respect to AdTokens and any information related thereto: (1) any public sale of AdTokens will be subject to terms, conditions and disclosures set forth in one or more documents and related sources of information (e.g., websites) that have not yet been finalized and are subject to change until the time of the public sale; (2) please read all final materials carefully because you will be bound by such terms and conditions in connection with any purchase; (3) any purchase involves substantial risks, including the complete loss of funds and the complete loss of value of the AdTokens; (4) materials are solely for informational and illustrative purposes and provided without representation, warranty or guaranty of any kind, and do not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase any instrument or asset; and (5) nothing herein constitutes investment advice or any recommendation whatsoever.\n\nAbout MetaX\n\nMetaX is a Los Angeles-based, blockchain technology company driving development and adoption of open platforms for digital advertising.

It said the asylum applications were handed over to the Russian consulate in the transit zone of Moscow airport, where Snowden has been hiding out for the past week.\n\nAccording to the list, Snowden's targets include not only Ecuador and Iceland, but also Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Italy, Ireland, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Norway and Finland in Europe, along with China, Russia, Cuba, Bolivia, Brazil, Venezuela, Nicaragua and India.\n\nIn a statement released on the same website under his name, Snowden accused the US of wanting to deny him the \"human right\" to apply for asylum in other nations. The government had invalidated his passport before he had been found guilty of any crime. Now, said the statement, the US government was using a different strategy - \"citizenship as a weapon.\"\n\nIn what is thought to be his first public comment since fleeing Hong Kong for Moscow around a week ago, Snowden accused US President Barack Obama of \"deception.\"\n\nAlthough Obama had publicly rejected diplomatic \"wheeling and dealing\" over his case, the president had put massive pressure on countries such as Ecuador that had been known to have considered offering the fugitive asylum.\n\nThe list was published just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would shelter Snowden on the condition he agree to stop publishing US secrets.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Tanzania, Obama confirmed on Monday that his government was engaged with Russia in high-level negotiations to secure Snowden's extradition to the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said on Monday he was not aware of any attempt by the whistle-blower to seek asylum in the EU but that any application would be reviewed on the basis of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nDPA/The Local/AFP/jlb",
  "latent_18258": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced this week that African lions (Panthera leo leo) may deserve protected status under the Endangered Species Act. The decision, published November 27 in the Federal Register, comes in response to a petition (pdf) filed in March 2011 by five conservation groups that argued that American hunters pose a major threat to a species that is already in serious decline.\n\nAfrican lion populations have declined by about 50 percent over the past three decades. Current estimates put the total number of the big cats at fewer than 35,000.\n\nTrophy hunting hardly poses the greatest threat to lions—which also suffer from habitat loss, the bushmeat trade, exotic diseases, conflict with livestock farmers and the often illegal trade in lion parts for use in traditional medicine, most of which is fueled by poaching and smuggling—but when you add up the numbers, hunters do have a significant impact on the big cats. According to data gathered for last year's petition, more than 7,000 lion body parts were traded internationally between 1999 and 2008 for recreational trophy hunting purposes, representing more than 5,600 lions. The vast majority of those trophies were imported into the U.S. by, or on behalf of, American hunters.\n\nIf you dig deeper into those numbers, two more facts become clear. First, hunting is occurring at unsustainable levels in 16 of the 20 African countries in which lions can still be found. Second, hunting appears to be increasing. The number of trophies imported into the U.S. in 2008 was more than double that in 1999 and higher than in any other year in that decade, said Teresa Telecky, director of Humane Society International's wildlife department, speaking at a press conference on November 26.\n\nIf African lions are added to the endangered species list—a process that could still take a few years—the listing would not prohibit Americans from traveling to Africa and hunting lions, but it would block hunters from bringing their trophies back into this country. The conservation groups say this disincentive would make hunting the animals less attractive.\n\nOutside of trophy hunting, at least 2,715 body parts from wild lions—claws, skins and skulls—and even live animals were commercially traded during the same period, representing at least another 1,000 animals. The majority of the items were U.S.-bound. Such imports would no longer be allowed if lions were protected under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nHunting individual lions is only part of the problem—their deaths can create a domino effect in their prides. \"When males that are part of a pride are killed, the pride becomes unstable and vulnerable to a takeover by a new male or coalition of males,\" said Jeff Flocken, director of the Washington, D.C., office of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, during this week's press conference. \"If this happens, males from both sides can be mortally wounded. If the takeover is successful, cubs less than nine months of age will likely be killed by the new males, and the females can be injured or killed defending their cubs.\"\n\nEndangered Species Act protection would have a few other effects within the U.S. First, importation of live lions would no longer be allowed without specialized permits. Private ownership of lions would still be legal, but the sale and transport of lions across state lines would be severely restricted. As Flocken pointed out during the press conference, consumption of lions would also be illegal, which would block the import of lion bushmeat and the already controversial sale of lion burgers as well as any lion bone trade related to traditional medicines. Adam Roberts, executive vice president of Born Free USA, said there is little evidence of the latter in this country to date, though it is a big problem in Africa.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service is now soliciting public comments on the proposal to add African lions to the endangered species list (to comment, go to regulations.gov and enter Docket No. FWS-R9-ES-2012-0025). After the 60-day comment window, the FWS will further review whether listing the cats is appropriate.\n\nPreviously in Extinction Countdown:\n\nPhoto: Meraj Chhaya via Flickr.

  "latent_18965": "North Korea on Wednesday morning attempted the launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) from a Sinpo-class submarine, MBN reported.\n\nAccording to the article, the submarine left the port early in the morning, but returned to the dock near Wonsan at 9 a.m. local time, which South Korean experts saw as indicating a failed fourth SLBM launch attempt.\n\n“The submarine would have not returned to the port that quickly if it were scheduled to take part in another training or operation,” a former South Korean admiral told NK News on condition of anonymity.\n\n“It seems that the submarine dealt with a malfunction during the process of their fourth SLBM test launch, and decided to return.”\n\nThe Sinpo-class submarine suddenly started to sail toward the East Sea on early morning Wednesday, according to MBN. South Korean intelligence immediately started to track the whereabouts of the submarine. But no provocative acts followed and the submarine returned.\n\nThe South Korean Defense Ministry refused to confirm or deny MBN’s claim.\n\n“All we can say is that our military, with the close cooperation with the U.S., is keeping an eye on North Korea’s SLBM development trends,” the military official from South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said during Thursday’s press briefing.\n\nThe exact location of where the event took place was not provided either by the report or by the South Korean Defense Ministry.\n\nBut as the report said the submarine returned to the port near Wonsan, the failed launch attempt likely took place somewhere at the east side of Korea, possibly between Wonsan and Mayang Do Naval Base – one of two North Korean submarine bases – located in South Hamgyong Province.\n\nPyongyang’s latest successful SLBM launch took place on May last year, which their state-run media claimed as evidence “that the ballistic missile fired from the submarine fully met the requirements of the latest military science and technology.”\n\nEven if their most recent launch ended in failure, another South Korean expert said that, assuming the report is true, this would be one of many SLBM launch attempts to come.\n\n“To raise the degree of completion of SLBMs, North Korea will execute dozens more tests in the future,” Moon Keun-sik, the director at the Korea Defense and Security Forum told NK News.\n\n“Perfecting SLBM technology requires a numerous tests … both on the ocean and on the ground. Pyongyang has been miniaturizing their nuclear weapons, and this launch – if it were successful – could’ve been their message to claim that they have completed adapting their warheads to a SLBM.”\n\nOn the same day as the reported test, the South Korean Defense Minister said the chances of North Korea conducting another nuclear test are high.\n\nFeatured image: DPRK Today",
  "latent_19213": "Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani is hopeful that a recent meeting between him and the leadership of Gorran, set up by Salahaddin Bahadin, leader of the Kurdistan Islamic Union (KIU), will lead to mending the relationship between Gorran and his Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), he explained in an interview with Rudaw on Sunday.\n\nRegarding relations with Baghdad, the prime minister would like to see his government and the federal one engage in serious discussions without the involvement of other players like Iran and Turkey. Kurdistan’s referendum and independence is an internal matter, he said, and must be respected as such.\n\nRudaw: You held a meeting today with the Change Movement (Gorran). The meeting has been described as important. How was it organized and what did you talk about?\n\nPrime Minister Nechirvan Barzani: The meeting came from an initiative taken by Mr. Salahaddin Bahadin. In fact, he took the initiative. The meeting was very frank and upfront. We talked about all the questions recently existing in the Kurdistan Region. Generally speaking, the frank discussions, I think will become an important step in order for us to hold similar meetings in the future and, God willing, find solutions for things existing between Gorran and the KDP.\n\nMr. Nechirvan Barzani, what did you agree on in the meeting?\n\nWe more addressed the topics. Our suggestion was for these meetings to continue. From our side as the KDP, we showed the willingness to develop such meetings. So, we are waiting for Gorran as they are going to be holding their own meetings. We will have other meetings later in order to reach a mutual understanding.\n\nMr. Prime Minister, there was a meeting yesterday between Ayad Allawi and Osama al-Nujaifi with the president of the Kurdistan Region. Is there any development with Baghdad to reopen the airports or how that could happen?\n\nIt was the initiative taken and the statement issued as you saw. The Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) position is clear – after the referendum we want to begin serious talks with Baghdad. The meetings have to be in a way that no party suggests preconditions. Both sides should sit unconditionally at the negotiating table. In our opinion, this is the best solution.\n\nBaghdad turning to other countries to assist them or making problems for the Kurdistan Region, be it Turkey or Iran, this is in no-one’s interest in our opinion. It is neither in the interest of Iraq nor in the Kurdistan Region, nor these countries. I think the best thing is that the prime minister of Iraq should understand that this is an Iraqi question and this is our question inside Iraq. The best solution is not turning to other countries to resolve the issues of Iraq. It would be much more beautiful and better for this question to be resolved internally, at the negotiating table in any form. We believe the president of Iraq will take an initiative next week to mobilize the Iraqi parties and we believe it will be a good opportunity for us to reach an outcome.\n\nYou are known for your ability to solve knotty problems. There is such a knot now with Turkey. What are you doing to untie it?\n\nThe knot is very tough and not easy to untie, but we have to gear up all our efforts for the relations to normalize as before. We have to explain to our neighbors that what we did in the Kurdistan Region, as we have said many times and emphasized and will be doing, came from our disappointment with Baghdad. We are not a threat to any of our neighbors, neither Turkey nor Iran. We want to maintain and make our friendly, economic, political, and social relations with the countries around us better. The question of the referendum is associated with Iraq. And we have to resolve this subject with Baghdad within the framework of Iraq. And we hope they assist us in order for us to resolve this question with Baghdad.\n\nLess than a month is left before the elections. Are there possibilities the elections may be delayed?\n\nAs of now, the political parties have not agreed on that. We expect some meetings will be held, so decisions will be made on it later.",
  "latent_19234": "The Washington Redskins and Baltimore Ravens meet up in Maryland as both teams kick off their NFL preseason action.\n\nThe Redskins begin their preseason schedule on the road as they kick off another quest to reclaim top spot in the NFC East, but with movement happening among the other three teams in their division it’ll be a tough task for them to get back into the playoffs. The Skins continue to leave quarterback Kirk Cousins in limbo as he is playing another season with the franchise tag and with a strong effort he could very well earn his pay day, whether it be in DC or otherwise. Washington will look to neutralize a Ravens side that has had a tough offseason as they will begin the preseason and likely the regular season without Joe Flacco and while this is just a preseason encounter the quarterback play early on could prove to be the difference in a close contest.\n\nThe Ravens meanwhile return the bulk of their defense that was their bread and butter against last season but that doesn’t mean they are underwhelming on the offensive side of things despite the fact that Flacco is on the shelf. Baltimore faces an uphill climb as well this season as they have the juggernaut Steelers to contend with and a Bengals team that always seems to be in the mix but their play outside of the division could be the difference between a return to the playoffs or not for John Harbaugh and company. Baltimore heads into this one as a slight favourite of a single point but that could very well change as we approach kick off and more starters and non-active participants are released.\n\nThe Redskins are 9-2 in their last 11 road games ATS and 10-4 ATS in their last 14 overall while the Ravens are 8-17-1 ATS in their last 26 games on turf and have played to the OVER in four of their last five. This should be a close battle but with more to figure out thanks to major changes in the offseason and the short handed nature of the Ravens roster I am leaning towards the Skins in this one.",
  "latent_19376": "Lessons from exporting Estonia’s digital democracy\n\nDaniel Vaarik had a chat with Frans Jorna from the Saxion University in the Netherlands, who is currently working on applying Estonia’s system for local democracy procedures called Volis.\n\nFor years Estonia has been experimenting with tools for digital democracy. Internet voting was introduced already in 2005 and today at least one in five voters casts their votes electronically in elections. At the same time the other countries are not following Estonia’s suit easily. Just how could one export these tools from one country to another anyway? Daniel Vaarik had a chat with Frans Jorna from the Saxion University in the Netherlands, who is currently working on applying Estonia’s system for local democracy procedures called Volis.\n\nWhy are you interested in Estonian digital democracy tools?\n\nI am studying new modes of public governance and after meeting with some colleagues from Estonia, I developed an interest in e-democracy in Estonia, its lessons and applicability in other countries. Estonia’s e-democracy has a specific pedigree, it is from one point attractive, but it is also hard to export.\n\nWhy is it hard to export?\n\nContrary to many other government systems it starts with openness by default. As a reaction to the cumbersome bureaucratic past experiences with Soviet systems, openness, flexibility and apparent forms of government are now hardcoded in your genes. You also had to start from the scratch with little money whereas in many other European countries there are large bureaucratic systems with a long legacy.\n\nYou also have specific technical requirements like X-Road (the environment that allows to use various e-services databases) that exchanges information freely between public and private domains. This would be unthinkable in many other countries with distributed heterogenous info streams.\n\nWhat are you doing with Volis specifically?\n\nIn Netherlands we are developing a local open government lab that connects citizens with professionals to develop good solid ideas that would normally not originate in top down government. Volis could be used as a backbone to get more transparency into the system.\n\nThe room I am in now, this is what we call the City Lab. Professionals, citizens, real estate developers, city marketing people, businesses and researchers will be having discussions and we would formulate and reformulate the ideas, comment on them, vote and transform them into local politics. It would be similar to the participatory budget process in the city of Tartu in Estonia.\n\nWhat have you learned by implementing Volis in Netherlands?\n\nWhatever application you take, you always have to take the country-specificness into account. The comparative aspect needs to be addressed.\n\nFor example as in Tartu they have a participatory budget project where citizens can come up with ideas for public investment. What struck me is the grassroots approach: it is ordinary citizens that participate, craft proposals and cooperate. In Holland, most of the participants are in some way public servants, and the language they speak and proposals they produce are voiced in highly professional language. The reason for this difference became apparent when I visited Tartu. The Tartu municipality had four times less public servants than a city with comparable size in the Netherlands. It simply does not have the money and manpower to dominate participatory processes. Estonia’s local government is flexible and employs much less people, so the particular IT systems make perfect sense there.\n\nHow will systems like Volis change politics, if at all?\n\nIt is an interesting question that I ask myself as well. It seems too soon to tell. Information technology may be a catalyst, requiring transparency and driving out inconsistencies. Open decision-making is a driver for open data sets, open budgets and open spending. Information technology has the capacity to empower ordinary citizens by allowing them to use the power of the network to come up with proposals that can compete with expert-based proposals.\n\nThis may help overcome the cynicism and bias that professionals sometimes have towards e-participation. The long evening sessions that we are used to in Holland could be supplemented by forms of IT sustained participation that are much lighter. Today less people are willing to spend time in traditional forms of civic participation. By limiting the transaction costs with IT, they could enter the discussion any time and any place. The problem with many open systems is that in the end you still need an expert to explain the terms and numbers. So we need more tools that help people to interpret the data, to play with it.\n\nI\n\nCover photo: Frans Jorna. Photo by Henri Pook.",
  "latent_19445": "Sen. Marco Rubio and other GOP senators fired a warning shot this weekend over President-elect Donald Trump’s consideration of ExxonMobil Chairman Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, raising concerns about the global energy titan’s reported Russian ties.\n\nTillerson is thought to be a favorite for the position of top U.S. diplomat and met again with the president-elect in New York on Saturday, though Trump would not confirm his selection in an interview with “Fox News Sunday.” The president-elect said only that he’s “getting very, very close” to an announcement.\n\nBut Rubio, who ran unsuccessfully for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and later endorsed Trump, posted a thinly veiled warning about Tillerson on Twitter Sunday morning, without mentioning him by name.\n\nBeing a \"friend of Vladimir\" is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState - MR — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) December 11, 2016\n\nTillerson is reported to have close ties to Russia. Democrats already have seized on the accounts, with the Democratic National Committee preemptively declaring such a choice “another victory for Vladimir Putin.”\n\nRepublicans have taken a more measured – but still cautious – approach.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, told Fox News on Saturday that Putin is a “thug” and while he doesn’t know the nature of Tillerson’s relationship with the Russian leader, it’s a matter of concern.\n\nSpeaking Sunday with CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” McCain said the Senate would give him a “fair hearing” and noted Tillerson’s ties could be “strictly commercial.”\n\nBut he reiterated that “it should be a matter of concern.” He voiced concern that Tillerson’s relationship could “color his approach” toward Putin and the Russian threat.\n\nAmid the bipartisan debate, Trump tweeted late Sunday morning: “Whether I choose him or not for ‘State’- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week on Tillerson’s ties to Putin and other world leaders.\n\nUnder his leadership, Exxon has steadily expanded its Russian business even as rivals faced expropriation and regulatory obstacles.\n\nIn 2011, Tillerson announced an expansive relationship with Russia's Rosneft that will spend years and billions of dollars developing technology to explore and produce oil and gas in icy waters in the Russian Arctic. In 2013, Putin bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson.\n\nTrump, though, still has not announced his choice for the State Department job.\n\nTrump told “Fox News Sunday” that he has “others” as candidates for the post, while lauding Tillerson’s record.\n\n“He's much more than a business executive. I mean, he's a world-class player. … He's in charge of an oil company that's pretty much double the size of his next serious competitor. It's been a company that's been unbelievably managed. And to me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company -- not for himself -- for the company,” Trump said. “I have tremendous respect for him.”\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that Tillerson would be a “smart pick.”\n\nNoting that experts in the State Department would be on hand to assist the next secretary, McCarthy said Tillerson has an understanding of what world leaders are looking for and “knows what buttons kind of push them.”\n\nSpeaking on ABC News’ “This Week,” incoming Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus also defended Tillerson as an “incredible businessman and American patriot.”\n\nWhile noting a “conclusion has not been made,” he stressed that Tillerson is in the business of finding oil around the world, and said “the fact that he actually has a relationship with people like Vladimir Putin and others across the globe is something that [we] shouldn't be ... embarrassed by.”\n\nAsked about tough questions from Republican senators, he said, “We don't have concerns about confirmation.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",
  "latent_19558": "Feminists will often cite ‘male privilege’ as evidence for the existence of ‘patriarchy’ or at a minimum, women’s relatively disadvantaged state in the West today. (Amp at Alas compiled one of the more notable male privilege checklists.) Most gynocentric feminists ignore the roster of equally valid female privileges.\n\nHere is my list of such privileges, updated from a comment I left some time ago over at Thinking Girl’s.\n\nBy “privileges”, I simply mean areas of life where women in the West have it better than men. In other words, “male disprivilege = female privilege” (and vice versa). There does not seem to be universal agreement about this usage. Some people apparently draw a distinction between “relative advantage” and “unearned benefit which the group shouldn’t have.” (Daran, as usual, had an excellent review of the issue in one of his Creative Destruction posts.)\n\nI have reservations about the term. I use it here primarily as a rebuttal to those who DO use the term and inaccurately assert that in gender, “privilege” is a one-way street.\n\nBTW, I phrased this in the first person the same way Amp phrased his for men, although I’m not female. I believe Amp used this approach not just because he’s male, but to induce some recognition of privilege among the bearers of that privilege, and I use the device similarly here.\n\nAs a woman …\n\n1. I have a much lower chance of being murdered than a man.\n\n2. I have a much lower chance of being driven to successfully commit suicide than a man.\n\n3. I have a lower chance of being a victim of a violent assault than a man.\n\n4. I have probably been taught that it is acceptable to cry.\n\n5. I will probably live longer than the average man.\n\n6. Most people in society probably will not see my overall worthiness as a person being exclusively tied to how high up in the hierarchy I rise.\n\n7. I have a much better chance of being considered to be a worthy mate for someone, even if I’m unemployed with little money, than a man.\n\n8. I am given much greater latitude to form close, intimate friendships than a man is.\n\n9. My chance of suffering a work-related injury or illness is significantly lower than a man’s.\n\n10. My chance of being killed on the job is a tiny fraction of a man’s.\n\n11. If I shy away from fights, it is unlikely that this will damage my standing in my peer group or call into question my worthiness as a sex partner.\n\n12. I am not generally expected to be capable of violence. If I lack this capacity, this will generally not be seen as a damning personal deficiency.\n\n13. If I was born in North America since WWII, I can be almost certain that my genitals were not mutilated soon after birth, without anesthesia.\n\n14. If I attempt to hug a friend in joy, it’s much less likely that my friend will wonder about my sexuality or pull away in unease.\n\n15. If I seek a hug in solace from a close friend, I’ll have much less concern about how my friend will interpret the gesture or whether my worthiness as a member of my gender will be called into question.\n\n16. I generally am not compelled by the rules of my sex to wear emotional armor in interactions with most people.\n\n17. I am frequently the emotional center of my family.\n\n18. I am allowed to wear clothes that signify ‘vulnerability’, ‘playful openness’, and ’softness’.\n\n19. I am allowed to BE vulnerable, playful, and soft without calling my worthiness as a human being into question.\n\n20. If I interact with other people’s children — particularly people I don’t know very well — I do not have to worry much about the interaction being misinterpreted.\n\n21. If I have trouble accommodating to some aspects of gender demands, I have a much greater chance than a man does of having a sympathetic audience to discuss the unreasonableness of the demand, and a much lower chance that this failure to accommodate will be seen as signifying my fundamental inadequacy as a member of my gender.\n\n22. I am less likely to be shamed for being sexually inactive than a man.\n\n23. From my late teens through menopause, for most levels of sexual attractiveness, it is easier for me to find a sex partner at my attractiveness level than it is for a man.\n\n24. My role in my child’s life is generally seen as more important than the child’s father’s role.\n\nThere are many good links to read on the topic of male and female privilege, in addition to the ones listed at the top. Sweating Through Fog put together this female privilege list, with an emphasis on the important difference in the role violence plays in men’s and women’s lives. Interestingly, Women in Higher Education editor Mary Dee Wenniger wrote this female privilege checklist for WIHE, which prompted this somewhat off-target rebuttal by Rachel Edidin. And of course, Daran has written extensively about privilege, which you can read here and in the links listed at the end of that post.",
  "latent_19620": "Copyright by WAVY - All rights reserved (Photo: @GovernorVa/Twitter)\n\nMark Tenia, WRIC - RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) - After opioid addiction was declared a public health emergency in the Commonwealth last month, Virginia hospitals began unveiling proposals to help reform the state's mental health system.\n\nOn Wednesday, the governor announced plans to spend millions tackling both issues.\n\n\"The time for talk is over. We've got to do something about it,\" said Governor Terry McAuliffe.\n\nOn Tuesday, WAVY's sister station WRIC spoke with mental health experts, who said state funding has been lacking for years.\n\n\"For some reason, mental health ranks in the very bottom tier when it comes to funding,\" said Kathy Harkey with the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\nGovernor McAuliffe says he plans to change that, unveiling a number of legislative and budgetary proposals. His office sending the following proposals in a release.\n\nAuthorize certain entities and individuals to lawfully possess clean syringes as part of a comprehensive harm reduction strategy\n\nLimit opioid prescriptions written in emergency departments to 3 days\n\nCreate a state registry for certified peer recovery specialists and qualified mental health professionals\n\nAllow community organizations to distribute Naloxone as part of trainings\n\nAllow Child Protective Services to respond to all reports of substance exposed infants\n\nExpand eligibility for participation in Drug Treatment Courts to include those convicted of violent crimes\n\nMandate e-prescribing for all opioids\n\nClarify that the Board of Corrections has the authority to investigate when someone dies in jail, and specify the expertise needed on the BOC to accomplish this.\n\nBelow is an explanation of Governor McAuliffe's Mental Health and Opioids Budget Package:\n\nThis budget takes the first step in moving towards a comprehensive state system of standard community treatment options by funding the implementation of \"same day access\" to screening and assessment services at 25 of our 40 Community Services Boards, with the remaining CSBs to come on board in the next biennium.\n\n$8.2 million (GF) is provided through the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services and the Department of Medical Assistance Services for implementation by funding additional intake and evaluation staff at CSBs to ensure that every person who walks through the door is screened the same day.\n\nTo address the increasing census at state mental health hospitals that are at or near capacity, we have included $7.4 million in funds for discharge planning, private bed purchase, and other community supports that will aid in discharging and diverting individuals into community settings.\n\n$2.5 million for discharge assistance planning\n\n$1.0 million for community detox and sobriety services\n\n$3.0 million for child/adult/geriatric private bed purchase\n\n$880,000 for a multi-disciplinary team in the community to work with nursing homes\n\nTo assure the safety of staff and those being served at our facilities, we have included $2.1 to hire an additional 24 full-time security and direct care employees and purchase necessary pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn November, in response to a growing number of fatal overdoses in our commonwealth, the state health commissioner declared the opioid addiction crisis to be a Public Health Emergency. To address this crisis, this budget includes a total of $5.3 million (GF) to increase access to opioid addiction treatment and aid in preventing fatal overdoses:\n\n$5.0 million is appropriated to provide medication-assisted treatment and supports to over 700 people struggling with opioid addictions;\n\n$200,000 is provided to purchase over 9,000 overdose reversal kits and 6,600 doses of naloxone that can be used in cases of accidental overdose to block the life-threatening effects;\n\n$78,000 is provided to fund a position in the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental services to oversee the opioid addiction treatment programs funded in this budget.\n\nWe also commit to strengthening our system of behavioral health services. To begin this transformation, we have included $4.5 million (GF) for a statewide assessment, gap analysis and high-level design of the service delivery system that will incorporate the voices of the CSBs, the correctional system, and those in the General Assembly who have been working on the future state of our community-based system.\n\nThis evaluation will also look at the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services as a whole, and identify resource gaps and areas where structural changes may result in improved outcomes for those served by our state facilities and CSBs.\n\n$4.2 million is appropriated to the Department of Criminal Justice Services for funding and positions to support mental health screening and assessment in local and regional jails to build on previously funded efforts to address the population of individuals with mental illness in jails.\n\n$4.0 million for grants for which criteria would be developed in collaboration with the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services.\n\nTwo positions and $200,000 in correlating administrative funds for administering the grant program.\n\nThis is all part of a budget the governor will introduce in its entirety on Friday.\n\n\"These issues, folks, did not begin overnight, nor will they be solved overnight but it's time to get started,\" McAuliffe said.",
  "latent_19660": "MPs approve measure by 346 votes to 115 as country confirms partial withdrawal from European convention on human rights after failed coup\n\nTurkey’s parliament has approved a bill declaring a state of emergency in the wake of last weekend’s coup attempt and informed the Council of Europe of a partial withdrawal from the European convention on human rights.\n\nTurkey will be required to provide regular updates to the secretary general of the Council of Europe on the measures taken under the state of emergency, according to the terms of the treaty.\n\nTurkey initially said it had informed the Council of Europe that it would suspend the convention entirely, a more wide-ranging measure likely to have drawn criticism from allies.\n\n'We see him as one of us': why many Turks still back authoritarian Erdoğan Read more\n\n“Turkey will derogate the European convention on human rights insofar as it does not conflict with its international obligations,” the deputy prime minister, Numan Kurtulmuş, was quoted as saying by the state-run Anadolu news agency, in a corrected statement.\n\nThe three-month state of emergency, approved by parliament on Thursday by 346 votes to 115, will allow the government to rule by decree, passing bills that have the force of law unless they are overturned by parliament, where the majority of MPs belong to the ruling Justice and Development party.\n\nTurkish officials insisted the lives and freedoms of citizens would not be affected, and that western powers such as France had recently taken similar measures. But concerns have mounted among both opponents and allies that the move will further consolidate President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s power.\n\nKurtulmuş said Turkey would take the step “just like France has done” under article 15 of the convention, which allows signatory states to derogate certain rights, including freedom of movement, expression and association, during times of war or a major public emergency.\n\nThe article stipulates that measures must be strictly proportionate and not discriminate against people based on ethnicity, religion or social group.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Turkish MPs attend a general assembly to discuss the state of emergency bill in parliament in Ankara. They approved the bill by 346 votes to 115. Photograph: EPA\n\nMehmet Şimşek, another deputy prime minister, defended the state of emergency at a roundtable for foreign journalists, insisting the government would only to use it to go after coup plotters and to “cleanse” the bureaucracy, judiciary and military of accomplices.\n\n“We are not making up these stories, this is not the Jason Bourne trilogy, this is real,” he said. “We cannot sit and pretend nothing happened. We have to act and will stay within the rule of law.”\n\nStill, he said that the provisions of the state of emergency law, which date from the 1980s, were outdated and draconian and would not be fully implemented.\n\n“We need a fast-track mandate to deal with these remnants [of the coup attempt],” he said, adding that the government had to work first on eliminating the risk of future instability and then focus on due process.\n\nThe government is currently drafting a legal framework that will determine how it goes after alleged perpetrators, including possibly extending detention times as it sifts through those caught up in a crackdown of monumental scale.\n\nA purge of state institutions has seen thousands of people detained, suspended or fired from their jobs over alleged links to the Hizmet movement of Fethullah Gülen, a US-based exiled cleric accused by Erdoğan of masterminding the coup attempt.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Turkish police officers attend the funeral ceremony in Ankara of a special forces officer killed during the failed coup. Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMore than 9,000 people have been detained or arrested in connection with the coup, including 2,000 judges and prosecutors and nearly 7,000 soldiers. Thousands of teachers and academic staff have been suspended, although Turkey has over 3 million civil servants and more than 4 million public sector employees.\n\nThe Council of Europe, which is based in Strasbourg and oversees the European convention on human rights, confirmed that Turkey had formally notified the organisation’s secretary general that it was declaring a state of emergency under article 15 of the treaty.\n\nIn doing so Turkey is using existing provisions within the convention as France has recently done in response to the wave of terrorism it has faced. That formal move is therefore unlikely of itself to provoke a storm of international protest.\n\nHuman rights groups, however, will be watching closely how Erdoğan interprets the legal freedoms he believes he has gained. Turkey, along with Russia, is one of the countries most frequently found by the European court of human rights to have violated the convention.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said on Thursday that rights lawyer Orhan Kemal Cengiz was detained in Istanbul.\n\nThe emergency provisions under article 15 cannot, however, be used retrospectively to justify any action before the declaration was made. Nor do the emergency provisions allow for the right to a fair trial to be suspended or the prohibition on torture to be lifted.\n\nA spokesman for the Council of Europe told the Guardian: “What’s important is that Turkey has to keep the secretary general of the council informed of developments during the state of emergency. Strictly speaking, they have to inform us what parts of the convention will be affected.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Turkish police secure the area in front of Grand Bazaar in Istanbul in the wake of the failed coup attempt. Photograph: Deniz Toprak/EPA\n\nCan Dündar, the editor of the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet, said the emergency state meant Turkey now had “an oppressive regime where the law and liberties will be suspended, press will be censored, and the parliament eliminated”.\n\nGermany’s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, urged the Turkish government to maintain both the rule of law and a sense of proportion in its response to the coup attempt.\n\n“Only provable involvement in illegal acts, not suspected political leanings, should trigger governmental action,” Steinmeier said. “It’s also critical that the declaration of emergency be the truly necessary length of time, and to end the measure as quickly as possible.”\n\nTanks and fighter jets commandeered by elite military troops rolled out into the streets of Ankara and Istanbul during the attempted putsch. More than 200 people were killed and thousands were wounded in the violence and Erdoğan narrowly escaped being detained at the holiday resort of Marmaris.\n\nThe government said it had arrested another soldier involved in the Marmaris raid, which occurred 20 minutes after Erdoğan had left the residence.\n\nThe Turkish leader has been accused of increasing authoritarianism in recent years, appointing loyalists to the bureaucracy, closing or prosecuting opposition media outlets and failing to crack down on corruption.",

  "latent_19723": "I think I was 22 or 23 when I heard Chieko Okazaki* speak. My dad had bought tickets to Time Out for Women for my mom and me, and we attended in St. George, Utah. We heard from a number of speakers and musical presenters over the two-day event, and Chieko was among them. I’m sure my notes from her talk are buried in some notebook or another, but off the top of my head, the thing I remember from her talk is a contemplation on competing virtues. She gave an example of how the virtue of “moderation in all things” would tell her not to take a second slice of chocolate cake, while the virtue of “don’t be wasteful” would tell her to gobble it right up. She talked about how often in our lives, we have to choose between virtues, and in her humble opinion, the ruling virtues in every situation are love and agency. She applied this to parenting in particular, as I remember, and said that as we do our best to raise children, our priorities should always be to express love and to honor agency.\n\nThat’s the only time I was ever in the presence of Chieko Okazaki, and I was in a large ballroom with 1,000+ other people, but she still made an impression on me. I’ve gotten to know Chieko better through her books and talks over the last few years. To me, she is an educator, a prophetess, and a true friend. Her words are inspired and bold. Her approach is refreshing. And along with some other permabloggers at fMh, I want to introduce Chieko to you in a special way over this coming year.\n\nChieko Nishimura Okazaki was born in Hawaii in 1926. The child of Hawaiian-born parents of Japanese descent, she was raised in the Buddhist tradition and joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints at the age of 15. She eventually relocated with her husband, Ed Okazaki, to the Intermountain West, where she became the mother of two sons as well as an elementary school teacher and principal. In 1961, she was called to serve on the YWMIA (Young Women) General Board (making her the first person of color — of any gender — to serve at that general level), and in 1990, she became the 1st Counselor in the Relief Society General Presidency, serving under President Elaine Jack. That presidency was active for seven years, and following her release, Chieko continued to write and speak to audiences of Mormon women until her death in 2011.\n\nOn every Sunday in 2015, fMh will publish a short excerpt from the writings or speeches of Chieko Okazaki. This idea is modeled somewhat on The Teachings of The Presidents of The Church series that is used in Relief Society, Elders’ Quorum, and High Priest meetings in the church. The idea is to share the perspectives of these leaders on a number of relevant gospel topics (repentance, tithing, family relationships, etc.), allowing class members to ponder these topics while also becoming more familiar with former church leaders. The Teachings of Chieko Okazaki series might not be as organized or cohesive as the church publications (we don’t have an entire curriculum committee, after all!), but we hope that they will provide at least occasional insight, encouragement, and spiritual promptings to our readers. Chieko was truly a magnificent person, and I’m excited at the prospect of demonstrating her goodness and wisdom to you in the coming months.\n\n*for those who are curious to know, the name is pronounced chee-AY-koh oh-kuh-ZAH-kee\n\nSara Katherine Staheli Hanks I'm a writer, reader, picnic-taker, mom, and aspiring world traveler.

  "latent_19825": "After three fans were shot or beaten over the weekend, the NFL has vowed to crack down on violence.\n\nThe mayors of San Francisco and Oakland have called for the end to such behavior.\n\nThey might as well call for the return of $1-a-gallon gas. There is only one simple, inarguable way to cut down on rowdiness.\n\nBan alcohol.\n\nIf you think the NFL is going there, you’ve obviously been drinking.\n\nThe league has no real interest in going to an AA meeting and saying, “My name is the NFL and I’m an addict.” History proves it is more interested in making cosmetic changes that really change nothing.\n\nThe denial continued after Saturday night’s Raiders-49ers game. Two men were shot and another was beaten unconscious in a bathroom.\n\n“We are working to assist the San Francisco Police Department in any way possible to understand how and why this happened,” 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh said.\n\nInvestigators haven’t yet said alcohol played a role, but would you bet against it? Even if the suspects are all devout Mormons, there is no question alcohol is the leading generator of fan rowdiness at all sports events.\n\nIt’s pointless to demand an end to alcohol sales at games. For one thing, the majority of fans can handle their booze. For another, the NFL recently signed a $1.2 billion sponsorship deal with Anheuser-Busch.\n\nThe NFL will give up booze when they pry Roger Goodell’s cold, dead fingers off a 20-ounce Budweiser sold for $8.50 at the nearest concession stand.\n\nBut is it too much to ask the league to sober up a little?\n\n“These games are family events,” read the mayoral proclamation, “and the types of images we witnessed last night have no place in our arenas.”\n\nFamily events? Sure, if your family is the local Hell’s Angels chapter.\n\nYou don’t need gunshot wounds to know NFL games long ago stopped being family-friendly. The Patriots disappeared from Monday Night Football in the 1970s after Foxborough, Mass., tired of the insanity that came with night games.\n\nOne enchanted evening saw 60 arrests, 100 evictions and 35 people taken to the hospital. A cop was assaulted and had his gun stolen.\n\nOne fan urinated on a paramedic working on a heart attack victim. A drunken driver killed a man outside the stadium.\n\nIt was Schaefer Stadium, of course. As in Schaefer beer.\n\nRemember the 1995 game at Giants Stadium when 175 people were ejected in the world’s largest snowball fight?\n\nTen years later, the stadium banned alcohol for the Jets’ final game. That came after two people were stabbed the game earlier.\n\nIn 2007, there was a similar last-game ban. This one came after hundreds of men blocked the Gate D ramps and chanted for women to bare their breasts.\n\nThey threw plastic beer bottles at women who didn’t cooperate.\n\nNot every NFL game turns into a bachelor party, of course. But every game has too many booze-fueled incidents.\n\nThe league’s response has been a Fan Code of Conduct, which apparently the assailant in San Francisco forgot to sign. It also limits tailgating to 3-1/2 hours before games, cuts off alcohol sales after the third quarter and limits fans to two alcoholic drinks per purchase.\n\nIn other words, come back in five minutes and we’ll gladly sell you another 40 ounces of Bud for $17.\n\nProhibition didn’t work in the 1920s, and it wouldn’t fare much better now. But there are more substantive steps to enforce responsible drinking.\n\nIf nothing else, take some of that $1.2 billion in Anheuser-Busch money and hire a lot more real police to patrol the stands. Have fans get their hands stamped after their beer purchases.\n\nNo one thing will solve the problem. But anything is better than issuing proclamations of shock and disgust.\n\nWe’ve heard plenty of those over the years. Then we hear gunfire, and league officials wonder how and why these things happen.\n\nThey should spend a game in the stands, or hang out around Gate D. The answer would hit them like a plastic bottle of beer.",
  "latent_20000": "She was, until six days ago, the young woman who did not exist. Excised from school photographs, barred from class theatrical productions and left off the list of scholastic achievements displayed on her college noticeboard, Flora Keays has been forced, by law, to remain invisible. Until now, writes Olga Craig .\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Flora turned 18 and was, for the first time in her life, given a voice. Her first public words have made poignant reading.\n\nOf Cecil Parkinson , the father she has never met, she said sadly: \"I would like to see him. If he loved me, he would want to see me and be in my everyday life.\" Of her hopes for a relationship with him, her requests have been modest: \"I would like to go to the cinema with him and have some fun.\"\n\nYet it is only now that Flora, who was left with severe disabilities after an operation to remove a brain tumour 14 years ago and also has Asperger's syndrome - a form of autism - has been able to express her wishes.\n\nThe illegitimate daughter of Lord Parkinson, the former Tory party chairman once feted as a future Prime Minister and forced to resign as Trade Secretary when Sara Keays, his secretary and mistress, announced her pregnancy, Flora has been the subject of a court order which has silenced her.\n\nBut now, with its expiry, she is free to talk of her life. So, too, is her mother.\n\nSara Keays's story - her clandestine, 12-year-affair with a government minister; her refusal to fade into the background after making her pregnancy public; her struggle to support her disabled daughter and her dogged battle to win financial support from her former lover - has been the subject of speculation and intrigue for the past 18 years.\n\nThe court orders have meant that little has been known of the mother and daughter, save that Flora's birth was one of the biggest Westminster scandals of its generation - throwing the married father of three into disgrace and threatening to bring down Thatcher's government.\n\nBut as Sara contemplates yet another court battle with Parkinson to help pay for the care Flora still needs, she has allowed the world to glimpse what has, until now, been their very private world.\n\nWhen Flora celebrated her coming of age, she did so with just a trace of hope. As she opened her birthday cards, she knew that there was little chance that, this year, for the first time, her father would acknowledge her birthday.\n\nEven so, she hoped. There was no card and no present.\n\nPhoto: GETTY\n\nShe said in an interview with the Daily Mail: \"Mummy told me not to expect a card but I do feel a bit sad about it. I would like to see him and talk to him.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think my father has behaved very badly towards me. I feel jealous that my mother has known him but I haven't, and jealous of other people who go on holiday with their fathers, when I don't.\"\n\nHer mother had no such expectation that Parkinson would contact their daughter. Eighteen years ago, he told her he would never see their child. \"It has been,\" said Sara, \"the one promise to me that he has kept, I am afraid.\"\n\nParkinson himself has never denied that Flora was his daughter - nor that he did promise Sara, during their relationship, that he would leave Ann, his wife, and marry her.\n\nBut, in 1983, when Sara told him of her pregnancy, she could not have known how far-reaching the effects of his intransigence would be.\n\nWhen the news of Sara's pregnancy broke, Parkinson - then 52 - was at the peak of his political career. He had been credited with masterminding Margaret Thatcher's landslide election victory that June and, within hours of the Tory triumph, Parkinson received his reward: the railwayman's son and self-made multi-millionaire was appointed Trade and Industry Secretary.\n\nParkinson had told the Prime Minister of the relationship and of Sara's pregnancy on election day and, in his autobiography - in which he describes events as \"the Keays affair\" - he writes: \"I told her that I had a serious personal problem and that I was not sure I should be in her Cabinet at all. I explained what the problem was. She was immensely sympathetic, not at all censorious . . .\"\n\nHe added that Baroness Thatcher had warned him that were he not included in the Cabinet \"every investigative journalist in the land would be given the task of finding out why\".\n\nParkinson accepted the post but his elation was short-lived. Just four months later, at the Tories' Blackpool conference, it was revealed that Sara was carrying his child. His resignation was now inevitable.\n\nPhoto: PA\n\nIn his memoirs, Lord McAlpine, the former Tory party treasurer, recalls how, at the conference, he witnessed \"the most extraordinary human drama\" as Parkinson and his wife discussed the matter on the eve of his resignation.\n\nHe wrote: \"Cecil and Ann prepared for bed, both insisting that we stay. As they busied themselves, changing into their nightclothes, they kept up a dialogue - he expressing his love for her and fear that she might leave. 'I love you. I could never manage without you,' he kept repeating.\"\n\nAfter his resignation (Parkinson, in his autobiography, says he received 16,000 letters of support and only 50 expressing hostility) faded briefly from the spotlight, but it was after Flora's birth that the real battles with Sara began.\n\nParkinson, Sara insists, had tried to persuade her to abort her baby, but she refused. Shortly after her birth, Flora developed serious health problems and Parkinson applied for and won a court injunction that was almost unprecedented in British law.\n\nIt forbade anyone, including Sara, from speaking of Flora publicly or doing almost anything that could lead to her identity being revealed. It prevented even Flora talking of her life.\n\nSo far-reaching were its powers that Flora's schools have had to go to extreme lengths to conceal her identity - thus she has never been photographed alongside her classmates or been allowed to take part in any school activity.\n\nIt has meant, too, that her health problems have never been fully revealed. Though a lively, outgoing young woman, her surgery has left her with serious social and learning difficulties. The price that Flora has paid has been high.\n\nShe said: \"I feel I have been ignored until now and I hate that. It has not been fair.\"\n\nSara herself has battled, in vain, to have the court order lifted - even though she has guarded Flora's privacy fiercely - even appealing to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nShe believes that it has been kept in place to protect Parkinson rather than her daughter, describing it as an \"abomination\" and \"the sort of thing you could imagine happening only in Stalinist Russia\".\n\nShe has battled, too, to win adequate maintenance. When, after yet another court application for more money, Parkinson suggested that Flora should be institutionalised, her anger boiled over.\n\nParkinson, the man she once regarded as \"the only man I have ever loved\" used the injunction to shield his reputation, she believes.\n\nShe said: \"It created the belief that there was some dreadful secret about Flora, which stoked up artificial interest in her. I feel she was singled out for treatment which had never been meted out to another child.\"\n\nShe added: \"A disabled child already feels isolated and rejected, and she was made to feel that far more acutely by the injunction. The only one to benefit is Cecil Parkinson. The injunction has stopped me getting Flora the help she needed because everyone assumed the worst about her - and about me - and I could do nothing to change those perceptions.\"\n\nShe went on to say: \"It has created the impression that I wanted to expose her to publicity, when in reality I have spent every moment guarding her interests. I kept her illness secret for more than a year, despite the fact I had to take her to hospital innumerable times. I even had her medical records kept under an assumed name for the first five years of her life.\"\n\nSara is angry, too, that her daughter cannot understand why her father has shown no interest in meeting her or introducing her to his other children.\n\nShe said: \"I decided to tell her that lots of children never saw their fathers - but that did not mean their fathers did not love them. I did not want her to feel deprived.\"\n\nThat Flora so closely resembles her father has brought no comfort. She is 5ft 10in tall and has his high cheekbones and a firm chin softened by a dimple. She has even inherited many of his mannerisms.\n\nClearly ill at ease about discussing her lengthy relationship with Parkinson, Sara said: \"I get so agitated talking about everything that happened. I cope by putting a large stone on the past and living in the present.\"\n\nShe admits, however, that her affair was a serious error of judgment, saying: \"Love is blind and I think he was in love with me. But I am not the first woman who has made a misjudgment about a man. We must take responsibility for our own actions and misjudgments, and falling in love with someone is one's own responsibility.\"\n\nSara, while distressed that her former lover has never contacted their daughter, has strong reservations about such a meeting. \"If he only saw her once, I know it would cause her terrible distress and just show her what she had missed. I would feel very nervous about anything that would cause her more grief than she already suffers.\"\n\nShe added: \"He would have to become involved properly in her life. It is very natural and entirely right for her to want to see her father, but lots of children don't and survive.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on January 6th 2002.\n\n• Cecil Parkinson obituary",

Never before have they captured a victory on Cleveland's home court. Heck, up until a few days ago, they had gone 46 years without winning a Finals game, period.\n\nYet, here they are, 2-1 over the Golden State Warriors entering Thursday's all-important Game 4. Going up 3-1 could prove to be a crushing blow to the Warriors. Even a 2-2 split would be an accomplishment given the current personnel.\n\nFor a tortured fanbase haunted by so many past failures, this is a remarkably resilient group.\n\n\"We root for our teams no matter what. Obviously, there hasn't been a lot to cheer about in the past few years, but people still show up to games,\" explained Josh, a local Boys & Girls Club sports director. \"It would be great to finally have the vindication and to get rid of the 'Cleveland never wins' mantra. To not be the butt of every joke about losing.\"\n\nNow, hope is everywhere in Cleveland, formerly a burial ground for positivity.\n\nEven for the team's watch parties, with the Cavaliers playing 2,500 miles away, thousands of fans line up early to file into Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nBleacher Report/Greg Swartz\n\n\"This is the fifth watch party I've been to,\" said Kenny from Akron, the first person in line prior to Game 2. \"The energy in the arena is unbelievable. It's sweet to be around other fans.\"\n\nWhen pointing out that it was still nearly an hour-and-a-half before tipoff, he said, \"I've already been here about two hours. I came on Thursday an hour before and the line was already so long, so we came early this time.\"\n\nSo lies the spirit of Cleveland.\n\n\"Cleveland has been through the ringer,\" explained WEWS chief meteorologist Mark Johnson (who's recently become an Internet sensation). \"The businesses move away and things change so we latch on to our sports teams for hope, for escape and for fun. We get very passionate and get very connected to them.\n\n\"It's psychological. Long-suffering Cleveland sports fans think that the universe is out to get us. We're all waiting for the next ball to drop. The next bad thing to happen to our Cleveland sports teams. A championship would officially break that cycle. It would be a cure to what ails us. We're all Cleveland championship virgins.\"\n\nA title would certainly make all the difference to the mindset of fans that have been through nearly every heartbreak imaginable. Still, Cleveland fans are considered some of the most loyal in all three major sports.\n\nDavid Dow/Getty Images\n\n\"It's their passion. Their passion for sports, their passion for their players that represent their teams. It's one of the most passionate sports towns in the country,\" said Kenny Roda, a 29-year veteran of Cleveland media and current sports talk host on WHBC Canton.\n\n\"I know a lot of other cities are going to say that. It's the most passionate sports town that hasn't won jack squat. They've suffered more than any other city in America and that's why, when they finally do win a championship—and hopefully it's this year with the Cavaliers—they'll appreciate more than any other city that's won a championship because of the drought.\"\n\nThat well-documented drought has reached 51 years. The Cavaliers have gone 44-plus seasons without a title. The Cleveland Browns, the city's last champion in 1964, have never won or even been to a Super Bowl (they won the NFL Championship). The Cleveland Indians did capture a couple of World Series crowns, but none have occurred since 1948.\n\nFans are aware of the history. So are former coaches and players.\n\nThat doesn't mean they didn't enjoy their time here.\n\n\"That was probably the best seven years of my life,\" Craig Ehlo, Cavaliers shooting guard from 1986-93, said.\n\n\"It's such a hard-working town. It's not really a white-collar town, mostly hard hats and lunch pails. The fans are rugged, passionate, not afraid to talk to you and are so supportive because sports are their outlet. They love sports. It gives them a sense of pride. They're just hard workers that love supporting their teams, win, lose or draw. If it turned into a bar fight, they would be there to support you. They had my back.\"\n\nEhlo, of course, was front and center for one of the city's greatest collapses. The primary defender on Michael Jordan in Game 5 of the 1989 Eastern Conference opening round, what's now known as \"The Shot\" knocked the heavily favored Cavs from the playoffs.\n\nIn a strange and mysterious way, however, Ehlo refers to that as his best recollection as a Cavalier due to the connection it created with the fans.\n\nRocky Widner/Getty Images\n\n\"When Michael got the ball and made the shot, it just took our hearts and ripped them out. It was dead quiet. You might say that's a bad memory, but it's actually the best memory I had, because the fans felt the pain of the loss just like I did. I felt great because if I went out, no one said, 'Gosh darn it, why didn't you do this or do that?' It was just, 'Hey, you guys are paying your dues, you're going to make it next year.' With the fans being so supportive, that was my best memory.\"\n\nEhlo, who now lives in Spokane, Washington, regularly attends the Cavaliers' summer charity golf outings and admits that his heart \"is definitely in Cleveland.\"\n\nWhy is such a player, primarily known nationwide for being part of the black eye of Cleveland sports history, loved instead of loathed?\n\n\"It's the nature of the city. They understand their support is so important to the success of their teams,\" said Mike Fratello, Cavaliers coach from 1993-99 and current TNT NBA analyst. \"They've suffered pain and suffering from generation to generation. Cleveland fans are special. They've gone through a lot of tough times. They're proud of their teams and show it full-heart.\n\n\"Players talk about taking their game to another level (in the playoffs. It's the same with the fans. There's a craze that takes over the city. That's what everyone talks about at work, at lunch. It's all about the playoffs and the opportunity to win.\"\n\nRocky Widner/Getty Images\n\nAlthough winning doesn't happen all too often on the shores of Lake Erie, when it does, fans recognize and reward it.\n\n\"If you've ever played in Cleveland and had some success, they treat you in such a way that, you know, it's just a special place,\" said Mark Price, Cavs point guard from 1986-95. \"Playing there nine years myself and playing on some good teams, I developed a relationship with the city of Cleveland. I just really enjoyed playing for their franchise and being a part of that environment.\"\n\nGregory Shamus/Getty Images\n\nThat environment has gone from one of misery and defeat in recent years to hope and optimism ever since LeBron James announced his return home last summer.\n\nNow just a pair of wins away from the first championship in over half a century, Cleveland has been infused with new life, even if the fans never gave up hope.\n\n\"It would mean, as LeBron said, everything. It would mean absolutely everything,\" Roda said. \"All the pain, the list—what other city lists their failures? The Shot, The Drive, the Fumble, the '95 and '97 World Series. The list goes on and on.\n\n\"If LeBron and the Cavs were able to end that drought, Clevelanders would be able to stick out their chest with Cleveland across the front of it proudly and pound their chest and feel like other cities have felt, as a true champion. Not that they're not proud of their city, because they are, but it would mean that much more to them and the waiting would be over. The celebration, I can't even imagine it. It would be sports-talk nirvana for me as a talk show host. The city would go absolutely crazy, and we're all hopeful that they can get it done in the next week to 10 days.\"\n\nMany former Cavs are very much interested in what's about to possibly transpire in Cleveland.\n\n\"I'm definitely rooting for Cleveland. As a former player with my jersey hanging in the rafters, I'll always consider myself a Cavalier,\" said Price, now the head basketball coach at UNC Charlotte.\n\n\"I think it's something that obviously as sports fans in the city of Cleveland, it's kind of the monkey that's been on the back for quite a while now. Now with the opportunity to get that off and to win a championship would obviously bring a lot of joy and happiness to the city of Cleveland.\"\n\nThere are so many storylines surrounding James and the Cavs. A title would simply be the final chapter to what's been a historic year.\n\nDavid Dow/Getty Images\n\n\"I think it would be one of the greatest sports stories in history,\" Johnson said. \"It's a made-for-TV movie. The hometown hero comes back. The guys around him go down with injury. All these unknowns step up to support LeBron.\"\n\nJames, Northeast Ohio's native son and best chance for a title, knows the history of the franchise. He knows what a title would mean for Cleveland and all who wore a Cavaliers jersey before him.\n\n\"The first time I met LeBron at one of his camps, before I could even say anything to him, he spit out, 'I can't believe y'all never got to the championship. I watched every game!'\" Ehlo said.\n\n\"He named all of us. (Brad) Daugherty, Price, (Larry) Nance, (John) Hot Rod (Williams), (Ron) Harper. It just shocked me. He felt like he was part of our team. I just feel like if he actually wins a championship this year, he wants to include everybody that ever wore a Cleveland Cavaliers uniform.\n\n\"That banner hanging in the rafter would be for everyone in the organization, regardless of who owned them or who coached them.\"\n\nGreg Swartz has covered the Cleveland Cavaliers and NBA for Bleacher Report since 2010.

  "latent_20269": "Christy Clark keeps saying that nobody wants another election in British Columbia.\n\nBut when her Liberal government is defeated on a non-confidence vote on Thursday, there will be only two options available to Lieutenant-Governor Judith Guichon.\n\nGuichon can ask NDP Leader John Horgan to form a new government, supported by the third-place Green party.\n\nOr she can call another election.\n\nIn an astonishing news conference on Wednesday, Clark made it clear which option she favours.\n\n“It’s hard to suggest that this place is working now and it’s hard to suggest that it would be working in the future,” Clark said outside the legislature. “It’s hard to see that path.”\n\nClark said she intends to immediately meet with Guichon when the government is defeated. She said if the lieutenant-governor asks for her opinion, Clark will give it.\n\n“I’m not going to lie to the lieutenant-governor,” Clark said. “I’m going to tell her what I really think.\n\n“It is not a functional place. The Greens and the NDP are just not interested in collaborating. It hasn’t been working, and I’m going to have to tell her that.”\n\nThe NDP-Green coalition has 44 seats in the legislature. Clark’s Liberals have 43. That’s a one-seat majority for the NDP-Greens in the 87-seat house.\n\nBut Clark said that majority does not appear big enough to produce a stable NDP-Green government.\n\n“I haven’t seen any evidence that they have the numbers that they need to actually govern,” Clark said.\n\n“This isn’t a working legislature. And I haven’t seen any evidence that it could work. That’s the advice that I have to give her. It has to be an honest conversation.”\n\nSo Clark is going to advise Guichon to call another election, right? Wrong. Clark said she won’t tell the L-G what to do, even though any premier has the constitutional right to request an election from the L-G.\n\n“I’m going to let her make that call,” Clark said. “It’s not my intention to advise her whether or not to call an election. That’s her decision.”\n\nBut it’s difficult to interpret Clark’s comments as anything other than a demand for another election. So why doesn’t she just ask Guichon to call one?\n\nBecause even though Clark clearly wants a new election, she doesn’t want to take the blame for one being called, that’s why.\n\nThe Liberals are afraid voters will punish them for forcing a snap summer election that polls suggest most people don’t want.\n\nInstead, Clark wants to blame the NDP and the Greens for the election.\n\nLast week, the Liberals introduced a topsy-turvy throne speech that copy-catted a long list of NDP campaign promises that will cost an additional $2.6 billion to deliver.\n\nMike de Jong, the Liberal finance minister, said Wednesday the government has found enough money to pay for it all because the B.C. economy is so strong.\n\nBut Clark said the NDP and the Greens are set to vote down the throne speech anyway, and “possibly” trigger an election call by Guichon.\n\nIf Guichon does call a new election, you can bet Clark will then tell voters the NDP and the Greens caused it, not her.\n\nWhy does Clark think an NDP-Green government would not work? She said an NDP MLA will have to serve as the Speaker, and the Speaker does not vote — except to break a tie.\n\nThat would reduce the party standings in the legislature to a 43-43 deadlock, with the “non-partisan” Speaker forced to vote over and over again to break tie after tie.\n\nSteve Thomson, the current Liberal-appointed Speaker, issued a four-page letter on Wednesday arguing such a situation would break the rules and conventions of the legislature.\n\nClark seized on it, saying it should worry Guichon.\n\n“As the representative of the sovereign, her job is to make sure the legislature is stable, make sure that this place can work and make sure the democratic processes that have been in place for 600 years in the British parliamentary system are respected,” Clark said.\n\nOf course, the NDP and Greens scoffed at all this, saying it’s just a last-ditch effort by Clark to cling to power.\n\nHorgan said he’s ready to become premier, and insisted the NDP-Green coalition would work.\n\n“There is a majority of support on one side of the house,” Horgan said. “We should be given an opportunity to govern.”\n\nHorgan was asked what he thinks Guichon will do.\n\n“I’m hopeful that she’ll do the right thing,” he said.\n\nHe thinks that “right thing” is for him to become premier, especially if Clark is not asking the L-G for another election.\n\nBut Clark’s comments have now placed enormous pressure on Guichon to call that election, even though Clark is not coming right out and asking for it.\n\nIt will all come down to Guichon, a cattle rancher who must wade through a lot of bull and decide what’s best for B.C.\n\ntwitter.com/MikeSmythNews\n\nmsmyth@postmedia.com\n\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\n\nIs there more to this story?

  "latent_20428": "Save\n\nHello friends! This is a sponsored post in partnership with McCormick. Today we are teaming up to bring you this recipe for a delicious dip made with roasted eggplant, perfect as a summer side dish or for snacking.\n\nIf you’re like me, you have a hard to resisting all the colorful seasonal fruits and vegetables that are just begging to come home with you! With so much fresh produce at our fingertips this time of year, it’s always fun to try different and creative ways to cook with them. This recipe for Roasted Eggplant Dip (or Baba Ganoush) purees roasted eggplant, tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, and spices. If you’ve never tried it before, it reminds me of hummus but with smokey eggplant rather than chickpeas. It’s perfect for summertime snacking!\n\nWhile Baba Ganoush may be something you love to order at your favorite Middle Eastern restaurant, it’s really simple to make at home. The first step is to broil the eggplant in the oven to char the skin and soften the flesh. They won’t look too pretty, but I promise you don’t want to judge them by their rustic exterior. The flesh is removed from the skin and set in a colander to drain off some of the excess liquid.\n\nYou can make this pureed dip in the food processor or blender. This trio of spices from McCormick gives the dip just the right balance of flavors. It’s creamy and smokey, with a little bit of nuttiness from the tahini. You can find tahini, a paste made from ground sesame seeds, in the international or ethnic section of your grocery store. The lemon juice and parsley add a pop of freshness.\n\nOne dip definitely leads to the next, and you might find yourself wishing you’d made a double batch!\n\nFor more delicious recipes created using the pureeing technique, like Kale, Bacon & Pistachio Pasta, check out McCormick’s website.\n\nRoasted Eggplant Dip (Baba Ganoush) Author: Julie\n\nPrep Time: Prep Time: 20 mins\n\nCook Time: Cook Time: 30 mins\n\nTotal Time: Total Time: 50 mins\n\nYield: Yield: 2 cups Print Pin Ingredients 2-3 small to medium eggplants (about 3 pounds)\n\n2 tablespoons tahini\n\n1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\n\n1 teaspoon McCormick Minced Garlic\n\n1/2 teaspoon McCormick Ground Cumin\n\n1/2 teaspoon McCormick Smoked Paprika\n\n3 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n\nSalt and McCormick Ground Black Pepper, to taste\n\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley\n\nMcCormick Toasted Sesame Seeds for garnish Instructions Preheat oven to broil. Prick eggplants all over with fork. Place on foil-lined shallow baking dish . Broil about 12 minutes or until skin is charred on all sides, turning occasionally. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Bake 15-20 minutes longer or until eggplant flesh is tender. Let stand long enough to handle. Cut eggplants in half lengthwise. Scoop flesh into colander, discarding charred skin and as many of the seeds as possible. Drain 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Place eggplant, tahini, lemon juice, minced garlic, cumin, and smoked paprika in food processor, and cover. Process until smooth. If needed, add 1-2 tablespoons of the olive oil for smooth texture.

  "latent_20590": "Minister for the Status of Women, Kellie Leitch, who launched Ottawa's anti-sex assault program. Photo via the Government of Canada\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE Canada\n\nAccording to a new national poll that should surprise no one and anger everyone, women are frequently the target of sexual assault and rarely feel comfortable reporting the attacks to police.\n\nThe Forum Research poll, released this week, confirms what women's groups have been saying for years—sexual assault is really common. The poll interviewed 1,658 Canadians and is considered accurate to within 3 percent, 19 times out of 20.\n\nOf the women who spoke with Forum, 17 percent said they had been sexually assaulted or raped in their lifetime, while 12 percent chose not to answer. The results stayed virtually the same across age groups, geographic region, and income level. The remaining 70 percent clearly said they had not been assaulted or raped.\n\nOf those who reported being attacked, 15 percent said it was at the hands of a family member, and a quarter said it was an acquaintance or a date.\n\nJust over one tenth of those who had been attacked reported it to police.\n\nThe poll shows that the problem also exists for men, but with much less frequency. Still, 5 percent of men said they were sexually assaulted or raped, while 11 percent preferred not to answer. One in ten said that the abuse came from a \"person in authority.\"\n\nJust seven percent of those men went to the police after the attack.\n\nIt's not surprising that these charges rarely come forward. According to government statistics, police lay charges in just 42 percent of sexual assault cases—eight points lower than the average for other violent crimes. That number goes up slightly if the assault involves a weapon, and improves to nearly 70 percent for aggravated sexual assault, the most serious of the possible charges.\n\nOne in five basic sexual assault cases are \"cleared otherwise,\" which includes cases where \"the complainant requests that charges not be laid against the accused, the accused has died, the accused has diplomatic immunity, the accused is referred to a diversionary program, police discretion, or for a reason beyond the control of the police.\"\n\nEven those sexual assault cases that do progress from being reported to laying charges only result in a guilty verdict about half the time.\n\nThe survey also asked about sexual harassment. One quarter of the women polled reported being sexually harassed, while 16 percent chose not to answer. Ten percent of men say they, too, have faced sexual harassment.\n\nThe poll caps off a year when sexual violence became a major topic of discussion in Canada. The conversation gained prominence due to the allegations against Jian Ghomeshi, the revelation that Parliament is a hotbed of harassment against women, and the campaigns to encourage women to share their stories, as they did on the Twitter hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported.\n\nThere have been calls for the federal government to do more to end violence against women. The NDP has called for a national action plan to address the issue, and for an inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women. Indigenous women make up a disproportionate number of victims of violent sexual assaults and murders.\n\nThe government, for its part, has launched a plan to try to reduce violent against First Nations women, but has rejected calls for a national inquiry, and has launched a campaign to fund local sexual assault centers.\n\nConservative MP Rob Anders, notorious for being the worst, suggested that rape be reintroduced as a federal crime (it was replaced with \"sexual assault\" and \"aggravated sexual assault\" in 1983). He introduced legislation to beef up penalties for sexual assault that involves penetration. Critics of Anders's bill point out that, prior to 1983, women's allegations were often undermined because it can be so difficult to prove penetration.\n\nAt least he's trying.\n\nBut if 2014 taught us anything, it's that the issues around sexual violence aren't going away. While the rate of sexual assaults has been declining since a huge spike in the 1990s, it's still more common than it was in the early 1980s.\n\nAnd given that Forum found that the prevalence of sexual assault amongst 18 to 30 year-old women was slightly higher than the average, there's still a long way to go.\n\nFollow Justin Ling on Twitter.",
  "latent_20622": "With this first mix, Ajam Media Collective is proud to inaugurate its music podcast series. As a regular writer for Ajam and a musician under the moniker Yavaran, I will now be hosting a monthly music podcast as part of a “digital residency” on Ajammc.com.\n\nCalling this podcast series a digital residency is important in many ways. Traditionally, the term “residency” is usually used to refer to a DJ who will spin consistently at the same venue for a set time period, be it a few weeks or a few months. On one hand, I believe the term pays respect to how the internet has been able to give artists who choose to draw on their non-Western influences such as myself a home online, no matter where our physical homes may be and what those home music scenes have to offer. Yet on another level, as many Ajam articles have previously dealt with questioning ideas of diaspora and breaking down ideas of center and periphery when it comes to Persian and Iranian culture, I hope to use this podcast to complicate similar notions of identity, albeit in a sonic form.\n\nFor a long time now, Iranian art has been able to find a place on the global stage and in front of global views, be it Iranian film, photography, or painting. However, as recently articulated in a blog post by an Iranian curator for the art group DADABASENYC, the way in which Iranian art is presented can often have a problematic effect on the artwork in question.\n\nThough the blog post focused on visual art, the worries that the author expressed in regards to how Iranian art is praised by outsiders can also apply to music. It often seems that Iranian artists are given the most support when their work deals with what outsiders often deem “Iranian” themes, such as the supposed dichotomy between Islam and modernity, or issues of gender roles in Iran. This then ignores any attempts by Iranian artists to even approach more universal questions, and discourages future gestures in that direction. Similarly, such representations of Iranian art often downplay and exclude Iranian artists in the diaspora. These artists are even further marginalized off by overemphasizing their “Iranian” nature, which often positions the artists’ work as contributions to local, rather than global art practice.\n\nWith these criticisms in mind, my goal for these podcasts was not only to showcase a wide variety of Iranian music, but to break through boundaries defining Iranian culture and the relevance of Iranian music by offering a new cosmopolitan vision that connects music from Iran to music from its diaspora, and allows it to participate in the conversation between genuinely global sounds.\n\nThis first podcast in our series is a look at Iranian contemporary music in a global context. The music in this mix not only crosses between the genres of hip-hop, rock, and electronic, but also crosses geographic borders. This mix features not only Iranian artists in Iran and in the diaspora, but also a number of non-Iranian acts with whom their music is in conversation. I felt that the only way to really produce a quality mix and not just an exercise in Iranian-cultural-showcase was to present these Iranian artists in the context that the artists themselves created their music in: a truly global aural milieu. While putting the mix together, I often recalled my discussions on music with Iranian musicians and listeners alike that consistently come from a international and diverse view of music as a whole, not just on what “Iranian” music Iranians were creating.\n\nMaintaining this global perspective was particularly important to me in the case of the Yellow Dogs song that we featured in this mix. Despite the untimely death of two of the band’s members, I felt it would not do them justice to honor them simply by including them in a mix of Iranian music, as that was not the only way the band perceived themselves.\n\nLike many other Iranian musicians, Yellow Dogs noted in interviews that although they were proud of their Iranian heritage, they were simply an indie band and wanted to be treated as such. Therefore, while a song by the genre-busting Turkish psychedelic folk artist Baba Zula leads into the Yellow Dogs hit single “Bruce,” the song fades into a song by renowned indie band The XX. This sonically places the Yellow Dogs beyond the pages of rock magazines’ “Middle Eastern” sections, into the global musical milieu to which they have always belonged, and as many of us know, to the level of renown that they truly deserved.\n\nAlso included in this mix are two songs by Bei-Ru, a Lebanese-Armenian-American producer and artist whose 2010 release “Little Armenia” was an unabashed celebration of his mixed descent as Armenian growing up in Los Angeles. The beauty of artists like Bei-Ru is that they take questions of identity, diaspora, and language, and resolve them sonically in a way that helps complex identities make sense.\n\nWhen Bei-Ru’s trademark hip-hop drum breaks come crashing over classic Armenian samples, you really do feel transported into the mind of an Armenian kid growing up in Los Angeles. Yet at the same time, like all the artists on this mix, the music is beautiful and is just as engaging of an experience without an understanding of Bei-Ru’s personal background.\n\nAnd in that spirit, and truly the spirit of DJing itself, I hoped to present a mix that is fundamentally enjoyable and innovative. Luckily, with such a talented selection of artists to choose from, the work of breaking down musical barriers between genres and nationalities came naturally.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1) Pari Zanganeh – Paeez (Yavaran Edit)\n\n2) Hichkas – Yeh Rooze Khoob (Yavaran Edit)\n\n3) M.I.A. – Only 1 U\n\n4) Hadi Pakzad – Underneath the Ocean\n\n5) Baba Zula – Komşu\n\n6) Yellow Dogs – Bruce\n\n7) The XX – Shelter (Tiga Remix)\n\n8) Bei Ru – Tu Yegar\n\n9) Yelle – L’Amour Parfait (Sticky K Remix)\n\n10) Bei Ru – Ourakhoutioun\n\n11) Abjeez – Too Aab\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr\n\nReddit",

She is unmistakably the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, but she is also very much her own person. She fascinates people because she both resembles and contrasts with the man who was the bête noire of French politics for decades.\n\nShe also has her father to thank for a powerful voice that booms even when she is speaking normally. It sounds deep and hoarse. It is the voice of a woman who has been smoking for years, but most of all it is the voice of a fighter. There is aggression in her voice, and even a hint of vulgarity. Marine Le Pen bills herself as someone who comes from the bottom and is determined to stick it to those whom she calls \"the caste\" -- France's political elite.\n\nHard-Hitting Words\n\nOn a sunny afternoon in Metz, a city in the Lorraine region of eastern France, Le Pen is speaking in a tiny, jam-packed conference room at the Hotel Technopole, a shabby concrete box of a building in an industrial area. The venue seems at odds with the larger-than-life image Le Pen has acquired through countless cover stories and television appearances. But despite the surroundings, her words are full of raw energy, and it quickly becomes clear that she is an extremely talented politician.\n\nUsing her notes instead of a prepared speech, she speaks in short, hard-hitting sentences. She talks about issues like the loss of buying power, and about people who have no more than 50 or 100 ($71.50 or $143) left over at the end of each month. She warns against refugees from Tunisia, and against immigrants in general. She demands social welfare systems for the French instead of for immigrants. And then she finally gets to her central issue: the fight against globalization, which Le Pen says is destroying France.\n\nShe wants to leave the euro, reintroduce customs borders and nationalize banks. Her vision is the antithesis of a Europe that hardly anyone, even in France, believes in anymore. \"What are the others, the conservatives and the socialists, proposing? Nothing! They are busy fighting the National Front!\" She rants and she is audacious, unlike the well-trained spin doctors normally seen on television, and she appeals to many people.\n\n\"Elections are sexual affairs,\" the author Christine Angot wrote recently in the daily newspaper Libération. \"Marine Le Pen appeals to 20 percent of us and fascinates 80 percent. A mannish woman, phallic, we like that. A woman who dominates her father and gets better results.\"\n\nIn Second Place\n\nSince January, Le Pen has been the chairwoman of the right-wing populist National Front (FN) party, a position in which she succeeded her father. France is obsessed with her. With the next presidential elections less than a year away, some polls place her in second place, ahead of unpopular President Nicolas Sarkozy and just behind Martine Aubry, the socialist politician who announced her candidacy last week. This could put her in the run-off election -- which would be a triumph for Le Pen.\n\nWhen her father managed the same feat nine years ago, on April 21, 2002, many French perceived it as a national catastrophe. In the first round of voting, Le Pen was ahead of Socialist Lionel Jospin. By the next day, protesters were shouting \"Never again!\" and French citizens formed alliances against the radical right wing. In the run-off election, 82 percent voted for Jacques Chirac and only 18 percent for Le Pen. The villain had been driven out once more.\n\nWhen Jean-Marie Le Pen founded the National Front in the 1970s, he also invented European right-wing populism. With his slicked-back hair, horn-rimmed glasses and the eye patch he wore in the early years, he was the caricature of the ugly right-winger, notorious for his efforts to downplay the Holocaust. Le Pen came across as a tyrant, a monster from another time, a man who did not hesitate to shout at and even physically assault his adversaries. His supporters included deeply conservative Catholics, right-wing extremists and Vichy diehards -- but the majority were disappointed protest voters.\n\nThe party's greatest success was followed by a rapid decline. The National Front, divided to the point of rupture, almost went under. The party needed a new face and, ironically, found it in the old man's youngest daughter. It now looks as if it needed precisely her to transform the FN from a coalition of the despised into a party like any other. According to opinion polls, the majority of the French already see it as a regular party -- and as a party that one doesn't just vote for out of dissatisfaction, but because one is in favor of Marine Le Pen.\n\nOn First Name Terms\n\nModern European right-wing populism no longer aims to shock people, but rather seeks to advance into the heart of society. The Dutch politician Geert Wilders and the Danish politician Pia Kjaersgaard have already made it, while Marine Le Pen is still hard at work, doing what she calls \"de-demonization.\" The difference between her and her father is that she seems normal in a way that inspires confidence, the kind of woman one would expect to run into with her children at the local sports field. The French refer to her by her first name -- as if she was an old acquaintance.\n\nThe FN is most successful in provincial towns like Hénin-Beaumont in the north and Metz in Lorraine, where industry has migrated abroad and unemployment is high. There is no feeling of radical change at Le Pen's appearances in these cities. Instead, the audiences she addresses in drab rooms are sheepish party members who are quick to point out that they are not racists before the issue is even raised. Only when Le Pen is standing in front of them do they suddenly straighten up, as if this person were someone who could clear them of all suspicion.\n\nIn Metz, she attacks the political class, what she calls the \"UMPS system,\" a fusion of the acronyms for Sarkozy's conservative Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) and the Socialist Party (PS). She disparages their politicians as nothing but graduates of elite schools who \"have colonized politics for the last 30 years.\" The National Front, she says, aims to produce a \"new elite from the ranks of the people.\" \"They don't like that!\" she thunders. \"They say to themselves: Who are these workers, these housewives, these students?\"\n\nShe talks about politics the way ordinary people talk about politics. \"This is shocking,\" she says. \"Outrageous!\" Le Pen is selling rage, and people are buying it. The National Front has long been the strongest party among blue-collar workers, and now it hopes to capture the middle class.",

Today, he announces that the provision has been dropped because it “could be misinterpreted.”\n\nLate update: And, if that wasn’t bad enough, Grassley’s also patting himself on the back for delaying health care reform, which in turn created political space for the town hall disruptions.\n\nLate late update: Here’s more from Grassley: “Maybe others can defend a bill like the Pelosi bill that leaves major issues open to interpretation, but I can’t,” Grassley added.\n\nAnother way of putting this is that Grassley’s shocked–shocked!–that anybody would write a bill that doesn’t explicitly disavow death panels.

  "latent_21252": "DUBAI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said Tehran would continue to bypass sanctions after the United States penalised a number of companies for violating sanctions imposed on Iran, mostly in connection with its nuclear programme.\n\nOn Friday, the United States imposed a fresh round of curbs on a number of Iranian and foreign companies, banks and airlines. The new measures came just over two weeks before talks between Iran and six world powers on Tehran’s nuclear programme resume in New York.\n\nWashington said the firms were helping Iran’s nuclear programme, which Tehran says is peaceful but the West suspects may be aimed at developing a nuclear weapons capability. They included Goldentex FZE, a UAE-based firm working with Iran’s shipping sector, and an Italian firm, Dettin SpA, which it said was working with Iran’s petrochemical industry.\n\n“The sanctions are cruel and illegal and we fulfil our duty for circumventing the sanctions,” Zanganeh was cited as saying by the oil ministry’s news website Shana.\n\n“We do not recognise the sanctions,” he said, referring to Friday’s new curbs.\n\nWestern sanctions imposed on Iran to hamper its nuclear programme have blocked sales of its oil to the West and made it increasingly difficult for Iran’s fleet to obtain insurance and financing for deals with Asian buyers.\n\nDespite that, Iran shipped 29.4 percent more crude to major Asian customers in July from a year earlier, with China, Tehran’s biggest client, accounting for most of the increase.\n\nIn the past, Iranian oil tankers sent incorrect satellite signals to confuse global tracking systems and Iranian state tanker company NITC changed tanker names in response to the sanctions.\n\nIran and the United States, France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia failed to meet a July 20 deadline to negotiate a comprehensive agreement under which Tehran would scale back its nuclear activities in exchange for gradually ending the sanctions that have crippled its economy.\n\nThe new deadline was extended to Nov. 24. Iran and the six world powers are set to resume negotiations in mid-September around the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.\n\nWestern diplomats say the two sides remain far apart on the future size of Iran’s uranium enrichment programme, activity which can have both civilian and military uses.\n\nJofi Joseph, a former director for non-proliferation on the White House National Security Council, said that the new sanctions “could be a message to Tehran that, unless it shifts course, these most recent designations are only a preview of what is to come if the talks break down.” (Reporting by Michelle Moghtader in Dubai; Additional reporting by Fredrik Dahl in Vienna; Editing by Rania El Gamal and Raissa Kasolowsky)",
  "latent_21376": "IN SPACE - SEPTEMBER 11: In this handout satellite image provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), hurricane Humberto (R) forms as a category one on September 11, 2013 in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean. Humberto is the first hurricane of the 2013 season. (Photo by NOAA/NASA GOES Project via Getty Images)\n\nNearly one year after Hurricane Sandy ravaged the East Coast, the 2013 Atlantic Hurricane Season has not produced a single land-falling hurricane in the U.S. Instead of having above-average storm activity, as the seasonal hurricane outlooks unanimously called for, the season has been quiet — notable for its inactivity.\n\nThe tropical season doesn’t officially end until November 30, but it would take a barrage of late-season storms to bring the season up to average levels, let alone above average, something that forecasters say is unlikely.\n\n“It’s not only quiet, but it’s got the potential to be near record quiet for the Atlantic Basin,” Chris Landsea, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said.\n\nSo far, there have been just 11 named storms, two of which have been hurricanes, and none that have been major hurricanes.\n\nWhile pre-season outlooks rarely, if ever, have pinpoint accuracy, they don’t usually miss by such a large margin. In May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) projected that there would likely be between 13 and 20 named storms (with sustained winds of at least 39 mph). Of those storms, NOAA projected that between seven and 11 would achieve hurricane status (winds of at least 74 mph); and that three or four would become major hurricanes of category 3, 4 or 5 (winds of at least 111 mph).\n\nBy one measure, 2013 so far ranks as the 7th quietest season in the past 70 years. That measure uses an index known as Accumulated Cyclone Energy, which incorporates how many storms formed, how long they lasted, and how strong they became. If no additional storms were to form before the end of the season, 2013 would be the 4th quietest.\n\nThere has not been a major hurricane in either the North Atlantic Basin or the eastern Pacific this year, something that hasn’t happened since 1968, according to Philip Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher and seasonal forecaster at Colorado State University.\n\nSubsidence and the Sahara\n\nThe scant number of storms is surprising given some of the favorable conditions that exist that would normally fuel tropical cyclones. The ocean waters throughout the North Atlantic are warmer than average, the trade winds are lighter, and there is no El Niño event in the Pacific to ramp up high altitude winds that can tear nascent storms apart.\n\nForecasters say that three main features loom large for the inactivity: large areas of sinking air, frequent plumes of dry, dusty air coming off the Sahara Desert, and above-average wind shear. None of those features were part of their initial calculations in making seasonal projections. Researchers are now looking into whether they can be predicted in advance like other variables, such as El Niño and La Niña events.\n\nIn this handout provided by the U.S. Air Force, an Air Force Reserve pararescueman from the 920th Rescue Wing scans the landscape of Nederland, Texas in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike, 13 September 2008. (Photo by Paul Flipse/US Air Force via Getty Images)\n\nBrian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami, said that across the Atlantic this season “you had air sinking through a pretty large depth of the atmosphere.” Sinking air inhibits storm formation by causing air to become drier and more stable, thereby stunting the growth of thunderstorms that require moist, unstable air in order to thrive.\n\nTropical weather systems depend on a plentiful supply of warm, moist air to form and intensify, and when these storms ingest exceptionally dry air, as many of the storms have this year, they can choke to death in a matter of hours or days. For example, Tropical Storm Karen formed in the Gulf of Mexico, where landfall in the U.S. or Mexico is virtually assured, but died before reaching land because of the presence of dry air and strong wind shear.\n\nSome of the dry air across the Atlantic Basin came from large areas of dusty air that originated in the scorching Sahara Desert. However, such outbreaks of dusty air are fairly typical during hurricane season. What has been unusual has been the broad expanse of sinking and drying air throughout the North Atlantic basin, McNoldy said.\n\nThis season, the dry air “made a huge difference” and “squashed all the other factors that looked good,” he said.\n\nKlotzbach said the area where most tropical storms and hurricanes form had the driest mid-to-lower atmospheric conditions during the Aug. 1 to Sept. 25 period since reliable records began in 1970.\n\nIn addition to the dry air, Landsea and Klotzbach pointed to above-average wind shear as another key reason. Wind shear is the difference in wind speed and direction between the ocean surface and the mid-to-upper atmosphere. Strong shear can knock storms off balance, essentially tearing them apart and allowing dry air to enter their circulation.\n\nLandsea said that NOAA’s seasonal outlooks focused on the other pieces of the puzzle that argued in favor of an above average to average season, namely the absence of El Nino and the presence of warm sea surface temperatures. The seasonal outlook won’t be correct every time, Landsea said.\n\nKlotzbach, who along with William Gray pioneered the art of forecasting the severity of hurricane seasons, said future outlooks will need to incorporate more variables.\n\n“We will be looking at ways to be able to incorporate more moisture data into our models, in hopes to not make a similar mistake in future years,” he said in an email interview.\n\nRecord Major Hurricane Drought Continues\n\nThe absence of a major hurricane in the U.S. this season means the continuation of a record-long streak. On Oct. 24, it will be exactly 8 years since the last major hurricane of Category 3 strength or greater made landfall. Scientists fear this streak of good luck is leading to more severe cases of “hurricane amnesia,” which can complicate emergency preparation efforts the next time a monster storm threatens.\n\n“When it doesn’t happen often you certainly become a little more lax,” McNoldy said, noting that in the 8 years since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida, tens of thousands of people have moved to the Sunshine State, many of whom have never before experienced a major hurricane. These residents, McNoldy said, may be less willing to evacuate their homes before the next major storm strikes.\n\n“People who have never experienced it . . . don’t really know what they’re in for,” McNoldy said.\n\nIn this GOES satellite handout photo provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Tropical Storm Karen churns in the Gulf of Mexico on October 05, 2013. (Photo by NOAA via Getty Images)\n\nKlotzbach said the “fear of complacency” grows as the major hurricane gap lengthens. “One statistic that people should remember is that on average, about 1 in every 3 major hurricanes makes landfall at major hurricane strength (in the U.S.)” he said. Klotzbach noted that since 2005, 22 major hurricanes formed in the Atlantic, yet none of them made landfall in the U.S. as major hurricanes.\n\nEven without a major hurricane reaching land, the U.S. has seen its fair share of damaging storms in recent years. Hurricane Ike devastated the Galveston, Texas area in 2008 as a strong Category 2 storm, and Sandy was one of the strongest and most destructive storms to ever strike the Jersey Shore.",

He is unveiling a program of string quartets this Sunday August 9, 2015 here in New York at the Noguchi Museum (info below). I thought I would use this opportunity to catch up with him and ask him a few questions about it.\n\nMLN: As I've told you before, I've admired your work for sometime and am looking forward to Sunday's performance. I have no idea what to expect you to do with a string quartet. Can you tell me a little about these pieces? How they came about?\n\nJGT: I was invited to perform at the Noguchi Museum by Bang On A Can for a series they present there and proposed that I present a program of string quartets. I've written a new piece called Narcolepsy for the concert, and that will premiere on Sunday. It's pretty intense. There are some pieces that I adapted for string quartet from the repertoire of my chamber ensemble Manorexia, and there will be a New York premiere of a piece called Hydrophobia, which I presented for the first time in Austin last year at New Media Art and Sound Summit Festival. The whole set is solely performed by the quartet but on the final piece of the program I join the quartet and slowly process the strings electronically.\n\nMLN: Your work always seemed to have a wide cinematic approach going back to the very beginning of your career. Do you see these compositional works as an extension or connected to your film score work?\n\nJGT: You could say there's a cinematic feel to lot of my music but I don't think this is really an extension of my scoring. If I am writing for string quartet I write with those instruments in mind, whereas with writing for Venture Bros for example, I have an unlimited palette of instruments, and I am scoring to picture so there are some set parameters, following the images and story on the screen and responding dynamically. There's creative problem solving. I've written three pieces for Kronos Quartet (none of which we are playing on Sunday) and I think for me there's a great deal to explore with that combination of instruments\n\nMLN: Can you tell me a little bit about the musicians who will be performing the piece?\n\nJGT: Elena Moon Park has been performing with me since 2007; she's played in Manorexia and also in my Steroid Maximus large ensemble project at the Celebrate Brooklyn Festival a few years back and various other things. She also played in one of the quartets I assembled for a project with Zola Jesus a while back, where I adapted ZJ's work for string quartet. Elena is also a big part of the collective Found Sound Nation. I also worked with cellist Clara Kennedy on that Zola Jesus project and we've been friends for a while, she plays with tons of people. They recommended Isabel Hagen who is an incredible violist. I met Adrianna Mateo at the Bang On A Can Marathon a few years back where she was performing solo, and we'd kept in touch, and I asked her to play on this project. I know she also works closely with Face The Music at Kaufman Center and is solo artist in her own right, along with playing repertoire all over.",

  "latent_21770": "Canadian comic book artist and writer Darwyn Cooke has died from cancer. He was 53.\n\nThe news about the Eisner Award winner came Saturday morning on his blog. “We regret to inform you that Darwyn lost his battle with cancer early this morning at 1:30 AM ET. We read all of your messages of support to him throughout the day yesterday. He was filled with your love and surrounded by friends and family at his home in Florida.”\n\nOn Friday, Cooke’s wife, Marsha, announced he was receiving palliative care “following a bout with aggressive cancer.”\n\nPromising that a longer statement would come later Saturday, the announcement ended with a quote from President John Kennedy’s “New Frontier” speech: “Then we shall not be weary. Then we shall prevail.”\n\nCooke’s first published work came in 1985 in a short story in New Talent Showcase #19. After leaving the comic book world for 15 years, Warner Bros. Animation hired him in the early 1990s to work as a storyboard artist for Batman: The Animated Series and Superman: The Animated Series, going on to create the main title design for Batman Beyond in 1999 before becoming a director for Sony Animation’s Men in Black: The Series.\n\nCooke then worked for DC Comics, revamping the Catwoman character with writer Ed Brubaker before writing and drawing DC: The New Frontier and Solo, an anthology project that landed Cooke an Eisner Award for “Best Single Issue” for his Solo #5.\n\nStarting in late 2006, Cooke wrote and drew an ongoing The Spirit series, landing him two Joe Shuster Awards as an artist and cartoonist. He won another as writer of Superman Confidential. Among his other works, Cooke adapted Donald Westlake’s novel The Hunter into Richard Stark’s Parker: The Hunger for IDW Publishing, followed by the author’s other books, The Outfit, The Score, and Slayground. More recently, Cooke was the writer-artist of Before Watchmen: Minutemen.\n\nEarly last year Cooke talked to EW about his first original story, Revengeance, saying he was “fairly full of an equal measure of both nerves and excitement.”\n\nBelow, some remembrances of Cooke from famous members of the creative community.\n\nThe best way to celebrate the passing of an artist is to sit with their work and enjoy it one more time. Try Darwyn cooke's new frontier — BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS (@BRIANMBENDIS) May 14, 2016\n\nEverybody remembers Darwyn Cooke for his DC work. I remember him for adapting the Parker books with bravado and love. — Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) May 14, 2016\n\nDarwyn Cooke fun fact: He animated the (proFOUNDly groovy) opening credit montage of Batman Beyond on an old Mac in his spare bedroom. — Glen Weldon (@ghweldon) May 14, 2016",
  "latent_21859": "About 42 percent of shoppers purchase their vitamins at natural and specialty retail outlets, like GNC and Whole Foods, according to the journal, while only 23 percent take the discount approach and buy their bottles at supermarkets and club stores. The other 35 percent buy through mail order or from a health care provider.\n\nOf course, it’s controversial whether we should be taking vitamins at all. Recent studies have indicated that taking a multivitamin won’t protect you from heart disease or cancer. And experts maintain that if you eat well, you don’t need vitamin supplements.\n\n“The evidence shows that a healthy diet and exercise are the best way to ward off disease; a vitamin cannot replace those benefits,” says Eric Rimm, associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nBut what if you don’t eat well or are chronically stressed out? Then, Professor Rimm says, there may be some benefit from taking a multivitamin. “Certain subgroups, including women of child-bearing age attempting to get pregnant, may need specific supplements, like folic acid and omega-3,” he added.\n\nAs for the matter of cost: If you take only a daily multivitamin mainly as a medical insurance policy, it certainly won’t hurt your health — as long as you do not already eat a lot of fortified food. And it could help. But it will require spending some money. And if you take a multivitamin and a few individual vitamins and minerals, it’s even more worth your while to make sure you’re not paying more than you need to.\n\nHere’s how to get the most vitamin for the least money.\n\nUSE ONLY WHAT YOU NEED Popping too many vitamin pills is not only a waste of money but can be bad for your health. Talk to your doctor about what added vitamins or minerals you might require; you can ask for a blood test to learn what you might be lacking.\n\nFor example, if you don’t get enough vitamin D — many people who live in the northern states or who wear sunscreen everyday are low on this crucial vitamin — then buy just a D supplement. Standard multivitamins will probably not have the levels of D you require (many doctors suggest taking 1,000 to 2,000 international units a day).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf your doctor recommends a specific supplement, like omega-3, ask in what form you should be taking it.\n\nPhoto\n\nFIND A REPUTABLE SOURCE Vitamins and minerals are commodity items, and every manufacturer has access to the same ingredients. For that reason, researchers and scientists say paying more for a name brand won’t necessarily buy you better vitamins.\n\n“When we measure levels of vitamins in the blood, we find the levels are the same whether the person was taking a generic brand or a name brand,” says Dr. Rimm, who has been studying the effects of vitamins for 20 years.\n\nThat said, don’t be too cheap. Purchase your vitamins from well-known retailers that do a brisk business and restock frequently, whether that’s Costco or Drugstore.com. Vitamins lose their potency over time and must be stored at, or below, room temperature. If bottles are sitting on a shelf in warm room or in direct sunlight, they may degrade even before their expiration date.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nPRICE MAY NOT MEAN QUALITY While the Food and Drug Administration regulates vitamins as part of the nutritional supplement industry, it does not test them before they are put on the shelves. The F.D.A. places the responsibility on the manufacturer to ensure that its dietary supplement products are safe before they are marketed. All of which means that no matter what the price, quality is not assured.\n\nConsumerLab.com, a company based in White Plains that tests hundreds of vitamins each year, finds that 30 percent of multivitamins have a quality problem: the pills might have more or less of a stated ingredient, or they might not dissolve properly.\n\n“We haven’t found any brand with a broad product line that makes every product well,” says Dr. Tod Cooperman, president of the company.\n\nTaking exception to such assertions is the vitamin industry’s trade group, the Council for Responsible Nutrition. In response to questions, the council released a statement from Andrew Shao, a vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs.\n\nMr. Shao said that the F.D.A. allowed for “a reasonable amount of variation” — which he characterized as up to 15 percent more of an ingredient than the label might indicate. Mr. Shao said that manufacturers frequently add slightly more of an ingredient to ensure that the amount is at least at the level claimed on the label as the product nears the end of its shelf life.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn any case, ConsumerLab.com says it has found a few patterns that consumers may find helpful. Products sold by vitamin chains tend to be more reliable than drugstore brands, and Wal-Mart and Costco’s vitamin lines are usually worth considering. In a recent test of multivitamins, ConsumerLab.com found that Equate-Mature Multivitamin 50+ sold by Wal-Mart was just as good as the name brand Centrum Silver, but at less than a nickel a day is half the price.\n\nPuritan’s Pride, a catalog and online retailer, also has very good prices, and Dr. Cooperman says that its products are generally good.\n\nCurious consumers can subscribe to ConsumerLab.com for $30 a year and learn how other supplement brands fare in the lab’s tests.\n\nCERTIFICATION SYMBOLS One quality check you can make, although it is not a perfect screening, is to see whether a product is certified by one of several nonprofit organizations that check supplements for purity and quality.\n\nThe two most commonly used groups are the United States Pharmacopeia (www.usp.org) and NSF International (www.nsf.org), according to Mr. Shao. Manufacturers voluntarily submit a product for review and, if it passes, the product can bear an approval seal, such as USP or NSF. Because the process is voluntary, Mr. Shao points out, the absence of the seal does not necessarily mean the product is of poor quality.\n\nBut at least the seal should mean you know what you’re getting. And with vitamins, anything beyond that simple assurance may not be worth paying for.",
  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nUntil the election, we’re bringing you “The Trump Files,” a daily dose of telling episodes, strange but true stories, or curious scenes from the life of GOP nominee Donald Trump.\n\nDonald Trump has a well-documented tendency to file lawsuits when someone hurts his feelings. In 2013, the guilty party was Bill Maher, the late-night HBO talk show host known for his liberal leanings and biting commentary.\n\nAfter Trump had insisted in 2012 that President Barack Obama release his college transcripts and passport records, Maher pushed back on the mogul’s request with a demand of his own: that Trump show proof that he is not “the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan.” Maher, interviewed on Jay Leno’s The Tonight Show, cited the similarity in color between Trump’s coif and an orange orangutan’s fur, as split-screen images of Trump next to the animal were displayed. If Trump complied with the request and proved him wrong, Maher promised he would give Trump $5 million for the charity of his choice. The charities Maher suggested? “Hair Club for Men” or the “Institute for Incorrigible Douchebaggery.”\n\nTrump took the jab personally. He filed a $5 million lawsuit against Maher for breach of contract, alleging that when he provided his birth certificate to Maher proving he is not, in fact, the son of an orangutan, Maher never came up with the $5 million. Alas, the lawsuit didn’t get very far. Trump wound up dropping it, but the threat to Maher remained.\n\nMichael Cohen, an attorney for Trump, insisted that although the suit had been withdrawn temporarily, it could resurface in the future. “The lawsuit was temporarily withdrawn to be amended and refiled at a later date,” Cohen said.\n\nWatch Maher’s jab at Trump on The Tonight Show:\n\nRead the rest of “The Trump Files”:",
  "latent_22156": "Firebase is an incredibly powerful cloud based real-time database that allows you to store and sync data without diving into back-end coding at all.\n\n“You can save data, update data, and listen for data changes in realtime with only a few lines of code. Data is stored as standard JSON and is accessible from any platform.” - Firebase\n\nIn this post, I’ll be going over Firebase and how it can abstract away a lot of things while allowing you to focus on your front-end development. I’ll be building a Real Time Shared Sticky Notes App using Firebase. So let’s get this party started!\n\nCreate a real time shared sticky notes application with Login/Signup using just front-end and firebase!\n\nGetting Started With Firebase To get started with firebase, you need to signup and create your app. They have a free plan so you can try it out without any hassles. Once you have created an app, you’ll get a unique url for it - xxxxxxxxxxxx.firebaseio.com/ This url is your key for all the API calls to your app.\n\nEnabling User Login and Auth Login and Auth Settings allows you to create login/signup for your application. The quickest way to get started is via Email & Password login. You can enable it from your app’s dashboard. You can even set up password reset emails and content from here! Once you have enabled Email & Password Authentication, you are good to go and dive into linking Firebase to you HTML pages. Note - You can allow users to Login via Facebook, Twitter, Github and Google as well. For this app, I’ll be setting up Email/Password Auth only.\n\nLinking Firebase to Login/Signup Forms At this point you should have your HTML/CSS done and should have 2 forms for the users to register and login to their accounts. I used StackHive to build from the browser, obviously! :) To begin with Firebase you just need to include their JS file. <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/2.2.3/firebase.js\"></script> Here is the HTML code that I am using - <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"> <meta name=\"description\"> <meta name=\"author\"> <title> Realtime Shared Sticky Notes Using Bootstrap and Firebase </title><!-- Bootstrap core CSS --> <link href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"><!-- Custom styles for this template --> <link href=\"starter-template.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js\"> </script> <link href=\"assets/css/sh-default.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" default-stylesheet=\"true\" type=\"text/css\"> <link href=\"//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.2.0/css/font-awesome.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> </head> <body style=\"cursor: auto;\"> <div class=\"navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top\" role=\"navigation\"> <div class=\"container\"> <div class=\"navbar-header\"> <button type=\"button\" class=\"navbar-toggle\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\".navbar-collapse\"> <span class=\"sr-only\">Toggle navigation</span> <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span> <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span> <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span> </button><a class=\"navbar-brand\" href>Realtime Shared Sticky Notes</a> </div> <div class=\"collapse navbar-collapse\"> <ul class=\"nav navbar-nav pull-right\"> <li> <a data-target=\"#login\" href>Login</a> </li> <li> <a data-target=\"#register\" href>Signup</a> </li> <li> <a data-target=\"#lists\" href>Shared List</a> </li> <li> <a id=\"logout\" href>Logout</a> </li> </ul> </div><!--/.nav-collapse --> </div> </div> <div class=\"welcome\"></div> <div class=\"container tab default\" id=\"login\"> <form class=\"form-signin\" role=\"form\"> <h2 class=\"form-signin-heading\"> <em class=\"stackhive-marker\"></em>Login to your account </h2> <hr> <input type=\"email\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Email address\" required=\"\" autofocus=\"\" id=\"login-email\"><input type=\"password\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Password\" required=\"\" id=\"login-password\"> <button class=\"btn btn-primary\" type=\"button\" id=\"login-btn\"> Login </button> <hr> <div class=\"status alert alert-info hide\"></div> </form> </div> <div class=\"container tab hide\" id=\"register\"> <form class=\"form-signin\" role=\"form\"> <h2 class=\"form-signin-heading\"> Register a new account </h2> <hr> <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Your Name\" required=\"\" autofocus=\"\" id=\"name\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Email address\" required=\"\" autofocus=\"\" id=\"email\"><input type=\"password\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Password\" required=\"\" id=\"password\"> <button class=\"btn btn-primary\" type=\"button\" id=\"signup-btn\"> Sign Me Up! </button> </form> <hr> <div class=\"status alert alert-info hide\"></div> </div> <div class=\"container tab hide\" id=\"lists\"> <div class=\"status alert alert-info hide\"></div><br> <h3> Add Items to the Shared List </h3> <p> <textarea type=\"text\" id=\"listitem\" placeholder=\"Add content that you want to add to your list\"></textarea><br> <a id=\"addItemToList\" class=\"btn btn-success\">Add it to your list</a> </p> <hr> <a class=\"btn btn-info\" id=\"sort-items\">View Aligned (for OCD fellows!)</a> <ul id=\"sharedlist\" class=\"sharedlist\" data-widget-class=\"sharedlist\"></ul> </div><!-- Bootstrap core JavaScript ================================================== --> <!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster --> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/2.2.3/firebase.js\"></script> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.11.3/jquery-ui.min.js\"></script> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"./firebasefunctions.js\"></script> </body> </html> First thing we need to do is instantiate our Firebase reference. var firebaseref = new Firebase(\"https://dazzling-fire-8954.firebaseio.com/\") Let’s connect Firebase with our login form. Firebase has a direct API call for authenticating using Email and Password - authWithPassword({},callback). $(\"#login-btn\").on('click', function() { var email = $(\"#login-email\").val(); var password = $(\"#login-password\").val(); firebaseref.authWithPassword({ email: email, password: password }, function(error, authData) { if (error) { console.log(\"Login Failed!\", error); } else { console.log(\"Authenticated successfully with payload:\", authData); } }); }); Similarly, we connect our signup form as well using the createUser({},callback) API call - $(\"#signup-btn\").on('click', function() { var email = $(\"#email\").val(); var password = $(\"#password\").val(); firebaseref.createUser({ email: email, password: password },function(error, userData) { if (error) { console.log(\"Error creating user:\", error); } else { console.log(\"Successfully created user account with uid:\", userData.uid); //additionally, you can log the user in right after the signup is successful and add more data about the user like name etc. } }); }); So far we have set up our login and signup forms. For a user to log in, they’ll need to go through the login form every time! Hence, we need to identify if the user is already logged in and update the app accordingly. In order to detect any changes in the login state of a user, Firebase has onAuth(callback) API call that is triggered every time a user logs in or out. //Callback for Auth Changes var authDataCallback = function(authData) { //authData is the object sent by Firebase in the callback. if (authData) { console.log(\"User \" + authData.uid + \" is logged in\"); } else { console.log(\"User is logged out\"); } } //register a callback for the change in Authentication Status firebaseref.onAuth(authDataCallback); Now, whenever a user logs in or out, authDataCallback will be called. This function will also be triggered if you refresh the page and hence the user can remain logged in (till the browser session is active). So our login/signup is almost complete. Before we move forward, we need to look into Firebase Rules -\n\nFirebase Security Rules Firebase rules are a way for restricting and securing the data. You can control the read and write permissions for any node of the data. Each node is essentially a url like -\n\nxxxxxx.firebaseio.com/users/1001/name The above url represents the name of a user with an id as 1001. We need a way to restrict who can read or write data to this url. Firebase Rules do exactly that. For more details and understanding of the security rules - check out https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/guide/understanding-security.html Note - This is a really important part of firebase and you’ll need to go over them in details before launching your app! For this application, I have the following rule structure set up - { \"rules\": { \"users\": { \"$uid\": { // grants write access to the owner of this user account whose uid must exactly match the key ($uid) \".write\": \"auth !== null && auth.uid === $uid\", // grants read access to any user who is logged in with an email and password \".read\": \"auth !== null && auth.provider === 'password'\" } } } } Users node is used to save the data about each user with their uid as the key.\n\nMy users node is only readable by a user who is logged in using a password.\n\nThe node is only writable by the user who has the same uid (hence only the user can change content of his node. The node will contains profile data for of the users.) “This rule grants a user write access on /users/<auth.uid>/ to the user whose unique ID matches the dynamic path, $uid.” - Firebase Once your rules are setup, your login/signup system is ready.\n\nGetting Started on Shared List -Saving Data and Firebase Events Next up is setting up a shared list where the users can create/delete items. The rules for my list are - \"lists\": { // grants write access to any user who is logged in with an email and password \".write\": \"auth !== null\", // grants read access to any user who is logged in with an email and password \".read\": \"auth !== null && auth.provider === 'password'\" } There are 3 events that are available in Firebase which help in creating a real time app effortlessly! Lets set up these events to listen for the changes on the shared list - var setUpFirebaseEvents = function() { listRef = new Firebase('https://dazzling-fire-8954.firebaseio.com/lists/sharedlist/items'); $(\"#sharedlist\").html(''); listRef.off('child_added', childAddedFunction) listRef.on(\"child_added\", childAddedFunction); listRef.off('child_changed', childChangedFunction); listRef.on('child_changed', childChangedFunction); listRef.off('child_removed', childRemovedFunction); listRef.on('child_removed', childRemovedFunction); } var authDataCallback = function(authData) { console.log(\"authCallback Event is called from onAuth Event\"); if (authData) { console.log(\"User \" + authData.uid + \" is logged in with \" + authData.provider); setUpFirebaseEvents(); } else { console.log(\"User is logged out\"); } } We call the setUpFirebaseEvents function from the authDataCallback. Here are the callback functions for each event to handle the changes - var childAddedFunction = function(snapshot) { var key = snapshot.key(); //return the key for the item var listItem = snapshot.val(); //returns the value of the item as JSON console.log(\"Key - \" + key + \" has been added\"); buildNewListItem(listItem, key); //adds the new item to the list $(\"#lists .status\").fadeIn(400).html('New item added!') } var childChangedFunction = function(snapshot) { var listItem = snapshot.val(); var key = snapshot.key(); console.log(\"Key - \" + key + \" has been changed\"); updateListItem(listItem, key); //updates the position of the item } var childRemovedFunction = function(snapshot) { var key = snapshot.key(); removeListItem(key); //remove the list item console.log('Child Removed'); } Note -\n\nkey = snapshot.key(); - This return the key at which the element is stored in firebase.\n\nIn terms of url - dazzling-fire-8954.firebaseio.com/lists/sharedlist/items/{key}",

The claim being that James Rolfe’s video is sexist; simply for stating he has no intention of seeing Ghostbusters 2016. For context, for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet, here’s the video their claims address.\n\nThis journalist backlash against the Angry Video Game Nerd demonstrates conclusively that journalists will invent a sexism moral panic narrative from nothing. Their reaction to the Nerd’s Ghostbusters comments shows an ever growing disparity between what journalists report about geek audiences and what geek audiences actually say. If any journalist disagrees with me, I have one challenge, one simple question.\n\nWhat were the actual words that came out of James Rolfe’s mouth that you found to be sexist?\n\nFor my research I’ve examined 23 articles that have covered James Rolfe’s Ghostbusters comments. Sixteen of these articles make points regarding a connection between general Ghostbusters criticism and sexism. Thirteen of these have directly made a claim that Rolfe’s criticisms have a basis in sexism (a couple of these are worded sarcastically, although they are in my opinion still direct, I have included a pastebin link of all articles examined, including quotes, so you can judge for yourself). Only one article from the group of articles I examined defended Rolfe. If you can show I have made a mistake in my working out, I will update this article. Disclaimer: I talked to Cathy Young for a previous article.\n\nNone of these articles are able to provide a specific quote from James Rolfe’s Ghostbusters comments that they believe to be sexist. These outlets are also lacking any serious audience research in their audience character judgments.\n\nBoston Globe’s question-begging headline. Ty Burr (@tyburr) then goes on to say ‘Maybe we should all boycott the new “Ghostbusters” because it has gurlz in it and because the trailer bites.’\n\nNick Patch (@ByNickPatch) for the Toronto Star framing gender as the basis of criticism without providing a specific quote.\n\nExcerpt from Toronto Star #1\n\nExcerpt from Toronto Star #2\n\nExcerpt from Toronto Star #3\n\nKeith Phipps (article exerpt below, can be contacted at @kphipps3000) takes the position that the simple act of objecting to the film opens the door for ‘soft sexism’. The actual nature of the objections seems to be irrelevant.\n\nKeith Phipps’ Uproxx article, another article linking back to Faraci.\n\nThe Daily Beast also refers to Devin Faraci’s ‘soft sexism’ article. Jen Yamato (@jenyamato) makes a point regarding unconscious prejudices and ties this to misogyny around Ghostbusters criticism, but fails to provide any quote from James Rolfe to demonstrate this.\n\nYou’ll notice a specific pattern in Faraci’s article and laced throughout these multiple outlets.\n\nThey reject Rolfe’s stated reasons for choosing not to view the film.\n\nThey have decided that Rolfe has a secret, ulterior reason for choosing not to see the film.\n\nThey have decided that this secret reason is sexism.\n\nThey cannot provide a quote from Rolfe to meet their burden of proof. It’s pure Argument from Ignorance. James Rolfe has been accused of a thought crime and his accusers cannot even describe how this thought crime manifests. What’s more, in each of these articles, this accusation of thought crime is a deliberate generalization of Ghostbusters (2016) criticism.\n\nExcerpt from Faraci’s article. When you have no evidence of sexism, point to things that are ‘unsaid’.\n\nHow does Devin know that Rolfe is having a sexist reaction?\n\nFaraci completely fails to describe how he comes to his conclusion of sexism. Prior to this paragraph he was on a tangent, talking about trans people and bathrooms. It’s a subject that has nothing to do with the words that came out of James Rolfe’s mouth. How did Faraci come to the conclusion that Rolfe was being sexist?\n\nIf James Rolfe weighs the same as a duck he’s made of wood! And therefore, a WITCH!!\n\nThis set of journalists have such wide definitions of what constitutes sexism that any criticism of Ghostbusters (2016) can be viewed as sexism. When dealing with an inherently subjective art form like films, the goal posts they have set are not reasonable in any sense. People are not obligated to support films they think look like shit, no matter the gender of the cast.\n\nWhat are the specific formation of words that came out of Rolfe’s mouth that Faraci finds to be sexist?\n\nFaraci fails to meet even the most simple burden of proof. When you label a person sexist, or label what they say as sexist, as a journalist you have a responsibility to back this up. I will not widen the goal posts as these journalists have. Rather, I will hold them to a rigid, reasonable standard of evidence. They do not soften their burden by calling Rolfe’s criticisms ‘soft sexism’.\n\nFaraci refers to Rolfe’s position - not wishing to see this big budget film - as dangerous. He refers to things unsaid, things under the surface, and sexism that ‘quietly lives inside us’.\n\nI remember a Tracie Harris video with an incredibly apt metaphor for Faraci’s fallacy. It’s as though Faraci has an empty jar, and is telling us the jar is full of sexism, but he cannot describe how it manifests in a way we can see or hear or measure in any way. The sexism is an innate, unseen, unsaid trait of the empty jar, that’s his argument. Following this metaphor, what Faraci describes as sexism is the same as describing nothing. He’s inventing sexism from nothing.\n\nFaraci is claiming clairvoyance into the unconscious thoughts of others. His argument does not get beyond the fact that Rolfe does not want to watch Ghostbusters (2016). That Faraci’s article has been cited by others in a media led attack against Rolfe is demonstrative of their failure. Their position has no basis in reason. This helps to explain the disparity between what these outlets report about audiences, and what the audiences are actually saying. If Rolfe’s criticisms are sexist, anyone’s criticisms are sexist. These outlets will be as ungenerous as possible in their interpretation of Ghostbusters criticism. They will accuse you of being a witch.\n\nYour guilt has been determined. This is merely a sentencing hearing.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the same outlets citing Faraci did not cite his personal attacks against James Rolfe.\n\nThese outlets do not represent geek audiences.\n\nAn imgur link to TotalBiscuit’s comment calling out Screen Junkies for implying the backlash is related to the gender of the cast, and pointing out that there are beloved nerd franchises with female leads.\n\nTotalBiscuit had also said in a separate comment that you can’t reason people out of a position they did not reason themselves into. He says not to bother arguing with the people who make these empty claims. Nevertheless, I think it is useful to document such a clear cut case of media faking moral panic. By challenging this narrative we not only challenge these journalists but we help to inform other people that this is happening, and we can speak to the future. I believe people will look back and examine today’s media driven moral panics, the way that we look back on the moral panics of the past and see them for what they are.\n\nThis is my message: Today’s media, movie critics, bloggers, video game journalists - they abuse their positions by acting like Orwellian thought police. Chastising people with accusations of thought crime and attacking hobbyists for the most innocuous of positions. Their work is poorly reasoned, with little to no research, constantly making character judgments and generalizations about audiences and enthusiasts with no sign that they’re actually listening to the people they make judgments about. Let’s take audience research, for example. Many of the articles that make these sexism claims do a poor job of providing examples of what they’re even referring to, if they provide examples at all. Examining comments sections - looking at what are the sorts of comments to float to the top with a high number of likes, or the articles that receive backlashes in comments (when they even allow comments), this is a valid approach to audience research. Sexism, bigotry, trolling, these things exist, but they do not float to the top, they are the vast minority, and we cannot trust these outlets to report with an accurate sense of proportion regarding those comments. Reasoned arguments, good natured banter, and witty burns against hacks, these are the comments that float to the top. It’s the marketplace of ideas in action, and it shows that people outside of their echo-chambers are not buying the snake oil. When these outlets take the position that Rolfe’s comments are sexist, we cannot trust these outlets when they tell us that general criticism of Ghosbusters 2016 is sexist. When the goal post is ‘you don’t want to see the movie therefore you’re sexist’, they’ve lost the argument.\n\nBacklashes happen.\n\nWhat thought crime can we blame on this?\n\nMaybe a backlash against something you subjectively don’t see the issue with doesn’t make sense to you. Does Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice deserve to be rated lower than Tommy Wiseau’s The Room on RottenTomatoes? Maybe, maybe not. Why the backlash? Why is The Room rated higher? The hype machine around BvS leading to disappointment, the ‘it’s so bad it’s good’ factor of The Room - there’s a hundred reasons you could conceivably come up with before ever considering bigotry as the reason.\n\nFaraci and the rest of these hacks are bleeding themselves to fucking death on Occam’s Razor. They cannot accept Rolfe’s stated reasons, therefore there has to be more to it, therefore it’s sexism. Is that really the simplest assumption? Or is the simpler assumption that Rolfe just doesn’t like the look of the film, and means what he says when he says ‘it’s a shameless attempt to bank on the name’?\n\nWhere I disagree is that I don’t think this can be entirely ignored, I think it’s important to document what these journalists are doing and show there is dissent, show they only speak for themselves, hold them to what they claim.\n\nSo, one more time - this is my open challenge to any hack journalist that wants to attack the Nerd and claim sexism:\n\nWhat were the actual words that came out of James Rolfe’s mouth that you found to be sexist?\n\nBonus challenge: If you wish to write another ‘Ghostbusters 2016 haters are sexists’ article, instead of making the Nerd your target, make Comic Book Girl 19 your target. They never would, of course. To do that would be to undermine the premise of their argument.\n\nI have a confession to make, at the risk of seeming hyperbolic. These people have bullshitted and engendered such ill-will to such a degree that I do consider them, and the others who push false moral panics, to be my enemy.\n\nI’m armed with truth bullets and sheer force of will, motherfuckers.\n\nIf you have the time and the inclination, if you agree with the message of this article, I’d like you to take a minute to contact these hacks. It is your right to voice your dissent against publicly stated opinions, especially against journalists who are full of shit. Let them know they don’t speak for you. Send them this article, tell them about my challenge, if you wish. The predictable reaction is that they’ll block you, because they are intellectual cowards. It’s fun to watch them retreat into an ever shrinking echo-chamber, and record that they’re doing it for all to see.\n\nI’ve written this as a follow-up to my previous article in which I addressed incredibly personal attacks from the media against James Rolfe.\n\nPastebin link of my research.\n\nUpdate: Devin Faraci stepped down as EiC of BirthMoviesDeath after allegations of sexual assault were made against him.\n\nBitcoin — 1ETpdSkiSeFUBnf4Qy1vQ72yKKpfHtyXma",
  "latent_22293": "Image copyright David Davies/PA\n\nFollowing Lewis Hamilton's historic Formula 1 triumph in Abu Dhabi last weekend, Press Association photographer David Davies reveals in pictures the moment the British-born racer became World Champion for the second time.\n\nI've always enjoyed covering Formula 1. In fact, it's where my interest in photography started. However, for one reason or another, I have never covered a Championship decider. But that all changed in Abu Dhabi last weekend.\n\nI have covered an F1 race at the spectacular desert racetrack before - back in 2009 - so I already knew a little about this great venue. I was obviously keen to get back out there, but also conscious that I had a huge responsibility to capture another possible great British triumph in F1.\n\nIn the end it all turned out perfectly. Lewis became champion and I managed to deliver some nice snaps.\n\nImage copyright David Davies/pa\n\nThe weekend starts on Thursday with the drivers' press conference, which normally features one or two of the main players.\n\nFor obvious reasons this week, both Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg attended and a rather contrived photo of the two shaking hands was set up before the press conference.\n\nThanks to Hamilton straightening his t-shirt, the shot, which appeared in media outlets around the UK, looked to be a rather hesitant Lewis contemplating whether to shake Nico's hand or not. This picture portrayed a tension between the two men which many felt had been underlying all season.\n\nImage copyright David Davies/pa\n\nThis is one of the practice sessions and shows Hamilton heading out of the Mercedes garage. It's a fairly standard pit lane action shot, but a little tricky to get spot on.\n\nShot on a wide angle zoom at about 1/15th of a second, the idea is to give the impression of speed but at the same time keeping the driver's helmet sharp as the focal point of the picture.\n\nWith the pit lane in half shadow, the background bleaches out to give a high contrast effect. I'm very pleased with this.\n\nImage copyright david davies/pa\n\nEach team at the end of the year produces a photograph which includes the entire team's operation from mechanics to chefs.\n\nSurprisingly Mercedes chose Sunday morning for their picture - Championship decider day. This was great for the photographers, as it gave us a chance to get an early picture of Hamilton and Rosberg together and find out the kind of mood they were in.\n\nFrom this side position you get a strong grasp of the body language between the two and the very apparent lack of eye contact.\n\nImage copyright david davies/pa\n\nUp to this point, the start is by far the biggest moment of my day.\n\nThere had been much speculation as to whether there would be some sort of coming together at the first corner or if the third placed Williams might get between the two Mercedes. As it played out, Lewis made the perfect start and was clear into turn one.\n\nIt always makes for a nice picture when all of the cars approach the first corner. Especially when the start-finish bridge is seen in the background - in this case branded with Abu Dhabi putting the picture in situ.\n\nSaying that, Alonso locking his brakes also adds an extra piece of drama to this particular picture.\n\nImage copyright David Davies/pa\n\nAs the race develops Hamilton creates a big lead thanks to great driving and some misfortune for his team mate.\n\nI know I need a picture of him during the intensity of the race and a little track knowledge always helps. I make sure I am positioned to capture a clear shot of Lewis turning into one of the chicanes where each car's front wheel is often a little airborne.\n\nShot on a 500mm telephoto lens I can get right into the cockpit to see the driver fighting the wheel in the desert heat.\n\nImage copyright david davies/pa\n\nThe race is won and Lewis Hamilton is World Champion. As soon as he gets out of his car he heads straight for girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger and his brother Nicholas.\n\nI chose a high vantage point on the photographers' platform to have an overview of the whole area.\n\nAs he jumps into his family's arms, I can see both Nicole's and Nicholas' face either side of his helmet as they hug - a very touching moment.\n\nImage copyright david davies/pa\n\nFrom the exact same spot as the last image I am able to get a clean view of the podium, a must-have for such a historic moment in British sport.\n\nHere I capture Hamilton lifting the winner's trophy, but I also get some shots of his tears during the National Anthem and the post-presentation champagne ritual.\n\nImage copyright david davies/pa\n\nAfter I have wired the podium and parc ferme images back to PA's newsdesk in London, I head down to the front of the garage for the official team celebration picture.\n\nI know this is where it could all go wrong, but thankfully Mercedes organise it beautifully.\n\nA huge scrum of photographers gathers as Lewis poses for the camera, surrounded by his family.\n\nImage copyright david davies/pa\n\nDespite Mercedes' best efforts to organise the photo call, once Lewis is lifted on to his mechanics' shoulders, draped in the union jack, many photographers can't help themselves and an almighty scrum ensues for the best position.\n\nThis sort of shot makes for a great atmospheric picture if you can get it.\n\nDuring moments like this you rarely get any chance to compose your picture or even see what you are taking. In fact at this point I held my camera above my head and pointed the lens in the direction of Hamilton, focusing the picture with my thumb on the back of the camera.\n\nOut of the 100 or so shots that I managed to rattle off, I finished up with about six useable ones. Personally, I think the other cameras add atmosphere to the scene, giving an idea of chaos on the ground, in contrast with the serenity of Lewis sitting aloft as Formula 1 World Champion.",
  "latent_22298": "Buchi Emecheta, the pioneering Nigerian author whose 20 novels mined her experience as a black single mother in Britain to produce work that inspired a generation of black British writers, has died at the age of 72.\n\nThe author, whose work encompassed adult and children’s fiction, as well as plays, passed away in her sleep at her care home in London on Wednesday.\n\nHer friend and publisher Margaret Busby paid tribute to her pioneering fiction, which explored sexual and racial politics in the Britain of the 1960s and 70s. “Given the odds she had to overcome, it was a triumph that she produced the powerful writing for which she will be remembered,” Busby said.\n\nAuthor Aminatta Forna described Emecheta as “one of [Wole] Soyinka’s so-called ‘Renaissance generation,’ those Africans who came of age at the same time as their countries. She and other writers all over the continent had both the challenge and the joy that comes with being first, of writing Africa and Africans into literary existence. They embraced the task.”\n\nBorn in Lagos in 1944, Emecheta moved to England in 1960 with her husband Sylvester Onwordi, to whom she had been engaged from the age of 11. Her 1974 autobiographical novel Second Class Citizen described their unhappy and sometimes violent marriage, which included his burning manuscripts of her work. At the age of 22, Emecheta left her husband and worked to support herself and five children. During this time, she completed a sociology degree at the University of London and contributed a column to the New Statesman about black British life. The columns formed the basis of her 1972 book Into the Ditch.\n\nUntil 1978, she wrote while working as a community worker in Camden, north London, using her experience to inform her fiction. Her third novel, The Bride Price, was the first of many where she focused on the role of women in Nigerian society. Among her most famous works was The Joys of Motherhood, an account of bringing up children in the face of changing values in traditional Igbo communities. In 1976, her first play, A Kind of Marriage, was widely praised when it was screened on BBC TV. Ten years later, she adapted the play into a novel, in the same year in which she published her autobiography Head Above Water.\n\nHer talent was recognised in 1983 when she appeared alongside Salman Rushdie and Martin Amis on the inaugural Granta Best of Young British Novelists list. In 2005, she was made an OBE for services to literature. She published her last novel The New Tribe in 2000 and continued to work as a publisher and writer. However, a stroke in 2010 halted her writing. In her later years, with her son Sylvester, Emecheta ran the publishing house Ogwugwu Afor, which published her work.\n\nBusby said she had recognised in Emecheta’s work the experience of many black women in the UK who did not have the same “stamina and signal determination” to speak out. “When I first happened upon her writing in the early 1970s, I was in no doubt about the importance of making her personal experiences – transmuted into autobiographical literature - known to the British society in which we both found ourselves,” Busby said.\n\nFellow African writers described Emecheta as an inspiration, not just for pioneering a route in to literature for other black women, but for tackling domestic abuse. “Her fictionalised life story showed women that they could survive and succeed through adversity and abuse and stand up for feminism – all without using those actual words,” said Kadija Sesay, friend and publisher of Sable LitMag. She said Emecheta was “a rock for women writers and single mothers in an unnassuming way … Buchi was warm, caring and humorous. We are going to miss her so much.”\n\nBritish-Nigerian novelist Bernardine Evaristo described Emecheta as “an incredibly important” figure in the history of British literature. “The Joys of Motherhood is a scorching portrayal of a woman’s life in pre-independence Nigeria, and should be up there as the female, feminist counterpart to Chinua Achebe’s celebrated and widely taught novel Things Fall Apart,” she said.",

  "latent_22541": "A sexual assault prevention nonprofit is petitioning the White House to rescind Bill Cosby’s Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nPromoting Awareness Victim Empowerment (PAVE) launched a petition Wednesday on the White House’s “We the People” site calling on President Obama to take away Cosby's medal, the highest civilian honor in the country, which was awarded to him by former President George W. Bush in 2002.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"That award is the most prestigious and honorary award that you can achieve and earn,” Barbara Bowman, a PAVE ambassador, told ITK in an interview. “The fact that [Cosby] would have an award like that, with other honorable people that have earned it and deserve to keep that award, is beyond comprehension. Especially since he received it deceptively, knowing full well what he was doing.”\n\nIn 2005 court filings were made public Monday, Cosby admitted he gave quaaludes, a sedative drug, to women with whom he wanted to have sex.\n\nMultiple women have accused “The Cosby Show” star of sexual misconduct over the years. Cosby, 77, has repeatedly denied the allegations and has never gone to court over any of them.\n\n“We urge President Obama to take the unprecedented action of revoking this award,” PAVE’s petition states.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday he hadn't seen the petition and \"hasn't heard any discussion of taking that step\" regarding Cosby.\n\n\"As a general matter, this administration has been focused on countering sexual assault and doing so in a variety of settings,” Earnest said, citing efforts to stamp out sexual assault in the military and on college campuses.\n\nStressing that sexual assault is an issue Obama \"feels strongly about,\" Earnest said he wasn't sure if it was legally possible to revoke the Medal of Freedom from Cosby.\n\nITK exclusively reported in November, when the accusations against Cosby first resurfaced, that the veteran entertainer was “unlikely” to have his Medal of Freedom revoked, according to a former White House aide.\n\n“I don’t think it’s ever happened, and it’s probably unlikely to happen, but there’s no precedent for it,” Aram Bakshian, who was responsible for the in-house selection process for Medal of Freedom recipients during the Reagan administration, told us at the time. Other recipients of the Medal of Freedom include Meryl Streep, Helen Hayes, Elie Wiesel, Yo-Yo Ma and Sidney Poitier, among many others.\n\n“The analogous thing is, although it should be given to people of high moral character, it’s awarded for aspects of their work or contributions,” Bakshian said. “Similarly, you would almost have to prove that their work or contribution — that it wasn’t Cosby on his TV series — that you could have a technical reason for rescinding it.”\n\n— Jordan Fabian contributed to this report.",
  "latent_22654": "For posterity, I’ve saved my review from 2017 as a postscript below.\n\nTLDR: Xaviant continues to struggle in all the usual departments: player relations, communication, development, and marketing. In the grand scheme of things, the Origins version of the game is actually pretty good, but it’s difficult for me to justify flipping my review to positive when matches in this now free-to-play game are made up of 80% bots. It feels like we need a miracle to save The Culling. Realistically? I give it no more than 4 months on life support before the devs move on.\n\nIf you read my old review then you know I was critical of Xaviant specifically for not being communicative enough during the beta. So when they announced that, for Origins, they would place a special emphasis on opening a dialogue with the players it was like music to my ears. And for the most part, this new, conciliatory Xaviant has been an improvement, but it hasn’t been perfect. Now the dev team is getting quieter and they’re slumping back into business as usual as we watch The Culling slowly bleed players. I’m not the only veteran who is starting to feel anxious over the future of the game.\n\nTo fill you in, during the initial development of Origins, Xaviant was throwing a lot of bones for players to chew on that included weekly surveys and video diaries a la Jeff Kaplan. It felt good to be part of the development process and you could feel the energy that had returned to the community. Transparency definitely helped during the transition and Xav has, so far, avoided surprising players with any broadly unpopular changes.\n\nBut for all this effort, I have to say it’s not quite turning out to be the relationship I imagined would be necessary to save this game. Players can fill in surveys but have no say in what the survey topics actually are and the results aren’t public. What’s more, Xaviant rarely responds in discussion threads and they post diaries that are narrowly focused and are coming out at an ever waning rate. The team is already starting to feel very remote.\n\nTo their credit, the first update wasn’t bad, but it came entirely by surprise and the balance solutions don’t appear to have come from the community whatsoever, and to that extent they’ve been inadequate. In other words, Xav is already behaving a lot like they did two years ago; they correctly identify the biggest problems, but when it comes to actual solutions, the player feedback is getting lost in the mail.\n\nBy far the biggest obstacle is the lack of players. Xav just can’t seem to get people to play this game, and they appear to have no idea what to do about this as evidenced by the fact that they dubiously sponsored a $25,000 Twitch streamer invitational that accomplished absolutely nothing. I sympathise more with the marketing department than with the designers, because whereas I feel like I could personally come up with a plan to balance the entire game in 2 hours, I too have no idea how to get people to actually log in. Let’s hope they figure something out soon, because the roadmap is preparing for expanded duos matches and squads mode that will place an even higher demand for average daily players. In the meantime, vets can only puzzle over why Xaviant is catering to the playerbase it doesn’t have rather than the one it does.\n\nAs a kind of noncommittal sell, I will promise to returning players that they should at least feel comfortable in this version; it’s one of the better iterations we’ve seen to date, and it will likely not change much at a fundamental level since Xaviant has become very timid and focused on content. But the problems that do exist will frustrate you and it’s looking like it will be the all-too-familiar uphill battle for vets who want good updates.\n\nOctober 6th, 2017 Review\n\nThere’s no denying it, The Culling has been one the best games I’ve ever played and there are droves who would agree with that sentiment. Xaviant has successfully captured the feel of a zany yet bloody game show, and The Culling offers as much uproarious and wicked fun as it does blood pumping and hair raising intensity. Even in a saturated market, there really aren’t any other games out there that promise as rich a package as does The Culling, and that fact makes it something truly special.\n\nSo I am pressured to give The Culling a positive review because to do otherwise after it gave me 1400 hours of high quality entertainment makes me look like a bitter fraud, but prospective players who owe nothing to nostalgia would not be justly served by that endorsement. The answer to the plain question: Is it worth $24.99 in its current state? Sadly, is a “no.” I paid $14.99 at open alpha release and believe that that’s still the right price. But even if the game went on sale tomorrow, there’s simply too high of a risk that the game will soon die. Any potential buyer should know that through the final stage of the beta, The Culling maintained so few players that queues wouldn’t even fill to start more than handful of games in NA over the course of several weeks, and full 16 player matches seem to be a thing of the distant past even in EU where the population has also waned to within an inch of its life.\n\nAs to the future, Xaviant has reported that they will continue updating the game, but this is about as promising as offering a lifetime supply of tampons to a troop of boy scouts. The dev team’s idea of a major update appears to be largely cosmetic, while bugs and balance problems that have plagued the game for months (and in some cases over a year) remain entirely unaddressed. The prevailing theory is that the staff doesn’t even have any engineers left that can adequately optimize the game, and if they do, then one has to assume that the leadership has completely derailed.\n\nOne warning to anyone who plans to read other reviews: The common complaint that Xaviant “doesn’t listen to player feedback” is demonstrably false and the team deserves that much to be known. That trope grew out of a vituperative campaign to which many community members have fallen prey due to lack of a better understanding of the situation and justified general frustration. The dev team has proven that they do listen to feedback; they just never seem to know what to do with it.\n\nThe real issue at Xaviant is their lack of reciprocal communication, misguided priorities, and woeful execution of what would otherwise have been reasonable ideas - lack of communication being the most inexcusable of the three, since had they not maintained a policy of silence about their patches as they developed them, they would have had more than enough feedback from the player base that, if taken, would have at least steered any patch away from total disaster. Instead, many players feel that after waiting patiently for updates, they were forced, time and again, to swallow unsolicited changes littered with bugs and without any word about why the most important issues could not be resolved.\n\nThe 2016 alpha will forever be revered, and in fairness, the current version isn’t so much worse than the darling release that charmed so many of us a year and half ago despite the rocky road we traveled to get here. But The Culling proves just how difficult it is to revitalize a community once it has bitterly departed. As of my writing this, on the day after full release, Xaviant has just closed down the official discord server and retreated at long last into total darkness. What players still remain stand at a gloomy precipice and are left wondering not what the future of The Culling may hold but what it could have been.\n\nFor posterity, I’ve saved my review from 2017 as a postscript below. TLDR: Xaviant continues to struggle in all the usual departments: player relations, communication, development, and marketing. In the grand scheme of things, the Origins version of the game is actually pretty good, but it’s difficult for me to justify flipping my review to positive when matches in this now free-to-play game are made up of 80% bots.

In other words, Xav is already behaving a lot like they did two years ago; they correctly identify the biggest problems, but when it comes to actual solutions, the player feedback is getting lost in the mail. By far the biggest obstacle is the lack of players. Xav just can’t seem to get people to play this game, and they appear to have no idea what to do about this as evidenced by the fact that they dubiously sponsored a $25,000 Twitch streamer invitational that accomplished absolutely nothing. I sympathise more with the marketing department than with the designers, because whereas I feel like I could personally come up with a plan to balance the entire game in 2 hours, I too have no idea how to get people to actually log in. Let’s hope they figure something out soon, because the roadmap is preparing for expanded duos matches and squads mode that will place an even higher demand for average daily players. In the meantime, vets can only puzzle over why Xaviant is catering to the playerbase it doesn’t have rather than the one it does. As a kind of noncommittal sell, I will promise to returning players that they should at least feel comfortable in this version; it’s one of the better iterations we’ve seen to date, and it will likely not change much at a fundamental level since Xaviant has become very timid and focused on content. But the problems that do exist will frustrate you and it’s looking like it will be the all-too-familiar uphill battle for vets who want good updates. October 6th, 2017 Review There’s no denying it, The Culling has been one the best games I’ve ever played and there are droves who would agree with that sentiment. Xaviant has successfully captured the feel of a zany yet bloody game show, and The Culling offers as much uproarious and wicked fun as it does blood pumping and hair raising intensity. Even in a saturated market, there really aren’t any other games out there that promise as rich a package as does The Culling, and that fact makes it something truly special. So I am pressured to give The Culling a positive review because to do otherwise after it gave me 1400 hours of high quality entertainment makes me look like a bitter fraud, but prospective players who owe nothing to nostalgia would not be justly served by that endorsement. The answer to the plain question: Is it worth $24.99 in its current state? Sadly, is a “no.” I paid $14.99 at open alpha release and believe that that’s still the right price. But even if the game went on sale tomorrow, there’s simply too high of a risk that the game will soon die. Any potential buyer should know that through the final stage of the beta, The Culling maintained so few players that queues wouldn’t even fill to start more than handful of games in NA over the course of several weeks, and full 16 player matches seem to be a thing of the distant past even in EU where the population has also waned to within an inch of its life. As to the future, Xaviant has reported that they will continue updating the game, but this is about as promising as offering a lifetime supply of tampons to a troop of boy scouts. The dev team’s idea of a major update appears to be largely cosmetic, while bugs and balance problems that have plagued the game for months (and in some cases over a year) remain entirely unaddressed. The prevailing theory is that the staff doesn’t even have any engineers left that can adequately optimize the game, and if they do, then one has to assume that the leadership has completely derailed. One warning to anyone who plans to read other reviews: The common complaint that Xaviant “doesn’t listen to player feedback” is demonstrably false and the team deserves that much to be known. That trope grew out of a vituperative campaign to which many community members have fallen prey due to lack of a better understanding of the situation and justified general frustration. The dev team has proven that they do listen to feedback; they just never seem to know what to do with it. The real issue at Xaviant is their lack of reciprocal communication, misguided priorities, and woeful execution of what would otherwise have been reasonable ideas - lack of communication being the most inexcusable of the three, since had they not maintained a policy of silence about their patches as they developed them, they would have had more than enough feedback from the player base that, if taken, would have at least steered any patch away from total disaster. Instead, many players feel that after waiting patiently for updates, they were forced, time and again, to swallow unsolicited changes littered with bugs and without any word about why the most important issues could not be resolved. The 2016 alpha will forever be revered, and in fairness, the current version isn’t so much worse than the darling release that charmed so many of us a year and half ago despite the rocky road we traveled to get here. But The Culling proves just how difficult it is to revitalize a community once it has bitterly departed. As of my writing this, on the day after full release, Xaviant has just closed down the official discord server and retreated at long last into total darkness. What players still remain stand at a gloomy precipice and are left wondering not what the future of The Culling may hold but what it could have been.

  "latent_22872": "It is now possible to map the activity of nearly all the neurons in a vertebrate brain at cellular resolution in just over a second. What does this mean for neuroscience research and projects like the Brain Activity Map proposal?\n\nIn an Article that just went live in Nature Methods, Misha Ahrens and Philipp Keller from HHMI’s Janelia Farm Research Campus used high-speed light sheet microscopy to image the activity of 80% of the neurons in the brain of a fish larva at speeds of a whole brain every 1.3 seconds. This represents—to our knowledge—the first technology that achieves whole brain imaging of a vertebrate brain at cellular resolution with speeds that approximate neural activity patterns and behavior.\n\nInterestingly, the paper comes out at a time when much is being discussed and written about mapping brain activity at the cellular level. This is one of the main proposals of the Brain Activity Map—a project that is being discussed at the White House and could be NIH’s next ‘big science’ project for the next 10-15 years. [Just for clarity, the authors of this work are not formally associated with the BAM proposal].\n\nThe details of BAM’s exact goals and a clear roadmap and timeline to achieve them have yet to be presented, but from what its proponents have described in a recent Science paper the main aspiration of the project is to improve our understanding of how whole neuronal circuits work at the cellular level. The project seeks to monitor the activity of whole circuits as well as manipulate them to study their functional role. To reach these goals, first and foremost one must have technology capable of measuring the activity of individual neurons throughout the entire brain in a way that can discriminate individual circuits. The most obvious way to do this is by imaging the activity as it is occurring.\n\nWith improvements in the speed and resolution of existing microscopy setups and in the probes for monitoring activity, exhaustive imaging of neuronal function across a small transparent organism was bound to be possible—as this study has now shown.\n\nThe study has also made interesting discoveries. The authors saw correlated activity patterns measured at the cellular level that spanned large areas of the brain—pointing to the existence of broadly distributed functional circuits. The next steps will be to determine the causal role that these circuits play in behavior—something that will require improvements in the methods for 3D optogenetics. Obtaining the detailed anatomical map of these circuits will also be key to understand the brain’s organization at its deepest level.\n\nThese are some of the types of experiments described in the BAM proposal and they are clearly within reach in the next 10 years–whether through a centralized initiative or through normal lab competition and peer review. While it is expected that in mice, too, functional circuits will span large brain areas, performing these types of experiments in mice will require more methodological imagination. It will not be possible to place a living mouse brain within the microscope system used by Ahrens and Keller to image the zebrafish brain. The mouse brain is significantly bigger, is largely impenetrable to visible light and is surrounded by a skull. Realistically, we may not see methods that enable whole brain activity mapping in mammals at the cellular level for quite a while.\n\nBut there is much worth learning about brain function in smaller organisms such as the zebrafish and drosophila, and microscopy systems such as this will be capable of providing important fundamental insights into brain function that are relevant to our understanding of the human brain.\n\nWhether it will be through BAM or not, the neuroscience community has important challenges to tackle ahead. At Nature Methods, we have been actively involved in supporting technology development in the neurosciences from the very beginning and we look forward with enthusiasm to doing so during this exciting period in neuroscience research.\n\nUpdate: We just published an Editorial on this topic in our May issue.",
  "latent_22915": "Ruth Fremson/The New York Times\n\nWhen he left physics, John Breit had the choice of a job in naval intelligence or on Wall Street. “My wife said I couldn’t be a spy. She hates capitalism, but said to go to Wall Street,” he told me recently. “And then I ended up running a spy network.”\n\nCalvin Trillin once attributed the financial collapse to the influx of smart people on Wall Street. The physicists, computer scientists and mathematicians displaced the slow-thinking country club types. With their incomprehensibly complex models, the smart guys’ hubris brought our economy low.\n\nMr. Breit was part of that initial incursion. A Ph.D. in physics from Columbia, he was doing postdoctoral work when he realized that he could never be as good as his contemporary Edward Witten, who went on to pioneer string theory.\n\nSo in 1986, he joined Wall Street, moving not to the trading floor, like many of his fellow rocket scientists, but into risk management. In 1990, he took his skills to Merrill Lynch, rising to become the firm’s head of market risk oversight. The physicist came to understand the limits of mathematical models. He learned that his job was really psychologist, confessor and detective. He became the financial version of a counterintelligence officer, searching for the missed clues and hidden dangers in the firm’s trading strategies.\n\nMr. Breit is retired now, studying ancient Greek in his spare time and volunteering as an adviser for New York’s pension funds. He comes across as George Smiley if he were a Southerner — gracious, reluctant to talk about himself, with iconoclastic opinions just below the surface. I’ve been talking to him periodically over the years about how giant financial institutions should manage the aggressive traders slinging giant sums around the world in ever more complex transactions.\n\nAfter the Senate issued a report last month on JPMorgan Chase’s multibillion-dollar London whale trading loss, an incident where the mathematical modeling went seriously wrong, I reached out to him again.\n\nThat debacle encapsulates much of what is wrong about how banks manage their risk and how the regulators oversee those efforts. At JPMorgan Chase, the risk models hid — and were used to hide — risks from the traders and top executives. Too many measures and too many numbers undid the risk managers. But ultimately, they failed because of human frailties; the risk managers lost sight of their mission and tried to protect the traders and their trades. As in all spy debacles, the counterintelligence officers got co-opted.\n\nEarly in his career, Mr. Breit figured out that models for markets aren’t like those for physics. They don’t come from nature. It was necessary to know the math, if only so that he couldn’t be intimidated by the quantitative analysts.\n\nBut the numbers more often disguise risk than reveal it. “I went down the statistical path,” he said. He built one of the first value-at-risk models, or VaR, a mathematical formula that is supposed to distill how much risk a firm is running at any given point.\n\nThe only thing from capital markets math he came to embrace was this immutable law of nature: investors make money by taking risk. “If it’s profitable and seems riskless, it’s a business you don’t understand,” he told me.\n\nInstead of fixating on models, risk managers need to develop what spies call humint — human intelligence from flesh and blood sources. They need to build networks of people who will trust them enough to report when things seem off, before they become spectacular problems. Mr. Breit, who attributes this approach to his mentor, Daniel Napoli, the former head of risk at Merrill Lynch, took people out drinking to get them to open up. He cultivated junior accountants.\n\n“They see things first,” he said. “Almost every trading debacle was sitting on some accountant’s desk.”\n\nAll the while, he was on the lookout for bad trades. Most traders who get into trouble, he thinks, aren’t bad guys. The bad ones, who try to cover up improper trades, are relatively easy to detect. The real threat, he said, comes from the “crazy ones” who really believe they’ve found ways to spin flax into gold. They can blow up a firm with the best of intentions.\n\nThey don’t do it suddenly. “I hate the whole Black Swan concept,” he said, referring to the notion, popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, that the true risks lie in unforeseeable events that occur with much more frequency than the mathematical models suggest. “It takes years of concerted effort to lose a lot.”\n\nYes, a big market move might reveal a fatally flawed trade, but that volatility is not the root cause of an oversize loss.\n\nThe problem, as Mr. Breit sees it, is that this has nothing to do with how risk management is practiced today, or what the regulators encourage. Regulators have reduced risk managers to box checkers, making sure they take every measure of risk and report it dutifully on extensive forms. “It just consumes more and more staff, turning them into accountants and rotting brains.”\n\nTake VaR. In Mr. Breit’s view, Wall Street firms, encouraged by regulators, are on a fool’s mission to enhance their models to more reliably detect risky trades. Mr. Breit finds VaR, a commonly used measure, useful only as a contrary indicator. If VaR isn’t flashing a warning signal for a profitable trade, that may well mean there is a hidden bomb.\n\nHe despises the concept of “risk-weighted assets,” where banks put up capital based on the perceived riskiness of the assets. Inevitably, he argues, banks will “pile into” the same types of supposedly safe investments, creating bubbles that make the risks far more severe than the initial perceptions. Paradoxically, risk-weighting can leave banks setting aside the least capital to cover the biggest dangers.\n\n“I could not be more disappointed,” he said. “The cynic in me thinks this is all in the interests of senior management and regulators to avoid blame. They may not think they can prevent the next crisis, but they then can blame the statistics.”\n\nInstead, Mr. Breit says he believes that regulators should encourage firms when they reach different conclusions on what is risky and what is safe. That creates a diverse ecosystem, more resilient to any one pestilence.\n\nAnd the regulators should empower risk managers by finding out how many times they meet with chief executives and what they have recently vetoed, and by judging whether the traders respect them. “It’s all completely unquantifiable and vague,” he said, adding that a risk manager should be divorced from the profit and loss statement, the one “who throws sand in the gears.”\n\nMr. Breit’s sand-throwing days are over now. Undermined during the credit boom, as the firm’s head, E. Stanley O’Neal, became isolated and paranoid, he resigned his position in 2005 (but stayed at the firm). By the summer of 2007, he realized that something was terribly wrong with Merrill Lynch’s subprime mortgage exposure. He began calling in favors to find out what was going on and became alarmed. Eventually, Mr. O’Neal called him in, seemingly thinking that Mr. Breit was still his risk manager. It was too late to save the firm from billions in losses.\n\nWhen he resigned his position at Merrill Lynch, did a board member or regulator call him to ask why?\n\n“Not a one,” he told me. Government overseers need to develop human sources, too.",

  "latent_23178": "CLOSE Worries about a leaking landfill next to the Whispering Hills Golf Course on Indy's southeast side and the mounting costs to clean it up have become a costly headache for the city and its taxpayers. Here's why. (Dwight Adams/IndyStar Wochit\n\nBuy Photo A pool of water stands on a cart path Sept. 22, 2016, at the Whispering Hills Golf Course driving range, site of a portion of the former Julietta Landfill on the southeastside side of Indianapolis. (Photo: Michelle Pemberton/Indy Star)Buy Photo\n\nFor decades, the concoction of trash, industrial chemicals and sewage sludge buried near the Whispering Hills Golf Course was out of sight, out of mind — and, as far as Indiana environmental regulators were concerned, contained.\n\nThat is, until recently. In April 2014, an Indiana Department of Environmental Management site inspection discovered the landfill cap had eroded due to natural wear and tear, compromising a critical barrier designed to prevent the toxins from escaping.\n\nNow, Indy Parks may have to pony up as much as $6 million to install new protections for the contamination at the old Julietta Landfill, a longtime industrial dumpsite on the southeast side that the city converted into the public golf course in the early 1990s.\n\nOfficials say testing since 2014 has found no imminent threat to public health. But a nearby neighborhood group says residents are concerned, nonetheless, about what a leaking landfill could mean for them.\n\nFor taxpayers, the episode raises another question: How did the parks and recreation department, of all things, get saddled with cleaning up the sins of private industry from decades earlier?\n\nThe accidental landfill\n\nSpanning 70 acres on the southeast corner of Brookville and Senour roads, the Julietta Landfill became a dumpsite almost by accident.\n\nA former pig farm, the property was leased in the 1950s to a sand and gravel company. The mining operation left huge pits in the ground when it abandoned the site in the early 1960s, and residents began dumping their household waste there illegally, according to IDEM records.\n\nLater that decade, it was leased to a private landfill operator, and served as a dump for commercial and industrial waste until 1976, when the Indiana State Board of Health determined the site’s geology was unsuitable for use as a landfill, and the private operator voluntarily closed it. By that time it had accumulated 2.6 million cubic yards of waste, including industrial chemicals, such as glue and oil.\n\nLater, from 1982 to 1985, the city used it to store more than 16,000 tons of sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant — the solid, fertilizer-like substance left over from the sewage treatment process.\n\nAnd as early as 1988, the city began trying to repurpose it as a golf course.\n\nIt's not clear now, from a review of IDEM documents, why the plans went forward. But IDEM regulators warned a city consultant in 1988 that the pollution at the site was so extensive that it was under consideration to be added to the National Priorities List, an Environmental Protection Agency designation that makes it eligible for federal Superfund cleanup dollars.\n\nIn 1995 — with a landfill cap and various monitoring protocols in place — Whispering Hills Golf Course opened to the public. But under state law, the parks department, as the landowner, also took on the long-term responsibility to keep what was buried there from getting out.\n\nCosts mounting\n\nThe golf course itself is across Senour Road from the landfill, but the driving range sits at the northern end of where the refuse was buried. It is surrounded by things that ideally wouldn't border a polluted site. To the east there's a recreational fishing lake. To the west lies the Whispering Pines subdivision. Creeks crisscross the site.\n\nThat's what worries Jennifer Selm.\n\n\"Just the idea of what is leeching into Buck Creek,\" said Selm, the president of the Greater Troy Neighborhood Association, \"it’s kind of disturbing.\"\n\nWhile recent tests of water wells have come back clear, a review of IDEM records shows that hasn't always been the case. In 2009, IDEM issued a boil-water notice for a water well on the golf course, which was city-owned but privately run. In 2010 and 2011, IDEM issued additional violations for failing to conduct required testing. IndyStar could find no record of violations since then, and IDEM officials were not immediately available for comment.\n\nWhen a 2014 site investigation found standing water atop the landfill, and evidence that the cap had been damaged, IDEM issued a violation notice to the city, setting off a series of assessments as the city and IDEM put together a plan to fix it. Under state law, whoever owns former landfill property has to maintain it, and monitor contaminants.\n\n\"We have been aggressively pursuing solutions,\" said Don Colvin, a planner at Indy Parks.\n\nAnd the costs are adding up.\n\nThe city has spent nearly $300,000 already. And all told, Parks Director Linda Broadfoot said the project could cost as much as $6 million, spread out over a number of phases.\n\nTo put that $6 million into perspective, that's close to a fifth of the department's entire proposed budget for 2017, money that predominantly goes toward salaries, maintenance and day-to-day operations. It's also $1 million more than the first phase of the overhaul for Tarkington Park on the north side. World Sports Park on the east side cost $5.1 million.\n\nIn short, for a parks department that already lags most of its peers nationwide in funding — and a city that perpetually struggles to fund basic services — it's an expense it could ill afford.\n\nStill, Broadfoot insists the department can cobble together the money.\n\n“Unfortunately, it’s a side effect of owning a lot of land,\" she said. \"Sometimes the land has a history that predates you that has to be dealt with.”\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Brian Eason at (317) 444-6129.

  "latent_23283": "My ice cream life was varied and disparate when I was a wain. There was the exquisite gelato of family holidays to Italy ( scene of one of my most memorable moments when I brattily declared I didn’t like ice cream to howls of disbelieving laughter), Mr Whippy style cornets with a flake on the side, the mouth puckering but moreish lemon sorbet my mum’s friend Ann made at dinner parties and slices of raspberry ripple from a rectangular carton, often served on the side of fresh raspberries from my granny’s garden but also slipped between two wafers to make a slider.\n\nCue quizzical eyebrow raising from our foodie readers. Well to us Norn Irish (and Scottish) folk, a slider is not a mini burger, it’s an ice cream sandwich, usually from a van or one of those amazing Celtic-Italian ice cream cafes both countries welcomed so happily due to their super sweet tooth. Possible to make at home if you could get your Dale Farm in the right sized block and work quickly, they were more often a treat bought on a seaside trip or at the end of a Sunday out. They came in several souped up versions such as the nougat wafer (dipped in chocolate and nougat and pronounced nugget) or the seemingly sophisticated oyster, but my favourite was the version that had a Flake inside. I could work out how they got the figs in Fig Rolls, but not the Flake inside one of these.\n\nQuite hard to eat in a dignified manner, these required a careful combo of licking, nibbling, turning and eventually biting to make sure you got every drop without it exploding down your front. I imagine it was their trickiness to eat that has led to them seemingly vanishing without a trace these days. I haven’t seen one for years and neither had the other slightly bemused people I canvassed about them. It looked like I was going to have to make my own version. It was a project worthy of one of Kavey’s ice cream challenges!\n\nChocolate is all very well and good but my last two batches had both been chocolatey and I felt I needed some fresher and tangier to hit the spot. One of those perfect lightbulb moments happened and I realised that a stick of poached rhubarb inside the ice cream would make a perfect grown up copy of that childhood classic…\n\nRhubarb Surprise Ice Cream Sandwiches:\n\n4 egg yolks\n\n250ml milk\n\n500ml double cream\n\n100g caster sugar\n\n5 stalks rhubarb\n\npack of rectangular ice cream wafers\n\nI used a silicone tray like this one to make individual blocks of ice cream. All instructions are for this tray, but you could use something else if you prefer.\n\nRoast your rhubarb in the oven at 150℃ for about 20 minutes until soft but still holding its shape firmly. Then set aside the narrower stalks on a plate so you have enough for nine pieces and allow them to drain any juice away. Puree the rest of the rhubarb in the blender.\n\nThen make your ice cream base by heating the milk and sugar together until bubbling but not boiling. Add in the cream. Separate the eggs and beat the yolks in a small bowl. Then add a cupful of the warm cream mixture to the egg yolks and stir. This will temper the yolks so they don’t scramble when you add them to the hot liquid. Then add the egg mix to the warmed milk and cream and cook gently until starting to thicken and coats the back of a spatula. Take off the heat and chill well before churning in your machine.\n\nAbout five minutes before your ice cream machine has done its job, add in the rhubarb puree to flavour your custard base. Make sure your ice cream is still quite soft and malleable and then put a dessertspoonful in the base of each section of your tray. Place the cut piece of roast rhubarb on top and then cover it all with another spoonful of ice cream so there are no gaps. When all are filled, put the tray flat into the freezer to chill completely for several hours so that each little block is nice and firm.\n\nWhen you are ready to eat the ice cream, take the tray out about 5 minutes before and run a blunt knife round the block to loosen it and the block should pop out in one piece. Pop between two rectangular ice cream wafers (I used Askey’s for extra childhood nostalgia) and then get your chops round this awesome ice cream sandwich. The ice cream is super creamy and custardy with a proper tang from the rhubarb shot through it and the whole thing is made amazing by the frozen piece of rhubarb which makes it all taste a bit like a quarter of the eponymous sweeties. I revisited childhood memories and instead of being disappointed, it was even better than remembered…",

Follow him on Twitter at @KJKnodell\n\n• • •\n\nWhat’s blue on top and yellow all over? A U.N. Peacekeeper.\n\n• • •\n\nIt’s an old joke — a reference to the their blue headgear and their supposed cowardice in the face of danger. It’s a criticism that’s not entirely fair. Missions are frequently short on air assets, have shoddy communications gear and lack spare parts for the equipment they do have. Blue berets often struggle to protect themselves, let alone keep the peace or protect civilians. Fair or not, it’s led many to be skeptical of the blue beret.\n\nBut, that doesn’t stop the international community from authorizing missions on the regular. The annual U.N. peacekeeping budget is a little more than $7 billion. The United States is the largest financial backer, paying almost 30 percent. Today, more than 123,000 soldiers and police from 128 countries operate under the blue banner in support of 16 ongoing U.N. peacekeeping operations (“Financing peacekeeping“, United Nations).\n\nVeterans of U.N. peacekeeping missions have long noted problems in the field. Hiccups with communications and logistics are often more than just frustrating – the consequences have been fatal. Today, many members of the peacekeeping community are pushing for reform.\n\nIn 2014 an international panel of security experts and retired military officers, funded by the Danish government, trotted the globe exploring how technology could help U.N. peacekeepers deal with some of the world’s worst conflicts. They talked to everyone from soldiers on the ground in war zones to tech gurus in start-up offices. They wanted to document the sorts of problems peacekeepers face, and figure out what tools they can use to overcome them.\n\nIn February 2015, the panelists published their findings in the form of a 144-page report (PDF). They concluded that peacekeeping missions need to catch up with the information age—and fast. The panel urged the U.N. to train “digital peacekeepers” and arm them with cheap, high-tech devices. That could mean peacekeepers monitoring Twitter for news, carrying smart phones and using apps to help identify unexploded land mines as well as some more far-out ideas like wearing visors streaming real-time information pulled from the Internet. And the panelists want peacekeepers to use drones. Lots of them.\n\nHarsh Realities\n\nBut that future could be a long ways off. The panelists blasted the current state of U.N. peacekeeping. “Missions frequently lack a wide range of the very capabilities now considered by most militaries, law enforcement agencies and international organizations to be minimally necessary to operate effectively,” the report stated (page 3).\n\nIt asserted that the gap between what troops are supposed to have and what they do have is “so pronounced,” that it has discouraged richer countries with the most technological, logistical and financial capabilities from contributing troops or material. Most U.N. peacekeeping missions today depend on troops from developing countries. These armies struggle with logistics. Even the most professional of them often lack airlift capabilities to bring in armored vehicles and adequate equipment by themselves. Perhaps the most serious consequence has been problems with medical evacuations owing to a lack of helicopters and qualified medical personnel. “[W]ith few exceptions, missions struggle to deliver critical urgent care within the ‘golden hour’ — the 60-minute period beginning at the moment of injury that represents an internationally recognized time period within which casualties should receive lifesaving and urgent life sustaining care,” the report warned (page 41).\n\nThough hi-tech gadgets can help peacekeepers, they’re no substitute for helicopters, heavy equipment and fuel. Logistics and resources are at the core of any military endeavor. The report found first and foremost that the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations needs to address basic operational needs.\n\nIronically, the hesitance of rich countries to provide missions with necessary logistical and technological help has led to a cycle in which troops on the ground consistently lack basic equipment and struggle to enforce their mandates. That’s created a perception that peacekeeping missions are doomed to fail and that current troops – mostly from countries in Africa and Asia – lack either the competency or the resolve to do their jobs. “This narrative has […] eroded the political and financial willingness of member states to ensure the peacekeepers in the field can operate at a level at least as sophisticated as any spoiler they may encounter,” the report suggested (page 5). But that hasn’t stopped rich countries from expecting poor countries contribute troops to these missions.\n\nEven so, Peacekeepers in the field have often proved resilient and creative. In South Sudan, a lightly equipped U.N. peacekeeping force with troops drawn mostly from developing countries has saved thousands of lives. It created safe havens for civilians when civil war enveloped the country in December 2013. Blue helmets immediately opened bases for people fleeing both government and rebel death squads. They escorted refugees around the country in re-purposed trucks and buses while keeping tabs on threatened communities. Today, as government and rebel fighters continue skirmishing and accruing arms, blue helmeted troops maintain civilian protection sites scattered around the country with modest resources. However, they could save more lives — and better protect themselves — if they had better tools. The panelists don’t seem to think that providing peacekeepers with modern equipment such a lofty expectation. “Most modern technologies are neither too expensive nor too sophisticated to be within the reach of peacekeepers,” the report asserted (page 5).\n\nDangerous Ground\n\nBombs litter today’s war zones. In modern warfare, terrorists and guerrilla groups who can’t fight an opposing army directly frequently resort to improvised explosives and booby-traps. That doesn’t even include the countless mines and un-exploded ordinance that conventional armies and rebel groups often leave behind over decades of conflict. It’s a common problem — and danger — for U.N. missions. Yet the panel found that missions have routinely sent peacekeepers into heavily mined and booby-trapped territory without proper equipment and training to protect themselves or neutralize explosives. The panelists said that’s unacceptable. “Where IEDs are an identified threat, all convoys should deploy with the minimum ability to self-recover, together with sapper pioneering teams equipped with heavy vehicle extraction capability and organizational level repair and remediation technologies,” the report recommended (page 48).\n\nThe panel suggested that convoys operating in areas known to be heavily laden with explosives should make use of mine-protected armored vehicles, rather than the vulnerable trucks that are regularly make up these convoys. Ugandan troops with the African Union force in Somalia have used mine-protected vehicles to shield themselves from insurgents with relative success. These vehicles debuted during the Rhodesian Bush Wars, developed by South African arms industry. They’re not rare in Africa.\n\nBut armored vehicles can be large, cumbersome and difficult to fly into remote locations. And spare parts can be difficult to track down. Many contingents get around in low cost, easy-to-transport pickup trucks. Peacekeepers have to be very deliberate about how – and when – to deploy heavy equipment. To make up for that the panel also suggested some simple, tech-based ways the peacekeepers can identify and protect themselves from bombs. The report noted that soldiers and police on the ground could use mobile apps to assess threats, in particular the U.N.’s open-source Landmine and Explosive Remnants of War Safety app — available to anyone for free (iOS / Android). The app tells users where known minefields are. It also helps users identify explosives, spot telltale signs of hidden bombs and allows them to report the locations of any explosives they come across directly to the U.N. Mine Action Service.\n\nThe panel singled out peacekeepers in Lebanon for effectively using this and other apps to help them in their mission. The panelists also proposed extensive use of tactical drones to help troops spot danger and scout ahead. “[C]onvoys may be equipped with small tactical UAVs as mobile intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms to survey choke points and hazard areas along the route as needed to enhance overall security,” the report suggested (page 46).\n\nBlue helmets have already started using drones. During one field visit, the panelists interviewed a U.N. police officer that frequently used a miniature drone to assist with investigations. The peacekeeper provided them video of an investigation of a helicopter crash site.\n\nDrones and Surveillance\n\nIn January 2013, the U.N. Security Council authorized the controversial deployment of drones to support peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The drones monitored rebel groups such as the brutal March 23 Movement. It was the world body’s first foray into robotic surveillance. But before the drones even reached the Congo, leaders in the Ivory Coast suggested that the U.N. consider using drones to augment the peacekeeping force in that country.\n\nThe U.N. mission in Ivory Coast reduced its forces in 2013, with more proposed cuts coming this year. The security situation has improved enough for the blue berets to continue a phased withdrawal but drones could help the shrinking force keep watch over its fragile security gains “This would help us to cope better with the difficulty we face in the west of the country and the heavily forested border area with Liberia which is very difficult to monitor and an ideal sanctuary for armed men,” mission spokesperson Sylvie van den Wildenberg told The Guardian. Peacekeepers around the world are definitely interested in using more drones to aid them in monitoring difficult environments.\n\nBut intelligence-gathering is a touchy subject in U.N. circles. Peace missions are supposed to be impartial. If peacekeepers covertly gather information, warring parties could perceive it as meddling. In 1993, U.N. officials in New York admonished Canadian general Roméo Dallaire when U.N. troops in Rwanda planned to raid weapons caches in Kigali discovered through help from an informant. The U.N. ordered Dallaire to stand down. Hutu extremists later used those same caches to commit the Rwandan Genocide and kill several of Dallaire’s troops.\n\nIn a community that already views gathering intelligence with skepticism, introducing drones is a huge leap forward. And there’s another hurdle — drones scare people. Pop culture regularly depicts drones as the embodiment of the surveillance state and the erosion of human rights. But countries and organizations all over the world are already using drones in increasing numbers. And their use isn’t limited purely to fighting terrorists and militants. Mexico recently began using drones to help protect endangered sea animals.\n\n“Enabling a peacekeeping mission to use technology or other advanced means to gather information does not violate the basic principles of peacekeeping impartiality and state sovereignty,” the panel concluded. “[P]eacekeepers do not lose their impartiality simply because they are better aware of what is going on in their mission space.” (page 5).\n\nThe report conceded that drones and other surveillance technology can lead to abuses and would need substantial oversight. But ultimately, the panelists seemed to conclude that drones are here to stay — and that peacekeepers need them. The panel recommended the U.N. authorize the creation of a new kind of operation — called “Special Technical Missions” — specializing in technology and intelligence-gathering. “[The STMs would] enable the Security Council to call on, organize and legitimize the use of technical audio, visual, monitoring and surveillance technologies, ground and airborne sensors and other technical means […] to keep up with events on the ground in rapidly changing circumstances, inform their decision-making, prioritize action and aid in planning,” the report concluded (page 57).\n\nThe panel wants the U.N. to operate more drones. Like, now. “[The U.N. should] make maximum use of UAVs, greater use of smaller, tactical-level assets is required […],” the panelists wrote (pages 57 and 115). “[…] [m]iniature UAVs should be incorporated into standard requirements without delay.” (pages 54,57 and 115). And the report called for tracking devices for vehicles and heavy equipment, so that commanders can monitor their troops’ whereabouts. The devices could help in recovering stolen vehicles and heavy weaponry if rebels or bandits try to make off with them—a problem that has plagued missions around the world. “Real-time safety and security information is not a luxury, but rather, a life-saving necessity,” the panelists concluded (pages 6 and 34).\n\nDigital Future\n\nCommunication is a constant problem for peacekeepers. It’s inevitable—troops come from all over the world and speak different languages. But the panel asserted that the problem peacekeeping troops most commonly report is their dependence on different sets of incompatible radio equipment, even when the U.N. — and not the troops’ own armies — provide the radios. “[This renders] communications between contingents, and even between members of a mixed patrol, difficult,” the report added (page 34). Though the panelists recommended that hi-frequency radio should remain the backbone of operational communications, they suggested peacekeepers make greater use of mobile communications gear connected to the Internet.\n\nThey want U.N. personnel — civilian and military alike — to have greater access to these devices. Regardless of their rank. “A number of mobile applications now exist for individuals to file travel plans, automatically communicate GPS locations on a periodic basis, and alert base stations or headquarters when they are overdue at their destinations,” the report stated (page 27).\n\nThe panel also wants peacekeepers to be social media savvy. Not just for communication, but to keep tabs on local political leaders, combatants and personalities. Warring factions regularly use Twitter and Facebook to make announcements, recruit fighters and spread propaganda. Monitoring social media is a hot-button topic that comes with a lot of concerns about personal privacy, freedom of expression and human rights. But the panel insisted that ignoring social media is a massive mistake, and hardly jeopardizes the peacekeepers’ neutrality. “No partiality is shown to peacekeepers in providing missions with the same access to information that people around the globe can readily and openly access […],” the report asserted (pages 5 and 23).\n\nThe panel also explored more ambitious technological advancements, suggesting individual peacekeepers wear Internet-connected visors that transmit and receive real-time mission updates. But Western military forces that have developed advanced battlefield communications devices have been slow to adopt them. The devices frequently prove expensive, prone to power issues in remote areas and become obsolete before they’re fielded. Adding more devices can make a mission more complex, rather than simplifying it. However, much of what the report suggests isn’t terribly expensive or hard to achieve — if the U.N.’s member states are willing to put a little bit of faith in the soldiers they continually send to the world’s most dangerous war zones.",
  "latent_23700": "Cuomo. | Office of the Governor of New York Power company at center of probe backed Cuomo, sought contract\n\nALBANY — The company that proposed a power plant now at the center of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s probe of the Cuomo administration has received a series of beneficial state approvals in recent years and was a generous donor to Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nCompetitive Power Ventures is now at work on a proposed $1 billion natural gas-fired power plant in Wawayanda, Orange County.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs a result of Bharara’s probe, the administration has cut off contact with CPV, the Daily News has reported. Bharara is examining whether top Cuomo aide Joe Percoco received tens of thousands of dollars from CPV, the Wall Street Journal reported. Todd Howe, a lobbyist close to Cuomo who is also at the center of the investigation, has done work for CPV.\n\nThe CPV Energy Center plant has received a series of approvals from the Cuomo administration over the years. The 650-megawatt plant in Orange County is viewed by the Cuomo administration as a key part of its plan to find replacement power for the Indian Point nuclear center, should Gov. Andrew Cuomo succeed in his effort to get it shut down.\n\nThe state’s action on CPV includes multiple levels of approvals for plant, as well as an approval for upgrades to the Marcy transmission line, which will connect it to the energy grid. The plant will also connect to the Millennium pipeline, which the company has applied for that through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n\nThe approval of the natural gas-fired plant came at a time when the administration was generally attempting to move away from fossil fuel generation and toward renewable energy generation, per its Reforming Energy Vision, which seeks to make the energy grid more reliant on renewable sources and more efficient.\n\nCPV has spent more than $140,000 lobbying the Cuomo administration and lawmakers in recent years, state lobbying disclosures show. CPV, and a host of connected LLCs, also donated at least $80,000 to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Much of that came just before Cuomo took office, and the company was preparing to seek state approvals for its Hudson Valley power plant.\n\nA CPV official did not return a request for comment on Sunday.\n\nBefore the plant was constructed, CPV sought a guaranteed state contract for the purchase of the power it would produce, state records show. That contract was sought through the New York Power Authority, but has not yet been granted.\n\nCPV officials have also recently met behind closed doors with members of the Cuomo administration’s Department of Public Service, including Tom Congdon, chief of staff at DPS, public schedules show.\n\nCPV has 10,000 megawatts of natural gas plants under construction or development around the country and has managed about 10,000 megawatts of power generation.",
  "latent_23723": "During a weekend in late spring, New York shoppers on the prowl for digital playthings unwittingly stumbled into a covert operation on the olfactory frontier. Riding up the escalator to the third floor of the Shops at Columbus Circle, they encountered a scent like that of a young metrosexual primed for a night at Soho House — a unisexy, modern fragrance along the lines of Calvin Klein’s cK One.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt wasn’t emanating from one of the many European tourists cruising the glossy vertical mall or escaping a promotional event at the nearby Aveda store. It was the seductive smell of consumer electronics. Samsung, the Korean electronics giant, was conducting a test of its new signature fragrance in its Samsung Experience concept store. Researchers waylaid shoppers leaving the store to grill them on whether they thought the scent was “stylish,” “innovative,” “cool,” “passionate,” or “cold,” and, more important, whether the scent made them feel like hanging around the shop a little longer. Amit Patel, 22, a pharmacist visiting from the UK, was unimpressed. He hadn’t noticed the smell but had a strong opinion about the company’s priorities. “I think Samsung should stick to what it’s good at: making gadgets,” he said. But Nicole Snoeker, 25, a Dutch tourist, was charmed. “I thought the store had just opened,” she said. “It smelled very fresh and new.” Plus, she volunteered, she probably lingered a bit more than she had intended. “I felt relaxed. It put me in the right mood. That’s important in shops nowadays.” And if the company is concerned about reaching hip, young electronics-savvy consumers, it hit pay dirt with 11-year-old Simon Clarke, a precocious redhead from Connecticut who admitted he was already a gadget hound. “I love the smell of technology,” he said. “It smells stimulating.” Samsung’s bid for the hearts and noses of electronics buffs comes not a moment too soon. Already, across town, the rival SonyStyle store has staged a preemptive strike in the odoriferous battle, with a shop scented with notes of mandarin orange and vanilla. “We wanted to add one extra dimension to differentiate our store from the rest,” says Christine Belich, executive creative director of the SonyStyle stores, noting that the company is particularly interested in attracting female shoppers to its 16 mall locations. The company is also exploring a way to make the store’s Madison Avenue windows radiate the scent, so passersby might be lured inside to sniff out a laptop or new digital camera.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSensory branding, the idea that brands should engage consumers on a variety of touch points, is hardly new. There’s the visual: Consumers now know instantly that a giant yellow arch indicates the proximity of cheeseburgers, or a certain robin’s-egg-blue box signifies a classy token of affection. There’s the auditory: A distinctive ring tone tells surrounding theatergoers that the offender is a customer of Nokia or Motorola. And a startup bong lets nearby latte sippers know whether the writer huddled over the laptop in the corner bought her operating system from Microsoft or Apple. The idea of using a signature scent as a brand identifier has been slower to catch on outside the fashion industry (where certain retailers, such as Victoria’s Secret, have long used fragrance as part of the sensory environment in their stores). But as it becomes ever more difficult to gain consumers’ attention in an increasingly cluttered environment, more and more companies are looking to fragrance to help distinguish their brands from the competition. Heaven — and Nielsen — knows, marketers need the help. With commercials, email, billboards, pop-ups, product placements, and print ads, the clutter problem has grown to epic proportions. A typical adult is now exposed to 294 TV ads alone per day, according to the industry reference book “TV Dimensions 2005.” Fully 83% of all commercial contact is visual — the 30-second spot, the newspaper ad, the screaming LED screen of an electronic billboard, says brand expert Martin Lindstroem, author of Brand Sense: Build Powerful Brands Through Touch, Taste, Smell, Sight, and Sound (Free Press, 2005). Yet an April 2000 CAB/Nielsen study showed a dramatic drop in ad recall as the number of messages soared, estimating that only 10 or 20 will produce a fleeting awareness of the brand. While vision is unquestionably our most powerful sense, when it comes to garnering an emotional response, scent is a much more powerful trigger. “Seventy-five percent of the emotions we generate on a daily basis are affected by smell,” says Lindstroem. “Next to sight, it’s the most important sense we have.” “For a couple thousand years, we haven’t had an environment worth smelling,” one store designer says. “But when we reopen that sense, we open up possibilities.” Until recently, though, smell has been the stepchild of the senses. “Smell is fairly dormant in our culture,” says Ron Pompei, CEO of the design firm Pompei AD. The reason, he says, is that as civilizations moved from the agricultural to the industrial age, we generated a lot of smells that weren’t too savory. Between sewage in the streets and belching factories, “for a couple thousand years, we haven’t had an environment worth smelling,” Pompei says. “But when we reopen that sense, we open up possibilities.” Savvy brand stewards are pouncing on that opening. The scent of Starbucks coffee, for example, is instantly identifiable, even in the midst of a Barnes & Noble bookstore. Fliers on Singapore Airlines relish the scented towels the airline distributes before meals. Borrowing a scented page from its hip young corporate sibling W Hotels, Westin Hotels recently began a test of White Tea, its new signature fragrance, in eight cities around the world. “We think scent is a pretty exciting element of the whole guest experience,” says Sue Brush, senior vice president, Westin Hotels & Resorts. “It’s one of those subliminal things you don’t necessarily advertise, but we hope it can help guests decompress after the rigors of the road.” In developing the scent, Westin rejected florals as too traditional and citrus as too harsh. The fragrance also had to have international appeal. The company’s designer, DB Kim, chose White Tea for its simplicity and its ability to both relax and energize. Westin expects to roll out the fragrance to the entire chain by the fourth quarter, deploying scent in the hotels’ public spaces via a diffusing machine.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCar manufacturers have long recognized the smell of a new car as one of the most powerful tools in their arsenal for cementing a love affair between their brand and a new owner. When Rolls-Royce buyers began complaining in the mid-1990s that the new cars didn’t live up to their predecessors, researchers tracked the problem to its source: the smell. Using a 1965 Silver Cloud as a reference point, the company deconstructed the scent, identifying 800 separate elements. It then recalibrated the aroma and now sprays it under the seats to re-create the scent of a classic “Roller.” Indeed, so alluring is the scent of a new car that manufacturers have bottled it, enabling used-car dealers to spray their inventory with the fragrance to help move jalopies off the lot. But Lexus, which prides itself on the high ranking its vehicles’ interiors invariably receive from consumers, disavows such olfactory ruses. “It’s the natural components of the vehicle that make the Lexus smell,” says Ann Bybee, corporate manager of advertising, brand, and product strategy. Those components include maple, birch, and cowhide leather. “Lexus has a stronger leather smell in our cars than BMW, maybe because they also have those nonleather, leatherette-type vehicles as well,” she sniffs. A few hundred miles from Paris, Napoleon famously sent an urgent missive to Josephine: “Home in three days. Don’t wash.” One needn’t have ridden a Paris subway recently to recognize that scent is a powerful force regardless of nationality. According to the Sense of Smell Institute, the average human being is able to recognize approximately 10,000 different odors. What’s more, people can recall smells with 65% accuracy after a year, while the visual recall of photos sinks to about 50% after only three months. Proust may have had his madeleines, but everyday Americans have equally powerful olfactory memories, says Dr. Alan R. Hirsch, founder and neurological director of the Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation, in Chicago. In one study of 989 people, he found that their favorite childhood smells varied based on when they were born and raised. Subjects born between 1900 and 1930 waxed nostalgic about natural smells — grass, trees, horses, pie. Those born after 1930 were more likely to remember artificial scents from their youth — Play-Doh, Crayola crayons, Keds, SweetTarts. “That suggests that the things people are nostalgic for are now more artificial and brand-related than in the past,” says Hirsch. “If a company can associate a mood state with a smell, it can transfer that happy feeling to the product.” Those who don’t lock in that connection risk being left behind, he warns. But experts say simply slapping a scent on a product won’t assure a brand’s acceptance any more than piping in “Feelings” on the sound system in a department store will make customers buy more socks. For one thing, the scent must match logically with the product and its customers. In other words, infusing pneumatic drills with the scent of lilac probably won’t goose sales among construction workers.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDr. Eric Spangenberg, dean of the college of business and economics at Washington State University, ran a test in a clothing store in the Pacific Northwest to determine how scent affected customers by gender . He diffused a subtle smell of vanilla in the women’s department and rose maroc (a spicy, honeylike fragrance that had tested well with guys) in the men’s. The results were astonishing. When he examined the cash-register tapes, he found that receipts almost doubled on the days when scent was used. However, if he reversed the scents, diffusing vanilla with the men, rose maroc with the women, customers spent less than average. “You can’t just use a pleasant scent and expect it to work,” he says. “It has to be congruent.” Similarly, he says, the fragrance has to make sense with the product or environment it’s supposed to enhance: “When you go into Starbucks, you don’t expect to smell lemon-scented Pledge.” Alex Moskvin, director of BrandEmotions at International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF), spends a lot of time tinkering with variables, attempting to match the right scent to the right brand. He begins by developing a demographic profile of a target customer and by identifying the elements of the brand that consumers find most appealing. Moskvin says he studies the DNA of the brand and its relationship to consumers — even those who have become disaffected — to figure out what resonates olfactorily. “It’s important for companies like ours to understand the emotional communication of the fragrance and to have a point of view on that,” he says. In designing a hotel fragrance, for example, Moskvin would want to know if the chain was positioned as a family-friendly hostelry (think chocolate-chip cookies) or an haute couture, Zen-like retreat (think sandalwood or hinoki). “We want to capture a smell that makes people feel part of the club,” he says. As many global marketers have learned, however, the scent of the club varies depending on where the clubhouse is located. At a seminar in Moscow, for example, Lindstroem polled the audience on their favorite aroma. “Freshly washed clothes, hanging on a line in subzero weather,” they responded enthusiastically. Hispanics, experts say, are partial to vanilla. The Japanese like apple. And to add to the complexity, much as in the fashion industry, fragrances follow trends. Indeed, says Ted Kesten, CEO of the international fragrance house Belmay, food-related scents — chocolate, vanilla, pecan pie — are the new black this year, at least in the United States. But that may not hold true in Barcelona or Bangkok. Five years ago, for example, fruit scents were popular in the States, but not in Europe. “Global brands are very tricky,” he says. “When you’re launching an international scent, you try to stay away from the love-hate extremes and find something in the middle with wide acceptance.” In 1994, Dr. Hirsch gave a paper on the effect of scent on consumer spending to a group at the Bally Hotel in Las Vegas. At the end of his talk, an audience member stood up and challenged him. “Hirsch,” he said, “the odors aren’t affecting consumers; they’re affecting the salesmen, who are being more friendly.” Hirsch was stumped. It was a variable he hadn’t considered. Walking back to his room, he passed a bank of slot machines, and three cherries rang up in his brain: What if he designed an experiment using aroma and one-armed bandits — a totally salesperson-free control group!\n\nadvertisement\n\nSo he set up a scent-free control area, and another with a faint, pleasant scent. Then he stood back and let the low rollers ante up. Afterward, he compared the test sample’s receipts with the weekend before the study and the weekend after. In the control area, there was about a 3% uptick in bets, defining the study’s margin of error. But in the scented area, receipts were up 45%. When the study was replicated using a higher level of odorant, there was a 53% increase. The study was reported in the journal Psychology & Marketing. Since then, Hirsch says, most casinos use some form of scent, although all will deny it. Despite instant comparisons to the famous subliminal advertising ploys first discussed by Vance Packard in The Hidden Persuaders, Hirsch claims to be unconcerned by the ethical implications of this sensory manipulation. For one thing, he says, the scents have to be used in high enough concentrations to be noticeable, so they can’t be secret. “When you use lower odors, it’s less effective than when you use higher odors,” he says. “So why would people bother using subliminal smells when higher odors have greater efficacy?” (Other researchers have warned that cranking up a scent too high, however, can be a turn-off.) And many marketers would argue that adding a pleasant scent to a product or a retail environment is no more coercive than installing marble fixtures or flattering lighting. When H.H. Gregg, an appliance retailer in the southeast, planned to refurbish some of its stores, it researched layout, color, and lighting, as well as scent, to create a more congenial shopping experience. The faint smell of home cooking — apple pie, sugar cookies — has helped boost sales 33% in the remodeled stores. “We’re not treating this like a head shop, where you’ve got incense all over,” says Jim Newell, director of marketing. “It’s subtle. You don’t want people to go, ‘Whoa! Pie!’ That would put them off a little bit.” Business is booming at ScentAir Technologies Inc., a Charlotte, North Carolina- based company that manufactures the device that delivers the stores’ aromas, says CEO David Van Epps. “I used to have to knock on a lot of doors to get somebody to take a meeting,” he says. “Now I’m hearing from some of the biggest names in retailing, fashion, and packaged goods.” Moving beyond the realtor’s homespun advice to stick cookies in the oven before an open house, Van Epps’s company now has a whole division focused on the real-estate market, an industry that he says is, well, salivating for his product. “Who has time to make a pie every time you want to sell a house?” he asks. Van Epps predicts his company’s business will easily quadruple in the next two to three years. “Scent is extremely powerful and dangerous if used wrong,” a branding expert says. “I’ve wanted to have a dialogue on the implications of this, but nobody’s talking.” Still, Lindstroem, who has been barnstorming the globe with his sensory-branding seminars, expresses a nagging sense of unease as companies flock to this latest branding trend. “Scent is extremely powerful and dangerous if used wrong,” he says. “So far, we’re not advanced enough to use it that way, but I’ve wanted to have a dialogue on the implications of this, and nobody’s talking.” There is, for example, a portion of the population that is allergic to scent. “They can be quite militant,” says Spangenberg. “It can get ugly.” In addition, fragrance has the ability to elicit unconscious responses that marketers may not intend. The hype surrounding scent is “out ahead of the science,” he warns. “We don’t know enough about it.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nTwo miles from the Magic Kingdom, in the Disney-designed town of Celebration, Sally Grady is on a mission to make having medical tests as fun as a day at the beach. Looking at a disturbing cancellation rate among patients facing an MRI, Grady, who’s director of imaging services at Florida Hospital’s Seaside Imaging Center here, resolved to address the problem by designing an exam space that would be so cheerful and welcoming that patients would decide to stick around. “We created an entire virtual beach environment in this area,” she says. The unit’s flooring is like a boardwalk; changing rooms look like cabanas; patients change not into backless nighties, but into surfer shorts and tops; barium is served, straight up, in a turquoise glass with an umbrella; the MRI unit is disguised as a sand castle; and a sound machine plays tapes of waves and birds. Several ScentAir machines diffuse the smell of the ocean in one room, and the scent of coconut oil in another. The fragrance of vanilla infuses the MRI room, since the scent reportedly helps people feel less claustrophobic. “We know this isn’t an amusement park. We’re here for something serious,” says Grady. “But you can almost see a patient start to relax when they start hearing the music and the waves and you hand them a pair of flip-flops. An amazing number say, ‘This doesn’t smell like a hospital.’ ” The results have been dramatic. In 2000, when the facility opened, 6% of patients needed sedation, upping the expense of the procedure. By last year, the sedation rate had dropped to 2%. What’s more, the cancellation rate for the test dropped 50%. And the time spent coaxing people to submit to the exam has also fallen dramatically. Seaside is now touting its beach-themed facility in its marketing materials and getting queries from other health-care outfits seeking to replicate its success. Grady has already rolled out a similar environment at Florida Hospital’s Kissimmee facility. For Grady, whose own teenage daughter needed MRI services last year, it’s less about cost savings than about patient care. And if coconut oil and vanilla can help alleviate the stress of a frightening exam, then, she says, bring it on. “If you see how intimidating it is for kids to face this test, you know you’ve got to have this environment,” she says. “Once I get them in the door, I’ve captured them.”",
  "latent_23788": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Islamic State’s execution of a captured Jordanian pilot by burning him alive has backfired on the militant group by galvanizing the U.S.-led coalition that is fighting it in Syria and Iraq, a senior U.S. official said on Sunday.\n\nStudents hold pictures of Islamic State captive Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasaesbeh during a rally calling for his release, at Jordan University in Amman February 3, 2015.

Even clerics sympathetic to the jihadist cause said the act of burning a man alive and filming the killing would damage Islamic State.\n\nAllen is in Jordan to meet with King Abdullah and other officials on the fight against the militant group, which has captured large parts of Syria and Iraq.\n\nJordan’s foreign minister, Nasser Judeh, said Islamic State is “on the run” after coalition air strikes.\n\n“They’re not gone yet, but certainly - I mean the sustained air campaign of the last few months has degraded their capabilities on the ground,” he told ABC.\n\nBut Arab leaders, attending a security conference in Munich, bemoaned what they called a lack of strategy and weapons in the fight against Islamist militants like Islamic State.\n\nThe Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, Michael McCaul, said Islamic State militants pose a growing threat to the United States and the video of the pilot’s death could strengthen recruitment of radicalized Muslims in Western countries.\n\nMcCaul told CBS’s “Face the Nation” program that hundreds of Americans were among the estimated 5,000 Islamic State fighters with Western passports, and some had returned.\n\nBut Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told CNN’s “State of the Union” program that law enforcement does a “pretty good job” of tracking people in the United States who have had contact with Islamic State, citing recent arrests of people accused of providing material support to militants or who had attempted to travel to Syria.",

  "latent_23909": "CLOSE The Defense Department's budget will increase $574 billion. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook\n\nAn employee sorts food at the Reaching Out Community Services food pantry in Brooklyn on May 15, 2017 in New York City. The popular Brooklyn food pantry feeds over 4,000 New Yorkers per month while offering a host of other services for those in need. Agencies throughout the nation that feed, shelter and care for the needy are increasingly nervous about proposed cuts to their programs if President Donald Trump's budget passes. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON – The Trump administration will formally send its first budget plan to Congress on Tuesday morning, relying heavily on an Obamacare reform plan that is far from certain and deep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps — two programs that benefit lower-income families — to pay for increases in military spending, border security and controversial school choice efforts.\n\nWhite House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney briefed reporters Monday on parts of the $4.1-trillion proposal for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. It still appears to include the elimination of $300 million a year for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative — a program that pays for water quality and wildlife habitat projects — first reported by the Free Press some months ago.\n\nMany of the details were still secret, pending release of the budget Tuesday morning by the White House and follow-up reports from federal agencies. But speaking to reporters, Mulvaney said extra care was taken to look at “the impact of government spending on people who pay the taxes in the first place,” rather than focusing more on people potentially aided by government programs.\n\nUsing as an example a program intended to help students get advanced degrees that he said has not lived up to expectations, Mulvaney said it — like others throughout government — was being eliminated, adding, “We can’t do that anymore.” He also touted a proposal to require a Social Security number for anyone receiving refundable child care credits, denying them to undocumented immigrants who may pay taxes if they have children who were born in this country and are U.S. citizens.\n\nCopies of the FY2018 budget come off the production run at the Government Publishing Office in Washington, DC, USA, 19 May 2017. The Trump administration is expected to release the budget next week. (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA)\n\nThe Trump budget calls for spending more in several areas, namely adding $54 billion more to the Department of Defense and $2.6 billion for border security, $1.6 billion of which is for “new and replacement border wall … to impede the flow of illegal crossings.” Throughout Trump’s campaign, he repeatedly promised construction of a southern border wall he said would be paid for by Mexico.\n\nMulvaney also made clear that additional funding for school choice programs would be included in the budget, though neither those details nor those of other cuts intended to pay for those increases were released. Trump’s education secretary, school choice advocate Betsy DeVos of west Michigan, will be expected to pitch those proposals to Congress and overcome entrenched Democratic opposition.\n\nHe said the budget includes a fully paid-for plan to provide six weeks of paid family leave to new parents, though it was unclear how it would work. Budget documents released by the administration indicated a cost of only about $19 billion over 10 years and seemed to suggest that states would be allowed to establish paid parental leave programs they deemed “most appropriate.”\n\nTrump’s budget, like any other proposed by a president in recent years, is more of a statement of his priorities and policy beliefs than a document expected to approved as-is by Congress. The legislative branch is certain to come up with far different proposals through the appropriations process of horse-trading and House-Senate compromise.\n\nAlready, many lawmakers of both parties are criticizing Trump’s plan to eliminate the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, for instance. And the budget’s reliance on the savings contemplated by the American Health Care Act passed early this month, including some $800 billion over 10 years in reductions to Medicaid spending, is uncertain at best.\n\nThe health care proposal has been criticized by some Republican politicians, including Gov. Rick Snyder, for cutting Medicaid funding. And while the U.S. House was finally able to pass it early this month, senators have already indicated that they expect to start largely from scratch in coming up with a proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\n“The President’s budget is incredibly short-sighted and reckless,\" said U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint Township in a statement released tonight. \"With his budget, the President is essentially saying our way of life in Michigan doesn’t matter. I will fight these devastating budget cuts in Congress.”\n\nThe Free Press previously reported on the Trump administration's proposals in what was known as its \"skinny budget.\" That document outlined only some larger ticket items, such as reducing spending on heating assistance to low-income families and the elimination of the Community Development Block Grant program, which sends millions a year to Michigan communities and others across the country.\n\nThe documents provided Monday add to those other cuts, including the elimination of subsidized student loans and the creation of a single “income-driven student loan repayment plan” that would set monthly payments at 12.5% of discretionary income and forgive any balances for undergraduate borrowers after 15 years. Loan forgiveness for taking a public service job after 10 years of payments would be eliminated, letting the government recoup $27 billion over the next decade.\n\nThe budget also calls for reforming the food stamps program — otherwise known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP — to cut it by $191 billion over 10 years. It also reduces payments for Medicaid as proposed under the AHCA, though the budget documents indicated a savings of $610 billion over a decade and not the $880 billion estimated some months ago by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\n\nThe CBO this week is scheduled to release new estimates as to the impact of the health care act as passed by the House this month, since changes were made to it before the vote. The CBO had estimated that some 14 million people could lose coverage under the initial Republican proposal by 2018.\n\nAccording to the state Department of Health and Human Services, there were some 1.8 million Michiganders who received traditional Medicaid, which is medical care for low-income individuals, in April and another 675,000 people who were part of Healthy Michigan, the state’s Medicaid expansion program created under Obamacare. The proposed health care act would cut back on federal cost-sharing for Medicaid expansion programs and eventually limit payments under Medicaid.\n\nWhile the proposed reforms to the food stamps program weren’t immediately known, they could have large impact in Michigan as well, with nearly 1.4 million people, including 558,223 children, receiving food assistance in March.\n\nAlso left unclear for now was whether the budget included rumored items such as closing the Environmental Protection Agency’s Region 5 office in Chicago, which oversees Michigan, or deep cuts to a Drug-Free Communities program created in part by U.S. Rep. Sander Levin, D-Royal Oak, decades ago.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: 703-854-8947 or tspangler@freepress.com.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index and Nasdaq Composite both also lost more than 2 percent of their value, with the former shedding 41.56 points, or 2.16 percent, and the latter closing down 126.59 points or 2.74 percent..\n\nEarlier the Dow had been down nearly 537 points.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen about 8 percent this year, while the Nasdaq is off more than 10 percent.\n\nOil prices, which provided the markets with a respite by rallying on Thursday, were again the catalyst for sellers on Friday, as fears grew that Iranian oil would add to the worldwide glut.\n\nAn International Atomic Energy Agency report verifying whether Iran has kept its promises under a nuclear deal reached last year with world powers is likely to be issued on Saturday, paving the way for sanctions relief and the widespread resumption of Iranian oil shipments, a diplomatic source told Reuters on Friday. Iranian and other officials had previously said they expected the report to come out on Friday.\n\nBracing for the decision, traders drove the price of crude oil down past the symbolically important $30 a barrel level.\n\nU.S. crude oil settled at $29.42 a barrel, down $1.78, or 5.71 percent. It was the first time in 12 years that it had finished trading under $30.\n\nThe steep slump in crude from over $100 a barrel in the summer of 2014 has eviscerated energy company profits and made it much harder for them to pay off their debts.\n\nStill, some traders said the market was overselling on oil's woes, given the continued strength of the overall U.S. economy.\n\n“The thing that worries me is this systemic lack of confidence. I still think the fundamentals are solid,\" Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial, told CNBC. \"The U.S. economy is not going into a recession anytime soon.\"\n\nBut evidence of a fourth-quarter slowdown, including weaker than expected U.S. retail sales for December , continued to mount. The Commerce Department reported Friday that sales declined 0.1 percent for the month, as warm weather hurt winter clothing sales and cheap gas undercut gas station revenue.\n\nThe National Retail Federation also reported disappointing holiday sales. Sales rose 3 percent in November and December to about $626.14 billion, it said, well below its forecast for a 3.7 percent gain. The shortfall came even as stores aggressively pushed discounts throughout the season.\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve reported that U.S. industrial production, which includes manufacturing, mining and utilities, dropped in December for the third month in a row.\n\nInvestors also were spooked by expectations of disappointing earnings reports for companies hit by plunging oil prices, and indications that China will report its weakest full-year growth figure in 25 years on Tuesday.\n\nEconomists said the expansion of the Chinese economy was held back by sluggish domestic and external demand, weak investments, factory overcapacity and high property inventories, which exacerbated deflationary pressures in the economy.\n\nThe U.S. markets' down day continued a rout that began when Shanghai Composite Index finished down 3.6 percent, sliding to its lowest close since Dec. 8, 2014.\n\nStocks opened higher in Europe but quickly fell. Germany's DAX lost 3.1 percent, while France's CAC 40 dropped 2.9 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 dropped 2.4 percent.",

  "latent_24472": "A senior Hamas official said on Friday there could be no new exchange talks with Israel until it frees dozens of prisoners it has rearrested since their release in a 2011 swap.\n\nIsmail Haniya, a former Palestinian prime minister, said Israel had re-arrested at least 54 of the more than 1,000 prisoners freed in exchange for soldier Gilad Shalit, who was captured in a cross-border raid by Gaza militants in 2006.\n\n\"We have told all the mediators who have mobilised to discuss a new exchange that there won't be any negotiations before the release of all those Israel detained from among the Shalit deal group,\" he said in a speech marking the Eid al-Fitr holiday.\n\n\"There will be no talks without their unconditional release.\" Haniya did not elaborate on what new exchange was being mooted. Hamas has long acknowledged holding body parts of two Israeli soldiers killed during last summer's conflict in Gaza.\n\nBut it has not commented on Israel's announcement last week that Hamas is also holding two of its citizens in Gaza. Hamas and Israeli sources have reported informal, indirect contacts on the possibility of a long-term truce between them, to cement an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire that ended the Gaza conflict last August.\n\nLast Thursday, the Israeli defence ministry said that Avraham Mengistu, an Israeli of Ethiopian descent, had been held by Hamas since crossing illegally into Gaza last September. It said an Israeli Arab is also being held, although it has given no details of his case.\n\nIsrael does not allow its citizens to enter Gaza, partly out of fear they may be used as bargaining chips to demand concessions, including the release of prisoners. Israel insists that all of those rearrested since the Shalit exchange were implicated in fresh security offences committed after their release.\n\nAlso Read: Israel downs Hamas drone as offensive claims 177 lives",

  "latent_24807": "CLOSE Liberia said a teenager who died of Ebola fever had spread the virus to at least two more people, confirming the first outbreak of the tropical disease for months.\n\nLiberians read a story about Ebola on a public chalkboard in Monrovia on July 10, 2015. Liberia has had six new cases of Ebola after the World Health Organization declared the country free of Ebola on May 9, 2015. (Photo11: Ahmed Jallanzo, EPA)\n\nMONROVIA, Liberia — Six cases of Ebola have surfaced in Liberia in the two months since the nation was declared free of the deadly virus, raising fears the disease lingers in the human body in ways not fully understood.\n\nThree of those cases were in the past week, doubling the number of new infections since the virus re-emerged in late June, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Wednesday.\n\nThe newest case occurred in a suburb of Monrovia, the capital city devastated at the peak of last fall's epidemic by scores of new Ebola infections each week.\n\nThis new patient was a nurse who died Sunday on arrival at an Ebola treatment clinic in Monrovia, according to the United Nations and the Liberian government. She had been caring for her son, who became infected with the disease in a remote village and fled to the capital.\n\nGovernment health officials are ramping up responses in Monrovia, tracking more than 140 people exposed to the virus, including 16 placed under quarantine.\n\n\"We have asked all county health officers to be on the alert,\" said Francis Kateh, Liberia's chief medical officer. \"We are not saying the other counties have Ebola. But we need to alert them so that we wouldn't experience the previous outbreak.\"\n\nThe six new infections in Liberia since June 21 include two deaths.\n\nThe disease persists in neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea, where a few dozen new cases are reported each week, according to the WHO.\n\nThe strain that resurfaced in Liberia does not appear to be genetically similar to those in Sierra Leona and Guinea, suggesting the new infections are not the result of cross-border contamination. Instead, the strain in Liberia is similar to one that circulated in that country last year, according to the WHO.\n\n\"Preliminary evidence from genomic sequencing strongly suggests that the most likely origin of transmission is a re-emergence of the virus from a survivor within Liberia,\" the WHO reported Wednesday.\n\nThe WHO declared Liberia Ebola-free on May 9 because 42 days had passed — twice the known 21-day period of incubation for the virus — since a previous infection.\n\nScientists such as Stuart Nichol, head of the Viral Special Pathogens Branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said one very possible explanation for the virus staying alive in survivors is that it possibly harbors in male testes.\n\n\"Infectious agents can hang out there undetected by the body's policing system, looking for foreign invaders,\" Nichol said Wednesday. He said there have been cases of it remaining active there for 80 days.\n\nEbola could then be transmitted through sexual contact. Liberia has encouraged protected sexual contact by Ebola survivors for at least 90 days.\n\nThere could be other explanations for the virus suddenly striking back in Liberia, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. People may have carried the disease without showing symptoms, something documented in a smaller outbreak, Hotez said. Another possibility is a rare case where the incubation period lasted far longer than 21 days.\n\n\"I think this is a new type of epidemic that we haven't seen before,\" Hotez said. \"We're still in a learning curve.\"\n\nSince late 2013 when this epidemic began, there have been 27,600 Ebola cases, including more than 11,000 deaths.\n\nLiberia suffered the worst, with more than 4,800 deaths. President Obama deployed nearly 3,000 U.S. troops there last year to build Ebola treatment clinics, train staff and conduct laboratory diagnostic tests. Most of those troops pulled out early this year, the last leaving in late June.\n\nZoroya reported from McLean, Va.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1J0MiET",
  "latent_24836": "CORAL GABLES, Fla. — The training room isn’t the ideal place to begin a new chapter in one’s life, but two freshmen — wide receiver Braxton Berrios and running back Joe Yearby — did just that this spring.\n\nWhile teammates put on helmets and pads for practice, the pair got up at 5 a.m. every day for 1.5 hours of treatment. Both watched from the sidelines as the other early enrollees and student-athletes practiced.\n\n\"I didn’t see my dorm room until 8 (p.m) as far as getting back to my room every day,\" Berrios said. \"Obviously it wasn’t the best thing coming in full load of classes, having a crutch everywhere and trying to learn football. It was a lot to deal with, but I ended up getting a 4.0 that semester, learned the offense and took care of what I had to in the training room.\"\n\nIn other words, not quite how he envisioned the start to his time as a Hurricane.\n\nBerrios, at 5-foot-9, 183 pounds, participated in the Under Armour Game on Jan. 2 and worked out per usual before moving into his dorm, oblivious to the fact he had a torn ACL. The procedure took place 13 days after scoring a touchdown against the nation’s top recruits.\n\nYearby, meanwhile, underwent fibula surgery Dec. 4, 2013. The 5-foot-9, 192-pounder missed out on the end of Miami Central High School’s state championship run.\n\n\"I was in the same thing with him,\" Yearby said. \"When Braxton showed up, I would be right next to him doing rehab. It was a good way to start talking with each other and telling each other we would be all right. We got a good bond like that.\"\n\nOnce the initial shock of sitting out wore off, it was time to begin the arduous recovery process. More than anything, it requires mental toughness.\n\nBrad Kaaya earns QB Spot True freshman Brad Kaaya is named the Miami Hurricanes starting quarterback.\n\nSome of their new teammates, whose 2013 seasons ended with injuries, were getting treatment beside them and could offer words of encouragement. Senior wide receiver Phillip Dorsett tried returning for last December’s Russell Athletic Bowl before he was ready. Junior defensive back Deon Bush was never fully healthy all year. Sophomore Corn Elder sustained a meniscus tear late in the season.\n\n\"My senior year when I got hurt I didn’t really think I would play football again,\" Yearby said. \"Everybody was talking to me, keeping my head up. Everything was like that. I just kept moving forward, staying positive. It came out right.\"\n\nWhen redshirt senior quarterback Ryan Williams tore his ACL during the spring, he turned to Berrios who was a few months ahead in the process.\n\nBetween knowing his physical limitations and staying focused with his rehabilitation, Berrios could offer words of advice and encouragement through experience.\n\n\"Just have to get mentally sound,\" Berrios said. \"I think that’s the No. 1 thing. You’re always going to want to compare yourself to your old self.\"\n\nAll-ACC running back Duke Johnson admitted he didn’t like bringing up the topic of his injury because it can become ingrained in one’s psyche. Doing so seems to have worked.\n\n\"He’s a new dude,\" All-ACC linebacker Denzel Perryman said. \"You couldn’t even tell he came off an injury. He went away and came back a whole lot better. He’s like a whole new person. I want to ask him how he did it. What’s his mindset?\"\n\nThroughout the 15-hour day, players are there for each other as support. The results, they were told, would come with both patience and humility.\n\nDespite their inability to participate on the Greentree Practice Fields, there were positives sitting out the spring as early enrollees. For one, they had more time to study the playbook and slow the game down.\n\n\"I watched a lot of film and took mental reps,\" Yearby said. \"Anything the starters were doing, I was in the back visualizing myself doing it.\"\n\nAdded Johnson: \"He came in ready to learn, ready to listen. He was ready. He came in with the mindset that the stuff in high school doesn’t matter.\"\n\nAway from the playing field, the pair grew accustomed to college life — from living in Pearson Residential College to studying for midterms and finals.\n\nNeither Berrios nor Yearby has missed much of a beat by attacking the recovery with determination and discipline. They set plans and met goals to avoid any setbacks.\n\n\"Like he never had an ACL (surgery),\" offensive coordinator James Coley said of Berrios. \"He worked really hard to get back. He’s at where he was before he had the ACL. He’s really been a strong point to this offense, especially on third downs. He’s come through. I’m very impressed with him.\"\n\nWith the season opener six days away, both guys are ready to contribute and close to full health. Their expectations haven’t been stifled.\n\nBerrios is listed as an option for kick and punt returns. He will likely see snaps on third-down situations.

A USDA inspection in April, six weeks before the child got into the enclosure, yielded no violations at the zoo, and the barrier system has never been found to be noncompliant in previous inspections, the zoo pointed out in a statement released Thursday. \"The Cincinnati Zoo reaffirms its longstanding commitment to the well-being of the resident animals and the safety of those inspired to view and conserve them,\" the zoo said in a written statement. \"Its stellar record in that regard includes 43 million visitors over the last four decades who have enjoyed the Gorilla World exhibit without coming in contact with the gorillas.\" The USDA acknowledged that the organization had not found the barrier to be noncompliant in previous inspections. \"Barriers between exhibits and the general public must restrict public contact from the animals,\" USDA spokesperson Tanya Espinosa said. \"In the case of the incident that occurred at the Cincinnati Zoo, the barrier had been in existence since 1978 with no updates, and while there had not been any issues prior to the May 28th incident, it became apparent on May 28th that the barrier was no longer effective.\" The federal inspection report viewed by The Associated Press states that the zoo's dangerous-animal response team properly followed procedures after zoo visitors called 911 on May 28 to report a child in the gorilla enclosure.

It is based on the South Korean hit reality series “Grandpas Over Flowers, in which prominent has-beens, including actor Lee Soon-jae, embark on adventures in foreign countries. Its American doppelganger is expected to make stops in several Asian cities, including Seoul, according to its producers.\n\nThe eight-member girl group will film its part at the SMTOWN@coexartium in southern Seoul this weekend, S.M.

The report by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration offered new details on the scope and duration of the I.R.S. targeting effort.\n\nMismanagement at the agency allowed “inappropriate criteria” for the singling out of conservative groups to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months, starting in 2010, the report said. That resulted in “substantial delays” for groups applying for tax-exempt status, either as 501(c)(4) or 501(c)(3) organizations, and it allowed unnecessary and intrusive information like donor lists to be gathered. I.R.S. officials told the inspector general that all donor information received was later destroyed.\n\nOf the 296 applications the inspector general reviewed, 108 were approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicants and 160 were still open, some pending for up to 1,138 days.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday night, the I.R.S. acknowledged that “inappropriate shortcuts were used to determine which cases may be engaging in political activities.” But it said the agency had a responsibility to make sure that such organizations did not engage in impermissible political actions, and that not just conservative groups were singled out. It also said that “there was no intent to hide this issue,” but that the agency had been awaiting the inspector general’s report.\n\nThe report said that senior I.R.S. officials told inspectors that no individual or organization outside the agency influenced the criteria used to single out Tea Party or other conservative groups.\n\nBut Congressional aides looking into the matter are not convinced. One notation in a 12-page timeline of events prepared by the inspector general stood out for exploration. On Aug. 4, 2011, officials at the I.R.S.’s rulings and agreement office met with the I.R.S.’s chief counsel “so that everyone would have the latest information on the issue,” according to the inspector general.",
  "latent_24911": "An emergency room entrance at a hospital in Santa Clarita, Calif. (Jason Redmond/AP)\n\nThe nation’s hospital industry warned President-elect Donald Trump and congressional leaders on Tuesday that repealing the Affordable Care Act could cost hospitals $165 billion by the middle of the next decade and trigger “an unprecedented public health crisis.”\n\nThe two main trade groups for U.S. hospitals dispatched a letter to the incoming president and Capitol Hill’s top four leaders, saying that the government should help hospitals avoid massive financial losses if the law is rescinded in a way that causes a surge of uninsured patients.\n\nThe letter, along with a consultant’s study estimating the financial impact of undoing the Affordable Care Act, makes hospitals the first sector of the health-care industry to speak out publicly to try to protect itself from a sharp reversal in health policy that Trump is promising and congressional Republicans have long favored.\n\nWhen it was enacted in 2010, the health-care law was a product of a delicate balancing act among various parts of the health-care industry. Each essentially agreed to sacrifices in exchange for the prospect of millions of Americans gaining insurance to help cover their medical expenses.\n\nSince Trump’s election last month, most health-industry sectors have quietly been trying to glean — and influence — the thinking within Congress’s GOP majority and the president-elect’s transition team.\n\nPost reporter Amy Goldstein walks us through what changes health care will face under a Trump presidency. President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on his promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. (The Washington Post)\n\nAmerica’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the insurers’ main lobby, has been holding private meetings with members of Congress. According to an AHIP spokeswoman, the group is urging that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act avoid disrupting newly gained coverage, eliminate certain taxes the law placed on insurers and replace the requirement that most Americans carry insurance with strong financial incentives for coverage.\n\n[Trump spurs fears, hopes among Americans insured by the Affordable Care Act]\n\nIn contrast, the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals (FAH) convened a news conference Tuesday to release the study’s findings and draw attention to their concerns.\n\nCharles N. “Chip” Kahn III, president of FAH, a for-profit group, said the amount of money that hospitals could lose under a repeal of the Affordable Care Act was “unsettling.”\n\nJoann Anderson, president of Southeastern Health, a financially fragile rural hospital in Lumberton, N.C., one of that state’s most economically depressed areas, said the prospect of repealing the health law without a replacement to keep people insured is “gut-wrenching. . . . We cannot take additional cuts.”\n\nThe study, by the health economics consulting firm Dobson DaVanzo, used as its starting point a bill that is the only Affordable Care Act-repeal legislation that Congress has produced. It was vetoed early this year by President Obama. That legislation would have eliminated crucial parts of the health law — among them, federal subsidies for health plans people buy through insurance marketplaces created by the law, penalties for violating its insurance requirements, and the expansion of Medicaid that 31 states have adopted.\n\nBorrowing from Congressional Budget Office estimates, the study says a similar repeal would cause an additional 22 million people to be uninsured by 2026. By then, it predicts, hospitals would lose $165 billion as a result — and $102 billion more unless the government reverses payment cuts the law made to hospitals that treat many uninsured patients.\n\nThe hospital groups say that if Trump and Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act without replacing it right away, they should also restore government payments for hospital care of Medicare and Medicaid patients to what they were before the 2010 law. When it was enacted, the premise was that hospitals could absorb lower payments if more people were insured.\n\n[ Obama urges the public to tell Republicans not to ‘abandon’ the ACA ]\n\nA spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) noted that Ryan has said he favors a transition period to phase out the law but has not specified how long he prefers. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that the senator has held over 100 meetings with hospital leaders, employees and patients “to hear firsthand about the damage the law is doing.”\n\nSpokesmen for the Trump transition team did not answer repeated requests for a reply, except for a note that said: “We have received your request. Due to the volume of requests coming in, response time may be slower than usual.”",

  "latent_25070": "With lawmakers poised to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—a sweeping tax reform package—many individuals and families will see very different tax bills come 2018 and beyond. In general, an overwhelming majority of Americans will pay less in federal taxes.\n\nSo how will you fare under the GOP tax plan?\n\nWell, on net, most Americans will see a significant tax cut, including virtually all lower- and middle-income workers and a majority of upper-income earners.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will, on average, provide immediate tax cuts across all income groups, according to analysis from Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nThis analysis does not, however, show how those tax cuts would vary based on factors such as total income, type of income, number of children, and itemized deductions.\n\nAmong the new legislation’s most beneficial components is a significant reduction in business tax rates. This will help make America more competitive with the rest of the world, and will result in more and better jobs as well as higher incomes for American workers. The bill will also put more money back into the paychecks and pockets of most Americans.\n\nThe new bill does lack some important pro-growth and simplification components, however. It does not go far enough in eliminating deductions and loopholes or in reducing the top marginal tax rate. It adds a discrepancy between the top rate for individual versus pass-through and small businesses and adds some complicated business provisions. It also fails to eliminate the alternative minimum tax and it phases out and eliminates some tax cuts for budgetary reasons.\n\nTo get a better idea of how some workers, families, and small businesses will fare under the new tax code, The Heritage Foundation has estimated the tax bills of a range of taxpayers under current tax law and under the GOP’s final version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nTom Wong: Single teacher with median earnings of $50,000 per year. Under the current tax code, Tom pays $5,474 each year in federal income taxes. His tax bill will decline by $1,104, or 20 percent, to $4,370 under the new legislation.\n\nThese tax cuts come primarily from a higher standard deduction of $12,000 and from lower marginal tax rates. Currently, Tom’s marginal tax rate is 25 percent. But under the new bill, his tax rate will be 12 percent.\n\nJohn and Sarah Jones: Married couple with three children, homeowners, and $75,000 in annual income. John is a sales representative and earns an average of $55,000 a year. Sarah is a registered nurse. After having children, Sarah cut back to part-time work and she earns $20,000 a year. Under the current tax code, John and Sarah pay $1,753 each year in federal income taxes.\n\nBut under the new tax bill, their tax bill will decline by $2,014, or 115 percent, to $0, plus a refundable credit of $261.\n\nEven though John and Sarah would have more taxable income under the proposed plans (as a result of not being able to claim personal exemptions), they would still receive a tax cut because they would face lower marginal tax rates and receive larger child tax credits.\n\nTheir current marginal tax rate will decline from 15 percent to 12 percent, while their $3,000 in total child tax credits will double to $6,000.\n\nThe numbers listed in the above example for John and Sarah’s current tax payments assume John and Sarah own a home and live in a state with average tax levels. Under the current tax code, if they did not own a home but instead rented, their federal tax bill would be higher ($2,375 instead of their current $1,753 tax bill).\n\nThis would mean that their subsequent tax cuts—as renters—would be larger—$2,636, or 111 percent. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act partially limits—by placing a $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions—an inequity in the current tax code that provides bigger tax breaks to property owners, wealthy individuals, and people who live in high-tax states.\n\nUnder the new tax legislation, however, John and Sarah’s tax bill will be the same regardless of whether they own a home or rent because the larger standard deduction will mean they will not itemize in either case.\n\nPeter and Paige Smith: Married couple with two children, homeowners, $1.5 million annual income. Peter works for a technology startup company and Paige is an accountant. Although Peter’s income fluctuates significantly from year-to-year, this was a big year for his company and he received a very large bonus, bringing his total earnings to $1.4 million. Paige’s stable income of $100,000 provided their family the financial stability they needed for Peter to take a risk and follow his dreams.\n\nUnder the current tax code, Pater and Paige pay $439,275 in federal income taxes. Their tax bill will decline slightly, by just $2,431, or 0.6 percent, to $436,8344 under the new tax legislation.\n\nPeter and Paige’s taxable income will be higher under the new bill because they will lose most of their state and local tax deductions. Their total exemptions and child tax credits will remain the same—at zero—as their income is too high to claim any exemptions or credits under the current code or the proposed plans. They will face a lower marginal tax rate, however.\n\nUnder the current tax code, Peter and Paige face a top marginal tax rate of 40.5 percent (39.6 percent, plus the 0.9 percent Obamacare surtax). Under the new tax bill, their marginal rate will fall to 37.9 percent (37 percent, plus the 0.9 percent Obamacare tax).\n\nThose marginal tax rates do not include Social Security’s 12.4 percent and Medicare’s 2.9 percent payroll taxes, which can lead to extremely high combined marginal tax rates for second earners that are part of a high-income family like Peter and Paige. Because Paige makes less than Social Security current taxable maximum income of $128,400 (for 2018), her combined federal income and payroll tax rate is 55.8 percent under current law and will fall to 53.2 percent under the new legislation.\n\nAlthough Peter and Paige will have about $100,000 more taxable income under the new bill because they can only deduct up to $10,000 of their state and local taxes, their lower top marginal tax rate will help eliminate some of the existing tax penalty they face on work and investment.\n\nThe above example assumes Peter and Paige live in a state with average taxes. Currently, however, their federal tax bill could be tens of thousands of dollars higher or lower, depending on whether they live in a state with higher- or lower-than-average taxes for them to write off. This is not the case under the new tax bill because it caps state and local tax deductions at $10,000 (and at their income level, they would likely claim that full amount in any state).\n\nJose and Marie Fernandez: Married couple with two children, owners of JM Blinds and Shades LLC, homeowners, $250,000 annual income. Jose owns and manages JM Blinds and Shades manufacturing company. Marie primarily stays home with their young children, but she also helps out significantly with the business when needed. Under the current tax code, Jose and Marie pay $35,588, which is their alternative minimum tax (AMT) amount.\n\nThe AMT is a separate tax system, created back in 1982 to make sure that millionaires paid their “fair share” in taxes. However, because the AMT was not indexed for inflation until 30 years after it was enacted, it now hits a significant number of middle- to upper-income Americans with a higher tax bill than they would otherwise pay. That’s because under the current tax code, taxpayers pay the larger of what they owe under the regular income tax system and the AMT.\n\nThe new tax bill increases the exemption level for the AMT, and significantly raises the income level at which the phase-out of that exemption begins (the phase-out creates a phantom, 35 percent marginal rate in addition to the AMT’s stated 26 and 28 percent rates.\n\nJose and Marie will still pay the AMT under the new tax legislation, but their AMT tax bill will decline by $13,619, or 38 percent, to $21,969.\n\nAlthough the AMT is a separate tax system that does not include the new 20 percent deduction on small and pass-through business income, Jose and Marie still benefit—indirectly—from the deduction. Without the deduction, Jose and Marie would pay $32,039 in federal income taxes under the new bill—a smaller cut of $3,549, or 10 percent.\n\nHowever, the deduction for their small business income lowers their regular income tax bill under the new bill to a level ($20,384) that is below their new AMT tax bill ($21,969). Thus, while they still pay the AMT (which does not provide the small business deduction), Jose and Marie would pay much more in federal income taxes without the deduction.\n\nJose and Marie’s marginal income tax rate is 35 percent under current law and will decline to 28 percent under the new legislation. The 28 percent is their AMT marginal rate (absent the AMT, their new marginal rate under the standard income tax would be 19.2 percent, which is 24 percent minus the 20 percent deduction).\n\nUnder current law, Jose and Marie make too much to claim the $1,000 per child tax credits. Under the new bill, however, they will receive the now-doubled $2,000 per child tax credits.\n\nThe above examples seek to show how some common taxpayers—including some wealthy individuals who are less common—would fare under the proposed tax reforms. Actual individuals’, families’, and businesses’ tax bills could vary significantly.\n\nOn net, however, most taxpayers—particularly lower- and middle-income taxpayers and businesses—will pay less in total taxes. Even more important than total taxes paid, however, is marginal tax rates. That’s because a lot of decisions are made at the margin.\n\nFor example, a worker is far more likely to work an additional hour if it counts as overtime and provides the equivalent of 1.5 hours’ worth of pay. And an individual is more likely to make a $1,000 contribution to his retirement savings account if that savings goes tax-free and means he can put all $1,000 away, instead of first having to pay between $100 and $400 in taxes on the savings.\n\nLower marginal tax rates are a big driver of economic growth, and the lower the rates, the higher the growth. The new tax legislation reduces the top marginal tax rate by 2.6 percentage points for individuals, and by as much as 10 percentage points for small and pass-through businesses.\n\nWhile the proposed tax reforms do not achieve 100 percent of the potential pro-growth impacts that they could, they go a long way in helping to jump-start America’s struggling economy and put it on a pathway toward higher long-term growth. This leaves tax reform an unfinished business.\n\nThe expiration and phase-out of some of the tax cuts in this plan will provide the opportunity for Congress to enact more of the pro-growth components lawmakers left out of this tax package.",

Or maybe that’s just me. Whichever it is, I’m always in love with any design that is so simple and integrated into my life that I don’t notice it.\n\nLaura has spent more than 15 years as an engineer and designer in Silicon Valley. Her goal is to help startups learn about their customers so that they can build better products faster. Her book , and her popular design blog, Users Know , teach product owners what they need to know to do research and design.\n\nDon’t guess and fall prey to designer arrogance (which we all do from time to time).\n\nDesign with those parameters in mind. Know thy user. Just like with successful marketing, understand their pains, problems, frustrations, and use their language to communicate.\n\nFor example, I am trying to install a bike rack on my car and I visit the manufacturers website. The goal is to successfully install my bike rack and get on the road as quickly as possible. The context is, I’m standing outside my car in the hot sun with my kids crying because they want to go to the park now.\n\nAlways consider the final outcome and context for the user/customer. What do they need to accomplish and in which context?\n\nInstead of searching around for quarters, getting change from delis, all just to pay a parking meter, I can now just enter in a number found on the meter , set the desired duration and pay the fee. It texts me when my time is almost up, and I can add more money if needed.\n\nMy favorite product experience lately has been using the ParkMobile app around town.\n\nCo-founder of Flavors.me and Goodsie , and previously Design Director at Vimeo , Jack says he was hooked onto design the very first time he started up Photoshop while he was in high school and counts his father as one of his primary influences. Nowadays, you can find him at Workshop – a no nonsense entrepreneurship training program for young adults.\n\nLearn to separate UI trends from practical/useful UI design conventions. Just because a current trend is widely used, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best way.\n\nHaving started out with graphic design and then making the move to web-design, Mike has worked with the likes of Twitter, Microsoft, and Mailchimp to create User Experiences that marry form and function.\n\nToday I stay engaged in that community through my local chapter of the UX Professionals Association, and that community is even more important now that I’m doing independent consulting. So meet as many people as you can who are as excited about UX as you are, and ask them for advice.\n\nWhen I made my initial career change into high tech, I knew very few people who did the same thing I did. When I went back to school for Human Factors at Bentley University, it was like a whole new world opened up for me. Of course, a big part of it was the learning, but the network of people I ended up meeting was just as valuable.\n\nUnderstand that in a collaborative profession like UX, people are more important than skills. If you have an aptitude for research or design, you’ll master those skills in time, but having the right relationships can make or break your career.\n\nI often get the feeling that we’ve reached a bit of a plateau as far as consumer app innovation is concerned, so it’s great to see something that’s fresh and spot on.\n\nI also love the language immersion part, where users collaborate on translations. Memorization and repetition are innate parts of beginning language learning that can be quite boring, and it’s clear the folks at Duolingo have been very thoughtful in trying to alleviate this challenge.\n\nI love the UX for so many reasons…it’s a very uncomplicated interface that’s fun and motivating. A lot of apps try to incorporate gamification or community just because it’s the cool thing to do, and it ends up feeling like an afterthought. Duolingo does a great job of using the gaming elements and variation in lessons to keep users engaged.\n\nEva runs her own company ( Red Pill UX ) based in Boston, is a regular at events of the UXPA , of which she is the President.\n\nDon’t listen to anyone, make your own mistakes and then when you fail, get up and try again.\n\nEven if I did, I wouldn’t gain as much value as I did discovering these things myself. The best way to learn anything is through making mistakes and so I would not want to deny my younger self that opportunity. As Winston Churchill once said “success is going from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm”.\n\nHonestly, I would avoid giving any advice to my younger self because I know I wouldn’t listen to it!\n\nWhat made this so groundbreaking was that it broke conventions. It rejected the convention of realistically showing distance and location. By letting go of those constraints they were able to create a simple representation of a complex network. For me this is what good design is all about – taking the complex and looking at it from a different angle to simplify it.\n\nHaving worked with the web for over two decades, Paul is a co-founder of web design agency Headscape (which counts Nestle, Macmillan, and several UK universities as clients). He is also a prolific writer and speaker.\n\nWe collaborated with the team at UXPin to bring you their insights below.\n\nAs a result, we got to interview 11 kickass UX designers to ask them what inspires them–and also what UX advice they’d give to other practitioners.\n\nWe compiled a lot of advice from top practitioners in the field for our free Guide to UX Careers .\n\nAt Springboard , we pair mentors with learners in UX and data science, so it makes a lot of sense for us to counsel listening to your elders.\n\nDescribed as a design psychologist and brand strategist, Joshua has worked with companies like Wendy’s and the New York Times to help connect with their customers and increase their revenues. You listen to what he has to say on his blog, Twitter and Candorem, the company he runs.\n\nDesign Inspiration :\n\nUser Experience surrounds us and extends far beyond the grasp of the digital web. User Experience as a label has to be seen through the perspective of context in designed interaction versus the actual medium or platform.\n\nAs an example, let’s take a look at automobiles in general.\n\nIt’s assumed that most of the time we spend in our vehicles we would be driving them. When we’re driving the priority, I hope, would be entirely based on the road in front of us. Stay in our lane. Stay under the speed limit. Watch out for other vehicles, pedestrians, or animals. But then we introduced a radio and thermostat. Looking away from the road for even a fraction of a second can lead to a lot of trouble for everyone on the road. So, why don’t the car manufacturers keep that in mind when designing the center consoles? Most have overly robust options, buttons, dials, and even touch screens to change the temperature or radio station.\n\nIf User Experience is about the context of interaction, then we need to look at how we can simplify the experience so the user’s primary focus isn’t negatively affected.\n\nGreat design guides a user without requiring much thought. Confusion kills.\n\nCareer Advice :\n\nBe insatiable. Always be present. Don’t let a label define you or what you look to accomplish in life. Look to everyone and everything for answers even when they don’t seem to relate to the question at hand. You can be anything and everything you want to be.\n\nAt Seven Heads Design, Kevin ‘solves problems you didn’t know you had’ – which involves not only how humans interact with computers, but also with themselves.

You can find him on his website, and on Twitter.\n\nDesign Inspiration :\n\nI’m a big fan of the overall user experience of the stock or “Google Play” version of Android, and more recently Android Wear.\n\nI experimented with the possible switch to Android for awhile when the “Kit Kat” version of the software and the Nexus 5 came out, and I haven’t looked back since. There’s a lot of interface choices that I think are great, but my favorite things are anticipatory and in the microinteraction space, such as the different ways you can act with push notifications, or seamless integration with calendaring user needs.\n\nThe first time I realized I could let people know I was running late for a meeting with two clicks/touches, I was like “Whoa! That’s useful.” Recently, I’ve been integrating the Android Wear watch, and it only took me about five days for that to become a completely natural part of my life. Now I can fade out of social situations by constantly looking at my watch instead of pulling my phone out of my pocket to check and interact with notifications.\n\nI’m very much looking forward to Android Auto as well. We’ll see what the next iOS is like, but for the time being, I can’t see myself switching back\n\nCareer Advice :\n\n“Hey younger self!\n\nYou will spend some time idealizing long term goals, and that’s a good exercise. You’ll think about your ideal job, employer, lifestyle, family, and more. But in reality, you’ll get very little satisfaction chasing those things, and you should never wait around for them.\n\nSpend life living.\n\nThe most fun is in charting the actual, sometimes smaller (sometimes not) decisions that will confront you whether you want them to or not. Your goal should be getting better at making decisions when they can have the greatest impact on your life, and not any particular ideal.\n\nAlso, as much as you can, realize that self-doubt may help you with humility, but not much else. Don’t take yourself too seriously. Exercise more, because dude, what have you done to me? Also, don’t overuse the word ‘also’.”\n\nLis has worked with a number of companies, large and small, to create technology products, – like espnw.com and nba.com, that change people’s lives in a meaningful way. She also serves as an Advisory Board Member for Future Insights events.\n\nDesign Inspiration:\n\nOne of my biggest inspirations lately has been public space design in large cities, like New York City, where I live.\n\nI can’t help but notice not just how well designed the larger spaces like Central Park are, but also how convenient smaller spaces are available to the public wherever I look. I also find myself obsessed with watching people use parks, and the fields and courts within them. The reason I look to this ecosystem for inspiration is because in order to make these spaces successful one has to design for the experience of such a large, varied group of people to enjoy, what can be, such an overwhelming and crowded space.\n\nThis, to me, is the aim of architecting for a User’s Experience, allowing them to flow, how they decide, through a space, to get an intended result that is pleasing both to the user, as well as to the product owner or designer.\n\nCareer Advice:\n\nChill out, for starters.\n\nOne thing about being in our field is that we know the importance of our work, and we want everyone else to know that importance and “get it”. So, many times we find ourselves fighting tooth and nail to get the message out there.\n\nThis, of course, leads to exhaustion and deflation. What I’ve realized is that fighting so very hard to imbue my knowledge on those outside of our field is not the point. I’ve also learned that it really doesn’t matter if the business, or the technology team, or whomever “get” what I do at the deepest level.\n\nAll that matters is that you are passionate about what you can control, do what you are responsible for (and more if necessary) to see that passion come to life, and that you enjoy the ride as you go!\n\nMatt is the co-founder of Supereight Studio in the UK and has been designing on the Web since 1998.

Dropbox impresses me with the onboarding experience, attention to detail, and thinking differently rather than copying patterns to make it completely intuitive.\n\nCareer Advice :\n\nDocument everything!\n\nHaving an extensive reference of well ordered UX design to browse through helps you learn and also find solutions to problems as your reference builds. Remember to document real-world experiences too, these patterns can be referenced too.\n\n10 .

It’s still the most popular turntable for DJs, producers and musicians.\n\nIt demonstrates functional design at its best and the importance of coupling thoughtful design with precise execution. I think that the ensuring the best possible execution is very often forgotten part of a UX designer’s responsibility, but it ultimately defines the success of the product.\n\nCareer Advice :\n\nDon’t get lost in all the design methodologies and design patterns. It’s important to learn about design frameworks and have rigid design process, but the start is always very simple: Who am I designing this for? What does he need to achieve? How can I help him to achieve that?\n\nThen it’s just a matter of iteration and learning what works and what doesn’t.\n\n11 .

He also teaches, gives talks, and writes.\n\nInspiration :\n\nI am continually inspired, provoked and challenged by the NYC subway system as an amazing, multi-faceted user experience.\n\nI have been a subway rider for (at least) 45 years. You can’t truly know or appreciate the value of an experience unless you have lived with it, and lived with it over an extensive period of time.\n\nToo many of the user experiences we celebrate are transient – apps that will likely not be in our phone in another month much less year. The subways are here to stay, and improvements are measured in pixels, people and steel. This sort of design is slow hard work.\n\nYet change is constant. As a resident of NYC there are few systems that are more important to “learn” than the subway. But where does the experience begin and end? It is not simply contained in the stations, trains and turnstiles.\n\nIn recent years the subway system has become a platform for experimentation, both authorized and improvised. Recently, large touch-screen information displays have started popping up on the Union Square platform. It is fascinating to watch people interact with them for the first time, peeling back one more layer on an experience that connects so many of us together in this great city (yes it is my home town).\n\nAs UX designers we should be thinking – and crafting – experiences on a big scale. What better than a city, where data and mobility are beautifully intertwined, and where we can constantly explore (and enjoy) the seams between our own experiences and those around us?\n\nCareer Advice :\n\nI love to talk to designers about the first moment that you put your design in front of a person to explore, experience and (hopefully) enjoy.\n\nIn that one moment, even before the person actually engages with the artifact, you always see it differently. It is like the old expression about the ‘scales falling from your eyes’. You suddenly see (and know) so many things that were just outside your understanding, planning and intuition.\n\nThose moments are precious – very, very precious – as well as humbling for every designer, no matter how accomplished.\n\nDesign is not precious in comparison, so try to make as many of these moments as possible happen on your projects. You don’t need to ask for permission!\n\nWorking at frog for 13 years, I had the pleasure of being in those situations over and over again with many different teams – Close Encounters of the Design Kind.\n\nQuality is always, and only, measured in the response the artifact elicits – in how it engages, delights and supports the user.\n\nBehavior is our medium.

  "latent_25244": "An alt-left thug “defending American values”\n\nHere’s more video of the Antifa freedom fighters beating the hell out of neo-Nazis.\n\nLeBlanc sent out this letter today.\n\nDear SNHU Community,\n\nLike so many, I watched with outrage and near despair at the violence and hatred of those who marched on Charlottesville last weekend. Those emotions were exacerbated by a lack of moral leadership and the false equivalency between the alt-right marchers, using the First Amendment as a platform for hateful vitriol, and the small number of counter-protestors who engaged with them. The former, who marched into town, are to be reviled. The counter-marchers were there to protest the evil that is the alt-right and defend American values.\n\nWhile I made my opinions immediately known on social media, I’ve wanted to be thoughtful about this more formal message to the SNHU community. It should go without saying that we condemn the alt-right marchers and the movement in all its forms. This is not a political stance. This is an American stance and one taken up by Republican and Democratic leaders alike, the CEOs of companies like Wal-Mart, Merck, and Under Armour, and military leaders like USMC General Robert Neller. While the marchers’ speech may be protected – and should be protected – those constitutional protections do not make them any less vile. Those who went beyond speech to attacks, murder, and threats are domestic terrorists and should be prosecuted with the same zeal we use in suppressing foreign terrorism, and other threats to American life and liberty.\n\nWith the fall semester soon approaching, I want to reaffirm SNHU’s commitment to ensuring a safe and welcoming living-learning environment forevery member of our community.\n\nLet me be clear about what SNHU stands for today.\n\nWe stand for inclusivity. We are working hard to be more supportive and embracing of difference. This extends from small things, such as how we manage restrooms, to big things, like diversity on our Board of Trustees. It means the very basic, like ensuring the safety of all our students, faculty, and staff to the complicated work of building culture and community, especially one that embraces all, while tolerating difference in opinion. We commit to being intolerant of intolerance. Which means we will actively work to prevent hate speech, while ensuring that we protect speech – civic and civil – across the political and intellectual spectrum.\n\nWe stand for the marketplace of ideas. Universities have struggled with those from both the left and the right who interfere with conference speakers or others with whom they disagree. Disagreement, discomfort, and dislike are not a basis for barring speech, and while we will not tolerate hate speech, we will promote – we desire – a robust exchange of ideas. We want that exchange to be civil, constructive, and respectful – that’s part of a diverse and pluralistic community. It feels like our society has lost a lot of that ability, and we will in this next year spend more time in workshops and other teaching venues developing the skill of having difficult conversations, and navigating sensitive and fraught topics.\n\nWe stand for social justice. This University is built on the core transformational power of education to help people achieve a better life for themselves, their families, and their communities. The greatest instrument of social mobility in America is education, so we remain committed to innovating and finding ways to bring education to first generation college students, to low-income students, and to students of color. Economic justice is one aspect of this work, but so is the work of extending rights and freedoms to those for whom they have been long denied, including members of our LGBTQ community. At a time when wealth inequity is reaching record levels, we commit to being part of the solution.\n\nWe stand for rationality, science, evidence, and facts. The world is a wondrous place full of mystery and awe, and the best scientists and researchers are humble in the face of what we do not know, but we should make policy and advances on the basis of what we do know. Unfortunately, we live in a time of willful ignorance. The alt-right movement promulgates lies about climate change, immigrants and crime, and sows seeds of doubt about fundamental institutions of our democracy. In these times, Universities have to stand as beacons of light against that darkness.\n\nStanding for a pluralistic society, the free exchange of ideas, social justice, and facts are core American principles; they are also core SNHU principles.\n\nUniversities do not only stand for things. They also take care of their people. Right now, too many of our students and employees feel frightened and under assault, and it is incumbent on us, as an institution, and as colleagues, and friends, and peers, to reassure them that we have their back, that we are allies. We have to do it in words, speaking up when we see their safety or rights under threat, and in deeds. Our actions will be louder than our words. Tomorrow we will announce an important new initiative to support refugees and immigrants in our local community. We are welcoming to our Board of Trustees Maribel Duran, child of immigrants from Mexico, and chief of staff of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellent for Hispanics; and Rick Banks, an African-American Stanford School of Law Professor, who writes about race and law. We will work diligently to recruit more students and employees of color, to better support our LGBTQ community members, and to stand by their side every time their rights, and their freedoms are under threat.\n\nEarlier today, I had the opportunity to tour the Fidelity Investment facilities in nearby Merrimack. At one point, I was introduced to an engineering team. On the team was a mix of men and women. Two of them were of Indian descent, another was Chinese, the team leader was Latino, and two team members were joining by video-conference from Poland. They were doing impressive work and they were doing it with laughter, respect, and efficiency, using agile development techniques that they had developedas a team. In our complex and globally connected world, this is what wins. Research shows that diverse teams are smarter teams. History shows that American success has been built on the success of immigrants and refugees and the castoffs of other lands. Meeting them felt like an antidote to this weekend’s headlines.\n\nI had another recent opportunity this year when I spent the day touring the beaches of Normandy. Standing on those beaches which had been blood-soaked, where so many Americans died saving the world from Nazis, and then thinking about those who walked the streets of Charlottesville giving the Hitler salute and parading the swastika, I can’t help think about those who sacrificed so much, and what they would think of our country today. What would they think of those who remain silent in the face of such a threat to our country? As a community, please join me in raising your voice and reaffirming the goodness of who we are as a diverse and richly supportive community.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul LeBlanc\n\nPresident of Southern New Hampshire University",

A couple of days ago I found myself pleading with my demographic of younger voters to choose remain, for the sakes of our futures, for it is we who will live the longest with the consequences of this referendum.\n\n“I’m so angry,” wrote one Twitter user . “A generation given everything: free education, golden pensions, social mobility, have voted to strip my generation’s future.” Another statement, from a commenter on the Financial Times website that has been widely shared , summed up the sense of furious betrayal among the young: “The younger generation has lost the right to live and work in 27 other countries. We will never know the full extent of lost opportunities, friendships, marriages and experiences we will be denied. Freedom of movement was taken away by our parents, uncles and grandparents in a parting blow to a generation that was already drowning in the debts of its predecessors.”\n\nBut worry not – Boris Johnson said this morning that young people can look forward to a “prosperous future” once “we take back control”. Except few of us are likely to believe his empty rhetoric.\n\nThree-quarters of young people – a massive mandate – are predicted to have voted remain , according to a YouGov poll , while those older than us made the decision to vote in favour of an uncertain vision of a future Britain that the young emphatically did not and do not want. Thank you to those baby boomers and their parents who either voted to stay, or who, in the days before the referendum, agreed to put aside their own feelings and vote on behalf of their children and grandchildren. We appreciate you trying.\n\nThere’s no point going into my own feelings about this result; I made that mistake after the general election and was mocked by rightwingers, as though openly acknowledging the fear and sadness you feel when a political result potentially has very real consequences for your family means that you are somehow overwrought and pathetic. But what I will say is that if you are young and you are experiencing feelings of fury and heartbreak about the result, you are justified in doing so. The political is personal; the way that the future weeks, months and years play out will have powerful, definable consequences on the way you live. This is one of those momentous turning points in our personal timelines; if you’re pissed off, you are right to be.\n\nAnd to the 16-year-olds who were denied the right to participate in this referendum : there isn’t much that I can say to make you feel better, except that the majority of us tried to have your backs. The coming years will see, I imagine, perhaps your first experience of how politics – that cocky and inscrutable performance that plays out through your screens – can breach the disconnect and impinge on concrete aspects of your own life.\n\nYes, as a demographic, we have lost, but at the same time we have made a powerful statement\n\nIt’s a lesson that I feel my own generation learned too late, the result of which has been apathy, a lack of political engagement, and the feeling that there is no point participating in a system that does not have our interests at heart. And so we do not vote as much as we should, or even bother to register, and then politicians continue to make policy without considering us. Because why should they tailor their policies to you, when they do not feel they need your vote? Depressingly, and despite having the power to swing the result, it is predicted that turnout among young people was low – though we won’t know exactly how low just yet – and for this we can only blame ourselves.\n\nIf you are young, and especially if you voted, I hope that the outcome of this referendum doesn’t put you off voting again. Yes, as a demographic, we have lost, but at the same time we have made a powerful statement about the kind of country we want to live in. That we are to be deprived of it is a crying shame, but at least we know that we are part of a collective of people who want a better world.",

  "latent_26113": "By allegedly backing the Séléka rebels in early 2013, President Déby of Chad thought he could finally solve his southern problem. His plan backfired dramatically.\n\nBy Celeste Hicks\n\nFor those who keep an eye on goings-on in central Africa, it came as no surprise that the recent resignation of Michel Djotodia, the Central African Republic’s (CAR) short-lived president, came during a regional summit in Chad. As if the extent of Chad’s involvement in its southern neighbour wasn’t already apparent, the country had also managed to summon the CAR’s entire transitional parliament to N’Djamena, Chad’s capital, ahead of Djotodia’s announcement.\n\nHaving influence, however, doesn’t mean things will always go your way, and in a sense, Chad has some responsibility in the crisis that has unfolded in the CAR. A year ago, Chad is believed to have given tacit approval to the Séléka rebel alliance − then led by Djotodia − as they embarked on a second push towards Bangui. A number of irregular Chadian soldiers and former Chadian rebels are understood to have been among their ranks, and the Séléka eventually overthrew President François Bozizé. Since then, the situation in the CAR has turned out much worse than anyone could have anticipated at the time.\n\nA history of involvement\n\nThough it ended on difficult note, 2013 had started well for Chad with its swift response to France’s call for help in tackling Islamist militants in northern Mali. Around 2,000 Chadian soldiers were sent to Kidal, where their combat experience in the deserts of eastern Chad was invaluable. While northern Mali is far from fully pacified, France’s Operation Serval has been broadly seen as a success, and the jewel in the crown was Chad’s claim that they had killed one of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb’s key commanders, Abou Zeid.\n\nChad’s sacrifice in Mali – which included the deaths of over 30 soldiers – was perhaps not as well rewarded as President Idriss Déby Itno would have hoped; the command for the UN’s Mali mission (MINUSMA) was given to a Rwandan general rather than a Chadian one. Nevertheless, France, which has around 1,000 soldiers in the Chadian cities of N’Djamena and Abéché as part of its ongoing military presence in the country − known as Operation Épervier − was grateful, and reportedly sent teams to Faya-Largeau in the north of Chad to look for ways to secure the Libyan border. However, it was to events south of Chad, where the CAR was quietly disintegrating, that attention would soon turn.\n\nChad and the CAR have a long history of involvement, dating back to the 1980s when Libyan forces used bases near the CAR-Chadian border from which to launch attacks against Hissène Habré, Chad’s dictator at the time. More recently, President Déby was involved in the installation of François Bozizé in 2003, giving the renegade general sanctuary during his campaign against then-president Ange-Félix Patassé. And even more recently, Déby made the significant move of withdrawing his support of Bozizé.\n\nDéby shows few signs of stepping back from involvement any time soon. “With the fall of Gaddafi, Chad’s Idriss Déby has become the regional kingmaker and shows no sign of leaving CAR alone,” writes Keith Somerville, Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies.\n\nOne reason for Chad’s interest in its neighbour is the continued activity of Chadian rebels in northern CAR. Many who took part in the attacks from 2008 to 2010 on N’Djamena and Abéché sought shelter in the north-west of the CAR, which was virtually untouched by Bangui’s authority. Here they mixed with Central African rebel groups, many of which later joined the Séléka coalition, and which have been operating in the Bria diamond-producing region for many years.\n\nOne reading of Déby’s decision to back the Séléka over his former protégé Bozizé is that the Chadian president was emboldened by his foreign policy success in Mali and wanted to put an end to the constant rebellions in the CAR. According to a UN security adviser in N’Djamena, it seemed Déby calculated that his former rebel opponents could be drawn into Séléka’s fight, pulling them away from Chadian territory.\n\nDéby’s miscalculation\n\nIt now seems clear that decision to switch allegiance to Séléka was “indeed a miscalculation” as Roland Marchal, a Chad expert at Sciences-Po University in Paris, puts it, adding that it is not clear who among Déby’s inner circle actually made the decision.\n\nWhile Chad cannot be blamed for the sectarian hatred which has ripped the CAR apart, it played a significant role in the lead up to Bozizé’s overthrow, and its continued interference has not been welcomed by some of the CAR’s political class. “It is vital that our sovereignty is respected,” says Martin Ziguélé, an opposition leader currently living in Paris, “we can’t keep asking for outside help, we have to sort these problems out for ourselves.”\n\nThere are further costs associated with Déby’s decision to allow Chadian soldiers to move unofficially into the CAR early last year to join the rebels. Indiscipline by Chadian soldiers comprises the reputation of the country’s military and has exposed the limits of Chad’s foreign policy being exercised through its army. In December, hundreds of Central Africans gathered at the airport to call for Djotodia and the Chadian contingent of the African Union peacekeeping force (MISCA) to leave, accusing the Chadians of supporting the Séléka. The Chadian response was to open fire, killing one person. And a few days later there were reports of Chadian soldiers fighting Burundian peacekeepers in the MISCA barracks. “Important questions have been raised about the actual quality of the chain of command within the Chadian contingent,” says Marchal.\n\nDéby’s bottom line has always been survival. He came to power through a desert rebellion 23 years ago and is acutely aware that he may leave power in a similar manner. Rather than ending instability, however, his decision to tacitly support the Séléka has made the situation on Chad’s southern border worse than ever. The country is now faced with thousands of displaced citizens − some of them Chadians who had lived in the CAR for years, trying to get home − and the prospect of recriminations and violence across the border for months to come.\n\nCorrection 29/01/14: The third paragraph of the section “A history of involvement” originally stated that Libya established bases in the CAR near the Chadian border to attack Chad in the 1970s. But, while bases were established in the 1970s, they were not used until the 1980s to attack Habré ruled Chad. This has now been corrected.\n\nI'm filtering the content inside the main loop",

But that may be an understatement.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, which funds much of the same basic biomedical research that Zuckerberg and Chan’s new initiative will, spends 10 times that much every year — and there is still plenty of disease to go around.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan. Jeff Chiu / AP\n\nWhat's more, many other organizations have already been spending far more than that with the same goals.\n\nHere’s a quick look at some of them:\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nThe NIH has a 2016 annual budget of $32 billion, which goes to researching causes of disease, treatments for them and vaccines to prevent them. It helps find and develop early stage drugs and looks at a variety of ways to help prevent diseases ranging from Alzheimer’s to Zika.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nThe CDC’s annual budget of $7 billion goes to helping fight disease outbreaks but also pays for research and action on ways to prevent both everyday diseases, such as diabetes and heart diseases, as well as outbreaks of the weird stuff like Ebola and bird flu.\n\nRelated: Facebook Founder's Pledge to End All Disease\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nThe FDA’s annual budget of $4.7 billion goes to approving new drugs, vaccines and other treatments, as well as policing products to make sure they are being used properly. The FDA also does its own research into diagnosing, preventing and treating diseases.\n\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute\n\nThe privately funded, virtual institute supports individual investigators who want to work a little outside the traditional lines of academia, as well as those firmly in the mainstream. It’s got $18.2 billion in assets, and says it has paid out $8 billion in direct support over 10 years.\n\nGates Foundation\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has given more than $10 billion to various efforts to fight AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, among other ills.\n\nRelated: White House Pitches Brain Mapping Project\n\nWellcome Trust\n\nBritain’s Wellcome Trust charity has a pot of about 18 billion pounds — about $23.4 billion at current exchange rates — and has committed to spending $1.3 billion a year over the next five years on research into the biosciences and \"the discovery, invention, improvement, development and application of treatments, cures, diagnostics, and other medicinal agents, methods and processes that may in any way relieve illness, disease, disability or disorders of whatever nature in human beings or animal or plant life.\"\n\nPrivate drug companies\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which represents drug and vaccine companies, says its members spent $58.8 billion in research and development in 2015.

  "latent_26175": "What words do you even use to describe LeBron James' 61-point night against the Charlotte Bobcats?\n\n\"Phenomenal. Amazing. Stupendous. Immaculate,\" Chris Bosh said after Monday's game, via the Miami Herald. Shane Battier added, \"Wilt Chamberlain-esque,\" pointing to the fact James did it on 22-for-33 shooting.\n\nHere's the phenomamazimmaculendous shot chart:\n\nThe 22 field goals marked a new career high, and he's never made more than eight threes in a game. The craziest part was that, through three quarters, he was 8-for-8 from long distance. James made Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, an excellent all-around defender, and the Charlotte Bobcats, the sixth best defensive team in the league per Basketball Reference, look utterly helpless. Double teams did nothing to disrupt James' rhythm, even when an extra man was sent as soon as he passed halfcourt.\n\nJames also shot 9-for-12 from the free throw line, and added seven rebounds, five assists and just two turnovers in 41 minutes.\n\nThe nutty numbers don't even totally do justice to how easy James made everything look. James took a few heat-check jumpers, but he wasn't exactly forcing the issue. Even when the shots were tough, they almost all felt like they came within the flow of the game:\n\nIn the wake of James' destruction, it's worth taking a gander at James' top scoring nights. His second-highest scoring total came almost nine years ago in Toronto, where he scored 56 points on 18-for-36 shooting, playing all 48 minutes. It was his first 50-point night in the NBA and, as insane as that was, the difference in the shot charts provides a glimpse into how his game has changed since then. There's more midrange stuff here:\n\nIn terms of James' three-pointers, the only night that compares to the Bobcats game was in February of 2009 in Milwaukee, where James went 8-for-11 from beyond the arc en route to 55 points. Even then, though, there were a bunch of midrange misses:\n\nAside from Monday night, the closest James got to perfection was probably the night he dropped 51 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists against Dwight Howard's Orlando Magic in February of 2011. He shot 17-for-25 that night, hot from just about everywhere. A couple of things differentiate the Charlotte game from all the others, though, even beyond the mask he was wearing. First, it was the first of James' 50-plus-point nights that took place in a home game. Second, according to ESPN's Tom Haberstroh, this was James' first dunk-less game since January.\n\nHe dropped 61 without dunking. Pretty sure even Wilt Chamberlain never did that.",

  "latent_26282": "When Narendra Nayak, a former assistant professor of biochemistry from the Mangalore-based Kasturba Medical College, decided to learn karate and armed himself with a nunchaku, it wasn't because he had been watching Bruce Lee movies. Nayak turned to self-defence lessons after escaping three murderous attacks on his life. Twice, his assaulters snapped the brake cable of his scooter. One attack left him with head injuries. The former professor was being targeted for challenging superstitions, exposing miracles and taking on 'godmen' and 'tantriks'. Undaunted, 62-year-old Nayak, who is now the president of the Federation of Indian Rationalists' Association - an umbrella body of about 85 rationalist, atheist, sceptic and science organisations in India - continues to campaign for rationalism.\n\nLike him, Sanal Edamaruku, the 58-year-old president of Rationalist International, which has more than 100,000 members, has also escaped numerous attacks. One of them took place in a Delhi high-society house where devotees of a baba, or godman, had gathered to watch him perform a special fire ritual for the electoral success of a prominent politician. \"When the godman lifted two red-hot flaming pans, holding them triumphantly in his naked hands, I challenged him and revealed that the pots had a cool base due to heat isolation,\" says Edamaruku. So furious was the 'holy man' that he tried to smash Edamaruku's face with the flaming pans. A duck in time saved the rationalist from getting singed.\n\nIn Punjab, 64-year-old Megh Raj Mitter, the founder of Bathinda-based Tarksheel Society, recalls how a thousand or so protesters marched to his house when he used cut-and-dry logic to explain the 'miracle' of Ganesha idols drinking milk. \"I had to call for police protection,\" says Mitter. \"Threats,\" he says, \"are a part of a rationalist's life.\" With the growing world of atheists and agnostics posing a greater challenge to firmly-rooted beliefs and practices, such threats are only becoming louder and more vicious.\n\n* * *\n\nBut the recent signs which indicate that a greater number of people are moving away from religion don't augur well for the multi-million dollar industry built around faith and beliefs. According to 'The Global Religious Landscape', a new study of world faiths conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, people with no religious affiliation or the 'unaffiliated' are today the third-largest global group after Christians and Muslims.\n\n'Unaffiliated' is defined as those who might have spiritual beliefs but profess no established religion, such as atheists, agnostics. The 'Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism,' published by market research and polling firm Worldwide Independent Network/Gallup International Association, has found that the number of non-religious people in India is also on the rise. In 2005, 87 per cent of Indians said they were religious. In 2013, the number was down to 81 per cent. The survey also found that worldwide, atheism is up 3 per cent.\n\nFor the rationalists, this is a victory of sorts. There are more than a hundred rationalist groups with thousands of members and supporters across India. The Vijayawada-based Atheist Centre was founded in 1940 to bring about social change in rural Andhra Pradesh. Patna is the headquarters for Bihar Buddhiwadi Samaj. Kerala, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Haryana, Odisha, Jharkhand, each has at least one rationalist society. \"We have observed that the fascination for the supernatural exists across states, classes and cultures,\" says Nayak.\n\nThere are, however, some region- or culture-specific superstitions and practices. Avinash Patil, the state chairman of Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (Committee for Eradication of Blind Faith) which was founded by Narendra Dabholkar, the rationalist who was shot dead in Pune last week for his fight against and black magic, says, \"In Vidarbha and north Maharashtra, the practice of witch-hunting is prevalent.\" In the Marathwada region, he comes across cases of women getting 'possessed by sprits'. \"These are basically mental disorders with physical manifestations,\" says Patil. Women in any case tend to be more superstitious than men, say the rationalists. \"While religions, faith, rules and regulations are all male-dominated, the responsibility of carrying them forward to the next generation is the woman's. She is not given time to step out of her house or experience the world outside her community or village,\" says Patil who has been a pro-active rationalist for 25 years. The workers of the organisation, which has 230 branches in 35 districts, have often been threatened and thrashed. Dabholkar's murder has shocked them, but they are going ahead with all planned programmes.\"It is remarkable that there has never been any threat or attack from common believers in order to defend their faith. But we are hated by those who fear us because we are cutting the ground under their feet,\" says Edamaruku. He has been living in Finland since a case was lodged against him for hurting religious sentiments after his examination of a so-called miracle of a 'dripping Jesus' at the Church of Our Lady of Velankanni, Mumbai. He had traced the 'miracle' to some leaky pipes near the statue. The church said it would drop the charges if he apologised. \"Besides infuriated godmen, there are sometimes small groups of fundamentalists out to harm us. They generally don't swing into action on their own accord, but can easily be driven into frenzy,\" he says. The mechanism is the same. \"The attackers span and tap all religious communities and traditional superstitions. It's never Hinduism versus Islam or Christianity, or religiosity versus rationalism, as they try to make us believe,\" he says.\n\nRationalists reveal the tricks of godmen and tantriks and teach their victims how to perform these by themselves. The experience, for example, of creating 'holy ash' (see box) is a great boost for people's confidence.\n\n* * *Why just villages, every city too has its share of faith-healers who attract people from across religions. One of them, who lives in the Sarai Kale Khan settlement in south Delhi, uses mustard oil and grass to \"brush away\" jaundice. He places the dish containing oil and grass on the head of the patient. The oil turns a deep yellow. Then he declares: \"(the oil has soaked up his jaundice).\" This exercise is carried out on the patient for three consecutive days. \"Thedoes not demand money; people pay him whatever they can,\" says Nazia Khan, who got her six-year-old son 'treated' from this faith-healer. Khan, who works as a domestic help in Nizamuddin, was getting her son treated at the nearby government dispensary, but the moment she heard about this, she stopped the prescribed medicine and turned to faith-healing.\n\nThen there are the faith-healers of the elite - the tarot card-readers, astrologers, palmists, numerologists and past-life regression therapists. Taking on rationalists, Gurgaon-based Yogesh Choudhary, hypnotherapist, past life regression therapist and director of the Indian Institute of Hypnotherapy, says, \"A rationalist is an ignorant man who will believe only what can be seen and not what can be experienced.\" As to how long past-life regression therapy can take to cure a person, the 71-year-old hypnotist says it depends on how willing the person is to yield and go into a trance and how long the person has been on this planet. \"How can I say instantly whether he is a thousand lives old or if he is a new soul? It depends on how much muck from his past lives he is carrying in his soul.\" So, where are the \"new souls\" being created or manufactured? To that he says, \"You have to experience it to understand it.\"\n\nPractically every rationalist organisation now has an open challenge for godmen. Some have offered up to Rs 2 crore in rewards. The challenges: read the serial number of a sealed currency note; stand on burning cinders for half a minute without blistering the feet; move or bend a solid object using psychokinetic power; read thoughts of a person using telepathic powers, et cetera. So far, not one person has taken up the challenge, they say.\n\nDismissing the debate between the rational and the irrational, social theorist Ashis Nandy says, \"Everyone is rational.\" The godman, he explains, is rational because he is a hardcore businessman who knows where his money is coming from. \"The believer is rational because he is using his rationale to negotiate with his insecurity. While the rationalists have the right to fight this, people will continue to believe what they want to, especially if the stakes are high like in the case of film personalities and politicians.\" Rationalists know theirs is a tough job. \"Billions of rupees are riding on faith which is beamed into our homes even through television,\" says Biplab Das, general secretary, of Kolkata-based Science and Rationalists' Association of India. Nayak, who calls himself a \"virulent rationalist\", is however confident that a slow change is in the air. More and more rationalists, he says, are coming out of the closet.\n\nTHE 'MIRACLES' OF 'GODMEN'\n\nFirst, a warning:try this at home or office. Now, the trick. 'Godmen' who claim they can eat fire simply use the pure form of camphor. A burning cube of pure camphor will not singe the palm as long as the person keeps shifting its position. Magicians and 'miracle-mongers' use it to their advantage. It is also possible to put a cube of burning camphor in the mouth for a few seconds without getting burnt. When the tongue starts to feel hot, the 'godman' simply breathes out and closes his mouth. And the fire goes out.\n\nConjuring ash (vibhuti) from air\n\nThere's a reason why a 'godman' waves his hand in the air like a magician while performing this 'miracle'. Hidden between his thumb and index finger is a dry pellet of ash created by mixing powdered ash and starch solution. When waving his hand, he brings the ash pellet to his fingertips, crushes it, and lo behold, he has created 'holy ash'. 'Ash' can also be produced from an aluminum coin, like the 5-, 10- or 20-paisa coin, by rubbing mercuric chloride solution on it. The grey powder will continue to form on the coin for hours, depending on the amount of mercuric chloride used. Even if you dust away this ash, it will 'miraculously' start forming again.\n\nLevitating in the air\n\nThe robes of the 'godman' play a critical role in this 'miracle'. He 'godman' appears to be suspended mid-air, with his arm resting on a bamboo stick by his side. The bamboo stick, in fact, has a bracket attached to it on which the man is seated. The bracket is cleverly concealed by his robes. The bamboo stick too has an iron rod running through its hollow inside which is securely anchored in the ground.\n\nProducing fire through mind power\n\nThe yogi demonstrates his powers by setting wood scrapings on fire simply by pouring ghee on them. What he's actually done is hidden potassium permanganate under the wood. What he pours on it is not ghee but glycerin, which is known to react violently when mixed with potassium permanganate. The chemical reaction generates heat and produces smoke and fire.\n\nWalking on fire\n\nThe 'godman' might be walking on a bed of burning coal which has rock salt sprinkled on it. Rock salt attracts moisture and thus, brings the temperature down. The chance of getting scathed is bleak if the person walks on these rock salt-coated embers within three seconds or so. There's another way of doing this. Some 'holy men' first pour water on themselves, taking care to properly wet their feet. They then walk around the bed of coals while pretending to be praying. In the process, their feet get coated with wet clay and they are able to quickly 'walk on fire' without getting singed.",
  "latent_26290": "NOTE: This blog post was written prior to Ansible including the gluster_volume module, and is out of date; the examples still work, but Ansible for DevOps has been since updated with a more relevant and complete example. You can read about it here: Simple GlusterFS Setup with Ansible (Redux).\n\nModern infrastructure often involves some amount of horizontal scaling; instead of having one giant server, with one storage volume, one database, one application instance, etc., most apps use two, four, ten, or dozens of servers.\n\nMany applications can be scaled horizontally with ease, but what happens when you need shared resources, like files, application code, or other transient data, to be shared on all the servers? And how do you have this data scale out with your infrastructure, in a fast but reliable way? There are many different approaches to synchronizing or distributing files across servers:\n\nSet up rsync either on cron or via inotify to synchronize smaller sets of files on a regular basis.\n\nStore everything in a code repository (e.g. Git, SVN, etc.) and deploy files to each server using Ansible.\n\nHave one large volume on a file server and mount it via NFS or some other file sharing protocol.\n\nHave one master SAN that's mounted on each of the servers.\n\nUse a distributed file system, like Gluster, Lustre, Fraunhofer, or Ceph.\n\nSome options are easier to set up than others, and all have benefits—and drawbacks. Rsync, git, or NFS offer simple initial setup, and low impact on filesystem performance (in many scenarios). But if you need more flexibility and scalability, less network overhead, and greater fault tolerance, you will have to consider something that requires more configuration (e.g. a distributed file system) and/or more hardware (e.g. a SAN).\n\nGlusterFS is licensed under the AGPL license, has good documentation, and a fairly active support community (especially in the #gluster IRC channel). But to someone new to distributed file systems, it can be daunting to get set it up the first time.\n\nConfiguring Gluster - Basic Overview\n\nTo get Gluster working on a basic two-server setup (so you can have one folder that's synchronized and replicated across the two servers—allowing one server to go down completely, and the other to still have access to the files), you need to do the following:\n\nInstall Gluster server and client on each server, and start the server daemon. (On both servers) Create a 'brick' directory (where Gluster will store files for a given volume). (On both servers) Create a directory to be used as a mount point (a directory where you'll have Gluster mount the shared volume). (On both servers) Use gluster peer probe to have Gluster connect to the other server. (On one server) Use gluster volume create to create a new Gluster volume. (On one server) Use gluster volume start to start the new Gluster volume. (On both servers) Mount the gluster volume (adding a record to /etc/fstab so the mount is permanent).\n\nAdditionally, you need to make sure you have the following ports open on both servers (so Gluster can communicate): TCP ports 111, 24007, 24009-24010, 38465-38466 (or 49152-49153 for Gluster 3.4+), and UDP port 111. (You need to add an additional TCP port in the 49xxx range for each extra server in your Gluster cluster.)\n\nConfiguring Gluster with Ansible\n\nThe following example is adapted from the gluster.yml file I'm using for my Raspberry Pi Dramble cluster (a cluster of Raspberry Pis running a Drupal 8 website).\n\nFirst, we need to punch a hole in the firewall for all the required ports. I am using the geerlingguy.firewall role on all my servers, so in my vars files, I added:\n\nfirewall_allowed_tcp_ports:\n\n- 22\n\n- 80\n\n# For Gluster.\n\n- 111\n\n# Port-mapper for Gluster 3.4+.\n\n# - 2049\n\n# Gluster Daemon.\n\n- 24007\n\n# 24009+ for Gluster <= 3.3; 49152+ for Gluster 3.4+ (one port per server).\n\n- 24009\n\n- 24010\n\n- 24011\n\n# Gluster inline NFS server.\n\n- 38465\n\n- 38466\n\n- 38467\n\nfirewall_allowed_udp_ports:\n\n- 111\n\nNext, I'll include the geerlingguy.glusterfs role in my playbook to install GlusterFS on my servers (like most of the geerlingguy roles, this role works with Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, and CentOS):\n\nroles:\n\n- geerlingguy.firewall\n\n- geerlingguy.glusterfs\n\nThen, I include a separate task include file with the Gluster configuration in my main playbook:\n\ntasks:\n\n- include: gluster.yml\n\nInside that file:\n\n---\n\n- name: Ensure Gluster brick and mount directories exist.\n\nfile:\n\npath: \"{{ item }}\"\n\nstate: directory\n\nowner: root\n\ngroup: www-data\n\nmode: 0775\n\nwith_items:\n\n- \"{{ gluster_brick_dir }}\"\n\n- \"{{ gluster_mount_dir }}\"\n\n# Gluster volume configuration.\n\n- name: Check if Gluster volumes already exist.\n\nshell: \"gluster volume info\"\n\nchanged_when: false\n\nregister: gluster_volume_info\n\n- name: Connect to Gluster peers.\n\nshell: \"gluster peer probe {{ item }}\"\n\nregister: gluster_peer_probe\n\nchanged_when: \"'already in peer list' not in gluster_peer_probe.stdout\"\n\nfailed_when: false\n\nwith_items: groups.webservers\n\nwhen: \"'Volume Name: gluster' not in gluster_volume_info.stdout\"\n\n- name: Create Gluster volume.\n\nshell: \"gluster volume create {{ gluster_brick_name }} {{ gluster_brick_config }}\"\n\nregister: gluster_volume_create\n\nchanged_when: \"'successful' in gluster_volume_create.stdout\"\n\nwhen: \"inventory_hostname == groups.webservers[0] and 'Volume Name: gluster' not in gluster_volume_info.stdout\"\n\n- name: Ensure Gluster volume is started.\n\nshell: \"gluster volume start {{ gluster_brick_name }}\"\n\nregister: gluster_volume_start\n\nchanged_when: \"'successful' in gluster_volume_start.stdout\"\n\nwhen: \"inventory_hostname == groups.webservers[0] and 'Volume Name: gluster' not in gluster_volume_info.stdout\"\n\n# Mount configuration.\n\n- name: Ensure the Gluster volume is mounted.\n\nmount:\n\nname: \"{{ gluster_mount_dir }}\"\n\nsrc: \"{{ groups.webservers[0] }}:/{{ gluster_brick_name }}\"\n\nfstype: glusterfs\n\nopts: \"defaults,_netdev\"\n\nstate: mounted\n\nThe first task ensures the brick and mount directories exist and have the appropriate permissions for our application. Next, gluster peer probe links all the servers together. Then, on only one of the servers (in this case, the first of the webservers inventory group), the Gluster volume is created and started.\n\nFinally, an entry is added to /etc/fstab and then the volume is mounted at gluster_mount_dir (using Ansible's mount module, which configures /etc/fstab and mounts the volume for us).\n\nThere were a few different Jinja2 variables I used to make the Gluster configuration and volume mounting simple and flexible (a task include like this is very flexible and could be used for many different server configurations). Define these variables separately, like so:\n\ngluster_mount_dir: /mnt/gluster\n\ngluster_brick_dir: /srv/gluster/brick\n\ngluster_brick_name: gluster\n\n# Note: This is hardcoded for 2 webservers. Adjust accordingly.\n\ngluster_brick_config:\n\n\"replica 2 transport tcp\n\n{{ groups.webservers[0] }}:{{ gluster_brick_dir }}\n\n{{ groups.webservers[1] }}:{{ gluster_brick_dir }}\"\n\nMost of these vars are self-explanatory, but the gluster_brick_config variable deserves a little more explanation. That variable tells Gluster to set up two replicas (one full replica on each server), using the tcp transport method, then it lists each server that will have a share of the volume, followed by the path to that share.\n\nIf you have two servers, this should work perfectly. If you have three servers, you will need to adjust the configuration to either use three replicas or use a different data partitioning scheme. If you have four or more servers, you just need an even number of replicas to allow Gluster to replicate data appropriately.\n\nSummary\n\nDeploying distributed file systems like Gluster can seem challenging, but Ansible simplifies the process, and more importantly, does so idempotently; each time you run the playbook again, it will ensure everything stays configured as you want.\n\nAnsible 1.9.x's inclusion of the gluster_volume module will make this process even simpler, since the built-in module will handle edge cases and general configuration even better than we did above.\n\nThis example (derived from the Raspberry Pi Dramble project), and others like it, can be found in Ansible for DevOps.",
  "latent_26371": "This article is about the playing card. For other uses, see Ace (disambiguation)\n\nAn ace is a playing card, die or domino with a single pip. In the standard French deck, an ace has a single suit symbol (a heart, diamond, spade, or club) located in the middle of the card, sometimes large and decorated, especially in the case of the ace of spades. This embellishment on the ace of spades started when King James VI of Scotland and I of England required an insignia of the printing house to be printed on the ace of spades. This insignia was necessary for identifying the printing house and stamping it as having paid the new stamp tax.[1] Although this requirement was abolished in 1960, the tradition has been kept by many card makers.[2] In other countries the stamp and embellishments are usually found on ace cards; clubs in France, diamonds in Russia, and hearts in Genoa because they have the most blank space.\n\nThe word \"ace\" comes from the Old French word as (from Latin 'as') meaning 'a unit', from the name of a small Roman coin. It originally meant the side of a die with only one pip, before it was a term for a playing card.[3] Since this was the lowest roll of the die, it traditionally meant 'bad luck' in Middle English, but as the ace is often the highest playing card, its meaning has since changed to mean 'high-quality, excellence'.\n\nAce promotion [ edit ]\n\nHistorically, the ace had a low value and this still holds in many popular European games (in fact many European decks, including the French- and Latin-suited decks, do not use the \"A\" index, instead keeping the numeral \"1\"). The modern convention of \"ace high\" seemed to have happened in stages. Card games, before they arrived in Europe, had suits that were in reverse ranking. In the Chinese game of Mǎ diào, which lacked court cards, the suit of coins was inverted so the 1 of Coins was the highest in its suit.[4][5] In the Ganjifa games of Persia, India, and Arabia, only the pip cards of half the suits were reversed so the 1 ranked just below the lowest court card. This convention carried over to early European games like Ombre, Maw, and Trionfi (Tarot). During the 15th and 16th centuries, the ranking of all suits were becoming progressive. A few games from this period like Triomphe, has the ace between the ten and the jack. The earliest known game in which the ace is the highest card of its suit is Trappola.[6] In Ace-Ten games like Brusquembille, Pinochle and Sixty-six, the ace dragged the 10 along with it to the top so the ranking became A-10-K. Some games promoted the deuces and treys too like Put, Truc, and Tressette. \"King high\" games were still being made in the 17th century, for example Cribbage. Many games, such as poker and blackjack, allow the player to choose whether the ace is used as a high or low card. This duality allows players in some other games to use it as both at once; some variants of Rummy allow players to form melds, of rank K-A-2 or similar. This is known colloquially as \"going around the corner\".\n\nIt was not only the French deck which experienced this promotion, but some games involving the Swiss and German deck also evolved into using the Daus (deuce) as the highest card.[7] The ace had disappeared during the 15th century, so the deuce took its place.[6] The Ass (ace) and Daus (deuce) were conflated into a single card and the names are used interchangeably along with Sau (sow) as early cards of that rank depicted a pig. Some decks in southern Germany use \"A\" for the index because \"D\" is reserved for Dame (Queen) in French-suited decks. Confusion is also avoided as German-suited decks lack numbered cards below \"7\" or \"6\". Despite using French-suited cards, Russians call the Ace a Deuce (tuz), a vestige of a period when German cards were predominant in central and eastern Europe.",
  "latent_26386": "ANN ARBOR—Parents with the most traditional beliefs about masculinity and femininity are likelier to view pay-to-play sports fees as too high for daughters compared with sons, a new study from the University of Michigan School of Kinesiology suggests.\n\n“Overall, gender role belief played a small but significant role in parents’ appraisals of the benefits of sports for girls versus boys,” said Kathryn Heinze, assistant professor of sport management. “On a large scale, even these small differences could potentially manifest in reduced opportunities for young female athletes.”\n\nBut there’s good news: In many cases, how parents feel about gender roles doesn’t lead to reduced opportunities for girls, Heinze said. Other studies have shown that if a child loves an activity, the parents typically support it.\n\n“You could think about, though, situations that exist where perhaps it’s a choice between sports and music, or maybe money is tight in the family,” Heinze said. “How parents feel about sports for their daughters may tip the scale in those situations. That is, of course, fine—parents should have influence, but we would want that influence to be unbiased in terms of gender.”\n\nIn conjunction with the C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital National Poll on Children’s Health, researchers surveyed a sample of 814 parents in 2012 to examine the relationship between parents’ gender role beliefs, views on the benefits of the monetary value of sports and types of sports their daughters play. The average cost to play a sport is $93 weekly, and 21 percent paid $150 or more.\n\nRoughly 37 percent of parents held traditional beliefs about masculinity and femininity as defined in the study.\n\nTo define traditional and progressive belief systems, researchers asked study participants how they felt about statements associated with male or female activities or behaviors. Two sample statements include: “A woman should be as free as a man to propose marriage” or “If families can afford it, women should stay home with their children instead of working.”\n\nOf the 269 parents of girls who deemed fees “too high” or “much too high,” 45 percent held traditional beliefs, compared to 39 percent of parents with progressive beliefs. Among parents who considered fees “much too high,” 50 percent held traditional beliefs, versus 36 percent with progressive beliefs.\n\nOverall, 19 percent of girls participated in so-called masculine sports and 69 percent had parents with progressive gender role beliefs. So what do these numbers mean for young female athletes? Studies in the 1990s found fairly large differences in parental views about the appropriateness of sport for girls versus boys.\n\n“That we found the same, albeit smaller, differences suggests that the gender bias gap in sport may be decreasing, but likely still exists,” Heinze said. More female role models and successful female athletes will continue to help dispel notions that certain sports are masculine or feminine, or that one sex benefits more from participating, she said.\n\nFeb. 4 is the 29th annual National Girls & Women in Sports Day. A panel of Olympic athletes and experts will convene on Capitol Hill to discuss the importance of girls and women in sports and expanding athletic opportunities.\n\nThe research was funded by the U-M Sport, Health, and Activity Research and Policy Center, the Institute for Research on Women and Gender, the School of Kinesiology, and the Women’s Sports Foundation.\n\nCo-authors include Justin Heinze of the U-M Department of Health Behavior and Health Education, School of Public Health; and Dr. Matthew Davis, Amy Butchart, Dianne Singer and Sarah Clark from the Child Health Evaluation and Research Unit and the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, School of Medicine.\n\nThe study appears online in the journal Youth & Society: Gender Role Beliefs and Parents’ Support for Athletic Participation\n\nMore information:",

A couple of times, we’ve talked,” the Governor told reporters.\n\n“They certainly do want to move forward in some way.”\n\nLegislators, he said, will want a majority of GOP lawmakers to sign up to support HB2’s repeal before they go ahead with a vote.\n\n“My argument to them is that there are enough overall votes -even if you don’t have a majority [in the] Republican caucuses – to pass repeal. And I’m urging them to do so. It’s too important to our state,” he added.\n\nHB2 was passed last March in response to a local ordinance in Charlotte, which protected the rights of trans people to use gender-appropriate public bathrooms.\n\nBut the state-wide law HB2 rolled back any local ordinances protecting against discrimination based on gender identity and banned local authorities from reintroducing them.\n\nIt also dictated that residents of North Carolina could only use a restroom which corresponds to the sex stated on their birth certificate.\n\nBack in December, at a special legislative session called to repeal HB2, efforts to do so collapsed amid negotiations between lawmakers.\n\nGovernor Cooper has advised that Charlotte not re-introduce its city-wide law to protect LGBT people, in an effort to appease Republicans in the state government to still push ahead with a repeal of HB2.\n\n“Charlotte has taken the step that Republican leaders wanted them to take, and now we need to keep pushing the legislature. The ball’s in their court. It’s time for them to act,” Cooper said.\n\n“I don’t see that there’s any need for [Charlotte City Council] to [re-enact the ordinance], no.”\n\nThe Federal Government is currently suing North Carolina over HB2, but a countersuit launched by the state was dropped earlier this year.\n\nA number of other states have banned their employees from travelling there while HB2 is in effect.\n\nCooper has continually hit out at HB2 and in his role as Attorney General and has refused to defend it in court.\n\nHe also promised that if he was elected, he would work to repeal the bill as soon as possible.\n\nNorth Carolina has suffered national condemnation for being the first state to introduce anti-LGBT legislation.\n\nAlready, a number of entertainers and major sports events have withdrawn from the state.\n\nRecently a newspaper that has supported McCrory for quarter of a century refused to endorse him over HB2.",

Protesters blocked Highway 6 northwest of the camp Friday and locked arms at the entrance to a Dakota Access staging area just west of Mandan on Saturday.\n\nOrganizers have been planning a series of demonstrations nationwide Tuesday since before the election. The goal of those 153 events nationwide — including one at Standing Rock with activist Robert Kennedy Jr. — is to push President Obama to take action to delay or stop the 1,172-mile project through executive action.\n\nThat message is more urgent now, said Jade Begay, an organizer on the ground at Oceti Sakowin who works with the Indigenous Environmental Network.\n\n“Our fight has gotten a lot harder, but it actually makes us stronger,” Begay said. “This is our time to put pressure on President Obama.”\n\nThe Obama administration took action this fall, but the decisions lacked finality.\n\nThree federal agencies forced the delay of an easement to drill beneath Lake Oahe to complete the final 90-115 feet of North Dakota construction in September, just hours after a judge ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had properly consulted Standing Rock on the project’s potential impact to culturally sensitive sites.\n\nObama said a re-route was on the table earlier this month, but the Justice Department said Thursday it plans to offer a “path forward” on the easement.\n\nTrump’s election has given pipeline supporters hope for an end to such rhetoric, and with good reason.\n\nDrummers lead a group of Dakota Access Pipeline protesters to the Oceti Sakowin campground after a special ceremony honoring Native American veterans took place on N.D.

Kelcy Warren, CEO of Dakota Access operator Energy Transfer Partners, contributed $103,000 to Trump’s campaign.\n\nTrump’s priorities for his first 100 days include a re-start to the stalled Keystone XL pipeline and an across-the-board expansion of oil, coal and natural gas production.\n\nIn a call with analysts last week, Warren called Trump’s commitment to infrastructure “refreshing.”\n\nNone of that news has slowed the steady growth of the North Dakota opposition camps.\n\nThe flags of hundreds of indigenous tribes worldwide fly in the right-of-way along Highway 1806 leading to Oceti Sakowin and line the well-traveled dirt paths that weave through it.

A wooden enclosure for the camp’s water supply is rising just south of the sacred fire and yurts are popping up all along the grounds to prepare for the coming winter.\n\n“It’s definitely grown,” Begay said. “I don’t think anyone’s lost spirit.”\n\nSonny Iron Cloud, 25, has watched the growth, as well.

Major U.S. science competitions aren’t dominated by the MIT or Virginia Tech, but a relatively small country of South Korea.\n\nOur science, math, and engineering education is in the state of crisis. The reasons are too many to name. Our educational system focuses solely on standardized testing of math and language, leaving all other subjects, science, art, engineering, social studies… behind. So behind that most schools do not even teach science and social studies in elementary years.\n\nBy the time students reach upper elementary school, they are basically science illiterate. The mystery of polar regions temperature difference and the parallel electrical circuit are both equally perplexing and beyond understanding. Failure to accumulate scientific knowledge during early childhood and elementary years is a sure recipe to increasing absence of U.S. youth in science fields.\n\nStill too many teachers and parents have never heard of STEM. STEM is an integrated approach of teaching science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through hands-on project based learning. Of course STEM incorporates arts and language in all aspects of its design, as well. STEM is what our educational system should look like. Unfortunately, science, technology and engineering isn’t on the end of the year state standardized test.\n\nWhat is STEM good for? STEM not only teaches cross cutting, comprehensive multi-disciplinary curriculum but it also teaches students problem solving and critical thinking. It increases both student I.Q., as well as, academic performance and achievement.\n\nSTEM promotions are great. I love that companies like Barnes & Noble are trying to introduce the concept and idea. Still, most STEM programs are geared toward high school students. If we wait until high school to introduce STEM, we have already lost an enormous number of student potential.

  "latent_26941": "Male employees of Archie Comic Publications Inc., publishers of the iconic Archie Comics, are suing CEO Nancy Silberkleit for sexual discrimination and harassment the New York Daily News reported today. They stated in their filing that she referred to them as ‘penis’ instead of by their name. Her lawyer contends the case should be thrown out because white men are not part of a ‘protected class.’\n\n“Plaintiffs fail to allege that any such comments were directed at any of the plaintiffs in particular, or they could cause extreme emotional distress even if they had been,” her court filings say. Thomas Brown, Silberkleit’s lawyer, said the employees’ allegations don’t even rise to the level of gender discrimination. “It’s absurd,” he said.\n\nSilberkleit’s tenure as CEO of the company has been beset with troubles with employees and legal fights with her fellows in upper management. Taking over after her husband, Michael Silberkleit who’s father co-founded the company in 1939, then called MJL Magazines, she quickly got into a conflict with fellow CEO Jonathan Goldwater. Goldwater filed a complaint in 2011 stating that she was unstable and threatened to run the company into the ground. The dispute was settled last year with an arrangement in which Silberkleit would have limited interactions with employees and an appointed go-between would represent her interests with the company.\n\nThe peace didn’t last long, however, with Samuel Levitin, Silberkleit’s go-between whom she herself appointed, filing papers in Westchester Surrogate’s Court charging that she’d become ‘unhinged.’ He said she needed to be dismissed from the company entirely.\n\nSilberkleit responded to the charges by accusing Levitin with sexual harassment and demanded he be fired. That case is still pending.\n\nThese troubles were followed with the current $32.5 million lawsuit filed by Archie employees which also seeks a court order keeping Silberkleit at least two miles away from the office. They say her “deliberate and disturbed campaign of outrageous conduct” has them so concerned an armed guard has been posted in the office.\n\nThey allege that Silberkleit invited the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club to Archie’s Mamaroneck offices in an apparent effort to “intimidate” them. She is also reported to have repeatedly inquired about the whereabouts of the handgun and 750 rounds of ammo her husband kept at the office. The suit also alleged she stalked them and their families.\n\nSilberkleit insists these allegations are untrue and calls them “twisted.”\n\n“Archie Comics to me stands for very high values that are global values,” including “community, support and laughter,” she stated while touting her role as Archie Comics’ CEO and primary publicist.\n\n“Everyone has that, ‘I heart Archie’ in them, and I’m proud of that.”\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/archie-boss-calls-male-employees-penis-article-1.1534462\n\nhttp://www.archiecomics.com/\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Comics",
  "latent_26982": "Politicians, unions use the “carrot and stick” to try to derail Detroit Public Schools struggle\n\nBy Nancy Hanover\n\n6 February 2016\n\nAs Detroit teachers are joined by those in Chicago in the fight against layoffs, cuts in benefits, intolerable working conditions and the attack on public education, Democratic and Republican politicians, along with union officials, are going into high gear to try to block independent action by angry educators.\n\nWhile this week’s announcement that Detroit Public Schools (DPS) emergency manager Darnell Earley has submitted his resignation, effective February 29, was welcomed by teachers, a sober assessment of the political challenges ahead is necessary.\n\nRepublican Governor Rick Snyder, facing the twin crises of lead poisoning in Flint and protests of teachers in Detroit, evidently opted to throw Earley overboard. This is an attempt to mollify growing public outrage directed at his increasingly discredited administration. In no way, however, did it signal a retreat in his efforts to ram through a bipartisan reorganization of Detroit schools that opens wide the floodgates for charters and education privatizers.\n\nTo that end, a whole series of reactionary political initiatives have been taken this week aimed at diverting, convincing, or coercing teachers who are fighting to defend public education and their own livelihoods.\n\nSnyder’s first order of business was to line up two well-known political operatives as candidates for interim head of DPS. Both are Democrats with substantial track records in the service of big business politics, but who are considered more palatable to the unions and Democratic Party establishment.\n\nThey are Charlie Beckham—who went to jail for his 1984 conviction in bribe-taking as the city’s water and sewerage department director, and has worked for just about every Detroit mayor since Coleman Young—and Tonya Allen, president and CEO of the Skillman Foundation, a major corporate player involved in the education privatization business. As co-chair of the Coalition for the Future of Detroit Schoolchildren, Allen’s general agreement with the plans to dissolve the district along the lines recommended by the governor and his bipartisan collaborators is well known.\n\nAt the same time, the Michigan legislature is moving quickly against teachers. A series of measures have been put forward alongside the Earley resignation to criminalize teacher protests and suppress the independent initiative of rank-and-file educators.\n\nDetroit teachers demonstrating last month\n\nOn Wednesday, February 3, a vicious package of anti-strike legislation passed the Michigan Education Committee. The bills had been amended into an even more draconian version than originally proposed.\n\nThese nationally-unprecedented measures would subject teachers involved in “strike” activity to fines of $5,000 a day and possible loss of pay, along with a possible two-year suspension of state teaching certification. They define “strike action” as at least one school employee “found to be engaging in the activity.” School districts that fail to enforce sanctions would be fined 5 percent of their total state school aid. Finally, in efforts to make absolutely sure the unions police the membership, the bill calls for the dissolution of a school’s bargaining unit and the union’s ineligibility to represent teachers for five years “whether or not it agreed to the strike.” Michigan law already prohibits teacher strikes.\n\nOn Thursday, hearings began in the state legislature’s Senate Committee on Government Operations on Governor Snyder’s restructuring plan, which would dissolve the DPS as an educational entity and set up a new Detroit Community Schools (DCS). The complete reconstitution of the district has long been the goal of privatizers.\n\nWhile the exact scope and nature of the DCS will still be negotiated over the next few weeks, disputes between Michigan state Democrats and Republicans over the timing of school board elections and “local control” have nothing to do with improving schools and restoring “democracy.” On the contrary, they are essentially a question of which party will control which positions of power and how the profits from the dismantling of public education will be divvied up.\n\nMeanwhile, no matter who makes up the immediate school administration, a state-selected Financial Review Commission (FRC) will have dictatorial powers over spending, including all new contracts and collective bargaining agreements approved by the school board.\n\nThe mission of the FRC will be to impose further cost-cutting measures to satisfy bondholders and usher in additional for-profit education companies and charters. As the bills presently stand, the responsibility for $1.5 billion of unfunded pension liabilities lies with the new district, which inevitably means that massive cuts and attacks on teachers’ pensions will follow.\n\nAdditionally, the FRC is to have jurisdiction until the Detroit schools have at least three consecutive years of deficit-free budgets and the ability to borrow independently in the municipal securities market—an impossible condition given diminishing state funding for education, the unfunded pension liabilities and countless other objective factors like antiquated buildings and infrastructure.\n\nHowever, as educators and students face this frontal assault on the right to public education and basic rights, they face another enemy no less consciously opposed to their interests. At the very center of the conspiracy by the politicians to “convince” and “divert” teachers away from struggle is the Detroit Federation of Teachers (DFT) and its parent organization, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).\n\nAfter teachers conducted their independent campaign of sickouts—independent of the DFT—in January, interim president Ivy Bailey suddenly claimed that “the situation in the Detroit Public Schools is far worse than we ever imagined.” Bailey is a longtime union official and crony of former DFT president Keith Johnson, who worked for years to impose massive concessions upon the membership. She shares responsibility for overseeing the deterioration of learning conditions.\n\nUnable to stop the escalating protests on her own, Bailey called in AFT operative Ann Mitchell to oversee the local, and AFT President Randi Weingarten to address the membership and work behind the scenes with the Obama administration to undermine the protests. As a result of more sophisticated advice, the DFT has now launched a lawsuit over school conditions, brought in their own building inspectors and organized a series of public relations stunts.\n\nThese events are attempts at winning back teacher loyalty with a pretense of concern. Last weekend, the union organized a “Labor to Neighbor” series of walks near schools, which will be further embellished next week into a Tuesday “Day of Action” including a “walk-in” (teachers and parents are to walk to their schools next Tuesday and “garner support for teachers”), topped off with an “Interfaith Candlelight Vigil and Unity Rally.”\n\nNone of these impotent actions can—nor are they designed to—stop the very advanced plans in the state of Michigan to criminalize teachers’ protests and utilize the DPS debt to impose a reorganization of the district favorable to the charters and privatizers at the expense of teachers and students.\n\nFar from representing teachers, the DFT/AFT has worked every step of the way with the Democrats—like Earley, former emergency managers (all Democrats), Arne Duncan and the Obama administration—in imposing pro-corporate education reform, only seeking to ensure that they have a seat at the table and a portion of the spoils.\n\nThe unions have sought at all costs to keep teachers politically shackled to the Democratic Party, which under Obama has overseen the destruction of more than 300,000 teaching jobs, has cut federal aid to education under Title I and has used the full power of the Education Department to promote charter schools and private education businesses. As it did during the Detroit bankruptcy, the role of the Democratic Party, no less than the Republicans, is to enforce the dictates of the hedge fund managers and bondholders.\n\nTo defend public education, it is necessary for teachers to continue their independent initiatives, break from the unions and the two big business political parties, form rank-and-file committees in every school and link the struggle to defend education with the struggles of workers throughout the country.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

But he suffered a rib injury in the second quarter, and missed the rest of the game.\n\nAfter the game, Redskins head coach Jay Gruden suggested Kelley was dealing with a rib fracture. That brought a multi-week absence firmly into play, and surely sent Kelley’s fantasy owners to the waiver wire in their leagues looking to add Chris Thompson or Samaje Perine.\n\nThompson had two rushing touchdowns on Sunday, most notably a 61-yard run to pay dirt, along with three receptions for 29 yards. Perine got an extended opportunity with Kelley out, and finished the game with a pedestrian 67 yards on 21 carries (3.2 yards per carry).\n\nBut there is some good news regarding Kelley, and he’s now considered day-to-day with a rib cartilage injury.\n\n#Redskins coach Jay Gruden says RB Rob Kelley (rib cartilage) and TE Jordan Reed (chest contusion) are day-to-day.

Thompson’s role in the passing game is safe, regardless of Kelley’s status (seven receptions on 12 targets in two games this season), and he’s worth checking on despite being pretty widely owned in ESPN fantasy leagues (67.3 percent). In PPR formats, Thompson is a virtual must-add if he’s still available.\n\nPerine’s fantasy stock is the most affected by Kelley’s outlook, as he would step into the early down role. So his immediate appeal as a waiver wire addition is not quite as good now. But the rookie out of Oklahoma is very widely available (1.8 percent owned in ESPN leagues), and still worth considering as a stash in 12 and 14-team leagues.",
  "latent_27474": "ACCRA (Reuters) - Abolishing subsidies on fossil fuels could cut world greenhouse gas emissions by up to 6 percent and also nudge up world economic growth, a U.N. report showed on Tuesday.\n\nA labourer works at a coal factory in Baicheng county, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, January 7, 2007. REUTERS/China Daily\n\nSubsidies on oil, gas or coal are meant to help the poor by lowering the price of energy but the report, issued on the sidelines of a 160-nation U.N. climate meeting in Ghana, said they often backfired by mainly benefiting wealthier people.\n\nThe study estimated that energy subsidies, almost all for fossil fuels, totaled about $300 billion a year or 0.7 percent of world gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n“Cancelling these subsidies might reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 6 percent a year while contributing 0.1 percent to global GDP,” it said.\n\nPeople forced to pay higher prices for energy would likely cut back on use of fossil fuels, the main source of greenhouse gases from human activities.\n\n“Governments should urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones,” said Achim Steiner, head of the Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\n“Many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy,” he said in a statement.\n\nSubsidies were biggest in Russia, with about $40 billion a year spent mainly on making natural gas cheaper, ahead of Iran with $37 billion. China, Saudi Arabia, India, Indonesia, Ukraine and Egypt also had big subsidies on fuels.\n\n“Some countries spend more on subsidies than on health and education combined ... they stand in the way of more environmentally friendly technologies,” Kaveh Zahedi, climate change coordinator at UNEP, told a news conference.\n\nPOOR\n\nThe report said liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidies in India, aimed at getting fuel to poor households, totaled $1.7 billion in the first half of 2008. But the report said: “LPG subsidies are mainly benefiting higher-income households”.\n\nSmarter subsidies such as tax breaks, financial incentives or other market mechanisms could generate benefits for the economy and environment if properly targeted, it said. It pointed to subsidies to promote wind energy in Germany and Spain aimed at helping to shift from fossil fuels.\n\nWell-devised subsidies in Chile had spread rural electrification to 90 percent of the population from 50 percent in 12 years, it said.\n\nGovernments in Accra are working on the building blocks of a new climate treaty meant to be agreed at the end of 2009 to help slow warming temperatures that may bring more heatwaves, more powerful storms and disruptions to water and food supplies.\n\nUNEP also said Africa was starting to benefit from a U.N. project to help investments in clean technologies such as wind or geothermal power. Nations such as China, India and Brazil have so far won almost all of the 3,500 projects.\n\nNew projects had been registered in recent months in Mozambique, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mali and Senegal, UNEP spokesman Nick Nuttall said.\n\nAnd a UNEP study projected that Africa might get 230 such projects by 2012, generating up to $1 billion in credits.",

  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nHeat-Magic Preview\n\nBy ALAN FERGUSON\n\nPosted Dec 30 2012 9:46PM The return of Dwyane Wade wasn't enough to help the Miami Heat avoid losing back-to-back games. A visit to the slumping Orlando Magic might keep their skid from growing to a season-high mark. While LeBron James attempts to add to an impressive scoring run Monday, Miami will try to get back on track by sending Orlando to its first six-game losing streak in nearly seven years. Wade scored 24 points in his return from a one-game suspension Saturday but the Heat (20-8) had only two other players in double figures in a 104-85 defeat in Milwaukee. LeBron James had a team-best 26 points and Chris Bosh had 12 on 5-of-14 shooting after scoring 28 in a 109-99 loss to Detroit on Friday, which snapped a six-game win streak. \"Obviously, the last 48 hours have not gone we wanted it to,\" Erik Spoelstra said. \"We don't want to make any excuses about it. Milwaukee kicked our butt. They were the better team tonight. We will gather ourselves, get to Orlando and start to work on it.\" James' performance gave him 20 or more points in all 28 games, tying him with former Boston star and current Houston coach Kevin McHale for the second-longest such streak to open a season since the NBA-ABA merger. McHale accomplished his feat in 1986-87 and San Antonio great George Gervin had a 45-game run in 1981-82. The Heat superstar will seek to surpass McHale's streak while helping his team avoid its first three-game skid since Jan. 10-13. James, who turned 28 years old Sunday, was kept under 20 points in three of last season's four meetings with Orlando, while Wade has averaged 29.4 on 56.3 percent shooting in his past five matchups. Miami is also seeking to avoid a third consecutive road defeat when it wraps up a four-game trip. The Heat haven't experienced such a skid since a four-game losing streak March 2-14, which included a 104-98 overtime defeat in Orlando. Miami lost in both visits to its in-state rivals last season and is 2-10 in its last 12, but this time it will face a Magic team that traded away its two top scorers from 2011-12, Dwight Howard and Ryan Anderson. Orlando has suffered all of its five losses since starting forward Glen Davis suffered a shoulder injury. Point guard Jameer Nelson (hip) and his backup, E'Twaun Moore (elbow) sat out Saturday's game against Toronto and their statuses are unknown for this one. Without those players, Orlando (12-18) was hardly competitive in a 123-88 home loss, its third in a row at the Amway Center. Rookie forward Andrew Nicholson had a career-high 22 points in his second NBA start but the other four starters combined to score 35. \"That's when character is developed. Not when it's easy and quiet but when it's pretty noisy and hard,\" coach Jacque Vaughn said. \"I think we have a great group of guys with character. Everyone wants to win and I would hope that there is some signs of us wanting to get better and not accepting the performance we had (Saturday) night.\" The Magic lost a season-high four straight at home Nov. 25-Dec. 12, but haven't dropped six in a row overall since Feb. 26-March 6, 2006. Miami and Orlando split their four meetings last season. The Southeast Division rivals won't face each other until March 6.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

(AP) The Miami Heat got another glimpse at how difficult it is every night when you're the defending NBA champion. The Heat needed clutch performances from each of their stars to slip past the injury-depleted Orlando Magic. LeBron James scored eight of his 36 points in overtime and also finished with 11 assists and eight rebounds to help Miami beat the Magic 112-110 on Monday. The Heat, beaten decisively by Detroit and Milwaukee before arriving in Orlando, got a decisive dunk from Dwayne Wade with 6.2 seconds left in the extra period to avoid what could have been their first three-game losing streak this season. \"The biggest thing was that we didn't want to lose,\" Wade said. \"We dug in against a team that played very well. They had some guys on the court that half the NBA never heard of, but those guys did an unbelievable job. They pushed us to the limit.\" Miami also needed a pair of baskets from Chris Bosh in the final minute of regulation just to get them to overtime. Bosh had 22 points and Wade added 21. \"The one thing I liked is that I saw an absolute competitive desperation in our guys in the fourth quarter and overtime,\" Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"In a perfect world, I would like to see where we didn't have to get pushed that far, but our guys did not want to lose that game. You saw a competitive spirit that our team is known for.\" Orlando rookie coach Jacque Vaughn had plenty of praise for his team despite a sixth straight loss. The Magic got a franchise-record 29 rebounds and a career-high 20 points from Nikola Vucevic, 28 points from Arron Afflalo and 23 points from J.J. Redick. They led by four with 1:07 left in regulation and were down only two in the final minute of overtime, but couldn't execute in the clutch. \"We really showed a lot of resolve tonight, a lot of fight and I hope our fans appreciated that,\" Vaughn said. \"We talk about character and how you will be challenged with a little adversity and how you respond. I'm proud of how we responded.\" Orlando, in the midst of a rebuilding program, played without injured point guard Jameer Nelson, his backup, E'Twaun Moore, and starting power forward Glen Davis. The lack of ballhandlers and depth never showed until the final minute of overtime, when the Magic committed three turnovers and couldn't get off a shot to either extend a lead or tie the game. \"We almost beat the Miami Heat without some of our really important players,\" Vucevic said. \"We were right there. If we play hard like we did tonight, we have a chance against anybody in this league.\" Miami, by contrast, had only one turnover in the second half and none in overtime. The Heat got plays when they needed them from James, Bosh and Wade. \"This is a winning league,\" James said. \"It's not about how close you came to losing or how close you came to winning. We won. I'm not discrediting what they did; they played a great game. We just made one more play than they did.\" James scored on a driving layup with 1:07 left in the extra period to give Miami a 108-106 lead. He missed a shot from the top of the key, giving Orlando a chance to tie, but Shane Battier stole a cross-court pass from Redick and fed Wade for his late slam. Josh McRoberts cut it to two with two seconds to play, but James sealed it at the line. The first half was a series of momentum swing by both teams, with Miami breaking off a 10-0 run early and Orlando responding with a 12-0 burst in the second quarter. The Magic finished the half on a 21-8 run to take a 54-48 halftime lead. The back-and-forth play continued in the second half. Miami scored the first seven points to go ahead 55-54 on an 18-foot jumper by James, but the Magic responded with a 13-2 run, punctuated by a 20-foot jumper from the corner by DeQuan Jones to go back in front 67-57. The Heat scored the last four points of the third quarter and the first nine of the fourth, eventually taking a 79-77 lead on a vicious slam by James with 9:38 left in regulation. Miami forced three turnovers and three missed shots in the 13-0 run. Redick stopped the rally with back-to-back 3-pointers, which set up a mad dash for the finish line. A 3-pointer by James gave Miami a 91-89 lead, but the Magic went back in front on a three-point play by Afflalo that made it 94-91 with 2:45 left. Orlando led 99-95 after Vucevic hit a 15-footer with 1:07 to go, but Bosh tied it with back-to-back baskets. The Heat forward had a chance to win it in regulation, but his runner from eight feet hit the side of the basket, sending the game into overtime. Notes: James has scored 20 or more points in all 29 of Miami's games this season. . Nelson sat out his second straight game with a hip injury. The Magic are 1-8 when he is out of the lineup. . Miami F Udonis Haslem returned after missing one game with a shoulder injury. Haslem had 2 points and 6 rebounds. . Wade, a 78 percent free throw shooter, missed his first four attempts. Wade was just 3 of 10 from the line for the game.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27648": "Want an easy way to save over three months' salary? Don't buy a diamond engagement ring. If your fiancée, friends, and family scream hellfire, calmly explain:\n\n(See also: The Ethics of Free: Is It Wrong to Get Free Stuff?)\n\n1. It's Just Marketing\n\nThe whole \"A Diamond Is Forever\" and the idea of a diamond engagement ring is not an ancient tradition to be revered and followed. It is Sprite's \"Obey Your Thirst.\" It is Nike's \"Just Do It.\" It is Gary Dahl's \"Pet Rock.\" Not only did De Beers understand it had to control supply (buying up and closing down any diamond mine discovered), they had to control demand. They had to make it sentimental. And Americans were the perfect suckers. They targeted the U.S. specifically for our marketability. This campaign is less than 70 years old, yet has become so ingrained in our culture that the diamond engagement ring has become the ultimate symbol of how much the relationship, the girl, and love itself is worth.\n\n2. Diamonds Aren't Rare\n\nFine, using marketing tactics can't be blamed since that's part of the game of capitalism. But another part of the game is competition. It's all well and good if marketers can convince consumers to buy them instead of the competition based on a nice slogan, but the competition should be there to protect the consumer. All gems are valued based on their rarity (as are most things in life). But diamonds are abundant. De Beers has a huge vault where they keep most of the world's supply of diamonds. If it ever got released into the market, the way it would be if they weren't a monopoly, diamonds would be worth nothing. It's literally a pretty rock.\n\n3. Diamonds Have No Resale Value\n\nThe reason \"A Diamond Is Forever\" is because you're basically stuck with it. You'll never be able to resell it except to a pawn shop. Even a jeweler (the few who would be willing to buy it) would offer a fraction of what you paid.\n\n4. Synthetic Diamonds Will Flood the Market\n\nSynthetic or \"cultured\" diamonds are already being made and within the next few years, will be efficiently made for the mass market. These are real diamonds. They are made in a machine that replicates the environmental forces that make diamonds. The only difference is that they're better. They have less flaws. And they cost a fraction of the going rate. Want a two-carat pink diamond? That'll be a few thousand dollars.\n\n5. Moissanite Looks Just Like a Diamond\n\nJewelers had to upgrade their equipment to detect Moissanite from diamonds when it came into the market. It's undetectable with the naked eye. And it's actually more brilliant. A one-carat ring is under $1000.\n\n6. Who Is the Ring for, Anyway?\n\nSeriously. As The Dilettante so poignantly put it, \"For women, comparing jewelry is our phallic posturing contest: look at how big MY dic….er, I mean, diamond is.\" It's fun to show off for about 30 seconds. After that there is little to show for the debt incurred for the shiny piece of rock. That money could have gone into furniture, an amazing trip (or many nice ones), your future kids' college funds!\n\nAre these reasons still not enough? Watch Blood Diamond. It is high time Hollywood dared to broach the subject of diamonds, especially when they had a hand in marketing it to the public in the first place. Blood Diamond, is an explicit example of the blood and war that has spanned the entire history of the De Beers' diamond cartel. The story of Sierra Leone isn't an isolated event, nor is the conflict over just because the movie says there's peace in Sierra Leone now.\n\n7. What Are Conflict/Blood Diamonds?\n\nConflict/blood diamonds are used by rebel groups to fuel conflict and civil wars, and by terrorist groups to finance their activities.\n\n8. The Kimberley Process Is Just PR\n\nIt's an agreement that is supposed to prevent conflict diamonds from getting into the market but ended up being more of a PR stunt since it's based on a system of self-policing. The U.N. reported in October 2006 that due to poor enforcement of the Kimberley Process, $23 million of conflict diamonds from Cote d'lvoire alone entered the legitimate market. Sure De Beers won't buy diamonds coming out of Cote d'lvoire, but they'll turn a blind eye to the smuggling of diamonds from there through Ghana and Mali where they are certified as being conflict-free.\n\n9. Percentage in the Market\n\nDuring the height of the diamond conflict in the 1990s, the diamond industry reported that no more than 4% of the diamonds in the market were conflict diamonds, when in reality it has been shown to be closer to 15%.\n\n10. Asking for Conflict-Free Certificates Is not Enough\n\nIn April 2006 after a scathing report by Partnership Africa Canada about activities in Brazil, an internal review showed that 49 of 147 Kimberley Process certificates were fraudulent. Besides these fraudulent certificates, real certificates could still be issued if conflict diamonds were smuggled and mixed with legally traded ones before being certified.\n\n11. Children in India Are Cutting and Polishing the Diamonds\n\nChildren in India can become \"bonded\" — forced to work to pay off the debts of their family. These children end up working in the diamond factories.\n\n12. Children in Conflict Zones Are Being Used as Soldiers\n\nThe images in Blood Diamond with child soldiers are very real. They are drugged and brainwashed to handle the manslaughter they are forced to do.\n\nJennifer Connelly says in the movie Blood Diamond, \"People back home would not buy a diamond if they knew it cost someone their hand.\" Now you know.\n\nAdditional Reources\n\nHave You Ever Tried to Sell a Diamond - Article from The Atlantic Monthly that chronicles the DeBeers marketing campaign\n\nThe New Diamond Age - Article from Wired magazine about the cultured diamond startups\n\nBlood From Stones - LA Weekly\n\nThe Truth About Diamonds - A Global Witness Report\n\nThe Kimberley Process update, November 13, 2006 - Global Witness\n\nConflict Diamonds Fact Sheet - Global Witness and Amnesty International\n\nThe Diamond Invention\n\nA History of the International Diamond Cartel\n\nDiamonds Suck! - A personal essay on the virtures of Moissanite\n\nChild Slave Labor in India",

This included wins against the likes of Otis Griffin, Cory Cummings and a decision win against Will Rosinsky.[3][4][5]\n\nCareer from 2016–2017 [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2016, Smith defeated Brazilian boxer Fabiano Pena (16-4-1 12 KOs) via a 2nd-round TKO winning 15 straight fights and continuing to rise up the ranks.[6]\n\nSmith vs. Fonfara [ edit ]\n\nIt was announced that Smith would be fighting the #2 WBC contender, former world title challenger Andrzej Fonfara (28-3, 16 KOs) for the WBC international light heavyweight title at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago, Illinois on June 18, 2016 in a scheduled 10 round fight in the main event of the Premier Boxing Champions card on NBC. Fonfara was coming of a huge decision win over British boxer Nathan Cleverly. A win here for Fonfara would set him up for another world title shot.[7]\n\nIn an 'Upset of the Year' in the light heavyweight division, Smith won the title by defeating Fonfara via a 1st-round technical knockout. Smith knocked Fonfara down twice in the round 1. The fight was halted after the second knockdown by referee Hector Afu. The official time of the stoppage was at 2:32. Smith caught Fonfara with a big right hand that dropped him. Fonfara got back to his feet. The referee let the fight continue. When the action resumed, Smith landed a left hook that snapped Fonfara's head back. Smith then followed up with a hard right hand to the head that dropped Fonfara in the corner, which ended the fight. The win also ended Fonfara's 15 fight undefeated streak at the UIC Pavilion.[8][9][10] The fight took place on Premier Boxing Champions on NBC. The whole card averaged 1.32 million viewers.[11]\n\nSmith vs. Hopkins [ edit ]\n\nFormer multiple weight world champion Bernard Hopkins (55-7-2, 32 KOs) announced he would be having a farewell fight at The Forum in Inglewood, California on December 17, 2016. He picked Smith as his final opponent. Hopkins would be coming out of a two-year layoff having last fought in 2014 in a decision loss to then unified light heavyweight champion Sergey Kovalev. Smith was said to be 'excited' to be fighting on HBO, a card promoted by Golden Boy.[12] Both boxers weighed in at 174 pounds.[13]\n\nOn fight night, in front of a 6,513 crowd, Smith upset and defeated Hopkins via KO when he knocked him out of the ring in the 8th round; Hopkins failed to make it back into the ring as referee Jack Reiss gave his 20-count. He became the first boxer to stop Hopkins inside the distance. Smith started much stronger than expected and his speed and power seemed to surprise Hopkins. In the 8th round, Smith caught Hopkins in the corner and landed five shots to the head that knocked him out of the ring. Hopkins said he was hurt and couldn't get back into the ring. He insisted that he’d been pushed out of the ring, but replays showed it wasn't a push. Hopkins spoke to HBO in the post fight interview, \"He shoved me out of the ring. My ankle got twisted when I fell out of the ring. I couldn't stand on my feet ... I can’t believe they gave him a TKO. They can call it a no-contest but not a loss. The momentum from his body pushed me. I went out like a soldier. I’m not in denial.\" Smith retained his WBC International light heavyweight title with the win and spoke of his respect for Hopkins in the post-fight, stating he is 'a true champion'. Hopkins' reported purse was $800,000, compared to Smith's $140,000.[14][15][16][17] According to Ringtv, the fight averaged 934,000 viewers, peaking at 1.035m on HBO.[18][19]\n\nSmith vs. Barrera [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2017, the WBC ordered a final eliminator between Smith and Oleksandr Gvozdyk, ranked third and fourth respectively by the WBC. The winner of the fight would then become the secondary mandatory challenger for the world title.[20] On May 12, Boxing Scene confirmed a deal was in place for Smith to fight Cuban light heavyweight contender Sullivan Barrera (19-1, 14 KOs). Early reports indicated the fight would be part of a HBO triple-header also featuring Miguel Berchelt defending his WBC super featherweight title against mandated Takashi Miura on July 15, 2017 in Inglewood, California.[21] The fight was officially confirmed on May 18 and shown live on HBO: Boxing After Dark.[22] Smith knocked Barrera down in round one with a left hook to the head, but was dominated for the rest of the fight and went on to lose via unanimous decision after 10 rounds. The three judges scored the fight 97-92, 97-92 and 96-93 all in favour of Barrera. Smith was beaten to the punch in almost every round, only landing 61 of his 320 punches thrown (19%), whilst Barrera was more accurate in landing 187 of 484 thrown (39%). In round 4, Smith was hit with a clean uppercut and by the end of round 7, his team urged him to go for a knockout. Referee Jack Reiss had the ringside doctor take a look at Smith after the seventh, but the fight continued. Ringtv scored the fight wider 98-91, only giving Smith two rounds.[23][24] It was revealed after the fight there was confusion in Barrera's corner as well as the HBO commentary team in regards to the fight being 10 rounds instead of 12. The referee told both boxers to touch gloves at the start of the 10th round. At first the HBO commentary thought the referee had made a mistake, but were later told, both fighters agreed to the fight being 10 rounds.[25] The fight averaged 617,000 viewers on HBO and peaked at 719,000 viewers.[26]\n\nAccording to ESPN, Smith may have sustained a suspected head injury and taken to hospital after the fight. Smith accepted defeat to the better man, \"Sullivan Barrera fought a good fight, and I congratulate him.\" Smith earned a career high purse of $160,000 compared to Barrera, who earned $130,000 for his win.[27] A few days later, Smith released a statement on social media that he had broken his jaw and believed to have broken it in round two, \"Somewhere during the second round I was injured and was in a lot of pain, but I did not want to let it show and I refused to quit.\" As the fight went on, he admitted the pain got worse and the fight got tougher.[28] On July 20, Smith had surgery to repair his broken jaw. The surgery took place at the Stony Brook University Hospital in Stony Brook, New York.[29]\n\nCareer from 2018 [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2018, according to his promoter Joe DeGuardia, Smith was looking to make a ring return around May 2018. DeGuardia stated that he wanted to create an event around Smith, however did not mention whether Smith would fight a top contender.[30] On May 9, it was announced that Smith would make his return to the ring at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Montville, Connecticut on June 30, 2018.[31][32] On May 31, it was confirmed that 39 year old Melvin Russell (11-4-2, 7 KO's) would be Smith's opponent in a 10-round bout.[33] Smith dropped Russell twice in round 1 before the referee stopped the bout after just 1 minute 45 seconds. After the bout, Smith called for a bout with then-WBO champion Sergey Kovalev.[34]\n\nSmith vs. Beterbiev [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2018, it was reported a deal was being worked out for Smith to challenge Russian boxer Dmitry Bivol for his WBA light heavyweight title. On October 15, Yvon Michel told the LA Presse that Smith was in talks to challenge his fighter, the IBF champion Artur Beterbiev (13-0, 13 KOs), on a card that would take place on DAZN.[35] Smith's manager, Joe DeGuardia of Star Boxing also confirmed the Beterbiev fight was the one they would pursue.[36] According to Le Journal de Montréal on November 3, Beterbiev decided against defending his title on December 15 against Smith and instead stated he would fight him in early 2019 instead.[37]\n\nProfessional boxing record [ edit ]\n\nProfessional record summary 26 fights 24 wins 2 losses By knockout 20 1 By decision 4 1\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

It was the morning after the mayor's appearence on the Jimmy Kimmel Show. ( STEVE RUSSELL / TORONTO STAR )\n\n“Was it a tough interview? Sure it was but he (Kimmel) has a job to do, that’s his job. I haven’t seen one of his shows that he doesn’t take shots at people,” Ford said after arriving back at city hall on Tuesday around 1 p.m. “I held my own and I got my message out that I’ve saved taxpayers’ money, all my achievements. I wish I had more time to promote Toronto.” Over three segments, Kimmel asked Ford tough questions about domestic abuse, drunk driving, his drinking, and his ongoing feud with the police chief. At one point, he walked the mayor over to a TV monitor and played some of the most infamous Ford videos, including a clip where the mayor threatened to kill someone and the clip at Steak Queen .\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nFord denied he felt embarrassed, shrugging off the videos as “old news.” Nor was he caught off guard by any questions. “No, not at all, going through you guys, if you can survive the Toronto media you can survive anything so …that was a walk in the park compared to you guys.” Ford also brushed aside Kimmel’s suggestion that he seek advice for substance abuse. “I don’t have any personal issues. We’ve gone down that road a number of times,” he said, adding he planned to “hit the gym” after work despite being sleep-deprived following an overnight flight from Los Angeles.\n\nFord said he met many nice people in Hollywood. “I met the movers and shakers of the movie industry and a lot of them knew about TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival) believe it or not some didn’t know it.” His brother, Councillor Doug Ford, also defended his brother’s performance, saying the audience was laughing “with him” not at him.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n“I think Rob did a fabulous job,” Ford said Tuesday morning, hours after the Toronto Sun reported the mayor felt “set-up” by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. “The only thing we were disappointed about... We wanted to pump Toronto more.” Kimmel has been trying to convince Ford to come on his show since last summer. This past weekend, after a personal call from Kimmel, the Ford brothers relented. Rob, Doug and the eldest Randy, who currently runs the family business, Deco Labels, made the trip to Los Angeles along with some members of the mayor’s staff. Kimmel greeted them at the airport and prior to the interview, the Fords told media how nice the host seemed. But the interview didn’t seem to go as planned. At city hall Tuesday, councillors said the mayor embarrassed the city. “The joke is on the mayor,” said Councillor Shelley Carroll.

It's a rather transparent attempt to provide 'proof' that the bombing was the work of the Iranians or Hizb'allah in the absence of any actual evidence that Iran or Hizb'allah were involved. After all, everyone 'knows' that Muslims and 'suicide bombers' are one and the same, and everyone 'knows that' Iran and Hizb'allah are evil and want to destroy the Jews, so what more 'proof' is needed?As I noted in my previous article, initial reports stated that the bomb was in the luggage compartment of the bus, and surely forensic examination of the bus could verify this. The only problem is that the Israelis have more or less taken over the investigation (as they always do), which in turn has resulted (as it always does) in statements of 'fact' without proof by the Israeli investigators.In this case, it seems the Israelis have used the unidentified eyewitness report (from yesterday, probably made by an Israeli agent) that the bomb exploded after someone got on the bus, to affirm that it was a 'suicide bomber'. Apparently no one in the mainstream media finds it utterly preposterous to assume that just because the bomb exploded after someone got on the bus, that person must be the 'suicide bomber'. By that logic, all the other people already on the bus could also be suicide bombers. Unless of course all suicide bombers are required to blow themselves up immediately after they arrive at their target.The main problem with the Iranian or Lebanese 'suicide bomber' narrative however, is that the person the Israelis have id'd as the bomber is probably the most unlikely devout Iranian or Lebanese Muslim. Here's a picture of him:This guy was also, we are told, carrying a fake US drivers license from the state of Michigan, which has been kindly produced (probably in more ways than one) by the Israelis:All we know about this alleged 'suicide bomber' then is that he is some tall white guy with long hair who was seen hanging around the airport with a couple of backpacks. Rather than Iranian or Lebanese, he was probably from the same place as these guys:The above image is a selection of the Mossad agents who formed part of the elaborate hit squad that murdered Hamas leader, Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel in 2010 . They were all travelling on non-Israeli passports (it's hard to operate in an Arab nation on an Israeli passport) belonging to innocent people from Australia and several European nations, passports that had been copied at some point by Israeli passport control agents or airline staff, either in Israel or some other country. So while the passports and names were fake, these are the actual images of the Mossad agents involved (although the beards and glasses are optional and at least one of them appears to be in drag). Informed sources claim that the Mossad has a very expensive research department dedicated to forging all types of ID documents, so they could probably churn out a Michigan drivers license in about 10 minutes.As for the idea that the Mossad (or some other branch of Israeli intelligence) would carry out an attack against Jews in order to demonise one of Israel's alleged enemies - I regret to have to inform you that such operations form a large part of the Mossad's raison d'etre, and they've been doing it for a long time. Back in 1976 for example, Israeli domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet infiltrated the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and hatched a plan (and ensured it was implemented) to hijack an Air France flight from Israel that was diverted to Entebbe, Uganda. Israeli commandos stormed the plane at the airport, but not before 3 of the Israeli passengers were killed (and not necessarily by the Palestinians). According to a UK government file released in 2007, the operation was \"Given that (within minutes of the news breaking) Israeli PM Netanyahu denounced Iran for the yesterday's bombing in Bulgaria, and taking Israeli intelligence's track record and MO, it seems reasonable to conclude that the bus bombing in Bulgaria was designed to increase pressure on Iran and whoever else the Israeli government decides to tar with their 'suicide bomber' schtick.So what we're dealing with here is the same old false flag terrorism BS that has plagued the world for decades and been used to justify more wars for profit and psychopathic pleasure than I care to contemplate. If you can see your way past the millions of slaughtered innocents (which isn't easy), it's all rather farcical. Consider a recent story about the 5 British nationals who were charged with terrorism offenses. Apparently the fact that these guys had a few copies of the supposed 'al-qaeda' English language magazine - Inspire - on their computers was enough for them to be charged with \"the intention of committing acts of terrorism or assisting another to commit such acts, engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect to his intention.\" The real irony is that Inspire is a hilariously transparent piece of Western intelligence agency propaganda and is used by those intelligence agencies to do three main things:On that last one, consider the fact that a 2011 issue of Inspire carried the following comment in response to the Iranian president questioning the official 9/11 story:This wasn't by any means the first time that 'al-qaeda' openly supported the agenda of the 'great satan', in 2008 they were already dismissing conspiracy theories, defending Israel and attacking Iran and Hizb'allah It's all one big horrible psychopathic lie, and while, so far, the price of believing the lie has been largely financial and moral for Western peoples, it has cost millions of innocent people in the Middle East their lives. If people in Western nations insist on holding out and believing (or ignoring) the lie a little longer however, I feel confident they'll get their fair share of the psychopaths' blood lust soon enough.",
  "latent_28028": "Some of you may recall that before being promoted from a FanGraphs Community Research writer to an actual FanGraphs writer, my primary focus was on the relationship between batted ball types (infield fly balls, in particular) and BABIP for pitchers. At the time, I’d been leaving park factors out of the equation in a [vain] attempt to keep things simple, but now I want to give them a bit of attention.\n\nNow, Guts! is a great resource on FanGraphs, but it does leave out BABIP, HR/FB, and — I believe — something else I’d like to talk to you about for a second. If you’re a big fan of the batted ball stats here, this bit of information might be completely earth-shattering, leaving you sobbing in a heap on the floor, pondering how your life will never be the same again: IFFB% may not mean what you think it does. Now, FB%, for example — that’s defined as fly balls divided by batted balls, right? Many of us might therefore assume that IFFB% equals infield fly balls divided by batted balls… but it doesn’t. IFFB% is actually infield fly balls divided by fly balls. This means that IFFB% doesn’t tell you much about a player unless you have the context of his FB% to go with it. It also means that IFFB% * FB% equals what you probably thought IFFB% was, which is IFFB/(Batted Balls).\n\nHopefully you’ll be able to read this clearly through your tears: I’m going to introduce a new, not-officially-FanGraphs-sanctioned term here: IFFB% * FB% = PU%. PU%, or popup percentage — again, it’s what you probably thought IFFB% meant — is the percentage of batted balls that are infield flies. This leaves OFFB%, or outfield fly balls, as the remainder of FB% (i.e., FB% = PU%+OFFB%).\n\nSo, without further ado, here’s a sortable list of the park factors I came up with for the 2009-2012 seasons, with the exceptions noted at the bottom:\n\nTeam BABIP GB/FB LD% GB% FB% IFFB% PU% OFFB% HR/FB Angels 98.4 98.0 99.3 99.2 101.3 95.4 96.5 101.8 93.8 Astros 99.4 99.8 98.7 100.3 100.4 98.4 98.9 100.6 103.2 Athletics 98.0 98.9 101.2 99.0 100.5 102.7 103.2 100.2 91.5 Blue Jays 99.7 99.6 100.0 99.7 100.3 98.6 98.9 100.4 105.9 Braves 100.6 100.7 101.8 99.9 99.2 95.8 95.0 99.6 97.7 Brewers 99.5 96.0 98.7 98.4 102.8 98.2 100.8 103.0 109.3 Cardinals 99.3 102.8 101.4 100.7 98.1 102.1 100.1 98.0 91.8 Cubs 100.9 98.4 99.6 99.4 101.0 99.2 100.2 101.1 99.5 Diamondbacks 102.3 100.4 101.5 99.8 99.4 97.5 96.9 99.7 104.1 Dodgers 98.8 100.4 97.8 100.8 100.2 109.5 109.4 99.3 98.9 Giants 99.8 106.6 100.4 102.7 96.6 101.3 97.9 96.5 90.5 Indians 98.9 104.5 101.0 101.7 97.5 101.9 99.3 97.3 96.3 Mariners 98.2 99.4 101.1 99.4 100.2 103.9 104.1 99.8 90.4 Marlins ** Mets *** 98.3 96.6 97.2 99.2 102.5 107.0 110.0 101.8 92.6 Nationals 99.5 99.4 99.3 99.9 100.5 98.9 99.4 100.6 99.3 Orioles 101.4 99.8 98.6 100.1 100.6 95.2 95.7 101.1 108.9 Padres 96.6 102.4 97.2 101.7 99.4 96.4 95.9 99.8 89.6 Phillies 99.5 100.4 100.8 100.1 99.6 97.7 97.3 99.8 103.4 Pirates 98.2 103.4 100.4 101.3 98.2 96.2 94.5 98.6 90.6 Rangers 102.2 97.7 103.8 98.0 100.3 96.6 96.7 100.6 109.9 Rays 98.3 96.5 99.1 98.4 102.3 112.2 115.1 101.0 93.6 Red Sox 104.3 100.7 101.1 100.1 99.4 103.7 103.1 99.0 97.0 Reds 100.2 99.6 100.5 99.7 100.1 105.3 105.5 99.6 115.5 Rockies 105.5 103.8 104.1 100.5 97.2 90.6 88.3 98.2 115.5 Royals 101.8 103.4 97.7 102.1 98.7 91.1 90.0 99.7 91.3 Tigers 99.8 98.7 97.9 99.9 101.2 104.2 105.5 100.8 96.3 Twins * 101.1 103.4 102.9 100.9 97.4 102.8 100.0 101.0 94.5 White Sox 99.7 95.2 99.7 97.8 102.8 97.3 99.9 103.2 113.6 Yankees 98.9 99.0 98.2 99.9 101.0 102.9 103.9 100.7 112.7\n\n* Twins’ factors based on 2010-2012 data only\n\n** Marlins Park excluded due to 2012 being first year (insufficient sample size)\n\n*** Citi Field’s walls were moved closer in 2012\n\nPark factors are halved (based on the assumption that a player will play half of their games there).\n\nIf you hadn’t heard, The Padres and Mariners will be moving the fences in a bit this year, by the way. My apologies if I neglected to mention any significant park dimension changes that happened between 2009 and 2012.\n\nIf you’re like me, you might find this table interesting; if you’re a normal person, skip right ahead:\n\nCorrelations Between Park Factors\n\nBABIP GB/FB LD% GB% FB% IFFB% PU% OFFB% GB/FB 0.198 LD% 0.544 0.296 GB% 0.003 0.922 -0.087 FB% -0.322 -0.966 -0.527 -0.799 IFFB% -0.389 -0.249 -0.228 -0.165 0.274 PU% -0.432 -0.501 -0.357 -0.378 0.534 0.959 OFFB% -0.167 -0.867 -0.366 -0.753 0.863 0.009 0.258 HR/FB 0.450 -0.342 0.205 -0.435 0.257 -0.239 -0.137 0.306\n\nAn obligatory refresher for those who haven’t taken statistics in a while (or ever): correlation coefficients (“r”) range between -1 and 1. A correlation of “0” means the two factors being compared have no apparent connection, whereas “1” indicates the two factors move together in a perfectly linear way, and “-1” means they move perfectly linearly in opposite directions.\n\nI bolded the connections I thought were the most interesting. Now, to discuss them more in-depth:\n\nHigh LD% factor = high BABIP factor\n\nThis should come as no surprise to those of you who read my first Community article, in which I pointed out LD% and [what I’m now calling] PU% as the two main factors for explaining pitcher BABIPs. LD% for a pitcher is hard to predict from year-to-year, and park factors aren’t entirely consistent on a yearly basis either, but many of the line drive park factors do make a lot of sense, and you can reasonably expect the factors behind them to exert their influence yearly.\n\nSpecifically, let’s look at the top two parks in terms of high LD% — Colorado and Texas. What do they have in common? Well, the most obvious is thin air; Colorado due to its altitude, and Texas presumably due to heat and perhaps dryness. Thin air, of course, offers less resistance to a batted ball, but it also should theoretically allow for less break on pitches. Most of the stadia (that’s fancy talk for “stadiums”) at the low end of the list also make sense, having thick marine air. KC is an exception… but then again, its BABIP factor isn’t in-line with those of its surrounding teams on the LD% list. This could have something to do with scorer’s bias issues, such as the one discussed here. Another possible contributor to LD% differences is the batter’s eye in each stadium.\n\nHigh PU% = low BABIP\n\nThis shouldn’t be a shocker to those of you who’ve read my previous work. Popups are pretty close to automatic outs. Let’s talk about how stadium characteristics might influence PU%. The first thing that comes to mind is that a greater amount of foul territory should lead to a higher PU%; that’s because a foul IFFB is only recorded if caught.\n\nAnother possible factor, judging by the Rays’ home field being firmly at the top of the list, is the dome factor. You might think the whitish background of the dome against a popup might not be so conducive to catching it, but perhaps the lack of sun and wind helps to make up for that. And it’s not like fielders in non-domed parks never have to deal with whitish backgrounds — clouds and haze are a thing, after all.\n\nHigh HR/FB equals high BABIP, high OFFB%, and low PU%?\n\nIt’s worth reminding you at this point that home runs are excluded from consideration in BABIP, but not in batted ball stats. That’s one reason why fly ball pitchers tend to have lower BABIPs — they may allow more HR, but those don’t count as a knock against their BABIPs. The other reason is that fly balls, especially popups, make for easier putouts.\n\nSo, if HR aren’t part of BABIP, why would HR/FB have an apparent strong-ish connection to BABIP? The most obvious is that a high HR/FB is a sign of harder contact being made, for whatever reason, which you might expect to lead to a higher BABIP. Of course, you would also expect a higher HR/FB in small stadia, where perhaps more balls are bouncing uncatchably off of outfield walls and dropping for hits.\n\nNow, PU% and OFFB% generally move together, both moving against BABIP, whereas HR/FB moves together with BABIP. That’s why I found it interesting that HR/FB divides PU% and OFFB%. I think that’s easy to explain in the context of an individual pitcher, but maybe not so much in the context of park factors. I’d like to hear your theories on it.\n\nOh, but before we make too much of this, I should tell you that the HR/FB factor appears to be the most prone to fluctuation of the bunch.\n\nPutting it all together, kind of\n\nAs I am wont to do, I’ve regressed some of the various park factors to see how they might be able to explain each park’s BABIP factor:\n\nBABIP = 0.48*LD% + 0.37*GB% – 0.05*PU% + 0.11*OFFB% + 0.09*HR/FB\n\nThe formula itself is, since it only applies to park factors, as useful as a poopie-flavored lollipop (Patches O’Houlihan) but it does have a 0.696 correlation to a stadium’s BABIP factor, meaning it can explain nearly half of the differences in BABIP factors (with a 0.484 R-squared). The park it has the hardest time explaining — by far — is Fenway, no doubt largely thanks to The Green Monster’s extreme BABIP-boosting ways. Take Boston out of the mix, and the correlation shoots to 0.772 (0.596 R-squared). Remove the second-biggest outlier, Kauffman Stadium in KC (with its suspiciously-low LD% factor) and the correlation goes to 0.816, explaining 2/3 of the differences. The exclusion of these outliers lends itself to the creation of a formula not tainted by them, which you probably don’t care about, yet here it is anyway:\n\nBABIP = 0.52*LD% + 0.28*GB% – 0.03*PU% + 0.12*OFFB% + 0.11*HR/FB\n\nThat one achieves a 0.829 correlation to the remaining BABIP park factors (0.687 R-squared).\n\nThat can be whittled down to:\n\nBABIP = 0.552*LD% + 0.320*GB% + 0.124*HR/FB\n\n…which has a 0.821 correlation to BABIP factor, but if you remove any of those three factors, the correlation takes a major hit (though PU% and OFFB% together can mostly compensate for the loss of GB%).\n\nI haven’t talked about what might contribute to a park’s GB% factor… well, groundskeeping might have a bit to do with it, but my guess is that it’s mainly due to less foul territory, and therefore fewer easy foul ball outs.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor those who are curious, the formula I used to calculate each factor was:\n\n(Home Pitching + Home Batting) / (Away Pitching + Away Batting) * 100\n\n… which is a pretty standard park factor formula. I then halved it like so: 0.5 + Factor/2 … this is based on the assumption that the player plays half their games away at a neutral-factor stadium. When you consider that some teams play in divisions full of non-neutral opponent stadiums (e.g., Texas faces a bunch of pitcher’s parks), that’s probably not such a safe assumption to make, buuut it’s how park factors are done, and it’s a topic for a different conversation.",

  "latent_28265": "The Israeli cabinet has endorsed a controversial Bill enshrining Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, despite criticism by Israel’s Arab minority who fear the measure will leave them as second-class citizens.\n\nA divided cabinet voted 14-6 in favour of the Bill yesterday after a session that ministers described as a “shouting match”.\n\nPrime minister Binyamin Netanyahu reportedly banged on the table and said “it cannot be that Arabs can live in Jewish towns, but Jews can’t live in Arab towns. A country within a country is developing.”\n\nHe said the law was needed because Palestinians refused to recognise Israel as a Jewish state and Israeli Arabs were seeking autonomy in the Galilee and the Negev.\n\n“Israel is a Jewish democratic state. There are those who want democracy to take precedence over Judaism, and those who want Judaism to take precedence over democracy. In the law that I am bringing, both principles are equal and must be given equal consideration.”\n\nCentrist ministers voted against and have threatened to do so again on Wednesday, when the Bill is due to be presented to the Knesset parliament for a preliminary vote.\n\nThe divisions have further strained Mr Netanyahu’s coalition and he may be forced to dismiss ministers who vote against the Bill, which could lead to early elections.\n\nTwo versions of the Bill were approved by ministers yesterday and a Knesset committee will merge the two after the Knesset passes the first reading. Both reinforce Israel’s national anthem and state symbols, use of the Hebrew calendar and the law of return, which grants any Jew the automatic right to emigrate to Israel.\n\nArab Knesset members described the Bill as racist, noting that one version would leave Hebrew as Israel’s only official language.\n\nGaza man shot dead\n\nIsrael said troops opened fire on two men close to the border fence in the northern Gaza Strip, after first firing warning shots. Relatives of the 32-year-old man said he had been searching for song birds, which nest near the border and command high prices in Gaza markets.\n\nAn Israeli border police officer has been charged with manslaughter in the killing of a Palestinian minor during protests at the Bitunya West Bank crossing in May. State prosecutors believed the officer used live ammunition and not rubber bullets, in violation of the rules of engagement, and also lied to military and police investigators.\n\nA home in a West Bank Palestinian village was set on fire early yesterday in what appears to be another “price tag” attack by Jewish extremists. No one was hurt. Hebrew graffiti was sprayed on the wall of the house reading “Death to the Arabs”.",
  "latent_28479": "The Philippines in the Center of Asian Realignment By Andre Vltchek January 23, 2017 \" Information Clearing House \" - Philippines, for decades a limping invalid, poor and suffering from countless ailments, is now suddenly finding itself at the vanguard, reshuffling the entire Asia Pacific, sending Western imperialists packing. In Manila, where the US used to roam unopposed, now Russian warships are calling on goodwill and symbolic visits. On January 6 2017, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte boarded the Russian anti-submarine combat vessel Admiral Tributs, chatted with its officers, and then declared, loudly and clearly: “Friends, long live! That’s from the heart; I hope you can come back more often.” Definitely, Russians will be happy to come back! Associated Press (AP) reported on January 6: “ Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who accompanied Duterte on the ship tour, expressed optimism about “the start of a partnership” between the two countries’ defense establishments when he met with Russian navy officials Thursday night. “May our common aspirations for regional and global peace and security enable us to become good partners, cooperating and coordinating towards tranquil and safe seas for all,” Lorenzana said on board the Admiral Tributs. He said during his trip to Russia in early December, he agreed with Russian defense officials to finalize a memorandum of understanding that will be the basis of future military engagements, including joint military exercises, so it can be signed during Duterte’s planned trip to Russia…” President Duterte openly admires Russian President Vladimir Putin. He is planning to visit Moscow in April and he has already expressed his hope that Russia would become his country’s ‘ally and protector’. The Philippines is also rapidly moving closer to China. There is significant improvement of bilateral relationships. Tension over disputed territories in the South China Sea is being gradually defused, and Manila is increasingly considering Beijing as its new and powerful ally, investor and partner, definitely not as an enemy. While he is lashing at the US, the EU and the UN, (calling the former US President Barack Obama “son-of-a-whore”, and telling him to “go to hell!”), Mr. Duterte defines China as “the kindest nation”. This sort of rhetoric, let alone policies, can never be overlooked or forgiven by the West. A couple consisting of leading Philippine Academics, Eduardo and Teresa Tadem, explained the new direction of their country’s foreign policy: “ The trend is clear: away from the West, towards China and Russia. We think that he [Duterte] will soon reach a territorial agreement with China. Plenty of goodwill is now coming from President Xi Jinping. Things are done quietly, but some great concessions are already visible: our fishermen are allowed to return to the disputed area. China is pledging foreign aid, investment, and it is promising to make our railways work again.” However, Dr. Reynaldo Ileto, a leading Filipino historian, is concerned about Duterte’s survival, should he move too quickly with the regional realignment: “ He cannot break up with the United States too abruptly… he’d be killed.” For a while, in Manila, we were discussing the pattern established; the way the West treats the ‘rebellious’ countries and their governments: Ukraine, Brazil, and even the former President of the Philippines, Gloria Arroyo. “Arroyo moved closer to China”, explained Dr. Ileto: “They got her indicted for corruption. Only Duterte managed to release her.” Antagonizing China, even provoking it into a military conflict, has been the mainstay of US foreign policy in Asia, at least during the later years of the Obama administration. This dangerous trend will most likely continue, even accelerate, since Donald Trump has already taken office. President Duterte’s stubborn determination to reach a peaceful arrangement with China may put him squarely on the hit list of the Western Empire. Prof. Roland Simbulan from the Department of Social Sciences of the University of the Philippines confirms what Dr. Ileto suggested above: “ If Duterte moves too fast, he will be overthrown, by the military. He is an outsider. Police and army hold grudges against him. Many top military commanders here were trained by the US, and often even corrupted by the US. Duterte’s anti-US and anti-imperialist policy goes beyond rhetoric; it is real. He is confrontational, he is against the US foreign policy towards the Philippines and the world.” * However, President Duterte is not only a self-proclaimed socialist, he is also a pragmatist. For him, this is the best time to take advantage of confusion caused by the upcoming administration of Donald Trump and its frequent anti-Asian outbursts. Japan’s MP, Shinzo Abe, is looking for new allies in the Asia Pacific and beyond. His country is in disarray, horrified by Trump and his doctrines. China and Russia may be Mr. Duterte’s two new soul mates, but the deep pockets of Tokyo cannot be fully neglected either. During his two-day visit to the Philippines, Mr. Abe pledged to provide 1 trillion yen ($8.7 billion) in funding and investment. He also promised to assist with deteriorated infrastructure, and to help the Philippines with the maritime security vessels and aircraft. Japan is the Philippines’ largest provider of aid, a substantial source of remittances. Japan’s help is not expected to be altruistic. It is clearly understood by the analysts that Mr. Abe is now using his subtle diplomatic skills and financial incentives in order to seduce President Duterte into returning back to the US-Japan camp, and even abandoning the new alliance that is being presently forged between the Philippines, China, Russia and possibly Vietnam. It is a complex and dangerous game, which at the end of the road may lead to a war, even to a global conflict. There is absolutely no doubt on which side Japan has been standing. Both Japan and the Philippines have territorial disputes with China, but while the Philippines is lately opting for compromise and peaceful settlement, Japan is increasingly choosing a confrontational path. PM Shinzo Abe is well aware of the fact that later this year, the Philippines will be hosting the ASEAN meeting and therefore in a position to control the focus and influence the language of the joint communiqués. That is why he is willing to eat simple cakes and (at least metaphorically) sing his sweet and seductive songs in Duterte’s humble home in Davao. It is highly unlikely that President Duterte would scale down his cooperation with Beijing just in order to get his hands on a few more secondhand coastguard vessels, or for an extra dose of foreign aid. However, he is likely to continue maintaining his close relationship with Tokyo, as his country has been doing for decades. To emphasize it, he declared during his meeting with the PM Shinzo Abe: “ In Tokyo, I said that Japan deserves its own rightful place in the constellation of the Philippines’ friends… Tonight, let me reiterate that Japan is a friend closer than a brother. That means that Japan is a friend unlike any other.” Perhaps, or maybe not… * This is an extremely critical moment for Asia. China and Russia are rising, while old allies of the West, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are either in decline or in distress. The Philippines and Vietnam are calculating their next moves. Thailand, Malaysia and even Indonesia are suddenly uncertain about their previously staunch pro-Western stands. Father of the imperialist ‘Pivot to Asia’, President Barack Obama, has stepped down. Aggressive and anti-Asian leader Donald Trump is on to the throne. When it comes to the Empire and its involvement in Asia, things are getting from bad to worse. It is clear that the West is not willing to tolerate the leadership of Beijing even on China’s own continent. Now Washington has to deal with one more obstacle to its complete rule. Once fully obedient and submissive, a poor former US colony, the Philippines, is suddenly roaring, flexing its muscle, negotiating independently for the best deals available, and searching for its own destiny. Just one year ago all this would be unimaginable, but it is happening now. The entire Asian continent is watching and so is, most likely, the entire political, military and intelligence establishment of the West. The process is very quick (dangerously quick, say many in Manila), and Washington can hardly keep up with the changes. President Duterte is governing his complex country for only six months, and there are already many fundamental developments. Russian warships are visiting Manila and future joint exercises are being discussed, even planned. China and the Philippines are talking peace, friendship, cooperation and even railways. Vietnam and the Philippines are moving closer. Japan is suddenly coming as a humble friend, not as an economic bully. For the Philippines, 2017 will be decisive: the country will establish itself as one of the main catalysts of the changes in Asia, or it could collapse, be destroyed, from outside or from inside, with substantial external ‘help’.

  "latent_28577": "by Tzvi Twersky | @ttwersky\n\nAllen Iverson is prepared to officially announce his retirement from the NBA in the coming days, a source close to the native of Virginia told SLAM.\n\nIverson, 38, played his last professional basketball in Turkey in 2011. Before that, he appeared in his final NBA game, as a member of the Philadelphia 76ers, in 2010.\n\nWhen he last spoke publicly, at a Sixers game on March 30, Iverson answered a question about continuing his career by saying, “My No. 1 goal is trying to accomplish to be the best dad that I can. And if basketball is in my near future, then God will make that happen. But if not, I had a great ride and I’ve done a lot of special things that a lot of guys have not been able to accomplish and people thought I couldn’t accomplish.”\n\nIncluded amongst those accomplishments are: 13-year career averages of 41.1 mpg, 26.7 ppg, 6.2 apg and 2.2 spg; 71-game Playoff averages 45.1 mpg, 29.7 ppg, 6.0 apg and 2.1 spg. He also won one regular season MVP award, four scoring titles and was named an All-Star 11 times. Maybe most impressive of all, omitting the obvious impact that he had on the culture off-court, was the resilience that the 6-0 guard showed in driving into the lane, into men a foot taller than him, time and time again.\n\n“He might be the greatest athlete I’ve ever seen,” Larry Brown, Iverson’s coach from 1997-2003 and the current coach at SMU, told SLAM today. “I don’t think there’ll be another one like him.\n\n“I’m sure we faced a lot of obstacles, maybe even on a daily basis, but when it came time to play, to try to win a game, he tried to play as hard as he could for his coach.”\n\n“He had a magnificent career, and he enjoyed every minute of it,” says the source. “He enjoyed the places basketball took him, he enjoyed the camaraderie with his teammates and he especially enjoyed that his job was playing the game that he loved.”\n\nIn a lengthy sit-down interview with SLAM this past spring, Iverson was overcome with emotion when discussing his tenure in the NBA.\n\n“It enabled me—and it has enabled me—to take care of my family,” said Iverson. “It brought me so many fans and people that love me. I met so many great people. And it made me, whether I like it or not, a role model. It built me up, it knocked me down, it taught me how to get back up. It did a lot for me.”\n\nWith basketball behind him, Iverson, the source says, hopes to place all of his energy on his business holdings and children.\n\n“He loves his fans more than anyone,” says the source. “He loves how they ask for his return constantly, on the streets and on the internet. But now that they know it’s not happening, he can just focus on his future endeavors.”\n\nIverson will be eligible for induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\n“If I’m blessed with being a Hall of Famer, it will be emotional,” Iverson said to SLAM last spring. “You can’t mention ‘Allen Iverson’ and don’t mention basketball.”\n\nAfter starring at Georgetown, Iverson was selected No. 1 overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1996. He also spent time with the Denver Nuggets, Detroit Pistons and Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nSince appearing in his final game, at Chicago in February of 2010, Iverson occasionally mentioned the desire to return to the NBA. But for various reasons, both in and out of his control, he was never signed as a free agent.\n\nAnd now he never will be.\n\n“He deserves better,” said Brown. “I wish he could’ve went out on his own terms, at his own time.”",
  "latent_28599": "Louisiana is threatening to pass a bill that would require doctors to lie to women and tell them abortion causes mental health damage. This is bad news not just for abortion doctors, but for the mental health industry as well.\n\nLouisiana is threatening to pass a bill that would require doctors to lie to women and tell them abortion causes mental health damage. This is bad news not just for abortion doctors, but for the mental health industry as well.\n\nLies via Shutterstock\n\nTrying to scare women by touting the risks of abortion—while studiously ignoring the much greater risks of carrying a pregnancy to term—is one of the anti-choice movement’s favorite tactics. (And, as is par for the course with anti-choicers, they can’t help but exaggerate or just plain make up risks in order to up the ante.) The latest in a long string of state bills requiring doctors to provide such misleading literature to women seeking abortion has popped up in Louisiana. But unlike many of these bills, which require doctors to provide literature with lies claiming abortion causes breast cancer and other physical ailments, this bill is focused strictly on false mental health claims.\n\nUnder House Bill 1262, which passed the Louisiana House of Representatives on Monday, abortion providers would be required to distribute a pamphlet that includes information about the “alleged psychological effects of abortion,” and lists names of mental health resources for women who are seeking assistance. Patients would be required to sign a form confirming that they received the pamphlet, and then wait at least 24 hours before returning for abortion care.\n\nThe committee that’s been assigned the task of writing the pamphlet is made up of anti-choice activists and politicians. Actual mental health professionals were barred from being on the panel, continuing in the grand right-wing tradition of extreme hostility to actual science and evidence. It’s no wonder in this case, since the research on abortion and mental health demonstrates that having an abortion has no impact on later mental health outcomes, meaning that actual mental health professionals might do something unpleasant, like object to flagrant lying to women in an attempt to scare them out of abortion. The sleaziness of this entire operation is hard to overstate.\n\nIt’s easy enough to figure out what’s going on here. As with issues, like climate change or evolutionary theory, Christian conservatives have decided that they can ignore scientists, with their “facts” and their “evidence,” and instead choose to believe lies because they sound better to them. For anti-choicers, the logic is straightforward: Women are supposed to be asexual beings who are more interested in having babies than having sex. Since abortion often means a woman was having sex for the enjoyment of it, without being interested in having a baby, that must mean she is malfunctioning. So she’s assigned the label of “crazy,” which is prettied up with faux concerned language about “mental health.”\n\nGet the facts, direct to your inbox. Subscribe to our daily or weekly digest. SUBSCRIBE\n\nIn other words, these pamphlets are just a gussied up version of trolls on Twitter yelling at women that they are “crazy” if they don’t adhere strictly to the troll’s model of how women should be.\n\nUsing feigned concerns about women’s mental health as a cover for efforts to control and oppress them has a long and disturbing history, often involving “treatments” that are clearly just punishments. Charlotte Perkins Gilman famously called this out for what it was in “The Yellow Wallpaper,” her fictionalized depiction of one of these punishment-treatments that was popular in the late 19th century, involving forced isolation under the guise of treatment for “hysteria.” (Nowadays, psychologists rightfully point out that social isolation is actually the cause for mental health damage, so much so that many human rights activists consider the use of solitary confinement in prisons to be a form of torture.)\n\nThe use of “mental health” as a cover to punish and shame women for resisting strict gender roles continued on after that, as was documented in the 1978 classic For Her Own Good: Two Centuries of the Experts’ Advice to Women, by Barbara Ehrenreich and Deidre English. As with anti-choicers who are so “concerned” about women’s mental health now, Ehrenreich and English found that for two centuries now misogynists have been keen on classifying women as deviant and crazy if they ever showed symptoms of wanting to have more out of life than being a wife and mother, or if they ever had sexual desires that weren’t geared strictly toward procreative purposes.\n\nWhat’s frustrating is that recent decades have shown a strong move in the medical and psychological world away from that, and toward supporting women’s actual mental health needs, regardless of how closely they’re adhering to female gender roles at any point in time. Respectable mental health professionals these days wouldn’t dare suggest there’s something wrong with a woman who wants to have non-procreative sex or who has a strong desire to control when and if she gives birth. On the contrary, the overwhelming evidence suggests that unintended childbearing has adverse health effects, including mental health effects.\n\nAnd yet, here we have a bunch of science-rejecting conservatives still clinging to outdated and wholly disproven theories that women are “crazy” for wanting things like non-procreative sex and control over when they give birth. This not only poses a danger to women who are seeking abortion and might feel unnecessary fear about their decisions. By perpetuating the notion that women are “crazy” if they don’t adhere to extremely narrowly prescribed gender roles, anti-choicers are perpetuating mental health stigma and discouraging women who might actually need mental health care from getting it.\n\nThe fear of having the misogynist stereotype of the “crazy woman” applied to them surely keeps a lot of women who actually need mental health treatment from reaching out, instead opting to hide their mental health issues and hope that no one notices them. This goes double if you threaten them with mental health damage if they dare get an abortion. Should these women have mental health issues later—which some will, for reasons unrelated to the abortion, and just because a certain percentage of all people have mental health problems—the shaming and fear they got from the state may cause them to fear reaching out, lest they confirm that ugly stereotype.\n\nThis is why attacks on abortion have to be understood as being about more than just abortion itself. They inevitably end up having ripple effects that damage seemingly unrelated arenas, such as mental health care. The mental health industry has worked really hard to overturn decades of misogyny disguised as medical concern. Now the anti-choice movement is working to reverse some of the effects of all that hard work.",

My entire career is based around understanding the neural basis of behavior which, I think, is pretty justifiable.\n\nSo when I see paper looking at the genetics of behavior, I expect to see at least one or two genes that are directly involved in neural function. A dopamine receptor, probably, or maybe some calcium channels that are acting up. And in one recent paper looking at schizophrenia, that’s exactly what we find! A D2-like dopamine receptor and some glutamate genes. My world is consistent.\n\nBut then we get a paper about friendship from Christakis and Fowler who find that friends are more likely to be genetically related to you than chance. So that means that your close friend? Basically a fourth cousin. What Christakis and Fowler have found is a few sets of genes that seem like they might influence friendship.

  "latent_29439": "This article is over 3 years old\n\nStuart Shearer, aka ‘Judge Dread’, vacates his position in Emerald after he was accused of improperly influencing a case\n\nA controversial Queensland magistrate vacated his country court circuit after he was accused of improperly influencing a case by contacting a witness due to testify before him.\n\nStuart Shearer, who was one of a number of contentious legal appointments by the former Newman government, drew the complaint from lawyers representing an Indigenous defendant who faced Woorabinda magistrates court earlier this year.\n\nThe magistrate, whose reputation for tough treatment of offenders led to a newspaper calling him “Judge Dread”, recused himself from the case.\n\nHe was later repeatedly spoken to and given “advice” after the complaint reached the state’s chief magistrate, Ray Rinaudo.\n\nShearer has finished his stint in Emerald, central Queensland, several months early and is now hearing matters in Brisbane because of what Rinaudo said was “an ongoing medical issue”.\n\nThe complaint stemmed from a telephone call Shearer allegedly made to a duty solicitor who was to be called to give evidence in a hearing as to why the Indigenous defendant, charged with various property offences, should be allowed to change a plea of guilty.\n\nThe duty solicitor had indicated the guilty plea when first appearing for the defendant.\n\nAnother solicitor from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal service (Atsils) in Rockhampton told Shearer at the next hearing she wished to vacate the plea as she had learned there was a defence to the charges.\n\nShearer ordered that she call evidence, which was to include testimony from the first lawyer.\n\nThe magistrate subsequently telephoned that lawyer, giving rise to the complaint.\n\nThe nature of a magistrate’s role in Queensland, where there is no judicial commission, is such that they do not face any kind of formal disciplinary mechanism but can receive mentoring from a senior colleague.\n\nRinaudo told Guardian Australia in a statement that he was “satisfied the issue has been dealt with”.\n\n“Magistrate Shearer had already recused himself from the [Woorabinda court] matter when he first alerted me to it. I spoke to him about the issue and provided advice,” Rinaudo said.\n\n“I subsequently received the oral complaint. I and one of my deputy magistrates had further conversations with magistrate Shearer about the complaint.”\n\nRinaudo said Shearer was to end his two-year stint at Emerald in June but “due to an ongoing medical issue he is currently sitting in Brisbane”.\n\n“His future working obligations will be subject to medical advice,” he said.\n\nShearer declined to comment. Atsils’ Queensland director, Shane Duffy, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt is not the first controversy to arise during Shearer’s career on the bench since his 2012 appointment by the former attorney general, Jarrod Bleijie.\n\nShearer was appointed from the same barristers’ chambers that contained the future chief justice, Tim Carmody, a future magistrate and husband of Bleijie staffer, Aaron Simpson, and a former Bleijie adviser, Ryan Haddrick.\n\nThat run of appointments from the John Gerrard chambers earned it the nickname “the magical chambers” in the Brisbane legal scene.\n\nIn 2013, a top QC made submissions on behalf of his client to Shearer that he had acted unlawfully by ordering the QC’s client, a court bystander, into custody for four hours without charge after she allegedly verbally abused the magistrate. The woman later apologised through her QC “for her outburst”, which was accepted by the magistrate and she was released without charge.\n\nShearer was called “Judge Dread” by the Courier-Mail last month when it reported that his tough stance towards offenders meant “defence lawyers loathe him but police love him”.",

  "latent_29714": "When populations around the globe started turning to agriculture around 10,000 years ago, regardless of their locations and type of crops, a similar trend occurred: The height and health of the people declined.\n\n\"This broad and consistent pattern holds up when you look at standardized studies of whole skeletons in populations,\" says Amanda Mummert, an Emory graduate student in anthropology.\n\nMummert led the first comprehensive, global review of the literature regarding stature and health during the agriculture transition, to be published by the journal Economics and Human Biology.\n\n\"Many people have this image of the rise of agriculture and the dawn of modern civilization, and they just assume that a more stable food source makes you healthier,\" Mummert says. \"But early agriculturalists experienced nutritional deficiencies and had a harder time adapting to stress, probably because they became dependent on particular food crops, rather than having a more significantly diverse diet.\"\n\nShe adds that growth in population density spurred by agriculture settlements led to an increase in infectious diseases, likely exacerbated by problems of sanitation and the proximity to domesticated animals and other novel disease vectors.\n\nEventually, the trend toward shorter stature reversed, and average heights for most populations began increasing. The trend is especially notable in the developed world during the past 75 years, following the industrialization of food systems.\n\n\"Culturally, we're agricultural chauvinists. We tend to think that producing food is always beneficial, but the picture is much more complex than that,\" says Emory anthropologist George Armelagos, co-author of the review. \"Humans paid a heavy biological cost for agriculture, especially when it came to the variety of nutrients. Even now, about 60 percent of our calories come from corn, rice and wheat.\"\n\nIn 1984, Armelagos and M. N. Cohen wrote the book, \"Paleopathology at the Origins of Agriculture,\" which drew from more than 20 studies to describe an increase in declining health and nutritional diseases as societies shifted from foraging to agriculture.\n\nThe book was controversial at the time, but the link between the agricultural transition and declining health soon became widely accepted in what was then the emerging field of bioarcheology.\n\nThe current review was undertaken to compare data from more recent studies involving different world regions, crops and cultures. The studies included populations from areas of China, Southeast Asia, North and South America and Europe. All of the papers used standardized methods for assessing health at the individual level and examined how stressors were exhibited within the entire skeleton, rather than a concentration on a particular skeletal element or condition.\n\n\"Unless you're considering a complete skeleton, you're not getting a full picture of health,\" Mummert says. \"You could have an individual with perfect teeth, for example, but serious markers of infection elsewhere. You could see pitting on the skull, likely related to anemia or nutritional stress, but no marks at all on the long bones.\"\n\nAdult height, dental cavities and abscesses, bone density and healed fractures are some of the markers used to try to paint a more complete picture of an individual's health.\n\n\"Bones are constantly remodeling themselves,\" Mummert says. \"Skeletons don't necessarily tell you what people died of, but they can almost always give you a glimpse into their ability to adapt and survive.\"\n\nWhile the review further supports the link between early agricultural practices and declining stature and health, it's important to keep re-evaluating the data as more studies are completed, Mummert says.\n\nOne confounding factor is that agriculture was not adopted in an identical fashion and time span across the globe. In some ancient societies, such as those of the North American coasts, crops may have merely supplemented a seafood diet. \"In these cases, a more sedentary lifestyle, and not necessarily agriculture, could have perpetuated decreased stature,\" Mummert says.\n\nThe way the human body adapted to changes we made in the environment 10,000 years ago could help us understand how our bodies are adapting now, she says.\n\nSome economists and other scientists are using the rapid physiological increases in human stature during the 20th century as a key indicator of better health.\n\n\"I think it's important to consider what exactly 'good health' means,\" Mummert says. \"The modernization and commercialization of food may be helping us by providing more calories, but those calories may not be good for us. You need calories to grow bones long, but you need rich nutrients to grow bones strong.\"",
  "latent_29735": "Republican leaders say they will table health care talks following the defeat of the House GOP to replace Obamacare. As House Speaker Paul Ryan put it, \"Obamacare is the law of the land.\"\n\nBut some conservatives say that President Barack Obama’s signature piece of legislation can’t last much longer, regardless of whether Congress finds a legislative compromise.\n\n\"It is in a death spiral,\" conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said March 26 on Meet the Press. \"The New York Times yesterday pointed out that — the president of Aetna — that you will lose coverage in many places in America for everyone, and that to me is a death spiral for those people.\"\n\nThe idea that Obamacare is in a \"death spiral\" — a specific term used in the health insurance industry — is a claim that we’ve heard before. Experts say Hewitt is incorrect.\n\nWe reached out to Hewitt through his radio program but did not hear back.\n\nStill no ‘death spiral’\n\n\"Death spiral\" is a health industry term built around three components:\n\nShrinking enrollment; Healthy people leaving the system; Rising premiums.\n\nSpecifically, a death spiral occurs when shrinking enrollment leads to a deteriorating risk pool (or when healthy people leave the plan due to the cost). That leads to higher premiums for the people remaining in the insurance pools, which causes enrollment to shrink even further, continuing the cycle until the entire system fails.\n\nThe latest government figures show enrollment in the Affordable Care Act is slightly down from last year. Through Jan. 31, 2017, some 12.2 million people were signed up for coverage through a federal or state marketplace, which is a decrease of 500,000, or 4 percent, from the same point last year.\n\nExperts noted that marketplace sign-ups were running in line with their 2016 pace as of the middle of January, which experts said might suggest the decline in sign-ups was somehow related to the Trump administration, not an impending death spiral.\n\nFor example, the Trump administration decided to at least partially halt marketing and outreach encouraging people to sign up for health coverage.\n\nBut experts say the enrollment decline isn’t an indication the health care law is in a death spiral. There is no direct connection, they said, showing that the declining enrollment is causing premiums to increase.\n\nWhy not? Because federal government subsidies in the form of tax credits are largely shielding customers from feeling the premium increase.\n\nAs we have reported, premiums are increasing. But that isn’t affecting the cost for most consumers, due to built-in subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The subsidies cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400 percent of the federal poverty level (in 2016 that would be $47,520 for a single person).\n\nAmong the people who have signed up so far for 2017, 81 percent will receive a subsidy.\n\nData also shows no uptick in healthy people leaving the health insurance market.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports the share of people signing up for health care in the low-risk demographic — ages 18-34 — remains about the same in 2017 as it was in 2016, at 26 percent of enrollees.\n\n\"There is no data to indicate a drop in the number of younger enrolled, although the announced policy not to enforce the IRS penalty, if not reversed, could result in a decline over time,\" said John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care.\n\nHewitt referred to a New York Times article that quotes the president of Aetna saying that in many places people will lose health care insurance.\n\nWe couldn’t find that article, but a simple remark on how premiums are rising and insurers are leaving the marketplace is not enough evidence to meet the actuarial definition of a death spiral.\n\nCBO, independent analysis: No death spiral\n\nOthers have also concluded that the Affordable Care Act is not in a death spiral. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, as part of its recent analysis of the GOP legislation, described the Affordable Care Act as stable.\n\nMatthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, similarly concluded in a recent analysis that the Affordable Care Act is not in a death spiral.\n\nFiedler found that marketplace premium increases had little if any impact on health insurance sign-ups and that the impact on the individual market risk pool will more than likely be minor, despite the small decline in enrollment numbers.\n\n\"It therefore remains likely that insurers’ individual market business will return to a roughly break-even or slightly profitable position in 2017, absent other policy changes,\" Fiedler wrote.\n\nOur ruling\n\nHewitt said Obamacare is \"in a death spiral.\"\n\nThat’s a specific phrase that describes a process where health people leaving the insurance market causes insurance premiums to rise to the point that more healthy people leave the market. At some point, the system becomes unsustainable.\n\nExperts say there is no evidence that cycle has started with Obamacare, because federal subsidies are keeping people from feeling the brunt of premium increases. The CBO and other independent analyses have found the health care system to be stable.\n\nWe rate this claim False.",
  "latent_29819": "(CNN) The Burmese python, one of the largest snakes in the world, is running amok in Florida.\n\nWell, more like slithering amok.\n\nSo much so that on Saturday, state officials kick off a month-long competition designed to remove as many of the colossal constrictors from the Everglades as possible.\n\nMore than 600 people have signed up for the Python Challenge, according to Carli Segelson, a spokeswoman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, which organized the event.\n\nA cash prize goes to the hunter who captures -- dead or alive -- the most Burmese pythons, as well as one for the longest one.\n\nWhy? Because the Burmese python, which can be as large as 23 feet long and weigh up to 200 pounds, doesn't belong in the Everglades, in Florida -- or even in this hemisphere for that matter.\n\nThe native Southeast Asian snake is \"wreaking havoc on one of America's most beautiful, treasured and naturally bountiful ecosystems,\" U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt said of the 1.5-million-acre Everglades National Park in a 2012 report. \"Right now, the only hope to halt further python invasion into new areas is swift, decisive and deliberate human action.\"\n\nBut that is no easy feat; the unwelcome guests are thriving in the habitat and climate provided by the Everglades.\n\n\"Even though it seems like such a large snake would be easy to find or see, only a very small fraction of pythons present in the park are ever detected,\" the USGS says on its website. \"Their cryptic coloration; hide, wait, and then ambush behavior; the dense low vegetation that helps conceal them; and seasonal inundation of the landscape, (are) limiting human access.\"\n\nJust how hard are they to find? In the inaugural Python Challenge in 2013, 1,600 hunters could only produce 68 of them . In fact, the Burmese python is so hard to detect, Segelson said there are no reliable estimates as to how many of them there actually are in Florida -- but they've been a long-simmering problem for the state.\n\nOnce allowed as an exotic pet, officials trace the Burmese python's entry into the ecosystem to 1992, when \"Burmese pythons escaped from a breeding facility that was destroyed during Hurricane Andrew,\" according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's website. \"It is also likely that pet pythons have been released in and around the Everglades,\" it says.\n\nThe effect has been profound; the invasive species is responsible for causing the near \"complete disappearance of raccoons, rabbits and opossums,\" according to the USGS, and goes almost completely unchecked in its environment.\n\nThe Burmese python has only two natural predators; one of them, the American alligator, is dubbed the \"king of the Everglades\" by the National Park Service. Beginning Saturday, 600 of the other natural predators species will spend the next month hoping to bring in big snakes, and take home the grand prize.",
  "latent_29964": "The Terror of Tiny Town is a 1938 American film produced by Jed Buell, directed by Sam Newfield, and starring Billy Curtis. It is the world's only musical Western with an all-midget cast. The film was filmed at a sound studio in Hollywood and partly at Placeritos Ranch in Placerita Canyon, California.[1] The inspiration of the film came when Jed Buell overheard an employee jokingly say “If this economic dive keeps going, we'll be using midgets as actors”.[2]\n\nUsing a conventional Western story with an all midget cast, the filmmakers were able to showcase gags such as cowboys entering the local saloon by walking under the swinging doors, climbing into cupboards to retrieve items, and midget cowboys galloping around on Shetland ponies while roping calves.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nThe film begins with a man on a stage who is the only cast member in the entire film who is of average height. The M.C. goes on to say that this film is the first of its kind and names it The Terror of Tiny Town. Then walks on stage the hero, Buck Larson who interrupts the emcee, telling him that the story is serious as he is the hero and will become the biggest star in Hollywood. The villain of the film, Bat Haines, comes on stage to say that he will be the biggest star in Hollywood. The two then proceed to argue and try to fight each other. The emcee breaks them up and lets the film proceed.\n\nThe townspeople are at work while singing Laugh Your Troubles Away. Buck Larson's father, Pop Larson, tells Buck that he wants him to go to the ranch and find out why the calves are disappearing. Bat Haines and his gang are seen roping the calves while riding Shetland ponies. Buck spots the cattle rustlers, and they run off before he can see them up close. The rustlers plant a branding iron with the initials of a neighboring rancher, Tex Preston. Meanwhile, Bat tells Tex that the Larsons are shooting his cattle.\n\nLater Tex goes to town to retrieve his niece, Nancy Preston, who was orphaned and will now live with her uncle. In the town saloon Bat tells the sheriff to stay out of the Larson and Preston feud or he will be sent back to the jail. He also reveals that he will rob a stagecoach carrying money. While Bat and his gang try to rob the carriage, Buck and his group see the attack and run Bat Haines off. Buck is able to stop the runaway carriage that is carrying Preston's niece, Nancy. After Nancy gives Buck her thanks, Buck takes Nancy back into town. Buck and Nancy's romance continues, but they have to meet in secret due to the family feud. Nancy and Buck are discovered by Pop Larson and are forced to stay away from each other.\n\nBuck chases after Nancy and together they ride away. Bat spies on the couple and tells Tex that they are together. Tex rides to meet them and sends Nancy home. Buck convinces Tex that someone else has stolen their property. As Tex rides away he is murdered by Bat who then tries to kill Buck, but fails. Bat tells Nancy that it was Buck who shot Tex. Bat forces the sheriff to arrest Buck for Tex's murder. Buck confronts Nancy and convinces her he didn't shoot Tex, and in the process figures out that it is Bat who is causing all the problems.\n\nBuck confronts Bat in the town's saloon and punches him. The Sheriff then takes Buck into custody. Bat plans to take matters into his own hands and tries to have Buck hanged without a trial. Buck sends Nancy to the Larson ranch to round up people who will help Buck escape. As the angry mob closes in on Buck, the sheriff intervenes but is shot by Bat. Bat escapes through the window before the Larson crew arrives. Buck chases after Bat to his secret hideout. Meanwhile, the angry dance hall girl, Nita, plants dynamite in Bat's cabin. She is angry after Bat neglected and hit her. Buck and Bat engage in a final duel inside the cabin. Buck is able to run out of the cabin at the last second, leaving Bat Haines behind. The cabin blows up as Bat prepares to shoot Buck in the back of the head. Buck and Nancy are finally able to share a kiss.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nBilly Curtis as The Hero (Buck Lawson)\n\nYvonne Moray as The Girl (Nancy Preston)\n\nLittle Billy Rhodes as The Villain (Bat Haines)\n\nBilly Platt as The Rich Uncle (Jim 'Tex' Preston)\n\nJohn T.

The film was last released in 2017 by Mr Fat - W Video and Film Detective on May 2nd, and June 29th respectively.[7]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nThe Terror of Tiny Town received mostly negative reviews upon its release, with some considering it the worst film ever made. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film one and a half out of four stars, calling it 'A typical, badly enacted stagebrush plot\".[8] TV Guide awarded the film one out of four stars, calling it \"One of the strangest ideas ever put to film\".[9] Charles Tatum from eFilmCritic.com gave the film one out of five stars, panning the film's acting, screenplay, and musical numbers; stating that the film was \"so short on entertainment\".[10] Craig Butler from Allmovie panned the film, calling it \"disappointingly boring\", criticizing the film's amateurish acting, unimaginative screenplay, and uninspired direction.[11] On his website Ozus' World Movie Reviews, Dennis Schwartz awarded the film a grade C+, writing, \"It holds up as a curio for those parties who are just curious to see midget cowboys in action.\"[12] Film Threat noted that, although it 'wasn't a great movie', it was still fun to watch. On the film's entertainment value, the reviewer wrote, \"The Terror of Tiny Town is so patently weird and spirited that it actually becomes very funny (albeit in a perverse and politically incorrect way). The midget cast isn't especially talented and a lot of the dialogue reading comes across as hilariously stilted (the fight sequences are priceless in their clumsiness – obviously stunt doubles were out of the question here). And Nita Krebs, as the Dietricheseque saloon singer, is so wildly over-the-top (or under-the-top, in her case), that her musical siren call is priceless in its warped eroticism.\"[13]\n\nLegacy [ edit ]\n\nIn 1986, the movie was featured in an episode of the Canned Film Festival.[14]\n\nIn 1980, the film was mentioned in the M*A*S*H episode \"Morale Victory\"; Corporal Klinger is trying to procure new movies for the 4077th, but the only one he can find is Tiny Town, mentioning the film has an all-midget cast, to which Hawkeye replies \"What do we do? Show it on a pillowcase??\"\n\nIn 1991, Hal Ketchum used clips from the film in his Small Town Saturday Night video.\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

  "latent_30071": "One of the sad, lasting legacies of the previous administration was the destruction of personal liberty and privacy which followed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.

  "latent_30108": "VIDEO: Infrastructure (Last Week Tonight with John Oliver)\n\nSydney Rapid Transit (SRT) could reach a new airport at Badgerys Creek, possibly via the existing Kingsford Smith airport at Mascot, as part of the Southern extension of a Second Harbour Rail Crossing. The idea was floated last week by the Transport Minister Andrew Constance when he said that “I think it is a case of putting all things on the table”, in which he also called on the Australian Government to provide funding for a rail line to Badgerys Creek. The Australian Government has committed $2.9bn in funding for roads to support the airport, but no money for rail.\n\nAndrew Constance floats idea of linking second cross harbour rail tunnel to airport. Calls for Fed govt funding for transport. #WSairport — Elisha Pearce (@ElishaPearce) May 1, 2015\n\nThe proposal is currently little more than a thought bubble. But if it were to happen, what could it look like and how would it build on existing plans that are already locked in?\n\nThe current plan\n\nThe North West Rail Link (NWRL) from Rouse Hill to Epping is currently under construction. It will be connected to the Epping to Chatswood Line, set to be closed in 2018 so that it can be converted, with the new Rouse Hill to Chatswood Line opening in 2019. Construction of a Second Harbour Rail Crossing from Chatswood to Sydenham will begin in 2017, and is expected to open in 2024. This will also see the Bankstown Line converted to single deck operation between Bankstown and Sydenham, also with a 2024 opening.\n\nThere are further plans to expand the line from Sydenham to Hurstville. Earlier plans showed the line extending from Bankstown to both Lidcombe and Cabramatta, but more recent plans show the line terminating at Bankstown and not continuing further.\n\nPast plans\n\nA rail line from the North West to the South West via the CBD is not a new concept. This is exactly what was proposed in 2005 as part of the Metropolitan Rail Expansion Program (MREP). This would involve the extension of the Epping to Chatswood Line via the construction of the NWRL and the extension of the then East Hills Line (now T2 Airport Line) via the construction of the South West Rail Link (SWRL). Core capacity would then be increased by building a new under the Harbour and CBD rail line, plus additional tracks from Chatswood to St Leonards; Sydenham to Erskineville; and Kingsgrove to Revesby. The difference is that the MREP proposal would use double deck trains and travel via Sydenham, therefore bypassing the existing Airport Line.\n\nA metro line out towards Sydney’s South West was also part of a leaked 2012 report, which suggested extending SRT from Wolli Creek to Revesby. This would follow the initial conversion of the T3 Bankstown Line and then later also a portion of the T4 Illawarra through to Hurstville to the new SRT system. The latter of these two conversions passes through Wolli Creek, which would allow the portion of the T2 Airport Line to also be converted. SRT could then provide all station services on these lines, with the remaining T2 and T4 trains running express from the outer suburbs.\n\nHowever, this proposal would not actually reach either airport.\n\nHow it could work\n\nIf both airports are to be connected then the entire T2 Airport Line would need to be converted to SRT between Glenfield and Central. The resultant shift of patronage from the T2 Airport Line to SRT together with the ability for SRT to reach the T2 Airport Line directly from Central without having to travel between Wolli Creek and Sydenham, eliminates the need to convert the T4 Illawarra Line to SRT. In fact, it would make more sense to maintain all station services from Hurstville within the Sydney Trains network and instead send them into the City Circle, joining the remaining T2 Airport Line trains (which would likely revert to the previous East Hills Line name, given they would no longer travel via the airport). This lifts the current capacity constraint on the T4 Illawarra Line, which along with the T1 Western Line is Sydney’s most congested.\n\nThe T2 Airport Line currently has 4 tracks between Wolli Creek through to Revesby in the West, where it drops down to 2 tracks. The line West of Revesby would need to be quadruplicated out to Glenfield, providing 2 tracks for T2 trains and 2 tracks for SRT trains. The Northern end of Glenfield Junction may also require some upgrading to prevent any conflicting moves between T2 and SRT trains, however the Southern end is flexible enough to be able to handle the merger of Sydney Trains and SRT services. From there it is simply a matter of converting the existing SWRL to SRT, while also extending the line out to Badgerys Creek or further.\n\nJourneys from the SWRL would be limited to all stop services on SRT, which would probably take around 60 minutes from Badgerys Creek to Central (perhaps 45 minutes if SRT allowed for shorter dwell times and faster acceleration). Passengers could change at Glenfield with a simple cross platform transfer to a faster express train directly to Central (or elsewhere).\n\nMeanwhile, the shutdown of the T2 Airport Line for SRT conversion could also be used as an opportunity to add an additional station (Doody St) between Mascot and Green Square and/or an additional station (Waterloo) between Green Square and Central. This would allow the Central to Sydenham alignment of SRT to take the Northern approach, via Sydney University; rather than the alternative proposal via Waterloo.\n\nThe 10km portion of the T2 Airport Line between Wolli Creek and Central is currently privately owned, but reverts to public ownership in 2030. Conversion would probably have to occur after 2030. However, with the initial Rouse Hill to Bankstown portion of SRT set to open in 2024 and an airport at Badgerys Creek set to open in 2026, the timing is not too far off the mark. Rail services would not be running on the day the airport opens, but they could commence a few years afterwards. This is problematic if the aim is rail on day one, but ideal timing if the aim is for a gradual increase in transport connections as airport usage ramps up over time.\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_30166": "Novelist has spent the last two years cementing his standing in grime as more than just an up-and-coming MC. From getting signed to XL Recordings, to him recently featuring on \"Lyrics\"—one of the standouts on Skepta's Konnichiwa LP—his presence and importance in the scene is in constant ascension. Speaking to him at 1pm on a Friday, Nov is busy walking round Lewisham, happily stopping to talk to everyone he meets (and he seems to know everyone!). He is instantly personable and eager to go directly into talking about the political plight the UK finds itself in at the minute. Politics, for Novelist, isn't something that's distant or separate to him; it's something he felt he's always needed to be a part of and engage with on a personal level, first exhibited in his Manifesto video for Lewisham Young Mayor back in 2012.\n\nNovelist's ongoing political sentiment—publicly joining Labour, backing Corbyn, and getting ravers to chant \"Fuck David Cameron\" live at shows—highlights his desire for people to stand up and confront the UK's disjointed political system. Here, he opens up to Complex on the need for people to carry on keeping their minds, eyes and ears open through engagement with politics, music and culture and striving for greatness in a political epoch that will become synonymous with disorder, disarray and disregarding towards the interests of today's young people.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nInterview by Jacob Davey\n\nYou've noticeably been politically active on Twitter for a while now, but more so now than ever.\n\nNowadays, I'm just gonna say what I'm thinking rather than think I'm gonna get blacklisted for what I say. When I first started music, it was for the people anyway fam. So I wanna talk about what's going on in the country as a whole.\n\nWhy did you decide to join Labour?\n\nWell, Labour have always been for the people. And when I say \"the people\", I mean the people as a whole; whether you're rich, whether you're poor—it's about having morals and standards. The Tories and Lib Dems, they're not concerned about someone who comes from the position I'm coming from. They don't get my scenario because I'm not from somewhere of opulence. They're from the mindset of 'make your own money', but it's not as simple as that. Whereas Labour are more understanding of all scenarios.\n\nWhy are you backing Jeremy Corbyn? Do you think he was vocal enough about wanting us to remain in the EU?\n\nTo be honest—yeah. Why I'm backing Corbyn is nothing to do with this current situation. He's someone who, if I saw on the road right now, I could have a chat with him. There's other people in my scenario who feel the same way too. If you went up to him and told him your problems, I feel like he'll understand you and where you're coming from. I feel like he's the uncle of the country you know [laughs]. And you see people like David Cameron? I feel there's a separation between him and the people, and everything is so corporate with him.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDo you think his replacement could be even worse?\n\nYep! It's fucked.\n\nDo you think people need to get out there and protest against the government, the referendum result?\n\nI do, but I also feel like it's London vs the UK right now. I'm not saying not to protest, because I'd be down, I'd be there, but if we're going to do that shit here we're gonna cause harm for ourselves because the rest of the country doesn't seem to care anyway.\n\nWas the EU Leave campaign a fear campaign?\n\nThe way it was publicised to the people, it was definitely a fear campaign. Even with immigration and all that shit, it's not about to change anyway. So, they're saying \"these people are gonna take our jobs\" and all that bullshit... Tell me how leaving the EU is gonna make that different? It's not gonna make anything different, other than the price of everything go up!\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn 2016, grime artists have a platform bigger than they've ever had before. Do you think more MCs should be more political?\n\nEveryone should! Whether you're grime, football, whatever—state your opinion. Everyone is allowed to have an opinion. People will say that you're jumping on the bandwagon when it comes to politics. But with politics, there is no bandwagon! We're all living it. Maybe some of us have woken up later than others, but still. I've always been politically aware. Someone was saying to me on Twitter the other day \"you've watched one Akala interview and now you think you're politically active!\" I will duppy you now, fam! I do know what's going on. And Akala makes a fair point—but do you think one musician alone should be doing that? No.\n\nIn the coming years, do you think grime can have as much impact as punk did 40 years ago as an anarchist genre?\n\nTo a certain extent. If you're from the hood, you've already got that 'fuck you' attitude. So I think grime can definitely do that.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHow can more people can get involved with politics?\n\nTalk more. Don't stop talking! Nothing's gonna change unless you make it change. I'll give you an example: at school, there's always that one dickhead knocking about, and there's always one younger that knocks them out. So, stand up for yourself. Don't be afraid to, and don't be afraid to change things. Don't think nothing's gonna change just because you've had it drilled into you that it might not.\n\nHave you always been into politics?\n\nIn my head, it's never been politics. I've always looked it as something that I've always been aware of and a part of. How are you supposed to defend yourself if you don't know what's happening? It's not something that's taught in the education system in the UK. Trying to get people to engage is key! It's difficult, and I wish more people were on this way of thinking.\n\nWill Tugg Set be releasing any politically-charged content?\n\nYeah, man. The Tugg Set mandem are some real G's and the music isn't glamourising guns and all that fuckery. It's just real, with a whole new sound that's a bit more dark. The world's a dark place right now, so it's reflective of that.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe times we're living in inspires the best music, the best satire.\n\nBruv! I can't believe we're living in this era. The pound's dropped lower than Thatcher's days.\n\nDid you see it went up again after Boris Johnson announce he wasn't running for PM?\n\n[Laughs] That's hilarious... Yo! Hold on a sec...\n\n[Novelist stops to talk to the third or fourth person he's seen whilst walking about during the interview].\n\nEveryone seems to know you!\n\n[Laughs] Yeah, man. Since young, I've always tried to be a man of the manor—someone who is respectful and someone who people respect.\n\nSo, when's Tugg Set Vol. 1 coming out?\n\nThat's something I don't really talk about. You see when Skepta talks about #GREATNESS? He's someone who really knows, and gets, what greatness is. I don't put time on greatness. See when Dizzee dropped Boy In Da Corner? When did that come out? We know it was like '03 or summit, but we don't know the exact date and people are still talking about that album today. I never really worry, because if it's great, it's gonna be great forever. But we've got tunes in the works—just know that.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRandom one, but what do you think of Skepta's new song \"Coming Soon\"? I feel like the hate on that track is unjustified.\n\nMate, that tune is sick! I've been saying to him for time how much I rate it. I just feel like there's a lot of wankers and no real, actual fans of how the music sounds. They're more about the whole image or the style. Whereas if they were about the music and sound, they'd automatically rate it. A lot of the hate is just ignorance.",
  "latent_30294": "Pamela Waldron makes $7.75 an hour as a cashier at the KFC in New York's Penn Station, where she has worked for eight years.\n\nThat's just 50 cents above the New York state minimum wage. The 26-year old nursing student, and mother of two, says she has asked for a raise but her pleas have gone unheeded for weeks.\n\nFinally, on Thursday, around lunchtime she joined a protest of about 40 fast food workers who walked out of their shifts, carrying placards and shouting slogans to bring attention to their cause of fighting for higher wages and the right to unionize. The protest was held outside a Burger King (BKW) near Penn Station.\n\n\"We're the ones who run the store day in and day out, and it's not easy,\" said Waldron.\n\nEarlier, Thursday morning, 14 workers from a midtown Manhattan McDonald's (MCD) location also walked out of their shifts in protest, according to a community organization New York Communities for Change.\n\nThe group said it had organized several protests at different locations in the city, including Times Square and the Fulton Street Mall in Brooklyn. Workers from McDonald's, Burger King, and Yum Brand (YUM)-run restaurants KFC and Taco Bell are expected to join.\n\nWorkers say they are asking for a pay raise to $15 an hour and the right to form a union. Currently, the median pay for the nearly 50,000 fast food workers in New York City is $9 an hour, or $18,500 a year, according to the New York Labor Department. That's about $4,500 lower than Census Bureau's poverty income threshold level of $23,000 for a family of four.\n\nKFC worker Waldron says she would be homeless with her kids if it were not for her husband's union-represented job at the grocery store chain Pathmark.\n\nUnder the National Labor Relations Act, workers are protected from retaliation as long as they work in concert with at least one other employee to try to change their working conditions. However, they can be \"permanently replaced\" if they strike for purely economic reasons, according to Ken Margolies, a senior associate at the Worker Institute at Cornell University.\n\n\"The workers who strike are taking a significant risk that takes a lot of courage,\" Margolies said.\n\nRelated: Fast food sales slow in China\n\nRaymond Lopez, a 21-year old shift manager at the midtown Manhattan McDonald's, was one of the workers protesting Thursday morning. Lopez makes $8.75 an hour, after working at the hamburger joint for two years. Despite a 40-hour work week, Lopez works two more jobs to supplement his income, a part-time job at a condominium and at a caterer to pay his bills and his $500 student loan payments each month.\n\n\"I wouldn't be able to survive just working at McDonald's,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Jonathon Westin, the organizing director for New York Communities for Change, workers like Lopez can't afford rent or to put food on the table with their meager wages.\n\n\"Many of these workers have to rely on government assistance because they're being paid poverty wages,\" he said.\n\nThe New York Communities for Change is supported by several unions, including UnitedNY, the Black Institute and the Service Employees International Union. Together the unions represent employees at grocery stores, government, hospitals, and also African American workers.\n\nMcDonald's said in a statement that the chain has an open dialogue with its employees and welcomes them to express concerns.\n\n\"McDonald's values our employees and has consistently remained committed to them, so in turn they can provide quality service to our customers,\" the fast food retailer said. The statement added that the majority of McDonald's restaurants are owned and operated by independent business people.\n\nRick Cisneros, the owner of the midtown McDonald's franchise location, said in a statement that he always encourages employees to provide feedback so that he can be an even better employer.\n\nOrganizers of the protests say that workers are planning to go back to work tomorrow.\n\nLabor experts say there have been scattered attempts to organize over the last several decades, but very little in the fast food industry has stuck. Many say that's because there is a high labor turnover rate in the industry.\n\nAccording to Cornell University's Margolies, unions haven't been able to get enough workers to organize an election to form a union.\n\nWorkers at Starbucks (SBUX) and sandwich store Jimmy Johns made some headway, but those efforts didn't go anywhere.\n\nMargolies said this is part of a larger movement of low wage workers to improve their economic positions and treatment on the job. Last week, hundreds of Wal-Mart workers protested on Black Friday against retaliation after speaking out for higher pay, fair hours and more affordable health care.",
  "latent_30318": "You like beer. I feel confident making such an assertion because you’re reading a sports column. Sponsorship Today reports global beer brands spend $1.4 billion annually sponsoring sports properties. They would spend those sponsorship dollars on musical theatre or societies for creative anachronism if it made sense, but sports fans are the ones consuming a lot of suds.\n\nAs a public service, then, I’ve decided to start an occasional series of blog posts in which I will offer you guidance about where to acquire beer while attending your favorite sporting events. My kitchen cabinet populated with plastic Rangers souvenir cups prompted me to start at Globe Life Park in Arlington.\n\nWhen a beer company sponsors a sports team, it also typically negotiates an agreement for favorable placement of its product within the team’s venue(s). You won’t have a difficult time guessing who scored the deal at Globe Life Park. You can’t flee an errant line drive without careening into Anheuser Busch products and signage.\n\nUnless you’re, say, PeeWee Herman, and have a real thing for bowties, you care more about the product than the signage, so we’ll focus on the liquid refreshment. Entering through any gate but Center Field, you can walk straight ahead and encounter small stands stocked with Bud-branded goodies on ice, including ZiegenBock.\n\nIf you enter through Center Field Gate by the office building, you’ll walk smack through the Budweiser Bowtie, a concession area in which they sell food and, well, yeah, beer.\n\nSo basically you can buy a beer within seconds after you enter the ballpark. And, as noted at the top of this column, you like beer.\n\nSo now you have an aluminum bottle to enjoy while walking the concourse scouting out where you might get your next one. Before we proceed further, we want to mention some important safety tips with which you should familiarize yourself. First of all, the Budweiser Good Sport program offers rewards to designated drivers. Inquire at the guest relations office near Mazda Home Plate Gate.\n\nSecondly, the concessionaire sells enough food products at that stadium to feed Mr. Creosote for a year. They have more than 100 concession stands, some selling comestibles the size of your labradoodle. When you can access a Choomongous, the Rangers 2-foot Korean beef sandwich named after outfielder Shin Soo Choo, you have no excuse for drinking on an empty stomach. Thirdly, you’ll find the cabstand outside Southwest Airlines Third Base Gate (or you can have an usher find it for you). Fourthly, there are, by my count, at least 189 restrooms in the stadium, if you include the suites, the clubhouses, and the office building. Your gender may disqualify you from using some of them, but you should still easily find a WC toward which to stumble if you’ve filled your bladder.\n\nSince you probably finished that first brew while reading the last paragraph, you’ll want to assess your options for a refill. Turn left or right after entering at any gate and you’ll find a few of the aforementioned concession stands, each with taps primarily dispensing standard Bud products, like Bud Light. The Rangers must sell a lot of Bud Light. If you’re in that “Up For Whatever” kind of mood, you can satisfy your BL jones a lot of places.\n\nHow about if you crave something different? Maybe you’ve progressed past the point of choosing the cheap Arlington Stadium bleacher tickets so you could afford more paper cups of suds? Luckily, the craft beer revolution has not bypassed the Rangers’ current stadium.\n\nCasey Rapp serves as Operations Manager for SportsService, the company that manages concession and merchandise sales for Globe Life Park in Arlington. He provided me some info on the variety of barley/hops available there.\n\n“Section 18 has the biggest selection on draft and it’s called Major League Brewhouse,” he wrote me. “We rotate the draft, but there are local beers like Franconia, Real Ale, Deep Ellum, Revolver, Karbach, St Arnold’s, and other craft beers like Alaskan, 90 Shilling, and the list goes on and on.”\n\nYou’ll find Major League Brewhouse on the ground-level concourse near Southwest Airlines Third Base Gate, and the nearby 3rd Base Alehouse also serves a variety of drafts, bottles, and cans. If you’ve entered via Southwest Airlines First Base Gate, turn left and you’ll quickly happen upon the Beers of the World stand, near the entrance to mid-30s numbered seating sections, offering a number of beery options.\n\nIncidentally, if you have some members of your party who prefer vino, you’ll find a wine stand across the concourse from Beers of the World. Such is Anheuser Busch’s dominance that they even sell Shock Top and Bud Light at the wine stand.\n\nIf you enter from Mazda Home Plate Gate and want something out of the ordinary, turn right and go just past the Pro Shop, across from the entrance to the good seats in the upper 20s sections. You’ll find the LandShark Lager stand. In addition to its namesake, the kiosk can sell you a draught of Montejo, Stella Artois Cidre, and the obligatory Bud Light.\n\nHard by Greene’s Hill (the grassy expanse in the batter’s eye named after a former Arlington politician) in centerfield resides the Beers of Texas stand, headlined by ZiegenBock. The location also offers some Shiner, Lone Star, and Lakewood brews. Rapp informs me they have such stands near sections 25, 51, 210, and 328 as well.\n\nOn the other side of the Hyundai Club from Beers of Texas, you’ll find the Centerfield Alehouse, just across from the Centerfield Market. It features, among other offerings, Stella Artois on tap. Its cooler includes cans of Modelo Especial, Heineken, Corona, 312 Urban Wheat Ale, and more.\n\nIf you visit the Lexus Club Level, there are a handful of stands and barlets that serve suds. The small bars offer a chance to enjoy some air conditioning as you order your beverage. I took special note of the left field emplacement, as it replaced my previous favorite spot in the ballpark, the ersatz Irish pub known as the Dublin Up. The new incarnation is Shock Top branded and offers its namesake’s varieties on draft as well as Bud Light.\n\nIf you choose to remain in your seats, SportService will have 75 or so beer vendors at a typical game to bring beer-filled aluminum receptacles to your very row. Rapp tells us, “You can get Bud Light, Budweiser, ZiegenBock, Michelob Ultra, Shock Top, LandShark, and the Rita family.” The Rita family means Bud Light with citrus favors. Be sure to tip the vendor something. Rita family members are heavy to carry around.\n\nIf you get up to go to one of the aforementioned necessaries, you may encounter a roaming beverage cart. Mr. Rapp tells us, “there are four on the lower level, one on the club level and three on the upper deck. They roam each baseline, stopping to make sales on the concourse. You can get all the same things you can get from a vendor, plus wine.”\n\nRapp also tells me I can find Firemans #4, Rahr’s Blonde, Rahr Pride of Texas Pale Ale, and Deep Ellum Brewing Company’s Dallas Blonde in cans on portable carts.\n\nWhat if you spend some of your evening in one of the onsite clubs? Of course, in the likes of the Captain Morgan Club, the Jack Daniel’s Club, and the Capital One Club, they serve beer. Casey Rapp describes it as a “wide array.” He also notes they often have Shock Top seasonal on draft, including Lemon Shandy, Banana, and Pretzel depending the time of year.\n\nWe’ve established that sports fans like yourself really like malted beverages, and a lot of folks like you attend every game. How can you feel certain the Rangers won’t run out of beer? Rapp assured me they keep a three-day supply at every game and can get same-day deliveries if needed. Whew.\n\nHere’s one final note, for the benefit of Michael Newquist and the Fort Worth Weekly sales staff: if you’re a beer brand, consider sponsoring this column. The people who read it like your product.",

On June 28, most of the show’s alumni will take part in a reunion in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the series was born, and on movie screens around the country.\n\nThe show sprang from the brain of Joel Hodgson, a standup prop comic working in Minneapolis in the late ’80s, who was given an unglamorous time slot at the local independent TV station. Trace Beaulieu, who knew Hodgson through the local comedy scene, got a call in 1988 to come down and help put on a show.\n\n“He had a little set put up, and a couple of robots laying on the floor,” says Beaulieu, “and he said, ‘Why don’t you go pick up those puppets and we’ll start doing a show?’”\n\nThe very thin premise was that Hodgson was a custodian, sent into space with his robot buddies by two mad scientists, and forced to watch godawful movies. This provided the comedians an excuse to savage some of mankind’s greatest cinematic sins.\n\n“It was very much like being trapped in a spaceship,” Beaulieu says. “We were trapped in a studio watching bad movies.”\n\nThe show caught on and found a rabid following. It was picked up by Comedy Central and later moved to the Sci-Fi Channel — lasting a total of 11 seasons and even yielding a feature film in 1996. But in 1993, Hodgson left the show under a cloud of conflict with its producer. Michael J. Nelson — a longtime writer on the show — took over as host.\n\nAfter the show was canceled in 1999, everyone went their separate ways, but the call of mocking bad movies was like a siren song. In 2007, Hodgson formed a new group called Cinematic Titanic, a video-on-demand format modeled on “Mystery Science Theater.”\n\nMeanwhile, in 2006, Mike Nelson and his robot pals from “MST3K” — Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett — formed RiffTrax.\n\n“We’re about to celebrate — I guess? — ten years,” Corbett says.\n\n“I’m gonna celebrate,” Murphy counters.\n\n“... or mourn ten years,” says Corbett, laughing.\n\nRiffTrax sidesteps copyright issues by offering mp3 commentary tracks, which fans can play alongside DVDs of everything from “Harry Potter” to “The Avengers.”\n\n“We’d been looking for, and had been frustrated by the idea of being able to do more current, first-run films,” says Murphy, who voiced the robot Tom Servo on “MST3K” for nine seasons. “But then, here comes the age of podcasting, and suddenly realized we just have to do our commentary in the form of a podcast, and teach people how to sync it up with the latest Hollywood films, and boom — we’re off and running.”\n\nMurphy says lampooning movies — new and old — just became a way of life for everyone who graduated from “Mystery Science Theater.” He blanches at the question: What would you be doing if you couldn’t do this?\n\n“Boy, that gives me nightmares when I think about that,” Murphy says.\n\nThe “MST3K” reunion show — which will be simulcast in movie theaters around the country — offers a rebuttal to fan speculation that there were two warring factions created in the wake of Hodgson’s departure from the original series.\n\n“Actually, nothing like that ever really existed,” Murphy says. “All of us worked together in different iterations, and some of us liked some of us more than others. But, generally, I think that we all ended up being reasonably good friends.”\n\nBut as Hodgson admitted(in a 2014 interview for the podcast “Pod People,” there was certainly pain to be healed.\n\n“My journey with it has been really weird, because I left the show and I didn’t really want to,” Hodgson says. “I felt kind of like I was getting pushed out. The funny thing is, and the kind of the strange blessing of it all is, that it’s just kept going. And so it’s really been great just to be able, in my own time, to come back to it.”\n\nLast November, Hodgson announced he was resurrecting “Mystery Science Theater 3000” with a brand new cast, including Patton Oswalt as a mad scientist and Jonah Ray, from “The Nerdist Podcast,” as the new host. At $5.7 million, Hodgson’s Kickstarter campaign became the highest-funded film and video project in the site’s history. It’s a reflection of how beloved the show was and is, and how — even though “MST3K” didn’t invent the idea — it’s basically the gold standard of movie riffing.\n\nBeaulieu, who’s been doing his own live riffing around the country with another alumnus — Frank Conniff — says the show seems to be more popular than ever.\n\n“We keep meeting little kids who’ve been introduced to the show by their parents, and they absolutely love it,” Beaulieu says. “So the humor is kind of timeless. Funny is funny.”\n\nAnd bad movies are bad movies.\n\n“Yeah,” he says. “They don’t get any better.”\n\nThe \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" reunion will be seen in several Southern California movie theaters.

  "latent_30674": "OK, normally when I’m putting this column together, I look for a cross-section of stuff, with at least a couple things that aren’t insanely, prohibitively expensive. But you know what? Sometimes I just want to look at insanely, prohibitively expensive things! This installment of The Week in Estate is all about the ridiculously opulent.\n\nA little while back, I told you guys about Carlo Giuliano (remember those ruby and pearl earrings?). What I didn’t tell you was that he had sons! Carlo Joseph and Arthur were trained by their father, and they continued the family business after his death in 1895. The sons were talented jewelry designers as well, and I’ve spoken with Giuliano experts who consider their work to be just as exquisite as their dad’s. This necklace is an excellent example. Circa 1890, it’s in the Renaissance Revival “Holbeinesque” style that Carlo Giuliano (the elder) made famous.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of the Holbeinesque (referring to Renaissance artist Hans Holbein) look is a border of stylized ﬂoral motifs colored in enamel in the manner of the English 16th century, surrounding a large center stone (or group of stones) — as seen in this necklace’s central pendant. Using gold as a base, Carlo Joseph and Arthur then arranged tiny sections of black and white enamel alongside diamonds and pearls, forming an openwork necklace that supports the lozenge-shaped pendant of diamonds and rubies with a pearl drop.\n\nUnfortunately, the Giuliano ﬁrm ended sadly. We don’t know when Carlo Joseph died, but Arthur committed suicide in August 1914. His motives aren’t known, but he had recently left his wife of 20 years for another woman, and it also can’t have been easy to maintain a luxury business after the outbreak of World War I. The business closed after his death, and any remaining stock was sold at auction.\n\nWOW. A French 3.2 ct Colombian emerald, diamond, and platinum ring, circa 1910. Just, wow.\n\nCirca 1935, this Oscar Heyman bracelet is ridiculous. It’s got ﬁve huge step-cut aquamarines (approximately 130 carats, total) ﬂanked by 20 square- and ﬁve round-cut sapphires. All set in platinum. It’s something Carole Lombard would wear around the house in My Man Godfrey.\n\nA small (5.5cm) 17th century kalgi with matching pin, from Mysore, South India. Both are set with diamonds and burmese rubies.\n\nA kalgi is a traditional Indian turban jewel, originally worn by Maharajas as an indication of their wealth and status. Nowadays they’re often worn as bridal jewelry, with the groom accenting the jewel with plumes of feathers.\n\nThis Victorian necklace features 9.00 carats of emeralds and 3.00 carats of diamonds set in silver with a gold mounting. I’m highlighting it because, yes, it’s gorgeous, but it’s also unusual — there are tons of similar Victorian necklaces out there in garnet, but I’ve never seen one in emerald before.\n\nA late 19th century silver over gold Edwardian bracelet set with nine oval cut rubies with accents of single cut and old mine cut diamonds in a twisting garland design.\n\nEven better, it has a ribbon collar extension, so it can be worn as a choker.\n\nCirca mid to later 20th century, these platinum and diamond briolette chandelier earrings feature old European cut diamonds with platinum bezels, onyx bands, and inverted tulip-shaped diamond canopies from which hang incredible diamond briolettes.\n\nEach earring has a total diamond weight of 1.75 carats.You might want to take a break now to wipe the drool off your keyboard.\n\nThis 18k yellow gold and amethyst “Candy” ring isn’t antique or even estate, but I’m breaking the rules because I love it. And even if it is a contemporary ring, it’s also by a renowned jewelry house (Verdura), so that means I get to tell you about Duke Fulco di Verdura.\n\nVerdura, born in 1898 in Palermo, was the fun-loving child of wealthy aristocrats. As a young man, his society connections brought him into contact with Coco Chanel, and he soon left Italy to work for her in Paris. It was there that he discovered a talent for jewelry design, and he created some truly iconic pieces — including the two Maltese cross cuff bracelets that Chanel wore constantly. His style was enthusiastic — big and bold, with bright precious and semiprecious gems and interesting color combinations.\n\nVerdura took off for Hollywood in the ’30s, and soon his pieces were being snapped up by the likes of Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, and Katherine Hepburn. Next up was a shop in Manhattan, where he also conquered the New York society crowd. In the meantime, he even found time to collaborate with Salvador Dali on a jewelry collection.\n\nVerdura continued designing jewelry for decades, ﬁnally selling his business in 1973. (He died in 1978.) The company is now owned and run by Ward Landrigan, the former head of Sotheby’s US jewelry division, and his son Nico. Using original sketches by Verdura, they continue to produce big, gorgeous jewelry — just like this amethyst ring. If anybody wants to buy it for me, I’m a size 5 1/2.\n\nCirca 1860, this French piece is gold encrusted with cabochon rubies, emeralds and diamonds. It’s a dress holder — the end is manufactured to grip one’s dress so that it can be lifted and kept unsullied when one is forced to walk the grimy streets of the lower classes.\n\nUm. I don’t even know what to say about this. Circa 1890, a starburst diamond tiara with a natural buttonshaped pearl at center. Holy CRAP.\n\nNow this is just for fun … Are there any historians out there? The dealer needs your help in ﬁguring out the identity of this little purple man! It’s an 18k gold stickpin, circa 1820, and the little guy is fashioned out of amethyst-colored paste (which I told you about last time). The dealer thinks he might be a French general from around the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, but things still don’t tally. “The cross our general is wearing here has four arms while the normal French order has ﬁve. Also the sash and epaulets could be of important indication. Or does the haircut style indicate a British officer instead of a French one?” Click on the link and get in touch if you have any ideas!\n\nPreviously: Snakes, Tiaras, and Conch Shell Pearls.\n\nMonica McLaughlin is extremely bummed that she can’t make the Hairpin meetup on Thursday, but she will be there in spirit, wearing that tiara.",

  "latent_30976": "The chief science adviser to the prime minister of New Zealand has accused scientists of displaying “hubris” and “arrogance” when they comment on government policy.\n\nSir Peter Gluckman, who also chairs the International Network for Science Advice to Governments, levelled a series of sharp criticisms at researchers and science organisations during an event in Brussels that debated the role of policy and evidence in a “post-fact” world.\n\nHe argued that scientists needed to appreciate that politicians made their decisions based on values as well as scientific evidence.\n\n“Individual scientists, professional and scientific organisations too often exhibit hubris in reflecting on policy implications of science,” Sir Peter told delegates at “EU for facts: evidence for policy in a post-fact world”, held on 26 September.\n\n“This arrogance can become the biggest enemy of science effectively engaging with policy – the policy decisions inevitably involve dimensions beyond science.”\n\nScientists needed to appreciate that political ideology, financial and diplomatic constraints, and “electoral contracts” also had to be taken into account by politicians, Sir Peter said. “It is important that [scientific] knowledge is provided [to policymakers] in a way that does not usurp the ability of policy process to consider these broader dimensions: otherwise trust in advice can be lost as it becomes perceived as advocacy,” he argued.\n\nHe also said that he avoided using the “somewhat arrogant” term “evidence-based policy”, preferring “evidence-informed” instead. Meanwhile, “too often academy reports are focused on academic demonstration rather than meeting policy needs or answering an unasked question”, he added.\n\nSearch our database for the latest global university jobs\n\nSimilar warnings have come from other figures in science. Last year, Jeremy Berg, the editor-in-chief of Science, said that academics have too often ventured into giving policy prescriptions rather than just explaining the evidence, for example in the area of climate change.\n\nAlthough he named no names, Sir Peter also warned that “individual scientists” were now using their “scientific standing” to make claims “well beyond the evidence and their expertise”. Universities may also “over-hype” their science, he added.\n\nIn addition, the pressures of “performance measurement, bibliometrics, and the quest for societal and industrial impact” also have the potential to undermine public trust in science, he said, “due to perceived or actual conflicts of interest and the potential to affect the behaviour of individual scientists”.\n\nAt the same conference, Carlos Moedas, European commissioner for research, science and innovation, argued that to combat a “crisis of confidence” in science, there needed to be online “places of trust for scientific advice”, just as sites like Mayo Clinic or WebMD were trusted sources of medical advice.\n\nSuch sites would be “where citizens know that science is genuine. Where the process is explained. Where they can check the sources. Where they can access the data themselves,” he said.\n\n“So I believe in the future there will be two types of internet. The one you trust and the one you don't,” he added.\n\ndavid.matthews@timeshighereducation.com",
  "latent_30996": "As President Barack Obama gathered high-profile supporters of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) for a meeting at the White House on Friday, the corporate-friendly trade agreement was dealt a blow as Vietnam's parliament deferred its long-expected ratification.\n\nReuters reported from Hanoi Friday that Vietnam will not include ratification of TPP on its agenda for its next parliament session, which begins October 20.\n\nThis adds \"to uncertainty over the future of...Obama's signature trade deal,\" the news agency wrote. \"As arguably the biggest beneficiary of the deal covering 40 percent of the global economy, Vietnam was expected to be among the first to ratify the TPP, the prospect of which helped spur record foreign investment last year in its booming manufacturing sector.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, Vietnamese newspaper Thanh Nien cited Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, the parliament chairwoman, as saying Vietnam's ratification would depend on the ruling Communist Party, \"the global situation,\" and the outcome of the U.S. election.\n\nBoth major party nominees are opposed to the trade deal, along with many Democrats, some Republicans, and wide swaths of civil society.\n\nBut Friday's meeting \"is an effort by the White House to show that support for the agreement also crosses party lines,\" The Hill wrote, and \"the latest effort by Obama to generate support for the pact, which would be the largest free trade deal in history and is a centerpiece of his administration's so-called 'pivot' to Asia.\"\n\nAmong those scheduled to be in attendance: failed Republican presidential candidate John Kasich, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former George W. Bush administration Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, and others. A press briefing is expected to follow the meeting.\n\nCNN reports that Kasich \"defended the prospect of Obama pushing the TPP toward passage in a 'lame duck' session of Congress\"—a possibility that TPP opponents are actively working to prevent.\n\n\"Frankly, if I have to come down here and spend some time lobbying my Republican colleagues, I'm more than glad to do that,\" Kasich said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared last month that the Senate would not vote on the current agreement this year, and House Speaker Paul Ryan has said: \"As long as we don't have the votes, I see no point in bringing up an agreement.\"\n\nBut watchdogs have warned that the TPP \"is not dead, unfortunately.\" Indeed, Public Citizen's Lori Wallach argued earlier this month that GOP leaders are in fact \"negotiating for changes to obtain even more corporate goodies—longer monopoly protections for pharmaceutical firms' high medicine prices, elimination of an exception protecting some tobacco regulations from TPP attack, and more.\"\n\nShe wrote:\n\nThe GOP leaders are not only trying to pressure the White House to meet their demands, but are trying to scare the other TPP countries off of their current positions that no changes are possible. SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts\n\nIf the GOP leaders get what they want, they will be pushing hard to pass an even more damaging TPP in the lame duck session, despite their insincere political posturing over the unpopular agreement leading up to the elections.\n\nSure enough, news outlets reported this week that Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) \"is working with the Obama administration to resolve several lingering issues that could ultimately pave the way\" for lame-duck passage of the TPP, as The Hill put it.\n\nInside U.S. Trade reported Friday that Hatch \"said the Obama administration has promised to satisfy his demand of including 12 years of market exclusivity for biologics in the implementing bill for the [TPP], but noted that he is waiting to receive that pledge in writing.\"\n\n\"They said they'd satisfy me,\" Hatch told the publication on Friday.\n\nHowever, Glyn Moody explained for TechDirt: \"The final TPP text specifies eight years, and because of the Fast Track authority that [Hatch] worked so hard to put in place, there is no way for Hatch to get the text changed now that it has been finalized.\"\n\nThat has not seemed to deter Hatch, who has floated a number of work-arounds including \"binding side agreements\" with TPP countries or development of a \"methodology\" he believes \"honorable\" countries will follow.\n\n\"That's really pretty extraordinary,\" Moody wrote. \"After nearly eight years of tough negotiations, concessions were made and a final text agreed by all the countries involved. And now Hatch says it's not good enough, that the U.S. has some special right to ask for yet more, and that countries refusing to up their protection for biologics data to 12 years won't be part of the TPP deal.\"\n\nIn turn, environmentalists, public health advocates, and labor groups aren't going to sit idly by.\n\n\"Why are we nervous? Well, we're nervous because we've been here once or twice before,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) told reporters Wednesday on Capitol Hill. \"When you have the Business Roundtable and virtually every multinational corporation saying they want this, we understand that's real power.\"\n\nStill, as Common Dreams reported Wednesday, people power was also on display this week, when a coalition of progressive organizations coordinated a national call-in day to voice their TPP opposition.\n\n\"While the president is cloistered with corporate chieftains planning how to use a lame duck session to try to pass a TPP only they love,\" Wallach said, \"Congress' phones are ringing off the hook with anti-TPP calls.\"",

They would be fine in most pen-and-paper games, but the amount of death KD:M throws at your heroes makes all the build-up feel that much more bittersweet.\n\nShould you count yourself among board gaming's biggest masochists, however, you're in for the four-player co-op adventure of your wildest dreams.\n\nPutting the \"pro\" in \"intestinal prolapse\"\n\nSam Machkovech\n\nSam Machkovech\n\nA few months ago, I received a brief e-mail from my favorite board gaming friend on the planet—the kind of guy who goes to multiple \"board game retreats\" per year to try out weird new games that haven't even been translated into English yet. He gets excited about games, but he's not wordy, so when I saw his brief, big-group e-mail asking anybody to join a KD:M session (\"it's ridiculous and awesome\"), I jumped on the chance.\n\nI'd heard whispers about this elaborate monstrosity from my gaming group, framed in an assumption that this whole crazy-sounding thing was Kickstarter vaporware. So I was shocked to hear that we knew someone who'd actually bought it—and loved it. A few days later, I arrived at that friend's house. That's when I saw the whole game spread out over his massive board-gaming table.\n\nSurprisingly, there's a brief way to describe how the game works. At its core, KD:M offers two kinds of gameplay in each of its campaign \"years:\" a D&D-styled co-op battle against a single, brutally difficult boss monster and a 4X-ish management phase for your warriors' home settlement after each fight.\n\nThe first thing worth understanding about KD:M's quality is how it hooks players into its complicated systems so that in each half of the game, players are minding what consequences will play out in the other half. The decisions you make in a bloody battle reverberate in ways that you can foretell to some extent, while the pre-battle management of crafting, shops, skill upgrades, and villagers' romances offer a lot of \"do we take a benefit now or hold out for even bigger stuff later\" weighing at all times.\n\nBefore all of that, your group of four (and that number is firm) must wake in its first year, mostly naked and weak, to do battle with an out-of-nowhere monster. So long as even one of your warriors survives, he or she will build a settlement whose residents must contend with a new monster every year as part of a lantern festival, though in some years, players will get to choose which monster they hunt. Different monsters drop different, random loot, but certain crucial items, weapons, and armor sets require parts from specific monsters to be crafted, so you have hunt decisions to make.\n\nFor example, do we keep fighting the easy monster and try to finish its crafting possibilities? Or do we risk more deaths by facing a monster class we're not ready for so that we might craft stronger stuff that'll get us through the required super-boss fights in various years? After all, some years present required bosses by default, while card-based events force other fights to take place when you least expect them.\n\nThe battle phase shouldn't terrify anybody familiar with pen-and-paper RPGs like D&D. Place minis on a board covered in square grids; pick from a set of powers to attack and do other maneuvers; roll dice to determine success or failure. Kingdom Death's key difference is in its emphasis on specific body parts. If a monster records a hit on one of your heroes (meaning, a high-enough roll on a d10), it'll then roll a \"damage location\" die. Should enough hits land on, say, your waist, you'll be forced to roll against a mortal-damage chart. The mortal damage charts ranges from a mere knockdown to the lopping of your genitals to an intestinal prolapse—which means your hero can no longer wear \"waist\" armor—to full-on death.\n\nExpect your heroes to roll against this mortal-damage chart on the regular. Boss characters have no shortage of brutal abilities. Player characters can find themselves in trouble even if they roll a successful \"attack\" roll, which then requires players to roll against a specific monster card. These sometimes offer perks for rolling a \"crit\" (usually meaning a 10, though sometimes also a 9), but they also punish players for not rolling a big enough number. Additionally, occasional \"hits\" turn up a card that says their sword stab, for whatever reason, still gets your warrior in trouble.\n\nThat's all to say that as a KD:M campaign extends over dozens of hours, expect fights that end with only one hero returning to the village to be considered a rousing success.\n\nListing image by Adam Poots Games",

  "latent_31812": "After a disappointing season(s), we fans always welcome new coaches as something resembling saviors — the quick-fix solution to all our franchise’s problems. This, despite what history has told us time and again.\n\nAfter all, it’s easy to forget that Bill Belichick disciple Eric Mangini was going to bring New England Patriots-like success to the New York Jets, that Joe Philbin would turn Ryan Tannehill into Aaron Rodgers, and that Dennis Allen would restore the Oakland Raiders’ Commitment to Excellence. Each time a new coach is hired, we get excited that he will take our team to, at the very least, many playoff appearances. However, on average, this is not the case.\n\nSince the 2005 offseason, there have been 75 new coaches hired in the NFL. Of those, 49 (65 percent) already have been fired. Of course, 10 seasons is a lot to expect from any new coaching hire, but the majority of coaches hired every season from 2005–12 have since been canned. The 49 that were fired lasted fewer than three years on average, and 30 of them never even made the playoffs before being canned.\n\nYearly coaching hire data*\n\nCoaching change data by year\n\nDespite all the new hires, success looks like flipping a coin; 36 coaches (48 percent) fared better than their predecessors when it comes to win percentage, while the rest had an equal or worse win percentage.\n\nOn average, there are six or seven coaching changes per year. The 2006 and 2009 seasons were landmark years, with 10 and 11 coaching changes (only one of which was to replace a retiring coach). All 11 of the coaches hired in 2009 have since been fired. This class includes former hotshot coordinators like Todd Haley and Undefeated Patriots-killer Steve Spagnuolo. Only Mike McCarthy and Sean Payton (for now) remain from the 2006 class.\n\nDespite the excitement about coaching changes this year, we’ve only seen six coaching changes (so far), with another one or two likely coming. This would put the 2016 hiring season in line with the historical average for changes.\n\nCoaches hired per year:\n\nTeams on average have had two or three coaching changes since the 2005 offseason. Only two franchises haven’t had a coaching change:\n\nCincinnati Bengals — Marvin Lewis (hired in 2003, 54 percent win percentage)\n\nNew England Patriots — Bill Belichick (hired in 2000, 74 percent win percentage)\n\nTwo franchises, Cleveland and Oakland, have had six coaching changes (the maximum in the sample)\n\nNumber of teams with given coaching changes:\n\nInterim coaches have had a pretty decent shot at getting the full-time job. Out of 24 interim coaches, five were hired for the full-time gig. Given the amount of coaches teams typically interview, those odds aren’t bad, since teams will survey the whole league (and the college ranks), then bring in multiple candidates.\n\nReaching the playoffs gives you almost an extra two-and-a-half seasons of leeway, on average. Coaches that didn’t reach the playoffs during their tenure lasted for 2.1 seasons. Coaches that reached the playoffs during their tenure lasted about 4.4 seasons.\n\nThe 2006 coaching class was very successful, although only two of the 10 hired coaches remain. Six of the 10 hired coaches took their teams to the playoffs. McCarthy and Payton won a Super Bowl, and the whole cohort stuck around for over four and a half seasons and counting (longer than all but one coaching cohort).\n\nTeams aren’t getting more trigger happy and firing coaches after one year. There is on average only a single ‘one and done’ — defined as a coach who only got one full season, including those fired midway through their second year— coach per year. There have been 12 since the 2005 offseason, and the Raiders and Niners have accounted for five of them (three and two).\n\nConclusion\n\nHopefully this calms you down a bit if you wanted a coaching change and didn’t get it. At the same time, those of you looking forward to the next coach should probably temper your expectations a bit. After all, there was a time when Romeo Crennel and Joe Philbin were two of the hottest coaching candidates on the market. Ultimately, you never know how it will work out until they put on the khakis and headset for your team.\n\nIf you’d like to view the data I used for this article, you can view the Google Doc via this link. I welcome any corrections or comments.\n\n*Coaches fired in the middle of the year get counted as following calendar year’s firing. For example, even though Joe Philbin was fired mid-season on Oct. 5, 2015, the Miami Dolphins are counted as one of the six 2016 head coaching changes. Data excludes interim coach record for interim coaches hired.",
  "latent_31826": "ST. LOUIS -- As a St. Louis Blue, he made a living in the slot with precise wrist shots and one-timers that made life difficult for opposing goaltenders.\n\nNow 15 years after unwillingly departing as an unrestricted free agent, Brett Hull returns to the place where his playing career took off in hopes of helping the franchise from the business side.\n\nBlues Chairman Tom Stillman made the announcement Monday night that the 49-year-old Hull, who is the franchise's leading scorer with 527 goals, has been named Executive Vice President.\n\n\"We are pleased to announce that Brett Hull is coming home to the St. Louis Blues,\" Stillman said in front of an audience at the Scottrade Center atrium of roughly 500 fans. \"Brett Hull belongs with the Blues. It makes all the sense in the world for him to be here. We've thought that from Day One, but we wanted it to work in the right way where it's good for Brett and good for the organization. We think it's a great thing for all concerned.\"\n\nHull, who had been working in the Dallas Stars' front office since 2007, was originally acquired by the Blues on March 7, 1988 from the Calgary Flames for goalie Rick Wamsley and forward Steve Bozek. A city that was down on its hockey team suddenly fell in love with No. 16 and the franchise. He spent 11 seasons with the Blues, setting a plethora of club records and placing his name into the NHL record books.\n\n\"I never wanted to leave fifteen years ago,\" Hull said. \"... and I'm glad I'm back, I'll tell you that.\n\n\"... My wife Darcy and I, it was a little over a year (ago) when we started talking about that this might be a possibility (of coming back to St. Louis), I don't think it took more than a couple sentences to convince her that this was a wonderful place and a place that we can call, I guess, our new home.\"\n\nLast week, the Blues changed titles of General Manager Doug Armstrong, adding President of Hockey Operations to his duties while also naming Bruce Affleck to President of Business Operations, opening up a spot for Hull to join the organization. Affleck previously held the title of Chief Operating Officer.\n\nHull will be working hand-in-hand with Affleck, who is also a member of the Blues alumni group and a close friend of Hull's.\n\n\"I'm proud to finally have you where you belong in St. Louis,\" Affleck said, speaking directly to Hull.\n\nHull will be responsible in the aiding of ticket sales, suite sales, adding sponsors and season tickets to an already-growing area.\n\n\"It's hard economic times. It's a small market,\" Hull added. \"It's not like we're the New York Rangers who have a TV deal that helps everything. We need to dig in our heels and get to work and show the community that we're a class group. I think anybody in the community and the business community sees a team that is classy and is doing the right things not only on the ice, but off the ice in the community that they'll jump on board and be a part of it as well.\"\n\nHull was part of two Stanley Cup winners in Dallas (1999) and Detroit (2002).\n\n\"It's going to be a big learning curve for me, but I think working with Bruce and Eric (Stisser) in the front office and obviously Tom in the front office, we can put together a great group that can push this team to a high level.\"\n\nIn Hull's 11 seasons with the Blues (1988-98), he recorded 527 goals, 67 playoff goals, 117 playoff points, 27 regular season hat tricks and played in 102 playoff games, which are all franchise records. He's second all-time in club history in regular season points (936), regular season assists (409) and playoff assists (50).\n\nStillman is banking on using Hull's past and present stature to enhance the team's product in the community.\n\n\"When Brett Hull is in town, there is a buzz,\" Stillman said. \"People are excited. There is something special about his effect on St. Louis.\"\n\nHull's tenure in St. Louis ended when the Blues chose not to resign him following the 1998 season. He went onto sign a free agent contract with the Stars -- coached by Hitchcock -- and scored the Stanley Cup-clinching goal against Dominik Hasek and the Buffalo Sabres. Hull then signed on with the Red Wings, winning a second Stanley Cup. But he said Monday that although he could never win one as a player with the Blues, winning one in an executive role would be just as good.\n\n\"Absolutely. It'll feel wonderful,\" Hull said. \"Not even for me. I know what it's going to feel like for me, but can you imagine how wonderful it'll feel for these fans of St. Louis who have been so loyal to the organization for so long?\n\n\"It's been 15 years (since I first left). A lot of the relationships that I've had have never really left. There's been a little bit of distance between us, but it's a city that I grew to love when I played here, the fan base, the organization I've always loved. When Tom got the team last year, I was very excited because we talked about his passion and where he wanted to lead this team. That's the way I thought it should be and should have been done ever since I've been a part of it. It's nice to have an owner who has that idea.\"",

  "latent_31894": "Foo Fighters posted a link to an event called “Hot Buns” on its Facebook page a few days ago, asking fans to “keep it clean.” The link led to a page on the band’s website featuring a picture of a man’s legs in cowboy boots standing in a shower. Pretty harmless, until one discovers the truth behind those boots: they belong to a member of the Foo Fighters, all of whom are naked as jaybirds and dressed as hillbilly truckers.\n\nThe “Hot Buns” video, which you can see below, features the band in a truck-stop diner setting, dressed the part of the 18-wheeler wheel men. When their number is called, they head to the back shower area – where untold carnal delights await.

  "latent_32016": "To be perfectly honest, I have no idea what silly putty is actually for. I know it’s a toy, but I’m in the dark about what kids are using it for. It was not sold when I was a kid where I grew up, and I only know what I use it for… A couple of years ago I was told how great masking agent it really makes on an online forum, so I headed to the kids’ isle at the local Walmart, and invested about $3 for a plastic egg full of silly putty. I thought I’d share this little gem, in case some people have not heard of it yet. You can buy dedicated products, which behave the same way, but I strongly suspect these companies are selling dirt-cheap silly putty repackaged as dedicated modelling product. (The very same thing happens with laboratory supplies… companies sell blenders, microwaves and other kitchen appliances as labware on a highly inflated price.) Anyhow, back to our post’s focus. Silly putty is a strange silicon polymer: it is essentially an incredibly viscous fluid, but it can also behave like an elastic solid material. (It’s a non-Newtonian fluid, if you really want to know.) So essentially what it means is that it can be shaped really easily, like clay, it “flows” into crevices, yet if you smash a handful against a wall, it will bounce off, like a rubber ball. We are not going to smash it against anything, though. This elastic, viscous nature makes silly putty an ideal masking agent. Using small pieces, you can easily form camo patterns on models. Obviously, for straight lines masking tapes are still your best bet, but to recreate irregular camo, it’s just perfect. Just place it on the model’s surface in the desired pattern, and use a toothpick to shape it further once it settled. Spray, and repeat if you have more than one colors to paint. It’s that easy. I used blue-tac for similar purposes, but it’s quite rigid, and difficult to make stick to the surface; silly putty is an all-around better option. Additionally, the material is very easy to work with. If you flatten it against a hard surface (a piece of glass, for example), you will have easy-to-use “pancakes” to work with; these can even be pre-cut it to shape with a sharp blade. Just carefully peel them off the glass, and lay them onto the model. Silly putty will not stick to anything (well, any model) permanently, and comes off clean, so you don’t have to worry about residues. If there are some residual material that got stuck in some real deep, real intricate pattern (like moulded-on grilles), rubbing a small piece of silly putty against any residual pieces will remove them easily. It will not dissolve in acrylic paint so they are absolutely safe to work with –can’t vouch for enamels, though, as I’ve never tried them. One thing you still have to keep in mind is the matter of small parts. If you are not careful, silly putty will remove any small parts from the surface, when you peel it off, so you’ll have to dig in for those PE clamps or headlights. (Same is true for any masking agents, though. On a positive note, silly putty will not break them when you apply it to the surface, unlike blue-tac, which does need some force to make it settle.) The best thing you can do is to leave those parts off until you finish the camo. Another general advice (which I sometimes ignore due to impatience) is to use several light layers, instead of a few heavy ones… this will make sure paint does not build up at the masking agent. After you are finished, you can just peel off the putty carefully (or use some more to rub it off with), and reuse. It seems to absorb the dried paint flakes without any issues, and it does not affect its behaviour. If you find after a couple of (dozen? hundred?) uses that the putty does not work as intended any more, it’s really cheap to replace. As a demonstration, I’d like to share some images of a DML 1/72 Sd.Kfz.251 halftrack painted using an airbrush, masked with silly putty. The putty was placed onto the vehicle in strips, according to the pattern shown in the instructions. After the first layer of color (green), it was further covered to add the second color (brown). Because it’s so easy to manipulate, and because it can be shaped very well, its “resolution” (the smallest detail you can make out) is quite high; you can create really intricate patterns even in small scale with very little effort. As you can see the putty was wrapped around the width indicator rods without any problems. Gently removing it shows the pattern achieved. And here is the result of the painting session\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_32021": "So after my last article went up, I hit the streets looking for some lessons that people have learned from losing games. As promised, here are some of the best:\n\nReddit user /u/Wolrund:\n\nI actually have a great example of not conceding to an infinite combo. I once had a game with my EDH storm deck (Melek) where I stormed off three times in the same game, my opponent sat there patiently all 3 times, and all 3 times I failed to play a win con. I conceded shortly after having exiled anything that would have helped me win and found out all my win cons were in the bottom 15 cards of my library!\n\nThe deck is pretty budget, so I don’t have enough tutors to really make it consistent, but usually drawing over half your deck in a combo is sufficient to win on the spot. Just think if he had conceded once I had made a ton of mana and cast past in flames for the flashbacks, I would have won a game that I had a 0% chance of winning!\n\nThis is a prime example of what I was talking about! Wolrund’s opponent made him/her have it, and it resulted in a big ol’ win. Remember that if you’re only mostly dead, you’re still slightly alive. This gives you a fighting chance if you play it smart.\n\nNext up is Reddit user /u/blackmagemasta:\n\nI’ve been playing EDH for over a decade and over the years had the opportunity to create and hone several EDH decks. I play with several people who either own one or no EDH deck. So I share.\n\nOne guy owns a $40ish BG Thallid deck. It’s fun and can absolutely win games, but it is a bit underpowered. He’s aware of this, so if we’re having an EDH session, he might play his deck a time or two and then play one of mine. He knows his deck is holding him back and knows that with money it could be better, but he has other priorities right now that get his money. So rather than be immature and whine, he chooses to borrow a deck (usually one of mine) and have fun. And you know, I’ve never felt bad about losing to my own deck.",

  "latent_32717": "CRICKET Australia chief James Sutherland insists controversial West Indies opener Chris Gayle won’t be prevented from signing with a Big Bash franchise.\n\nGayle caused outrage in January following his infamous ‘Don’t blush baby’ boundary-line interview with Mel McLaughlin during his spell with the Melbourne Renegades.\n\nBut despite the bad publicity surrounding the incident, Sutherland appears to have back-tracked after Cricket Australia strongly intimated at the time that it would come over the top of any team that tried to sign Gayle for Big Bash 6.\n\nSutherland told News Corp that with the exception of match-fixers, it’s not CA’s position to rub players out of the competition.\n\nChris Gayle during his infamous interview with Mel McLaughlin. Source: Channel 10\n\n“No matter what anyone at Cricket Australia thought (of the incident) at management level, board level, I think you’re on a slippery slope if you start making judgements on players who could or shouldn’t be playing in the Big Bash League or in our domestic competitions,” Sutherland said.\n\n“Because, when does that ever end? My view is unless there’s a very, very strong reason along the lines of anti-corruption, then its difficult for us to be making those judgements.\n\n“I’m not saying that it wouldn’t happen but my judgement is that it’s not appropriate it’s about the teams themselves to make the calls.”\n\nChris Gayle could return for the next BBL despite a ban being touted last season.
