  "latent_37": "Oil companies complicit in Sudan civil war, report alleges\n\nBy Brian Smith\n\n12 July 2010\n\nThe European Coalition on Oil in Sudan (ECOS)—a group of 50 European Non Governmental Organisations—recently released a report, “Unpaid debt: The legacy of Lundin, Petronas and OMV in Sudan, 1997-2003”. It alleges that an oil consortium led by Swedish firm Lundin Petroleum (and including Petronas of Malaysia, OMV of Austria and the Sudanese state oil company Sudapet) may have been complicit in “war crimes and crimes against humanity” in Sudan.\n\nECOS notes that the Lundin Consortium signed a 1997 agreement with the Khartoum government for the exploitation of oil in the Block 5A concession on the border of North and South Sudan, an area not controlled by the government. ECOS claims that the start of exploration in Block 5A set off “a spiral of violence as the Sudanese government and forces loyal to them set out to secure and take control of the oilfields in that block”.\n\nThe report says that in the ensuing six years the civilian population was forcibly displaced following indiscriminate attacks, pillage, killing, rape, abduction, torture and the burning of shelters. It alleges that the Sudanese government’s efforts to secure the oilfields included the use of “artillery, ground troops, helicopter gunships, and high-altitude bombers against the civilian population”. ECOS estimates that 12,000 people died and “almost 200,000 people were violently displaced” in the process.\n\nJeffrey Fountain, vice president for legal affairs of Lundin Petroleum, has pointed to an open letter on the company’s website refuting “all the allegations and inferences of wrongdoing attributed to Lundin Petroleum”.\n\nThe Swedish public prosecutor has opened a criminal investigation into Lundin Petroleum’s activities in Sudan between 1997 and 2003 following the ECOS report, and has launched a formal investigation into the role played by Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt, who was on Lundin’s board during the period.\n\nSaid Mahmoudi, professor of international law at Stockholm University, believes that “you have evidence that Lundin knew about what was happening, and they just closed their eyes simply because it was a question of millions and millions of dollars”.\n\nThe report splits the events into three stages. 1997–1999: Commencement of oil exploration by the Lundin Consortium sparks war in Block 5A; 2000–2001: Oil is discovered amidst intense violence; and 2002–2003: A Military Solution.\n\nIn the first stage, Lundin Petroleum and the Sudanese Government signed the Block 5A Exploration and Production-sharing Agreement in February 1997, just 10 weeks before the signing of the Khartoum Peace Agreement between the government and the Southern independence and defence groups.\n\nAfter bringing OMV, Petronas and Sudapet on board, Lundin began seismic acquisition, and Khartoum sent in troops and the air force to keep the South Sudan Defence Force (SSDF) from controlling the oilfields. The peace deal soon collapsed.\n\nIn May 1999, the Lundin Consortium suspended its operations after an attack on its oil installations by the SSDF, though it soon after announced “a significant new oil discovery” comparable with the finds in Blocks 1 and 2 that contained an estimated 500 to 800 million barrels of reserves.\n\nIn the second stage, while operations were officially suspended, Lundin pushed on with building an all-weather road to the oilfield with the help of a major government offensive to protect road construction.\n\nThe completion of a pipeline from Blocks 1 and 2 to the Red Sea in July 1999 led to huge oil revenues flowing into Khartoum’s coffers, which allowed the government to increase its offensives in Block 5A using newly purchased large-calibre artillery, helicopter gunships, and armoured combat vehicles.\n\nThe road was completed in January 2001, when Lundin began drilling, and by March it announced a major oil strike with the field reportedly containing recoverable reserves of 149.1 million barrels of oil.\n\nIn the third stage the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) and the Sudan People’s Defence Force (SPDF), who had reunified following a cease-fire agreement in August 2001, declared oil operations a legitimate military target. Khartoum responded by launching a final major offensive to control Block 5A and to clear the oil areas of civilians.\n\nIn January 2002, Lundin was again forced to suspend operations after an attack on its installations. In March 2003, after announcing that it would resume activities, Lundin Petroleum and OMV sold their rights in Block 5A to Petronas and ONGC Videsh Ltd (India) respectively.\n\nIn September 2003, the Naivasha Agreement on Security Arrangements was signed by the Khartoum government and the SPLA (representing the Southern ruling elites), as a prelude to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the parties signed on January 9, 2005, bringing to an end two decades of civil war in which some 2 million people died—mostly due to starvation—and 4 million people lost their homes.\n\nThe CPA called for a future (2011) referendum on Southern independence and the sharing of oil and non-oil revenue. It made the SPLA the de facto ruling group in the South and a partner to rule in Khartoum. Under the wealth-sharing agreement all revenue was to be shared between Khartoum and the SPLA, with each receiving at least 2 percent of oil revenue.\n\nThe main impetus for settling the dispute has been pressure from Europe and the United States, because the 20-year civil war hampered their ability to extract the enormous oil reserves that lie predominantly under the border region. Southern Sudan produces over 80 percent of all the country’s oil, which contributes around 70 percent of total Sudanese exports. US oil companies felt that they have been hampered by Washington’s uncompromising stance on Sudan, and felt marginalised by other foreign oil companies that were working more closely with the Khartoum regime.\n\nIn the five years since its signing, the oil revenue generated did not find its way to the wider population, where poverty and sporadic starvation are the norm. Nor was money spent on much needed infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition, the shaky alliances that went into signing the CPA have disintegrated, with Northern and Southern partners within the Government of National Unity at loggerheads, and divisions re-emerging within the Southern parties as the referendum approaches. The SPLA government was accused of corruption, and along with the Khartoum government, of fraud during the recent elections.",

  "latent_141": "The 2013 GCSE results showed a 25% increase in students taking the ICT exam – the first rise in numbers since 2005. However, the proportion of girls studying the subject continued to fall, from 46% last year to 44%.\n\nThis is a guest post from Lottie McCrindell (pictured), a schoolgirl from north London, giving her thoughts on studying ICT and an insight into the ongoing challenge of convincing girls to consider IT as a future career.\n\nI’m a 13-year-old girl who frequently uses technology – however I’m not keen on producing it or my ICT lessons.\n\nAt school I receive an 80-minute lesson on ICT every fortnight, but now going into my third year of secondary school I will have only six lessons and then will have to decide whether to take the subject for GCSE. Right now, I’m not planning on taking it, but what I don’t know is whether I’d be keener if it was not for the stereotyping and the curriculum.\n\nSo far at school, I have created my own app, website and database, looked into programming and explored digital information literacy – some pretty advanced stuff. These tasks have needed a range of programs, for example Photoshop, Excel, PowerPoint, AppShed and Scratch, and I have been introduced to many new websites.\n\nAll of this was crammed into the space of two years. It would have been impossible to complete everything within the lessons so consequently a lot of homework was issued. My teacher would say, “Spend 40 minutes” – however, honestly, it depended on what standard of work you were content with; personally only 40 minutes extra work each week would not have left me with a finished app etc, so I associate ICT with a lot of work. Considering it is not one of my preferred subjects, that makes it a lot less appealing.\n\nAttending a mixed grammar school means pupils are generally at the same level, however ICT is one of the few subjects where there can be big differences, especially between girls and boys.\n\nWhen I began secondary school everyone received similar assessment levels for subjects like English, science and maths, the average score was about a 6. However, in ICT the average was around a high 3 or low 4, but some pupils received a high 5. This was because some children had only received a small amount of teaching at primary school, and some – mostly boys – had done a lot of gaming or developed their own interests at home.\n\nThroughout my first two years, my ICT assessment levels have always been much lower than other subjects and this can put you in the frame of mind that you’re bad at ICT, and if there are other subjects you’re better at, surely it’s simpler to take them for GCSE. And of course, IT is not the ideal job for me if I can’t even pass an exam.\n\nUnless computing was made a compulsory subject like a language or maths, I don’t think this will change. To improve your English you can read, and to improve your ICT there are particular websites, but I certainly would not spend time on them and I’m sure my friends wouldn’t either.\n\nHowever, there is gaming and I think this is the sole reason boys generally like ICT and excel at it. Gaming can be considered geeky or nerdy and on a weekend I would prefer to meet my friends and go shopping while some boys enjoy sitting at home and playing Minecraft or Call of Duty for hours. This puts images into your head – boys not washing; eating in front of their console etc; and for girls it’s often considered boring or geeky. This stereotyping is continued into technology jobs.\n\nI think of someone working in IT as male, old, bearded, not bothered about his clothes, his looks, or going outside. All his friends are boys and he’s never had a girlfriend. He gets excited about new gadgets and he likes reading comics even though he’s over 40, and he collects things, like little figures from games.\n\nI imagine working in a typical IT job as being stuck in an office basement with computers, with mostly men, hard work and not much socialising, so it doesn’t offer much for me. But I do like using technology.\n\nSocial media is a large part of my life; I use Facebook, Skype, Snapchat and BBM. Each has its own purpose and allows me to connect with friends and family letting them know what I’m doing or thinking.\n\nI own a BlackBerry. My friends and I criticise BlackBerrys for being prone to freezing and scratching and its minimal app store. You may be wondering why then do I own a BlackBerry? Well the answer is BBM – with friends using it constantly you immediately want to be part of the instant messaging app and with it being exclusive to BlackBerry you buy one.\n\nI love technology, it’s so useful and I’m so happy it’s around; however I wouldn’t like to be behind the scenes. I know not all jobs in technology involve sitting at a computer in a stuffy office coding. Being part of a team designing an app would be fantastic, but only some of the production would appeal to me – for example, sketching the designs, creating the music, advertising the product. Technology is massive now – it’s used in almost every job and I enjoy using it and I know my future job will most probably involve it, but I do not want to create hard-core technology.\n\nBrands such as Apple are loved by me and most of my friends. I would love to be the one to create products used everywhere and no teenager thinks, “Oh, Steve Jobs was such a nerd”. We think, “Wow, he must have been so smart and so rich”. But there are no women in technology that I know who have produced products that I use and would aspire to create, so that’s not very encouraging as there are no role models for me.\n\nMaths is a compulsory subject because we use it constantly throughout life, but to be honest I use technology probably more frequently than maths. I’m not gifted at maths but because it’s a GCSE I’m forced to take, I try hard to improve – but ICT isn’t compulsory and knowing I can drop it doesn’t make me try my best. Maybe if ICT was made compulsory, more women would be involved in technology, because they would have to become better at it as they’d want their qualification.\n\nRecently I attended a mini workshop run by Little Miss Geek with 10 other girls. It involved completing and then assessing Little Miss Geek’s latest Tech Club Programme. I actually left with quite a few new skills, like how to program a little robot, Sphero. I’m now aware of more programs, attempted designing wearable technology using a 3D design program, learned how to create barcodes, and have tested Raspberry Pi which is a computer that you can code to complete instructions. I also know how to make a music video.\n\nThe experience really drilled in the fact that technology is used everywhere and is very important. It didn’t inspire me to become a programmer – but it made me wake up to the importance of technology and therefore I am now considering ICT as a possible GCSE choice purely because I know the skills you learn will be extremely useful later on.\n\nConsidering I went in laughing with a friend who said, “The reason girls don’t like technology is because we’re too busy worrying about what we look like”, that is really quite a miracle.",

Top Gun, Stand By Me, and Crocodile Dundee topped the box office chart, while the love song from Top Gun, “Take My Breath Away” made number one on the Billboard list. Beloved shows like Cheers and Golden Girls were making us laugh hysterically from the comfort of our own homes.\n\nSeptember 23, 1986 was the official first day of fall, and leaves on the trees were turning red, yellow, orange, and brown in the small New England coastal town of Norwalk, Connecticut.\n\nOn this same day, 11-year-old Kathleen Flynn attended the Ponus Ridge Middle School until school dismissed at 2:40 p.m. Afterwards, she headed for the paved path through the woods next to her school to walk the short distance to her house.\n\nKathleen never made it home.\n\nAt 3:30 a.m. the following morning, the young girl was found dead. She had been raped and strangled.\n\nAt the time she was last seen walking into the woods, soccer and field hockey teams were practicing nearby at the school’s athletic fields, and hundreds of students and parents swarmed the school grounds.\n\nNot one person saw or heard a thing. Hundreds of tips came in.\n\nThe hottest lead came from a student, who told detectives he saw three men confront Kathleen in the woods. He provided a detailed description of two of them. Months later, detectives confronted the boy with their suspicions that the story was made up. He admitted the lie. The FBI was called in within days of the killing to compare the crime against a national database of violent crimes. Local detectives tracked down every known sex offender and determined their whereabouts on the afternoon of Sept. 23. In all, detectives interviewed about 50 men who were suspects, in the loosest sense of the word. Police in nearby Westchester, N.Y., forwarded a thick file on their sex offenders. It included details on men arrested for everything from rape to public urination (Pazniokas, 2000).\n\nNone of it led to an arrest. Police announced in 2000 they had a suspect, but did not release the person’s name. They also announced mitochondrial DNA testing of hairs found at the crime scene would be performed. It is unclear what the results were from that testing.\n\nThere has not been any new information since that time and the case remains unsolved.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Kathleen’s parents, Jim and Esther Flynn, are still alive and reside in the same house they shared with Kathleen and their son, James.\n\nTrue Crime Diva’s Thoughts\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is the boldness of the crime – committed with many people nearby in broad daylight. The killer was not worried about anyone finding them. He must have been one hell of a cocky asshole. Didn’t other kids who lived nearby walk this path? It is a wooded area so he probably took her off the path and into the woods where they could be hidden from view. If there were other children walking this route, how did the killer manage to grab Kathleen without being seen? Could she have known her killer?\n\nDid the killer single Kathleen out or was he just lying in wait for any child to come along on the path? Did he live in the same neighborhood as Kathleen? Was there more than one killer?\n\nWhoever killed her knew when school let out so did he live in the area? Have a kid at the same school?\n\nAt the time of Kathleen’s murder, her father, James, owned a restaurant in Rowayton, CT called Cap’n Henry’s. Maybe the killer saw Kathleen there and stalked her. I did read that Kathleen and her older brother, James, worked at the restaurant from time to time.\n\nI also read that Kathleen normally did not walk through the woods on her way home from school, so why did she do so this time? And if she didn’t, and she was singled out, how did her killer know she would be walking that way?Maybe she was lured there somehow by her killer.\n\nI couldn’t find any recent articles on this case. The newest was from 2000, so I found nothing on the testing of the DNA.\n\nThere isn’t a lot of info on this case, but I felt like it really needed to be on here. Kathleen cannot be forgotten and I hope there is justice for her one day.\n\nThis case is very similar to the Michelle Norris case I published on February 23, 2016 . In fact, when I started writing about Michelle, I thought I had already written a post on it. I had not. I wrote about Kathleen. I think these two could be related.\n\nSource: Pazniokas, Mark. ‘Girl’s Death Leaves Only Questions, Grief’. tribunedigital-thecourant. N.p., 2007.

  "latent_425": "LAS VEGAS — A years-old Disney policy meant to restrict the use of exotic animals in its films is no doubt a good thing, but if you happen to be making a movie primarily starring exotic animals, it also makes things trickier. Just ask the visual effects team on the studio's stunning and technically groundbreaking The Jungle Book.\n\nSure, the Jon Favreau-helmed film may have been built digitally from the ground up — famously the only thing not computer generated in the film is its human star Neel Sethi — but making the animal stars come to life required a level of research that certainly would have been aided by some real-life references.\n\n\"We're not allowed to actually shoot exotic animals that are kept in captivity for movies. You can do cats and dogs, but you can't do anything like a tiger or an elephant ... you can never get them in a trained environment,\" Rob Legato, a veteran visual effects artist who worked on Jungle Book, told a crowd at a panel during the National Association of Broadcast conference Tuesday.\n\nThe aforementioned policy outlines that Disney productions are, in general, not allowed to use exotic live animals outside of a zoo, sanctuary habitat or natural environment. It applies pretty much across the board — television or film productions, photo shoots, any media broadcast, special events — with only occasional exceptions, providing the said animal is not an ape or other large primate.\n\nThe not-real King Louie Image: Disney Enterprises Inc.\n\nFor the team on The Jungle Book, that meant no tigers or other animals on set, for reference, filming or otherwise.\n\nBut, Legato said, the Internet has a wealth of video footage and reference materials that aided the team in making the animals move and act authentically. The artists spent months combing through research in order to track behavioral and movement patterns they could mimic on screen.\n\n\"They found a reference for almost every shot,\" Legato said.\n\nThe key was in the details, he said — and that applies across the film.\n\nLegato recounted a story about a particular scene that wasn't quite working — until a young artist on the team suggested they put drops of water on the \"camera lens\" — to replicate what would have been captured had they shot the film in a wet and wild jungle — instead of a warehouse off the 10 freeway in Los Angeles.\n\nBy using the bare necessities of life, visual effects artists added sparks of realism to Disney's 'The Jungle Book.' Image: Disney Enterprises, Inc.\n\nThis was especially on display in footage shown to the crowd that depicted an early model of a scene at Peace Rock. The model was video game-esque, and contrasted with the final scene, every ripple in the water and every blink of a mammal's eye became even more apparent — and impressive in hindsight.\n\n\"To add mistakes on purpose sounds crazy,\" he said, but it brought the scene to life. Every speck of dust floating in a beam of sun, every bee, every mosquito was the work of an artist and bringing authenticity to the movie.\n\n\"It's just constant reminders every so often that what you're seeing is real,\" he said.\n\nOr, you know, \"real.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

El primero modifica los artículos 294, 303 y 329 del decreto 131 del 11 de enero de 1982 que contiene la Constitución de la República, el cual divide el territorio nacional en departamentos.\n\nEstos “se dividen en municipios autónomos administrados por corporaciones electas por el pueblo, de conformidad con la ley. Sin perjuicio de lo establecido en los dos párrafos anteriores, el Congreso Nacional puede crear zonas sujetas a regímenes especiales de conformidad con el artículo 329 de esta Constitución”.\n\nPoder Judicial\n\nLas reformas también incluyen la jurisdicción de la Corte Suprema de Justicia en lo que tiene que ver con el artículo 303 que dice: “La potestad de impartir justicia emana del pueblo y se imparte gratuitamente en nombre del Estado, por magistrados y jueces independientes, únicamente sometidos a la Constitución y a las leyes”.\n\nAgrega: “El Poder Judicial se integra por una Corte Suprema de Justicia, por las Cortes de Apelaciones, los Juzgados, por tribunales con competencia exclusiva en zonas del país sujetas a regímenes especiales creados de conformidad a la Constitución y demás dependencias que señale la ley”.\n\n“En ningún juicio”, agrega, “debe haber más de dos instancias; el juez o magistrado que haya ejercido jurisdicción en una de ellas, no puede conocer en la otra, ni en recurso extraordinario en el mismo asunto, sin incurrir en responsabilidad”.\n\n“Tampoco pueden juzgar en una misma causa los cónyuges y los parientes dentro del cuarto grado de consanguinidad o segundo de afinidad”.\n\nDesarrollo económico\n\nEl artículo 329, igualmente reformado, regula la función económica del Estado. “El Estado promueve el desarrollo económico y social, que debe estar sujeto a una planificación estratégica. La ley regula el sistema y proceso de planificación con la participación de los poderes del Estado y las organizaciones políticas, económicas y sociales, debidamente representadas”, dice.\n\nAgrega: “Para realizar la función de promover el desarrollo económico y social, y complementar las acciones de los demás agentes de este desarrollo, el Estado, con visión a mediano y largo plazo, debe diseñar concertadamente con la sociedad hondureña una planificación contentiva de los objetivos precisos y los medios y mecanismos para alcanzarlos”.\n\n“Los planes de desarrollo de mediano y largo plazo deben incluir políticas y programas estratégicos que garanticen la continuidad de su ejercicio desde su concepción y aprobación, hasta su conclusión”.\n\nSegún este artículo, “el Plan de Nación, los planes de desarrollo integral y los programas incorporados en los mismos son de obligatorio cumplimiento para los gobiernos sucesivos”.\n\n“El Estado”, añade, “puede establecer zonas del país sujetas a regímenes especiales, los cuales tienen personalidad jurídica, están sujetos a un régimen fiscal especial, pueden contraer obligaciones en tanto no requieran para ello la garantía o el aval solidario del Estado, celebrar contratos hasta el cumplimiento de sus objetivos en el tiempo y durante varios gobiernos y gozan de autonomía funcional y administrativa que deben incluir las funciones, facultades y obligaciones que la Constitución y las leyes le confieren a los municipios”.\n\n“La creación de una zona sujeta a un régimen especial es competencia exclusiva del Congreso Nacional, previo plebiscito aprobatorio, de conformidad a lo establecido en el artículo 5 de la Constitución. Este requisito no es necesario para regímenes especiales creados en zonas con baja densidad poblacional. Para este efecto el Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas debe emitir el correspondiente dictamen”.\n\nLa reforma hace alusión al territorio al apuntar: “El Congreso Nacional al aprobar la creación de zonas sujetas a regímenes especiales debe garantizar que se respeten, en su caso, la sentencia emitida por la Corte Internacional de Justicia de la Haya el 11 de septiembre de 1992 y lo dispuesto en los artículos 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 y 19 de la Constitución referentes al territorio.

Amazon purchased Twitch in 2014 for $970 million. The social video platform claims 100 million monthly active users and 15 million daily active users and 2.2 million broadcasters each month. A blog post by Twitch’s Ryan Balke comments:\n\nThe Twitch Skill lets you play your favorite channels, discover new streamers, get notified when your favorite channels start streaming, and get a reminder when your Twitch Prime subscription is available to use.\n\nTwitch is No YouTube, But it Has Value for Echo Show\n\nAmazon Echo Show is the Alexa device with a screen that integrates the voice and video experience. Until September, Echo Show users had access to YouTube, but that access has since been removed on two separate occasions. There are a number of Alexa skills such as Jeopardy and Food Network that have good implementations that support both audio and visual engagement. However, without YouTube, video consumption has been limited to Amazon Prime Video. Twitch provides another use for the screen. It also introduces live stream viewing to the device.\n\nTwitch Fills a Video Gap on Echo Show\n\nEcho Show is an important product line for Amazon because the screen-plus-voice-assistant combination is the only offering in the category today. In particular, it is valuable because Google doesn’t compete in the category and it adds video calling to Alexa’s repertoire in addition to video and image display. Twitch is a dark horse in the social video category compared to YouTube and Facebook, but it does give Amazon an asset to fill a current content gap on Echo Show. Plus, it may be an incentive for Twitch’s youth demographic to take advantage of the Echo Show discounts available right now.\n\nThe Twitch skill will also work in audio-only mode for other Echo devices according to the company.

Time to find some new idols.” While Streeter’s account might sound like a clear example of discrimination — and there’s certainly a moral argument to be made against the Albee estate’s decision — from a legal perspective, it’s more complicated than that. Producers have to get rights before they can put on a production, and many in the theater community believe that playwrights or their estates can withhold those rights to their plays for any reason they see fit. The Dramatists Guild Bill of Rights states, “You have the right to approve the cast, director, and designers … This is called ‘artistic approval.’” And yes, in some cases, that means approving or rejecting an actor based on race. “I don't see this as being racist,” Streeter told BuzzFeed News. “I think that they are operating from some fealty to a sense of integrity, of retaining what Edward Albee would want. And I understand that.” He said he never questioned the legality of the Albee estate’s choice. “They certainly are within their rights to do it, and they did it. … I'm disappointed that they made that choice.” The concept of “artistic approval” doesn’t exclusively benefit white actors; it also serves to protect playwrights who have written characters to be played specifically by actors of color. In 2015, the Dramatists Guild spoke out in defense of playwrights Lloyd Suh and Katori Hall, whose work was being produced on college campuses with white actors playing roles that had been written as nonwhite. And while race is central to these examples, playwrights have railed against other “nontraditional” casting choices: In 2014, representatives for David Mamet sent a cease-and-desist letter to a production of Oleanna that cast a man in a female role. That production shut down after one performance.\n\nWarner Bros. George Segal as Nick and Sandy Dennis as Honey in the 1966 film adaptation of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\n\nIn the case of Streeter's Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, the concern seems to be over how casting a black actor as Nick fundamentally changes the text. Nick is one-half of the younger couple in the play who intrude on the fractured marriage of George and Martha. In a letter sent to Streeter and provided to BuzzFeed News, a representative for the office of Edward Albee writes, “It is important to note that Mr. Albee wrote Nick as a Caucasian character, whose blonde hair and blue eyes are remarked on frequently in the play, even alluding to Nick's likeness as that of an Aryan of Nazi racial ideology. Furthermore, Mr. Albee himself said on numerous occasions when approached with requests for non-traditional casting in productions of Virginia Woolf? that a mixed-race marriage between a Caucasian and an African-American would not have gone unacknowledged in conversations in that time and place and under the circumstances in which the play is expressly set by textual references in the 1960s.” The letter also notes that Streeter went against protocol by hiring actors without prior approval by the Albee estate, and by advertising the production before receiving the rights to the play. (In his Facebook post, Streeter said that he requested the rights in November, but said the estate requires a venue and cast to be set in order to grant the rights. He also said he only created images for casting purposes, not to advertise the production.) Streeter is taking the Albee estate's word when it comes to the reason for wanting Nick to remain white. At the same time, he noted, there is some inconsistency within their response. A 2002 Oregon Shakespeare Festival production of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? cast black actor Andrea Frye as Martha alongside white actor Richard Elmore as George, going against the Albee estate’s current assertion that one of their objections is to the portrayal of an interracial couple. But Albee was alive to give his approval at the time of the Shakespeare Festival production — the playwright died in 2016 — and Streeter believes some of the resistance now might reflect a more restrictive approach designed to preserve the intent of an author who is deceased. \"I think now that Albee is gone, they should let go of some of that and open up to the idea,\" Streeter said. He's sympathetic, but he believes Albee’s death could actually allow for more diverse productions of his plays. “I was hoping the negative elements with Edward Albee would have died with him,” he said. “You've got years of situations where black actors have not had the opportunities to play those great roles.”\n\nJohan Persson The current London production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? starring Conleth Hill and Imelda Staunton.",

  "latent_967": "Today at their annual GPU Technology Conference keynote, NVIDIA's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang announced the company's first Volta GPU and Volta products. Taking aim at the very high end of the compute market with their first products, NVIDIA has laid out a very aggressive technology delivery schedule in order to bring about another major leap in GPU deep learning performance.\n\nAs a quick history lesson, NVIDIA first unveiled the Volta architecture name all the way back in 2013. What eventually happened with their architectures wasn’t what was originally announced – Maxwell and Volta became Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta – but Volta is the last GPU architecture on NVIDIA’s current public roadmap. Until now, all we’ve known about Volta is that it existed; NVIDIA has opted to focus on what’s directly in front of them (e.g. Pascal), one generation at a time.\n\nSo let’s talk Volta. For their first Volta products, NVIDIA is following a very similar path as they did with Pascal last year. Which is to say that they are kicking off their public campaign and product stack with a focus on business, HPC, and deep learning, rather than consumer GPUs. Volta is a full GPU architecture for both compute and graphics, but today’s announcements are all about the former. So the features unveiled today and as part of the first Volta GPU are all compute-centric.\n\nNVIDIA’s first Volta GPU then is the aptly named GV100. The successor to the Pascal GP100, this is NVIDIA’s flagship GPU for compute, designed to drive the next generation of Tesla products.\n\nNVIDIA GPU Specification Comparison GV100 GP100 GK110 CUDA Cores 5376 3840 2880 Tensor Cores 672 N/A N/A SMs 84 60 15 CUDA Cores/SM 64 64 192 Tensor Cores/SM 8 N/A N/A Texture Units 336 240 240 Memory HBM2 HBM2 GDDR5 Memory Bus Width 4096-bit 4096-bit 384-bit Shared Memory 128KB, Configurable 24KB L1, 64KB Shared 48KB L2 Cache 6MB 4MB 1.5MB Half Precision 2:1 (Vec2) 2:1 (Vec2) 1:1 Double Precision 1:2 1:2 1:3 Die Size 815mm2 610mm2 552mm2 Transistor Count 21.1B 15.3B 7.1B TDP 300W 300W 235W Manufacturing Process TSMC 12nm FFN TSMC 16nm FinFET TSMC 28nm Architecture Volta Pascal Kepler\n\nBefore we kick things off, one thing to make clear here - and this is something that I'll get into much greater detail when NVIDIA releases enough material for a proper deep dive - is that Volta is a brand new architecture for NVIDIA in almost every sense of the word. While the internal organization is the same much of the time, it's not Pascal at 12nm with new cores (Tensor Cores). Rather it's a significantly different architecture in terms of thread execution, thread scheduling, core layout, memory controllers, ISA, and more. And these are just the things NVIDIA is willing to talk about, never mind the ample secrets they still keep. So while I can only scratch the surface for today's reveal and will be focusing on basic throughput, Volta has a great deal going on under the hood to get to in the coming weeks.\n\nBut starting with the raw specficiations, the GV100 is something I can honestly say is a audacious GPU, an adjective I’ve never had a need to attach to any other GPU in the last 10 years. In terms of die size and transistor count, NVIDIA is genuinely building the biggest GPU they can get away with: 21.1 billion transistors, at a massive 815mm2, built on TSMC’s still green 12nm “FFN” process (the ‘n’ stands for NVIDIA; it’s a customized higher perf version of 12nm for NVIDIA).\n\nTo put this in perspective, NVIDIA’s previous record holder for GPU size was GP100 at 610mm2. So GV100, besides being on a newer generation process, is a full 33% larger. In fact NVIDIA has gone right to the reticle size of TSMC’s process; GV100 is as big a GPU as the fab can build. Now NVIDIA is not a stranger with reticle sizes, as GM200 happened to do the same thing with TSMC’s 28nm process, but at only 601mm2, GV100 is much larger still.\n\nNow why the focus on die size first and foremost? At a high level, die size correlates well with performance. But more significantly, this is a very visible flag about how NVIDIA is pushing the envelope. The company is not discussing chip yields at this time, but such a large chip is going to yield very poorly, especially on the new 12nm FFN process. NVIDIA is going to be sacrificing a lot of silicon for a relatively small number of good chips, just so that they can sell them to eager customers who are going to pay better than $15K/chip. This is how badly NVIDIA’s customers want more powerful GPUs, and how hard NVIDIA is going to push the limits of modern fab technology to deliver it.\n\nThe chip’s absurd size aside, GV100 promises to be powerful. The chip contains 84 SMs – as this is a compute product, each SM is 64 CUDA cores in size – making for a total of 5376 FP32 CUDA cores. Joining those FP32 cores are 2688 FP64 CUDA cores (meaning NV is maintaining their 1:2 FP64 ratio), but also a new core that NVIDIA is calling the Tensor Core.\n\nTensor Cores are a new type of core for Volta that can, at a high level, be thought of as a more rigid, less flexible (but still programmable) core geared specifically for Tensor deep learning operations. These cores are essentially a mass collection of ALUs for performing 4x4 Matrix operations; specifically a fused multiply add (A*B+C), multiplying two 4x4 FP16 matrices together, and then adding that result to an FP16 or FP32 4x4 matrix to generate a final 4x4 FP32 matrix.\n\nThe significance of these cores are that by performing a massive matrix-matrix multiplication operation in one unit, NVIDIA can achieve a much higher number of FLOPS for this one operation. A single Tensor Core performs the equivalent of 64 FMA operations per clock (for 128 FLOPS total), and with 8 such cores per SM, 1024 FLOPS per clock per SM. By comparison, even with pure FP16 operations, the standard CUDA cores in an SM only generate 256 FLOPS per clock. So in scenarios where these cores can be used, NV is slated to be able to deliver 4x the performance versus Pascal.\n\nNow there are a bunch of unknowns here, including how flexible these cores are, and how much die space that they take up versus FP32 CUDA cores. But at a high level, this is looking like a relatively rigid core, which would make it very die-space efficient. By lumping together so many ALUs within a single core and without duplicating their control logic or other supporting hardware, the percentage of transistors in a core dedicated to ALUs is higher than on a standard CUDA core. The cost is flexibility, as the hardware to enable flexibility takes up space. So this is a very conscious tradeoff on NVIDIA’s part between flexibility and total throughput.\n\nContinuing down the spec list, each SM contains 4 texture units, the same number as with the GP100. Joining those texture units is yet another rework of NVIDIA’s L1 cache/shared memory architecture. Whereas GP100 had a 24KB L1/Texture cache and 64KB shared memory per SM, on GV100 it’s now a 128KB of L1 data cache/shared memory per SM, with the precise L1/shared memory split being configurable. Besides unifying these caches, this means there’s more cache/memory overall, 40KB more per SM. On the other hand, the register file remains unchanged at 256KB of registers (4x16K 32-bit registers) per SM.\n\nAt a higher level, the 84 SMs are organized 2 to a TPC, just as with GP100, giving us a 42 TPC count. These TPCs are in turn organized 7 to a GPC, and then 6 GPCs. Feeding the beast is once again HBM2, with NVIDIA using 4 stacks of it like GP100. It’s interesting to note here that while memory clocks have only increased by 25% for the respective Tesla SKUs, NVIDIA is claiming a 50% increase in effective memory bandwidth due to a combination of that and better memory efficiency. Meanwhile the L2 cache system between the memory and GPCs has also been enhanced; there’s now 768KB of L2 cache per ROP/memory partition, versus 512KB on GP100. This means L2 cache for the whole chip now stands at 6MB.\n\nGoing to a higher level still, Volta also implements a newer version of NVLink. This is the previously announced NVLink 2, and along with greater link bandwidth – up from 20GB/sec bidirectional to 25GB/sec bidirectional – there are now 6 NVLinks per GPU for GV100, 2 more than on GP100. Critically, NVLInk 2 also introduces cache coherency allowing the GPUs to be cache coherent with CPUs. Expect to see this play a big part in the eventual Power 9 + Volta systems.\n\nFinally, while the full details on this will have to wait until later, NVIDIA has also unveiled that they’ve made a pretty significant change to how SIMT works for Volta. The individual CUDA cores within a 32-thread warp now have a limited degree of autonomy; threads can now be synchronized at a fine-grain level, and while the SIMT paradigm is still alive and well, it means greater overall efficiency. Importantly, individual threads can now yield, and then be rescheduled together. This also means that a limited amount of scheduling hardware is back in NV’s GPUs.\n\nOverall, GV100 is a 3 billion dollar R&D project for NVIDIA, their largest project to date for their largest GPU to date. NV is expecting the first GV100 products to start shipping in Q3 of this year and they won’t be cheap – on the order of $18K per GPU for a DGX system – however for those customers with deep pockets and who will essentially pay NVIDIA to eat the risk of producing such a large GPU, this will be the most powerful GPU released yet.\n\nTesla V100\n\nThe first product to use the GV100 GPU is in turn the aptly named Tesla V100. Like its P100 predecessor, this is a not-quite-fully-enabled GV100 configuration. Overall, only 80 of 84 SMs are enabled for yield reasons.\n\nNVIDIA Tesla Family Specification Comparison Tesla V100 Tesla P100 Tesla K40 Tesla M40 Stream Processors 5120 3584 2880 3072 Core Clock ? 1328MHz 745MHz 948MHz Boost Clock(s) 1455MHz 1480MHz 810MHz, 875MHz 1114MHz Memory Clock 1.75Gbps HBM2 1.4Gbps HBM2 6Gbps GDDR5 6Gbps GDDR5 Memory Bus Width 4096-bit 4096-bit 384-bit 384-bit Memory Bandwidth 900GB/sec 720GB/sec 288GB/sec 288GB/sec VRAM 16GB 16GB 12GB 12GB Half Precision 30 TFLOPS 21.2 TFLOPS 4.29 TFLOPS 6.8 TFLOPS Single Precision 15 TFLOPS 10.6 TFLOPS 4.29 TFLOPS 6.8 TFLOPS Double Precision 7.5 TFLOPS\n\n(1/2 rate) 5.3 TFLOPS\n\n(1/2 rate) 1.43 TFLOPS\n\n(1/3 rate) 213 GFLOPS\n\n(1/32 rate) GPU GV100\n\n(815mm2) GP100\n\n(610mm2) GK110B GM200 Transistor Count 21B 15.3B 7.1B 8B TDP 300W 300W 235W 250W Cooling N/A N/A Active/Passive Passive Manufacturing Process TSMC 12nm FFN TSMC 16nm FinFET TSMC 28nm TSMC 28nm Architecture Volta Pascal Kepler Maxwell 2\n\nBy the numbers, Tesla V100 is slated to provide 15 TFLOPS of FP32 performance, 30 TFLOPS FP16, 7.5 TFLOPS FP64, and a whopping 120 TFLOPS of dedicated Tensor operations. With a peak clockspeed of 1455MHz, this marks a 42% increase in theoretical FLOPS for the CUDA cores at all size. Whereas coming from Pascal, for Tensor operations the gains will be closer to 6-12x, depending on the operation precision.\n\nThe Tesla V100 will be paired with 16GB of HBM2. At this time no one is producing an 8-Hi HBM2 stack, so NVIDIA cannot expand their memory capacity at 4 stacks. However the memory clockspeed has improved by 25% over Tesla P100, from 1.4Gbps to 1.75Gbps.\n\nAlso like the Tesla P100, NVIDIA is using a mezzanine card. They have not shown the new connector – expect it to have more pins to account for the additional NVLinks – but the overall size is similar. NVIDIA calls this the SXM2 form factor.\n\nIn terms of power consumption, Tesla V100 will have a TDP of 300W, like its predecessor. NVIDIA notes that power efficiency of V100 is higher than P100, though it will be interesting to see just where this stands, and how often the card actually power throttles.\n\nThe first product to ship with Tesla V100 will be the NVIDIA DGX-1V, the Volta version of their DGX server. Similar to their Pascal launch, starting with DGX sales allows NVIDIA to sell 8 GPUs in one go, and for a premium at that. A DGX-1V will set you back a cool $149,000. The payoff? It ships in Q3, whereas OEM P100 designs won’t be available until Q4.\n\nFinally, along with the mezzanine version, NVIDIA has also announced two PCIe versions of the V100. The first is a full size 250W card, analogous to the PCIe Tesla P100. The second is a smaller full height half length PCIe card, which for now is being dubbed the “Tesla V100 for Hyperscale Inference”. This is a 150W card, and is specifically meant for dense configurations in datacenter inference servers. The specifications have not been published yet, but given that it has half the TDP of the mezzanine card, it’s a safe bet that it’s clocked lower and features more disabled SMs than the full fat version.",

It is the predecessor to Gorescript, the new 2017 version, a full revamp of the game, reworked from the ground up in C++ and currently on Steam Greenlight.\n\nThis article aims to explore the full history of Gorescript Classic, from the development stages to its initial release, to getting played by John Carmack himself, then headlined on HackerNews, and finally achieving lasting popularity on Chrome Web Store.\n\nBuilding my own private Doom\n\nIn early 2014, I wanted to make a game. Specifically, I was messing around with some 2D stuff in three.js while relearning JavaScript the proper way. For some reason 2D never managed to keep me engaged for long periods of time, so after a few weeks I switched to 3D and started to build a shooter.\n\nNow imagine you’re in the following situation: you want to build a shooter, right? But you don’t want to use an engine, nor do you want to learn Blender or something similar to make 3D assets. You also don’t have any artistic skills whatsoever, and your team consists of you and you alone. What do you do? Well, you either choose a more orthodox path to pursue or you start to improvise. And improvise is what I did.\n\nTo build something that can be called a shooter you need the following things: some kind of weapons, some kind of enemies, and some kind of environment for these to interact with each other. Unless you’re developing under a rock, at this point you’re gonna start looking for inspiration. How did other people accomplish this?\n\nThe best example I came up with is the original Doom. Doom was pretty much the top game of my childhood. I know every level like the back of my hand. I can’t name more than a few Pokemon, but I can sure name every single monster “species” from Doom. The sound effects (particularly the PC speaker ones) are forever burned into my skull. I even read Masters of Doom twice. Doom was the perfect choice for me, both for personal and technical reasons.\n\nSo I started to reverse engineer Doom, not by way of reading the source code, but simply by looking at it and trying to break it apart. How does a map look like in a map editor? How does it render a map? What kind of scripting do the maps need to function? How do the weapons work? How does the monster pathfinding work? What monster types do you need?\n\nOver a period of a few months, I built my own Doom-like content creation pipeline. First off, a map editor where you draw 2D maps which then get converted into 3D by the engine. While the engine renders them in full 3D, the levels themselves are old-school 2.5D. Because why would you want to place a room over another room in 2014?\n\nSecondly, instead of sprites, I opted to use voxel meshes so I built a custom voxel mesh editor. Animating them the modern way was out of the question, so even though they’re 3D, the enemies cycle through different meshes to walk, attack and die, in a way very similar to spritesheet animation.\n\nCollision detection and response was another huge issue to tackle. After reading every article I could find, I finally pieced together a working version using ellipsoid to triangle tests for the player and projectile collisions and 2D AABB tests for the monsters. It’s decent enough if you ignore the fact that monsters can’t step over each other, even if one of them is flying 30 feet above. That’s a Doom limitation which I gleefully added into my own engine, 20 years later. To tie it all together, I used a uniform grid scene graph instead of BSP trees.\n\nAI was pretty basic: you make any kind of noise inside a room and all the monsters in that room and any adjoining area not separated by a door are instantly alerted to your presence. They don’t come straight at you but they do add a random 2D vector to your position every few frames and instead head straight for that. If their movement is blocked for any reason, they “scatter” -- pick a random direction to run for a few moments before getting back to their original target. Same as in Doom, this works surprisingly well, considering they don’t have any sophisticated pathfinding algorithm at their disposal.\n\nRendering was the most interesting part. I had to make it look decent while running reasonably fast. After a few attempts involving textured environments and lightmaps, I eventually chose against them and went for vertex-colored walls, floors and ceilings lit by point lights and shaded only by SSAO. It gets the job done, though it’s not by any means a novel approach. A lot of three.js demos use this style, certain games too.\n\nSo after all that plus the usual boring to implement but necessary bits like UI, menus, rebindable keys, etc. the game engine was finally ready. For the game itself, which amounted to a demo content-wise, I made three scripted levels, two enemy types and three weapon types. And that was it. I released it for free in May 2014.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe initial response was lukewarm, although I probably saw it differently at the time. People seemed to like it for the most part, and it even got praised by Ricardo Cabello (aka Mr.doob), the creator of three.js. Apart from the game being showcased on threejs.org and Chrome Experiments, it pretty much went under the radar. Since I had no further plans to develop it at the time, I moved on with my life.\n\nOne of the main complaints in the first half-year since its release was performance. It was quite resource-intensive and didn’t reach 60fps on most systems, so around Christmas 2014 I decided to pick it up again and try to improve the performance. Eventually, after a few weeks I implemented antiportal rendering, which proved to be a substantial boost. While not perfect, the game ran much better now on a significant slice of systems.\n\nIn January 2015, I started to promote it a bit more on Twitter and Reddit. Somehow I even got the nerve to tweet it to John Carmack. To my surprise, he actually replied! He played it. It was an amazing moment for me . Soon after, HackerNews picked up the game, and its popularity soared for a while.\n\nCome February, I got an e-mail from Google asking me to put the game on Chrome Web Store. I published it as a packaged app, which provided a few improvements over the original web version, most notably the fact that you no longer needed to click a browser dialog to enable mouse look every time you played.\n\nThe Chrome Web Store release proved to be the definitive one. It’s currently at 250000+ users, with an average score of 3.5 stars out of 5. Not bad for my first ever game release.\n\nThe game is also quite popular on YouTube, getting weekly Let’s Play’s to this day. That’s after basically no content patches since early 2015. People are still playing it. I still get e-mails about it from time to time. Overall, I’d say it was definitely worth my time to develop.\n\nGorescript Classic is completely free and the source code is available under the MIT license on GitHub.

That got us thinking about laundry. Whether you're washing diapers or not, washing and drying clothes can take up a lot of energy usage in your home - but there are plenty of ways to save.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, there are two main ways to reduce your energy usage on washing clothes: use less water, and use cooler water. Except in the case of oily stains, warm or cold water settings will generally do a good job getting your clothes clean. The agency reports that simply switching your washing machine's temperature setting from hot to warm can cut a load's energy usage in half.\n\nHere are some additional money-savings tips from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nWash your clothes in cold water using cold-water detergents whenever possible.\n\nWash and dry full loads. If you are washing a small load, use the appropriate water-level setting.\n\nDry towels and heavier cottons in a separate load from lighter-weight clothes.\n\nDon't over-dry your clothes. If your machine has a moisture sensor, use it.\n\nClean the lint screen in the dryer after every load to improve air circulation and prevent fire hazards.\n\nPeriodically, use the long nozzle tip on your vacuum cleaner to remove the lint that collects below the lint screen in the lint screen slot of your clothes dryer.\n\nUse the cool-down cycle to allow the clothes to finish drying with the heat remaining in the dryer.\n\nPeriodically inspect your dryer vent to ensure it is not blocked. This will save energy and may prevent a fire.

That’s the nuts and bolts of it.\n\n“We all know who the best players are, but we are trying to find the rough diamonds we can polish up as well as being in the market for the top players.”\n\nThey were the words of Brendan Rodgers to the ECHO, back in the late summer of 2012, as you may well remember.\n\nLiverpool’s former boss was speaking in the wake of his first summer as Reds manager when he had ushered the unwanted Andy Carroll out of the the Anfield door but failed to adequately replace him.\n\nClub owners FSG had refused to sanction a deal for Clint Dempsey and other options didn’t fit the bill. Rodgers would wait to strengthen, with Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho arriving in the January window just a few months later.\n\nThose words may have been uttered more than five years ago - and by a manager long gone - but they remain fundamental to the business Liverpool will try to do this summer.\n\nThe context however is very different.\n\nWhere Rodgers spoke of “polishing rough diamonds” in terms of affordability, it is rather availability which will prove the most difficult hurdle for Jurgen Klopp as he seeks to build on this week’s mood-enhancing arrival of Mohamed Salah.\n\nMake no mistake, Liverpool’s parameters for affordability are very different now.\n\nThey have money available though they are not inclined to shout about it, perhaps explaining their rather different views of the Salah fee than that publicly declared to the stock exchange by Roma as one which could rise to 50m euros.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAnd let’s be frank, FSG should have money available to their manager, and lots of it.\n\nKlopp after all kept his powder dry in January when his intended targets weren’t available - there’s that word cropping up again - a decision which cost Liverpool in the short term but which can be mitigated by a strong and decisive summer window.\n\nHis transfer dealings in the previous two windows have delivered a net profit when it could reasonably have been expected to see an investment of at least £30m in each. He will also generate his own money to spend with a clear-out of fringe players, even if Napoli’s £11m for Alberto Moreno was deemed short of Liverpool’s £15m asking price earlier this week.\n\nWith Salah in the bag, fans will naturally look to see which position the Reds will move to strengthen next.\n\nA centre-back for many, a midfielder for some, a left-back for almost everybody.\n\nThe club are taking a more fluid approach and insist they will take opportunities when availability arises with players of the quality they seek. Klopp himself has spoken of how limited that supply of players actually is.\n\nSpanish reports that the Reds had bid 100m euros for Kylian Mbappe weren’t accurate as at this stage the club don’t yet believe he is a player who might be available to them, with Real Madrid seemingly in the driving seat for any move for the coveted Monaco striker.\n\nThe fact that Liverpool are interested and now at least in the conversations for those top players is though a significant step forward.\n\nRemember 2012. Remember Clint Dempsey. Yes, Clint Dempsey.\n\nOther positions too could be hit by the availability dilemma.\n\n(Image: ROBERT MICHAEL/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nUEFA’s decision this week to allow RB Leipzig to take part in the Champions League after apparently overcoming the dual ownership issues arising from Red Bull Salzburg undoubtedly dealt the Reds a blow in their chances of prising Naby Keita away from the Bundesliga runners-up.\n\nRyan Sessegnon was favoured as a promising left back but prefers staying in London, most likely with Spurs while Southampton decided to make Virgil van Dijk very unavailable, to Liverpool at least, even with £60m set to be waved under their noses.\n\nAs avenues close Liverpool will pursue others with Klopp constantly on the phone with sporting director Michael Edwards and FSG president Mike Gordon, even as he soaked up the Ibiza sun on “holiday”, the three essentially masterminding Anfield’s summer business.\n\nLiverpool got one hugely promising deal over the line this week but the work has barely started.\n\nThere is no endless supply of money of course, there never is, but there are now few deals from which Liverpool would have to walk away from due to financial constraints alone.\n\nMost are now “affordable”.\n\nWhat will decide the success or otherwise of Liverpool’s summer is how many can become “available”.",
  "latent_1739": "+ T -\n\nПоделиться:\n\nПроехала на автомобиле от Москвы через Хельсинки до Праги, думала о том, куда делись деньги на строительство суперсовременной магистрали Москва-Санкт-Петербург.\n\nМожет, я что-то пропустила, но вроде бы собирались строить? Даже убили нескольких человек, которые вякали против строительства и в защиту химкинского леса? Так вот, лес-то вырубили, а трассы все нет. Возле Москвы стоят какие-то железные опоры якобы для будущей развязки, но никакого строительства рядом не идет и вид их не меняется уже несколько лет, а дальше от Москвы уже и вида про строительство никто не делает, так, ковыряются лениво рабочие, поправляют провал, чтобы совсем не проваливался, не больше.\n\nБолее половины из почти семисот километров эта, с позволения сказать, дорога, имеет всего три полосы - средняя, для обгона, каждые полкилометра меняет направление. Кто не успел обогнать за эти полкилометра, тот оказывается на встречной. С летящими навстречу гружеными КАМАЗами, привет семье и близким. В Вышнем Волочке трасса идет через город с узкими мостами. Дорога сужается двух полос. Поэтому тут всегда многокилометровая пробка, через которую машины ползут со знаменитым русским терпением.\n\nСправа от дороги рекламировал себя магазин валенок.\n\nВ кустах сторожил местный гаишник. Уныло изучил документы, с сожалением отпустил. Я попыталась его утешить:\n\n— Трасса, — говорю, — вон какая загруженная, вы себе еще наловите рыбы.\n\n— Да если бы! — возразил он плаксиво. — Никто же не нарушает! Как штрафы повысили, так все стали ездить осторожно! (“Гады”, - хотел он явно добавить, но замялся. Он был застенчивый придорожный грабитель, как голубой воришка Альхен в “12 стульях”).\n\nИ на всей дороге нет нормальных стоянок для отдыха. Нет чистых туалетов. Для кого эта дорога построена, теряюсь в догадках — для суровых мужиков в ватниках и кирзовых сапогах, которые могут гордо доставать из широких штанин, стоя на обочине?\n\nЯ вот езжу в туфлях, потому что считаю, что не стоит снижать стандарты и надевать кирзовые сапоги, собираясь из одной столицы в другую. Но в этих туфлях в половину придорожных туалетов на трассе М10 не войти. Даже не то что не войти внутрь, а просто не дойти до отдельно стоящего строения типа сортир, потому что кругом лужи и какие-то провалы и бездны.\n\nВообще хочется на любой бодрый патриотический рапорт спрашивать: \"А туалеты?\"\n\n\"Крымнаш!\" — \"А туалеты?\". \" Сто тысяч тонн нефти загружено в закрома Родины!\" — \"А туалеты?\"\n\nКогда с туалетами, рукомойниками и туалетной бумагой все наладится, тогда, помяните мое слово, и выборы станут честными, и народ перестанет бросаться друг на друга с детсадовскими обзывалками. Тогда, но не раньше.\n\nВ районе Валдая трасса внезапно резко улучшается. Появляется дополнительная полоса, фонари по бокам, разделительный барьер. Спутники мои тут же забормотали про Путина — “Путин, Путин, тут Путин ездит, Путин тут отдыхает, это для него трассу построили”.\n\nНа вопрос, откуда Путин тут внезапно посередине ничего берется и зачем он тут ездит, по этому короткому хорошему куску трассы, спутники многозначительно показывали пальцем в окно и говорили:\n\n— Видишь, какая хорошая дорога? Такое могли построить только для Путина. А прилетает он сюда на вертолете.\n\n— Чтобы не попасть в пробку в Вышнем Волочке, понимаю. А жаль — он бы там красиво смотрелся среди фур.\n\nПосле Валдая трасса снова ухудшается, а еще через сотню километров начинается предпитерская пробка и уже не кончается до самой северной столицы. Поэтому к рассказам друзей-водителей, что они-де пролетели весь путь от Москвы до Питера за пять часов я после этой поездки отношусь с большим скепсисом.\n\nТуалеты опять же.

And one of them, the BBC's £600m MediaCityUK in Salford, designed by Wilkinson Eyre, has had to take the ultimate shame of winning the 2011 Carbuncle Cup awarded by Building Design magazine.\n\nThe MediaCity complex is described by BD's editor, Ellis Woodman, as \"a crazed accumulation of development in which every aimlessly gesticulating building sports at least three different cladding treatments. The overriding sense is one of extreme anxiety on the part of the architect. Quite how the BBC has stooped this low is hard to fathom.\"\n\nTwo more big names, Lord Richard Rogers and Sir Nicholas Grimshaw, joined BD's list of carbuncular practitioners. Rogers' astoundingly costly One Hyde Park, with the first £100m apartment in the world, was controversial from the outset, but a far better design exercise than Rogers' equally new, and distinctly blingy Meccano kit apartments near Tate Modern in London.\n\nJoin Independent Minds For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just £5.99 €6.99 $9.99 a month Get the best of The Independent With an Independent Minds subscription for just £5.99 €6.99 $9.99 a month Get the best of The Independent Without the ads – for just £5.99 €6.99 $9.99 a month\n\nThe gleaming swirls of Grimshaw's transport hub at Newport station in Wales were judged to be beyond bling and branded a \"bizarre ovary\".\n\nThe Carbuncle Cup's \"lowly commended\" included the Phoenix School in west London, designed by Bond Bryan. The school's jutting, luridly coloured vertical panels were said to \"march down the building's considerable length like so many dwarves hi-hoing their way to the diamond mine\".\n\nAnd can there be a more grimly banal place of worship than the Ebenezer Chapel in Brighton, by Molyneux Architects? This mixed-use building is exactly the kind of supposedly acceptable, local authority-friendly architecture that is turning our cityscapes into zones of apocalyptic mediocrity.\n\nBut the most controversial building on the Carbuncle shortlist is surely the just-completed £72m Museum of Liverpool, designed by the cool Danish practice 3XN. The big question mark is whether such a big building should have been built on the waterfront within a stone's throw of the historic Liver Building. The lead architect's first reaction was that it shouldn't.\n\nBut its design proceeded, riven by legal disputes between architect and client, cost cuts, and the bringing in of another architect, AEW. The result is a building stoutly defended by Paul Finch, director of the government watchdog, Design Council CABE, but described as \"cringe-making\" by Ellis Woodman.

  "latent_1952": "Negotiating with terrorists, at least up until the current administration’s tenure, had always been off the table for our country; and yet we see the Black Lives Matter anarchists’ use of violence and intimidation rewarded by some of our most stalwart politicians.\n\nCities turned into riot zones, a preferred tactic of Black Lives Matter leftists to manipulate the genuine misery and dissolute practices of our urban ghettos, are now on the receiving end of what amounts to a hefty ransom payment. The willingness with which politicians are caving to this situation is almost as surprising as the names of the politicians who are writing the checks on behalf of the taxpayers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMy own city, Milwaukee, is chief among these beneficiaries of taxpayer “generosity.” Just this past week, Governor Scott Walker routed $4.5 million of state and federal funds to “train workers, help businesses and deal with foreclosed homes” to the city. Taxpayers already spend billions per year for the original albeit failing job-training and anti-poverty program called K-12 public education. An actual breakdown of the allocation reveals just who will benefit: the nonprofits and developers chummy enough with the progressive left to have gotten to the front of the line.\n\nIt was none other than the race-provocatuer Jesse Jackson who delivered the ransom demands, just days after the Milwaukee rioting, when he said that not enough had been spent on urban reconstruction in Milwaukee and other cities. He failed to mention that these cities are all Democrat-run. It makes you wonder what happened to the stimulus funds that were meant to solve these problems. Not enough quite enough money to stave off massive rioting, looting, and loss of life, it appears.\n\nWalker’s response is the typical well-meaning but destructive misstep so many GOP politicians have pursued, but the damage they do in implicitly validating the claims of Black Lives Matter is even more destructive than the loss of taxpayer dollars for valid taxpayer spending.\n\nWe’ve seen this all before; after cities were torn apart by riots in the 1960s, billions of dollars were spent on urban renewal—and things only got worse in the ghetto. In fact, the funding of the urban pathologies back then has wrought the very situation we are dealing with now.\n\nIf the GOP wants to help, and I believe they do, it won’t be by funding the cultural rot of the American ghetto or giving credence to the message that this has anything to do with a lack of funds being funneled to the left’s nonprofits and developer buddies.\n\nAnd truly, my conservative friends should know better.\n\nIt is the failed urban policy of the progressive left that is responsible for the misery of the ghetto, the need for more money to fund this manipulation. The Democrat Party has torn down every element of strong and independent society that could have been a lifeline to the black community, although they’ve been frustratingly (to them) unable to tear away their faith.\n\nAs Ben Shapiro wrote in National Review this past week, it’s all so cringingly clear: the left simply cannot let a “good crisis” go to waste. In fact, it appears they’re not above creating that crisis to begin with.\n\nOur conservative leaders need to hold the line on this one, no matter how enticing it may be to seek the approval of the progressive left by doling out money to the cities. I have news for politicians considering this type of move: you’ll never get the progressives to thank you, to accept you, or to acknowledge that you’ve paid their ransom with the good-faith effort to reach out to the black community and show that you care.\n\nThe progressives don’t care about the black community or the urban ghetto. They care about funding their nonprofits, their builders and developers, and their machine of poverty manipulation.\n\nWe need the tough love parenting that actually helps restore independence and self-reliance, not the rewarding of bad behavior that sends a child down an irrecoverable path but feels good. The Democrats have now seen that their riot diplomacy works, and it will be at the expense of yet more lives wasted and lost in the progressive’s American ghetto.\n\nClarke is the Milwaukee County sheriff.

  "latent_2058": "DIVISIVE questions dominate the Supreme Court’s docket this year, but the most emotional decision coming down this month addresses a tug-of-war custody battle over a little girl named Veronica. In the unfortunately titled case Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, the court will rule on whether the biological father of a three-year-old had the legal right to reclaim his daughter after she had been given up for adoption. It’s a lose-lose situation: either the adoptive parents who raised Veronica from birth for 27 months, or her biological father, with whom she has lived since January 2012, will be heartbroken when the justices render their decision.\n\nDiscussion surrounding the case has focused on what is in the best interests of the child, but the legal question is oddly divorced from that inquiry. According to the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), a 1978 law combating the removal of Native American children from their homes and reservations, a number of procedural safeguards must be followed before Indians are adopted by outsiders. Dusten Brown, the biological father and a member of the Cherokee Nation, signed away custody rights to Veronica’s mother, but subsequently objected when he discovered Veronica had been adopted by Matt and Melanie Capobianco, who are not Native American. Based on several provisions in the ICWA, a family court awarded custody to Mr Brown, and the South Carolina State Supreme Court affirmed the ruling on appeal. The Capobiancos were forced to hand over the child in a tearful parting.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision, coming in the next two weeks, should be close. Based on their questions during oral argument, Justices Ginsburg, Scalia and Sotomayor are poised to rule for the biological father and Justice Kagan seems likely to join them. But Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Breyer and Alito, seem more sceptical that the ICWA gives Mr Brown custody. Justice Thomas, true to form, was mum during the oral argument. Justice Kennedy, also true to form, was inscrutable, lamenting that he couldn’t call upon King Solomon to sort things out.\n\nSo a 5-4 or 6-3 decision seems likely. Whichever way the justices rule, they will address (or skirt) some wrenchingly difficult questions. Among them are two biggies:\n\n1. What is a parent? Much of the oral argument revolved around whether Mr Brown should be construed as a mere “sperm donor”—since he had no relationship with Veronica in the first two years of her life—or as a father with full custodial rights under the ICWA. For Justice Scalia, it’s simple: “this guy is...the father of the child...and they’re taking the child away from him even though he wants it.” Case closed. But the attorney for the petitioner insisted that the ICWA doesn’t apply since “there is no Indian family” that the adoption by the Capobiancos was breaking up. Mr Scalia's adamancy about biology is interesting given his ruling in 1988 that the husband of an adulterous wife who conceived and bore a child through her lover was unquestionably the baby’s father in the eyes of the law, genetics be damned. Since the \"presumptive father\" had cared for the child and exercised parental responsibilities for him, Mr Scalia had reasoned, he was the legal parent despite the lack of a biological connection. All signs point toward Mr Scalia coming to exactly the opposite judgment this time around.\n\n2. When are racial classifications permissible? Chief Justice Roberts is famous for his faux-tautological contention that “the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” Justice Scalia has made a similar point time and again, as he did in the Adarand case in 1994:\n\nTo pursue the concept of racial entitlement—even for the most admirable and benign of purposes—is to reinforce and preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that produced race slavery, race privilege and race hatred.\n\nSuddenly Mr Scalia seems less perturbed by racial identity serving as the centerpiece of a legal claim. In a brief on behalf of Baby Veronica, Paul Clement, a conservative lawyer representing the child's guardian in the case, points out a connection to Palmore v. Sidoti, an equal-protection case:\n\nIn Palmore, this Court struck down the use of racial classifications to remove a child from an appropriate custody placement. This case is no different. Baby Girl’s Indian blood quantum was the sole reason the lower court ordered her removed from the loving, stable home she had lived in since birth and placed with a biological father whose failure to timely care for her extinguished any parental rights he might otherwise have had under state law or the Constitution.\n\nThe Indian Child Welfare Act was designed “to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families.” It is a federal response to America's long and grim history of forcibly removing American Indian children from their homes. In the view of Marcia Zug, a law professor at the University of South Carolina, \"without ICWA, the future of American Indian tribes is imperiled.\"\n\nYet if the ICWA is to protect both the tribe and the child, as it promises to do, the question of Veronica's best interests must be considered as well. If it weren’t for Veronica’s few drops of Cherokee blood, Mr Brown would have had no legal basis for removing her from the custody of the Capobiancos in 2012. When a confused, crying Veronica was taken from her adoptive parents at the age of two, her individual interests were sacrificed to those of the Cherokee tribe. We can argue about whether that move was justified. But now Veronica's circumstances have changed. She is living with her biological father, and the Capobiancos are fading from her memory. Wrenching her away from the parent who has raised her for the past 18 months would only compound Veronica's confusion and double her misery. However the court rules, we can only hope that the sad episode of this Solomonic custody case will not be repeated with other children.",
  "latent_2082": "I have never been a fan of using tank sealers, but sometimes you don't have a choice. Recently, the tank on my 1964 Triumph T100SC started seeping at a spot weld under the right side strut securing the tank kneepad. I didn't want to repaint the tank, so the easiest fix was to epoxy coat the tank and seal the leak from the inside.\n\nFortunately, this is a project within most people's grasp. It's not a difficult task, but careful preparation is key, especially if you have an expensive paint job to protect. Materials needed include bolts or rubber plugs to seal the fuel tap threads, a rubber bung to seal the filler neck, plastic wrap and newspapers to protect the paint, rubber gloves to protect your hands, a container for mixing the epoxy, a mixing stick and the sealer, of course. Finally, a clean workspace with enough room to move the tank around so the coating is evenly applied is important.\n\nWhen choosing a sealer, make sure it will stand up to the ethanol in modern gas. A Novolac epoxy sealer such as Caswell sealer will do that. Prepare the tank by removing anything you can unscrew from it, such as badges, filler cap, fuel taps and kneepads. If you use bolts to seal the tap holes, wrap them with Teflon tape. If you use rubber plugs, push them in firmly. You don't want any epoxy leaking out.\n\nSponsored by\n\nMost people seal tanks because of rust issues. Although Caswell says you don't have to remove the rust first, I'd rather start with a clean, rust-free surface if at all possible. I used Evapo-Rust to clean the surfaces inside the tank. Evapo-Rust is non-toxic and won't dissolve your paint, plus it does a bang-up job of removing rust. I just filled the tank and let it sit for 12 hours. I drained the Evapo-Rust back into its jug (you can reuse it until it stops being effective), then blew the tank dry with compressed air.\n\nOnce you have the tank cleaned and the fuel taps plugged, it's time to wrap the tank. First, wrap it with plastic wrap. Make several passes, completely covering the tank, including the filler neck. You're building a barrier to keep any spilled epoxy from sticking to your paint job. After the layer of plastic wrap, cover the wrap with newspaper, using masking tape to hold it on the tank. Again, cover everything; you're making an absorbent layer in case any epoxy gets through what comes next. Finally, apply another layer of plastic wrap over the newspaper to hold everything together. With a razor blade or sharp knife, make an X cut to expose the filler neck opening. Carefully pull the layers of covering back to the circumference of the cap opening. With masking tape, seal the edges of the covering to the outside of the filler neck. As a final step, after wrapping the tank I rinsed it with a cup of acetone to remove any moisture left from the Evapo-Rust and water rinse.\n\nMake sure everything you need is within reach, because after the next step, the clock is ticking on applying the coating. You have about 15 minutes to work the epoxy before it sets up, and in that time you have to roll the tank to evenly coat the interior.\n\n-Advertisement-\n\nMake a filler neck cover out of several layers of plastic wrap, or use a rubber stopper big enough to seal the cap opening. If using wrap, have rubber bands to seal the wrap to the filler neck. Mix the two components of the epoxy. There's enough in the kit for two average-sized motorcycle tanks, so I only used half of each component. With the epoxy thoroughly mixed, pour it into the tank. Quickly seal up the filler neck opening and start rotating the tank. The objective is to get all the interior surfaces covered evenly, but the epoxy is thick, and it gets thicker as it cures. Roll the tank around to spread the epoxy, giving it a minute to settle with each major orientation of the tank (top, bottom, left, right).\n\nAfter about 15 minutes of this the interior should have a good, even coating. Set the tank down and remove the filler neck plug. Turn the tank over and drain any leftover epoxy into a disposable cup. Once the excess is out, turn the tank right side up and remove the fuel tap bolts. Place the tank so nothing will drain out of those holes; you don't want any epoxy plugging them. Let the tank cure at room temperature for 48 hours, replace the fuel taps and any other hardware — and you should be good to go.\n\nThis is where it started. If you look closely, you can see the paint bubbling along the lower edge of the kneepad support. Fuel was leaking because of corrosion at the spot weld.\n\n-Advertisement-\n\nBefore lining the tank we removed all the tank emblems, the fuel taps and the fuel cap. To purge the tank of any rust we filled it with Evapo-Rust, letting it sit for 12 hours followed by a thorough rinse and dry. If you still see some rust, fill it again and let it soak another 12 hours.\n\nPlug the holes for the fuel taps. We prefer using threaded bolts with Teflon tape as the bolts will protrude beyond the threads, but tight-fitting rubber plugs will also work well.\n\nWith the fuel tap holes sealed, wrap the gas tank several times with plastic wrap, including the filler neck. Next, wrap the tank with several layers of newspaper, followed by another layer of plastic wrap to hold it all together. Note the large rubber plug for the filler neck.\n\nCut a hole for the filler neck and seal the plastic/paper wrap to the edge of the filler neck. Next, we rinsed the tank with acetone to remove any moisture. Doing so at this stage ensures you won't damage the paint if you spill acetone.\n\nNext it was time to mix our two-part liner. We used an old glass mixing cup, which we threw away when we were done. Pour the mix into the tank and seal the filler neck with a rubber plug or tape, then start rolling the tank.\n\nSpread the liner mix by rotating the tank for about 15 minutes, letting it sit for a minute or so on each major surface (top, bottom, left and right sides). Once you're comfortable the tank's thoroughly coated, remove the plug from the filler neck and drain excess liner out the neck and into a disposable container.\n\nAfter draining the excess liner, carefully and thoroughly clean the top of the fuel filler neck of any epoxy that might have settled on it so the gas cap will seat and properly seal.\n\nPosition the tank so no liner can drip from the fuel tap holes and remove the wrap, followed by the fuel tap plugs. Leave the tank in this position for 48 hours to let the epoxy liner thoroughly cure. Once cured, reinstall the fuel taps and any tank hardware. You're done!",

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Iran has not altered its posture on the global stage despite, over a year and a half ago, choosing to alter the nature of its controversial nuclear program, a senior White House official said on Thursday.\n\nDeputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, a close confidante of US President Barack Obama and a chief architect behind the sale of last year's landmark nuclear deal with Iran, said the agreement has been fully implemented by Tehran and is widely favored by the Iranian public.\n\nOffering a timeline of how negotiations started in a speech to The Iran Project– a non-governmental organization which favored the deal– he asserted that Obama was consistent, from the start of his presidency, in his intention to negotiate a settlement with Iran on the nuclear issue regardless of the contortions of the current government.Rhodes emerged for the speech after enduring a storm of critical media coverage, some of which alleged he had intentionally misled journalists in his sale of the deal. He briefly alluded to those articles, stemming from a profile in New York Times Magazine, but also offered his analysis on the impact the nuclear deal will have on broader relations with Iran.\"Many other aspects of Iranian behavior– and US-Iran relations– remain unchanged,\" Rhodes said. \"Iran has not ceased its support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah or its threats toward Israel. Iran has continued to test ballistic missiles. From Iraq to Yemen, Iran has continued to engage in destabilizing support for proxy organizations.\"Despite the diplomacy that has brought Iran into discussions about resolving the Syrian civil war, Iran continues to be one of the chief sponsors of an Assad regime that brutally murders the Syrian people,\" he continued. \"In short, Iran’s approach to its nuclear program has changed, but thus far, its broader foreign policy– and the nature of its regime– has not.\"But Rhodes reiterated a longstanding line from the White House: That the nuclear deal was never about changing Iran's system of government, about its broader foreign policy, or about rapprochement.\"Some argue that means the deal wasn’t worth it. We would argue the exact opposite,\" he said. \"Isn’t it better when a government with a ballistic missile program that supports terrorism doesn’t have a nuclear weapon? The Iran Deal stopped the spread of nuclear weapons to the world’s most volatile region, and prevented a possible war.Rhodes addressed the comparisons between the president's efforts to \"open\" relations with Cuba and Myanmar and his efforts with Iran, noting some suitable parallels but overall concluding that the policies are not analogous.\"Myanmar decided to change the nature of its own government. Cuba decided to change the nature of its relationship with the United States. Iran decided to change the nature of its nuclear program,\" he said. \"In that regard, while the nuclear deal is enormously consequential, the broader progress with Iran is the most limited.\"The greatest test of whether Iran is willing to shift its foreign policy lies in Syria, where constructive engagement to resolve the conflict \"has not been forthcoming,\" Rhodes said. But relations between the two foreign ministries make constructive engagement possible, he added, where it would not have been before Obama took office.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_2507": "Doug Jones was formally certified as the winner of Alabama’s US Senate election this month, as the state ignored a last-ditch legal challenge by the Republican Roy Moore.\n\nEvangelical Christians 'uncritical' in support for Trump, UK bishop says Read more\n\nThe announcement came hours after Moore’s lawyers filed a request late on Wednesday for a restraining order to stop Alabama’s canvassing board from certifying Jones’s victory. In a statement accompanying that filing, Moore’s team called for a new special election and claimed Alabama “will suffer irreparable harm if the election results are certified without preserving and investigating all the evidence of potential fraud”.\n\nBut even before Montgomery circuit judge Johnny Hardwick denied Moore’s request in a Thursday ruling, state officials rejected Moore’s claims. The certification paved the way for Jones to be sworn in as Alabama’s junior senator when the Senate reconvenes in January.\n\nAfter that was done, at the state capitol on Thursday afternoon, Jones said in a statement: “I am looking forward to going to work for the people of Alabama in the new year.\n\n“As I said on election night, our victory marks a new chapter for our state and the nation. I will be an independent voice and work to find common ground with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get Washington back on track and fight to make our country a better place for all.”\n\nMoore, who was accused of assaulting teenage girls while in his 30s, lost to Jones in the 12 December race by around 20,000 votes, a margin of 1.5%. It was the first time Alabama had elected a Democrat to the US Senate in 25 years.\n\nMoore refused to concede, citing unsubstantiated rumors of election fraud and claiming high Democratic turnout was improbable. The Republican remained undeterred after state officials certified Jones’s win, issuing a statement that continued to suggest foul play despite there being no evidence to support his claims.\n\n“I have stood for the truth about God and the constitution for the people of Alabama,” Moore said. “I have no regrets. To God be the glory.”\n\nA spokesman for Jones called Moore’s late-stage legal challenge “a desperate attempt … to subvert the will of the people” and said: “The election is over. It’s time to move on.”\n\nState officials also disputed any claim of inconsistencies in the voting process. John H Merrill, the Alabama secretary of state, told CNN: “Will this affect anything? The short answer to that is no.”\n\nMerrill met Alabama’s governor, Kay Ivey, and attorney general, Steve Marshall, on Thursday to certify the election result. Jones will be sworn in by vice-president Mike Pence on 3 January.\n\nWith respect to Moore’s allegations of voter fraud, Merrill said that while more than 100 such cases had been reported, the state had “adjudicated more than 60 of those”. “We will continue to do that,” he said.\n\nMoore’s court filing, which spanned dozens of pages, pointed to turnout exceeding expectations in Jefferson County, where Jones won more than 68% of the vote and was buoyed in part by high turnout among black voters.\n\nThe filing cited “experts” including Richard Charnin, who has a blog dedicated to John F Kennedy conspiracy theories and has also floated conspiracies over the 2016 death of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer. Another cited authority, James Condit Jr, has espoused antisemitic views and promoted conspiracies about a supposed Jewish takeover of the Vatican.\n\nMoore has separately sent fundraising emails which solicited donations to investigate alleged voter fraud.\n\nProfile Who is Doug Jones? Show Hide Early life The 63-year-old grew up in the working-class city of Fairfield, just west of Birmingham, an area once dominated by the steel industry. His father was a steelworker and he spent time working in a mill when not in school Democratic roots and the KKK Jones got his start in government as an aide to the last Democrat to serve a full term in the Senate from Alabama, the late Howell Heflin. Years before running for the Senate himself, Jones became known for prosecuting two KKK members for the bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist church in 1963 which killed four black girls. After his appointment as US attorney in Birmingham in 1997, Jones led a team of federal and state attorneys during trials that resulted in the convictions of Thomas Blanton Jr in 2001 and Bobby Frank Cherry in 2002. Photograph: Marvin Gentry/X02859\n\nThe Alabama Senate seat was left vacant by Jeff Sessions, who was chosen by Donald Trump to serve as attorney general.\n\nMoore, who had the backing of Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, secured the Republican nomination in September. The former judge was already a controversial figure, having declared among other beliefs that homosexuality should be illegal and that Muslims should not serve in Congress, and having twice been removed from the state supreme court for unconstitutional actions.\n\nAfter Alabama, Republicans need to choose reason over rage Read more\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, Moore was accused of sexual misconduct towards a number of women. Some of the women, who came forward after decades amid a watershed moment around sexual harassment, said Moore molested them when they were teenagers.\n\nMoore denied the accusations and attempted to discredit the women but has failed to turn up evidence to contradict their claims. In his legal challenge to the election result, his team said he had taken a polygraph test in an attempt to disprove the allegations.\n\nShortly after the election, Trump, who backed Moore’s opponent in the primary, called on the beaten man to concede.\n\n“I would certainly say he should,” the president told reporters on 15 December.\n\nTrump endorsed Moore against Jones, pointing to his denials of the allegations against him and insisting any candidate would be preferable to a “liberal Democrat” like Jones. Trump has himself been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. He denies all such allegations.\n\nJones’s victory has narrowed the Republican Senate majority to 51-49, although he was not seated in time to vote on the GOP tax reform bill.",

  "latent_2604": "Photo credit: Reuben Samuels\n\nAbout a week ago, I got an unexpected early morning message from a man I’d spoken to, but never met in person.\n\n“Hey man, still interested in some early 944 fun/shooting?”\n\nNow I don’t know about you, but when someone offers me a chance to spend some time with a vintage Porsche, I agree first, and ask questions later. The owner in this instance had read some of my other reviews, and even knew the owners of some of those cars, so an unspoken understanding was already there. I figured it would proceed in the usual fashion: we’d meet in some forlorn parking lot at a depressing hour, I’d tear around on the street for an hour or so, snap some photos, and send him on his way. If that sounds like an odd way to spend a morning, it is.\n\nThe usual hashing out of scheduling began, which is always the complicated part. At any given point, I’m working on at least one side project, in addition to a full time job, all while trying to ensure that my girlfriend doesn’t leave me for my cat. That’s not a joke. It’s a serious concern. I intended to get something on the books for the Porsche, but there was no rush. I’m behind on work, and spring is just beginning, so we have many months of good driving weather left. But as we were discussing his SCCA schedule, the bomb dropped.\n\n“If you’d like to co-drive my car on Sunday you’re welcome to do so.”\n\nFlogging sports cars on the street is certainly fun, but there are severe concessions made in the name of safety and staying out of jail. But on the track, I’d be allowed to drive as fast as I was physically capable of, without regard for other motorists, pedestrians, or police. Previously, I was intrigued. Now, I was enthralled. A Porsche, on a closed track, in a sanctioned SCCA event. How could I say no?\n\nBut then I remembered that I’ve never even spectated an autocross event. And I’d never seen the car in person. So, race an unknown car, in a type of event I know nothing about, on a track I’ve never seen, while the owner sits next to me? Also, the only rear wheel drive auto I’ve ever owned were some Ford Rangers back in high school and college. Both of which I totaled. Oh. This might actually be a bit more interesting than I originally planned on.\n\nI know most autocross events just take place in parking lots, but this might be the one area in which Kansas City’s motorsports scene is better than some of our rival cities. Here, we have a web of paved lanes, that are then adjusted with a few cones to finalize the layout. This means there are actually grass runoff areas, different pavement materials, and even some very minor elevation changes. Picture it as a series of four way intersections, that you close certain arms of, to create a route.\n\nSo I headed down there, at the crack of dawn on a Sunday, with the sole goal of not breaking the car, and hopefully not embarrassing myself too badly. Luckily, we were scheduled to run in the third and final heat of the day. The downside of that was I would be spending a full eight hours at the track, and I hate spending that much time anywhere I’m not getting paid. But the upside was I would get many hours to watch and learn. The first heat I would just be learning, and trying to talk my way into any and all available passenger seats. The second heat, I would be a corner worker out on the track (complete with my own super stylish orange safety vest). Finally, in the third heat, I’d be taking the wheel.\n\n[brid video=”35383″ player=”4063″ title=”Andrew autocrosses a borrowed Porsche 944″]",

  "latent_2741": "Circumhorizontal Arcs – Fire Rainbows – Cloud Rainbows\n\nPosted on December 20, 2012 Comments (4)\n\nYesterday afternoon I spotted this odd, colorful, spectrum seemingly in a cloud in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The colors are similar to a rainbow but the prism effect takes on a bit different form than a rainbow as I learned with a bit of searching online. I added a short post to this blog, about the phenomenon a few years ago.\n\nA circumhorizontal arc is an optical phenomenon – an ice-halo formed by plate-shaped ice crystals in high level cirrus clouds. They are also known as “fire rainbows,” if the cloud is at the right angle to the sun, the crystals will refract the sunlight just as when rainbow is created.\n\nThese fire rainbows can only occur when the sun is 58 degrees or higher above the horizon and when the clouds or haze contain plate-shaped ice crystals. The arc has a considerable angular extent and thus, rarely is complete. When only fragments of a cirrus cloud are in the appropriate sky and sun position, they may appear to shine with spectral colors.\n\nThe exciting colors appeared in a few different locations over time as the cloud pattern developed over about 10 minutes. But all of the spectrums appear just above the huge cloud formation seen in the wide view photos above. All the photos are by John Hunter and can be reused as long with the conditions for using the photos are followed (Creative Commons Attribution).\n\nRelated: 2 Raptors Over Johor Bahru, Malaysia – Big Lizards in downtown Johor Bahru – Clouds Are Alive With Bacteria – Turtle Camps in Malaysia",

  "latent_2908": "DUBAI (Reuters) - A senior aide to Iran’s supreme leader warned against the overthrow of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, saying his fate was a “red line”, in one of the Islamic state’s strongest messages of support for the Damascus government.\n\nIran has steadfastly backed Assad’s rule since an uprising against his rule began almost two years ago and regards him as an important part of the axis of opposition against arch-foe Israel.\n\n“If the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is toppled, the line of resistance in the face of Israel will be broken,” Ali Akbar Velayati, who is seen as a potential contender in Iran’s June presidential election, said in an interview broadcast on Sunday.\n\n“We believe that there should be reforms emanating from the will of the Syrian people, but without resorting to violence and obtaining assistance from the (United States of) America,” he told Lebanon’s Al-Mayadeen satellite television.\n\nAsked if Iran sees Assad as a red line, Velayati said: “Yes, it is so. But this does not mean that we ignore the Syrian people’s right in choose its own rulers.”\n\nMore than 60,000 people have died in the uprising against Assad, part of the Arab Spring protests that have swept aside four heads of state since 2011.\n\nIran, a regional Shi’ite Muslim power which backs Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, describes many Syrian opposition groups as “terrorists” who are backed by Western and Arab states. Assad follows an offshoot of Shi’ite Islam.\n\nVelayati blamed what he called “reactionary” Arab states for the violence in Syria and singled out Qatar, accusing it of bringing in fighters from Somalia and Afghanistan to help topple Assad.\n\nSyria's President Bashar al-Assad answers journalists after a meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, December 9, 2010. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nVelayati said all parties linked to the crisis in Syria needed to negotiate.\n\n“Anyone who comes to the talks cannot negotiate on the table and support the armed elements, but must enter the negotiations and stop supporting the armed elements,” he added.\n\nThe Islamic Republic has sought international backing for its six-point plan to resolve the Syrian conflict. The plan calls for an immediate end to violence and negotiations between all parties to form a transitional government, but does not call for Assad to step down.",
  "latent_3003": "If you haven't done so already, go and update your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to iOS 9.3.5 right now. To update, go to Settings > General > Software Update.\n\nIt may not seem urgent because it's only a \"point release,\" but the update is crucial or you risk having all of your data secretly stolen by invisible malware that can install itself on your device and even uninstall itself without leaving any traces behind.\n\nSEE ALSO: Update your iPhone immediately to protect yourself against spyware\n\nTwo reports from the New York Times and Motherboard published on Thursday detail how three major security holes, patched via the update, could be exploited by hackers to track and steal practically all of the private data on your iOS device.\n\nAccording to both reports, Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist from the United Arab Emirates, discovered the vulnerabilities when he received a suspicious text message with a link that would have provided \"new secrets about torture of Emiratis in state prisons.\"\n\nHad Mansoor clicked on the link, he would have been directed to a website that would have exploited all three security holes and installed malware onto his iPhone, giving remote hackers full access to his device.\n\nThankfully, Mansoor didn't click the link. Instead, he alerted Citizen Lab, an interdisciplinary lab based at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto that focuses its research on the intersection of human rights and security.\n\nThe malware kicks in immediately as soon as it's activated and starts snoop on all your iPhone's data.\n\nCitizen Lab identified the link as belonging to NSO Group, an Israel-based \"cyberwar\" company reportedly owned by American venture capital firm Francisco Partners Management, which sells spyware solutions to government agencies.\n\nAlong with additional research from cybersecurity firm Lookout, it has been revealed the three exploits (dubbed \"Trident\") are \"zero-day\" level, meaning the malware kicks in immediately as soon as it's activated (in this case, once the link is opened, the malware automatically installs itself and starts tracking everything).\n\n\"Once infected, Mansoor’s phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements,\" writes Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton, two Citizen Lab senior researchers.\n\nAccording to Lookout, the software is highly flexible and can be configured in a number of ways to target different countries and apps:\n\nThe spyware capabilities include accessing messages, calls, emails, logs, and more from apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, FaceTime, Calendar, Line, Mail.Ru, WeChat, SS, Tango, and others. The kit appears to persist even when the device software is updated and can update itself to easily replace exploits if they become obsolete.\n\nUpon discovery, the two organizations immediately notified Apple and the iPhone maker immediately got to work on iOS 9.3.5, which was released on Thursday.\n\nThough Trident and the type of malware NSO sells (called \"Pegasus\") is mainly used by governments to target dissidents, activists and journalists in volatile countries like United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Kenya, Mozambique, Yemen and Turkey, it can be used to target any iOS device.\n\nThe very idea of having all your data stolen without any real effort should scare everyone into updating their iOS devices.\n\nAs we've entrusted our smartphones and tablets with more and more of our personal data, it's more important than ever to always be running the latest software with the most up-to-date security patches to prevent digital spying and theft.\n\nQuicker to protect iOS than Android\n\nIt took 10 days for Apple to release an update to close the holes after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company.\n\nTen days may seem like a long time, but when you compare it to how long it would take for Android devices to get updated for such a critical patch, it's like hyper speed.\n\nOne of the benefits of iOS is its tightly-integrated software and hardware. Because there are fewer devices and they all run the same core software, Apple can test and deploy security updates quickly and easily with fewer chances of something going wrong.\n\nAndroid, on the hand, is fragmented into tens of thousands of distinct devices, and customized in too many versions for even the most diehard Android fan to remember. This makes it extremely challenging for phone makers to test and release updates to plug up dangerous security holes quickly.\n\nGoogle's Nexus devices are quicker to get software updates because they all run stock Android and Google can push them out in a similar way to Apple. Same goes for Samsung and its Galaxy phones.\n\nBut there's often little incentive for Android phone makers to update their devices. Software maintenance is costly and that's why you'll see many Android devices from lesser-known brands either update their phones months or years later or never at all.\n\nNo platforms are ever truly secure\n\nThe publishing of the security flaws and how serious it could be if you were to fall victim invites another conversation: media portrayal.\n\nAndroid bears the brunt when it comes to being portrayed as the less secure platform, but as this revelation has revealed, no matter which platform is really more secure, all platforms are susceptible to hackers.\n\nSecurity is an ongoing and never-ending battle between phone makers like Apple and Google and hackers. It's a constant cat-and-mouse game where each side is always one step ahead or behind the other.\n\nHad Mansoor not alerted Citizen Lab, the Trident exploit would have continued to exist without anyone knowing. Lookout believes the malware has existed since iOS 7. NSO Group's Pegasus malware can also be used to target Android and BlackBerry devices, too.\n\nWhile no platform will ever be be truly secure, updating to the latest version of your phone's software is the best way to remain safe.",
  "latent_3087": "Pence Working to Reverse Pentagon’s Transgender Policies\n\nVice President Mike Pence and his staff have been working quietly to get Congress to roll back the Defense Department’s year-old policy covering medical procedures for transitioning service members, according to sources.\n\nIn a flurry of last-minute activity, House Republicans have submitted three separate but identical amendments to the 2018 defense spending bill this week that would prohibit the Pentagon from using government money to “provide medical treatment related to gender transition.”\n\nTwo sources involved in the lobbying effort on the Hill say Pence and his staff have been reaching out to Republican members of the House to push for the amendment to be included in the Pentagon spending bill. This month, an effort by Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) to end funding was narrowly defeated in the House in a 209-214 vote, with 24 Republicans voting against it.\n\nPence, who opposed President Barack Obama’s repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” in 2010, has deep ties on the Hill from his years as an Indiana congressman. As governor, he opposed a federal directive on transgender bathroom use in schools, arguing that the matter should be left to states.\n\nThe vice president “has been focused on health care,” Pence spokesman Marc Lotter told Foreign Policy. “I am not aware of him speaking to any members about this.”\n\nDespite the amendment’s initial defeat on July 13, House Republicans have refused to give up the fight and on Monday and Tuesday submitted near identical amendments, each of which must be considered separately.\n\nRep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) forwarded one with the most support and has gained the co-sponsorship of five other Republican lawmakers. The amendment says: “None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to provide medical treatment related to gender transition.”\n\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa) added another amendment stipulating that no funds may be used to conduct transgender sensitivity training courses or “screen members of the Armed Forces regarding gender reassignment surgery.” Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) also filed an amendment to stop funding for the medical services.\n\nConservative groups like the Family Research Council, Heritage Action for America, and Alliance Defending Freedom have been working on the Hill to convince members to support the measure, and with votes coming this week, it’s unclear which way the vote will fall.\n\nOpponents claim that costs for the medical treatments that transgender service members may pursue would cost the Pentagon more than $3.7 billion over 10 years. However, studies from the New England Journal of Medicine and the Rand Corp. show that projected costs would more likely fall between $24 million and $84 million over the same time period.\n\nIn a statement to FP, Rep. Hartzler asserted that the cost would be closer to $1 billion, but “steps must be taken to address this misuse of our precious defense dollars. This policy hurts our military’s readiness.” It’s unclear where Hartzler’s figures come from, and her office declined to comment on her estimate.\n\nThe Family Research Council did not respond to a request for comment on its figures.\n\nOpponents of the measure say military readiness is not an issue that will be affected by continuing the policy as it currently exists.\n\n“The Department of Defense does not want these amendments, and neither do we,” said Matt Thorn, the executive director of OutServe-SLDN, an LGBT advocacy group. “Transgender service members have been serving, openly and authentically, since October 2016 with no impact on readiness or lethality of the force.”\n\nIn a statement released through a spokesman on Tuesday, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Adm. Mike Mullen, said that “it would be unprecedented” for lawmakers to stop medical treatment for service members. “The military conducted a thorough research process on this issue and concluded that inclusive policy for transgender troops promotes readiness. I urge the Congress to respect the military’s judgment and not to breach the faith of service members who defend our freedoms,” the statement read.\n\nPrior to this month’s failed vote on the 2018 defense spending bill, Hartzler had submitted and then withdrawn a more wide-ranging amendment that would have completely reversed the year-old policy that allows transgender service members to serve openly.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker told CNN in June that she decided to wait for Defense Secretary James Mattis to outline his own policy on the issue. Mattis had reached out to Hartzler on at least one occasion in an effort to convince her to withdraw the transgender funding amendment, to no avail.\n\nOn June 30, however, Mattis implemented a six-month delay in accepting transgender recruits into the armed forces, saying service leaders need more time to “review their accession plans and provide input” to him, spokeswoman Dana W. White said in a statement.\n\nBut advocates for transgender service members point out that Mattis’s decision halts a program that wasn’t causing any problems. “It’s not healthy for the military to whipsaw policy back and forth,” said Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, an independent think tank that has conducted research on sexuality in the armed services. “There’s concern in the community that the military spent a lot of time and money to train cadets [at the service academies] on the new policy,” and now it will be tossed aside.\n\n“Thousands of transgender troops have been serving openly for over a year,” Belkin added, “and 18 foreign militaries incorporate them into their forces with no compromise to readiness.”\n\nPhoto credit: U.S. Army",

  "latent_3329": ".- There's a demon that specializes in attacking the family, said exorcist César Truqui, a priest who participated in a 2015 course on exorcism held in Rome.\n\nFr. Truqui warned that everything that is harming the family, including divorce, pleases the devil.\n\nSpeaking to the Italian weekly Tempi in 2015, the priest said that there is “a demon who specializes in the attack on the family, also cited in the story of Tobias, called 'Asmodeus.'”\n\nIn the Old Testament book, the demon is known to have killed seven of Sarah's husbands and was chained in the desert by Saint Raphael. The demon “is present” in many exorcisms, Fr. Truqui said.\n\nThe priest recalled encountering the demon “in exorcisms by Father Gabriele Amorth and Father Francisco Bamonte, whom I assisted.” The recently-deceased Fr. Amorth was a renowned exorcist in Rome who has performed an estimated 70,000 exorcisms over the course of 29 years. Carrying out an exorcism can require multiple sessions and each time the rite is administered it is counted as one instance.\n\n“I remember a young couple, very united, who wanted to get married, however, the woman had to undergo an exorcism to be set free,” Fr. Truqi said.\n\nDuring the exorcism “the demon was furious and threatened Fr. Amorth in order to prevent the marriage, otherwise he would kill the young woman. Obviously, it was a threat from the Liar which in fact did not happen.”\n\nIn that regard, the priest added that the devil also seeks to attack the family through ideologies and lifestyles, as well as individualistic thinking and the spread of divorce.\n\n“They think 'if I don't like my husband anymore, I would be better off divorcing' but they forget about the consequences to the children and society,” he said. “This mentality that works against the family pleases the devil – he knows that a man who is alone without any points of reference is manipulable and unstable.”\n\n“Even today, and I'm more than 50 years old, just thinking that my mother and father love each other forever, I find comfort and courage. In contrast, the children of separated parents are more fragile and wavering,” he said.\n\nIn 2014, Pope Francis gave an address to the Charismatic Renewal, in which he pointed out that the devil seeks to destroy families because that is where Jesus grows, in the midst of the love of the spouses and in the lives of their children.\n\n“He grows in the love of the spouses, he grows in the lives of the children. And that's why the enemy attacks the family so much. The devil does not love the family. He seeks to destroy it, he wants to eliminate love there,” he warned at Rome's Olympic stadium before 52,000 people.\n\nOn that day Francis reminded that “families are these domestic churches. The spouses are sinners, like everyone, but they want to progress in the faith, in their fruitfulness, in the children and their children's faith.”\n\nAnd so he asked the Lord to “bless the family, make it strong, in this crisis in which the devil wants to destroy it.”\n\nThis article was originally published May 26, 2016.\n\nYou may also like:",

Richard Kinder was looking out her garrit window (in nyc) on the nite of March 29,1861 in the direction of the church of the transfiguration at about 12 oclock. The nite was clear and dark with no moon when she saw a luminous cross in the sky with light eminating from around the head as it moved directionally across the sky. She awoke her husband Richard and he saw it also.\"\n\nnotice just before the story begins, they drew a diagram of the cross in the sky on the paper. they drew a second diagram at the top of the next page also. the church of the transfiguration is in chinatown nyc on mott street. so mrs. kinder was in nyc on baxter street (1 block west of mott street) looking east. baxter st. at the time was the famous slum called 5 points which is the background for the martin scorscese film \"gangs of ny\".\n\nin 1861, there were no airplanes, no tall buildings but churches, no television, no reality shows to make you famous, and so i believe the woman and her husband saw something sincerely and told a priest thinking it was a vision from god.\n\nthe light emanating from the head of the cross was obviously a cockpits light and the cross was a craft. btw, a garrit window is like an attic window in todays cape cod type homes.\n\ni researched the newspapers for nyc the following day to see if this could be corraberated.\n\ni found a very interesting story that on canal street about 6 blocks away from baxter street a warehouse, a book bindery and a LABOROATORY went on fire and the entire city block burned to the ground the same evening as the cross in the sky.\n\nmy theory is this: the cross was a type aircraft. the fire illuminated the belly of this metallic aircraft and so its fusilage glowed like a cross as the flames from the fire lit it up from below otherwise it never would have beeen noticed. remember according to the witness it was dark and clear with no moon. i also wonder what was in the laboratory that burned down.",

It is complete and utter lies,” Cruz snapped after a campaign stop in Oshkosh, Wisconsin on Friday.\n\n“It is a tabloid smear, and it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.”\n\nThe supermarket tabloid did not identify them by name, but published pixelated headshots of the women with black bars across their eyes.\n\nThe women were described as a hooker, a teacher, and co-workers.\n\nCruz also took to Facebook this morning to slam the allegations.\n\n“These smears are completely false, they’re offensive to Heidi and me, they’re offensive to our daughters, and they’re offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack,” he posted.\n\n“Donald Trump’s consistently disgraceful behaviour is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow.”\n\nDespite his efforts the squash the story, the hashtag #CruzSexScandal has been the top trending hashtag on Twitter this morning, adding to the candidate’s woes.\n\nOver half a million tweets about the #CruzSexScandal.

I only speak to myself, however,” she wrote.\n\nMs Pierson has garnered the spotlight on a number of occasions during the presidential race for her choice of jewellery and incendiary remarks on abortion.\n\nEarlier Friday on CNN, Adriana Cohen of the Boston Herald, a Trump supporter, accused Cruz communications director Amanda Carpenter of being one of the women.\n\nCarpenter was on the air when Cohen made the accusation.\n\nCarpenter retorted that the story was “tabloid trash” and slammed Cohen for sliming her.\n\n“You should be ashamed for spreading this smut,” Carpenter said. “Donald Trump supporters should be held to account for it.”\n\nThe GOP presidential race became unusually personal this week after an anti-Trump group posted a campaign ad with near-nude photos of Trump’s wife, Melania, taken from a 2000 photo shoot for British GQ.\n\nTrump accused Cruz of having a role in the ad, which he denied.",
  "latent_3746": "In Hollywood, there are unforgivable crimes – performing at Donald Trump’s inauguration, for one. Making a serious movie about Christ’s passion and death, for another. But a powerful and celebrated 43-year-old director raping and sodomizing a 13-year-old? Not so much.\n\nRoman Polanski, now an octogenarian, has been on the lam from the U.S. for 40 years, and neither Poland nor France, where he has dual citizenship, will extradite the old rapist. But he’s been anything but ostracized by his peers. In 2003, he was treated to a standing ovation (led by kindness enthusiast and national conscience Meryl Streep) when he won the Oscar for directing The Pianist. Just last Wednesday, France’s National Film Academy announced it had named Polanski President of its annual Cesar Awards.\n\nBut it seems there are at least some “women’s groups” doing more than walking around in vagina suits. Some feminists and France’s women’s rights minister objected to giving Polanski the honor and Roman the Rapist is out.\n\n<<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>>\n\nStill, the wellsprings of support for Polanski run deep in Hollywood and elite media circles. Actress and The View yacker Whoopi Goldberg infamously defended Polanski because the incident wasn’t what she called “rape-rape.”\n\nBack in 2009, more than 100 entertainment figures signed a petition calling for his release (he was briefly arrested by Swiss authorities, who intended to send him to the U.S. to finally receive sentencing -- he originally fled the U.S. after his conviction but before sentencing). Among them were Martin Scorcese, Woody Allen, David Lynch, Wim Wenders, Pedro Almodovar, Tilda Swinton and Monica Bellucci. (Yes, that Woody Allen.)\n\nSo whether he returns somehow to the U.S. or dies “on the run,” as it were, we can expect more heartfelt Hollywood appreciation for the guy who gave a pubescent girl champagne and drugs, took naked pics of her and then sodomized her in a hot tub.

  "latent_3842": "rama June 21, 2016\n\nTags: Eat That Question: Frank Zappa In His Own Words, Moon Zappa\n\nI was fortunate enough to have recently interviewed Moon Zappa in honor of director Thorsten Schütte's documentary, \"Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in His Own Words\" which was about Moon's legendary father, the late great music icon, Frank Zappa. Those of us fans of cinema and TV would also recognize some of Moon Zappa's works in such gigs as \"National Lampoon's European Vacation\" and TV's \"High School USA.\"\n\nIn my conversation with Moon, I mostly wanted to know more about what it was like to be growing up with a father like Frank, and Moon was generous enough to answer my questions. Below is my entire interview with Moon Unit Zappa.\n\nRama's Screen: So if Frank was alive today, what would he say about this documentary? Because at the end of the film he himself said he didn't want to be remembered.\n\nMoon Zappa: \"I think he really would’ve enjoyed this film, while he may not have wanted to be remembered, I think what he was saying in that moment was that it didn’t matter; that it’s irrelevant if you are remembered or not. I think he was talking about the time that you are alive that matters. Because the time that you’re gone is for other people anyway. So it was not a goal.. it didn’t summarize him in some way if he was remembered or if he wasn’t remembered. Possibly he was afraid he wouldn’t be remembered I don’t know, but I think he would’ve really loved this film because one thing I know he wanted to be seen is as an American composer and I think Thorsten’s tells that story beautifully\"\n\nRama's Screen: I had a hard time growing up liking Frank's music mainly because it was so unconventional, he'd add in xylophone or flute, much of his composition sounded experimental, I admire that he was doing something unique and new and unlike anything every body else was doing, but his songs weren't your regular verse bridge chorus catchy songs, ya know, definitely not the kind that's easily marketable by record labels. So I guess my question is.. if he was around today, would his music find a place in today's generation that prefers Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez?\n\nMoon Zappa: \"I think that he probably would’ve had a lot of fun either spoofing it or if he enjoyed their work, he probably would’ve wanted them to come and do some kind of collaboration. He was a big fan of excellent musicians who took their job as musicians seriously but also could be playful and could improvise. I think he would get along with Justin Timberlake and possibly Beyonce.\"\n\nRama's Screen: This documentary doesn't have talking heads, it doesn't even feature you or any of Frank's loved ones talking about Zappa. Were you ok with that format?\n\nMoon Zappa: \"I think that’s an inspiring format, I had nothing to do with that decision-making, I think that was 100% Thorsten decision and I think there are many stories he could’ve told, but I think this story about Frank wanting to be understood as an American composer was a fantastic way to ground this journey and make it a human adventure that you’re watching. My mother was in charge of giving him the keys to the kingdom, I’m amazed that he pulled it off. That was 8 years it took him to.. I think two years was just asking her nicely and her saying maybe.\"\n\nRama's Screen: So you've seen the film?\n\nMoon Zappa: \"Yes, I’ve seen it four times now.\"\n\nRama's Screen: So seeing this docu film, when you were watching it, what sort of memories come rushing in? What does the film make you remember?\n\nMoon Zappa: \"It makes me remember how he smelled, especially when I see him with no shirt on and composer, I’m like ‘O, right, I remember that room, I remember how it felt to be in that room with him, I remember him smelling like winston cigarettes and kind of musky from not bathing because he was up working for many days in a row. It just reminded me of silly things in the house like we had this thing where we lower food down to the basement and then bring it back up and then there was like an intercom system throughout the house so you could always be hearing the music. You’d be trying to sleep or do your homework and you’d just be hearing this dissonant sound.\"\n\nRama's Screen: At one point in the film, Zappa said that his wife was the only one buying toys for the kids in the house. So is that correct? Was your mom the only one buying you guys toys?\n\nMoon Zappa: \"Ya, I’m trying to think, there were couple of things that he purchased, actually I have it on today, he gave me this little charm I wear around my neck. But ya, one of the things my mom liked to do was that she’d take tampon applicator and she’d wrap tinfoil around them and they become scuba gear for our dolls. She was crafty, a little MacGyverish that way, we had a lot of art supplies in the house, that was probably the thing we were most interested in, a lot of books. But he was just a presence in the house, a very strong presence. It’s so interesting to me that his presence lingers, such a big presence that even him not here, he’s still a presence, it’s fascinating.\"\n\nRama's Screen: I really loved the part where Frank strongly advocated against censorship. It seems that time and time again, there will always be those uptight ringt-wingers trying to bring us down. I went to Europe once and when I was there I thought America was the land of the free, but it felt so much more free there in Europe. Why do you think that is? What is your take on that?\n\nMoon Zappa: \"I don’t know but if you believe in reincarnation, I do think that it’s interesting that this man appeared on American soil to wake people up over here and that he was so much more well-received in Europe especially Eastern bloc countries where people there really valued freedom, they really understood it. We just take so many things for granted here, and it’s embarrassing and I think he was embarrassed by that, and he had no time for ignorance or for being wasteful with your time. He would not have been a Netflix guy, he would’ve been generating Netflix content. But ya, I think.. some of his ideas are just beginning to be.. we’re just getting to understand that a person like this existed and now be on the look out for even more of these kinds of people and his message is as strong now, even more important. You have to get out there, educate yourselves, vote, be reasonable, if we’re trying to keep this planet together, we don’t go plundering and harming other people. We’re really moving forward towards every man for himself kind of approach to living and that’s not what he would’ve wanted, it’s not sustainable, it’s not kind, it’s not smart.\"\n\nRama's Screen: Did Frank pass his musical talent down to you? Did you ever get bit by that musical bug? Are you a musician?",
  "latent_3858": "“There is no reason why LGBTQ people and their allies cannot be proudly Jewish and proudly Zionist. ” Journalist Mark Stern who writes for Slate, will be moderating the panel this Thursday for the LGBTQNZ Pride, Zionism, and Inclusivity in New York. Below, he talks about his reactions to the Dyke March fiasco and creeping anti-Semitism.\n\nJews who attended the Chicago Dyke March last June found themselves subjected to an unusual litmus test. Openly Jewish marchers were required to relinquish their “Zionist displays”—a category that included a Star of David on a rainbow flag—and repudiate all connections with the state of Israel. Jews who failed to pass this test were condemned and expelled. Dyke March organizers attempted to justify their actions by explaining in a statement that their “celebration of dyke, queer, and trans solidarity” could not tolerate “pinkwash[ing].”\n\nLike many LGBTQ Jews, I was both disturbed and puzzled by the Dyke March fiasco. How could any movement claim “solidarity” with the queer community, my community, while rejecting Jews like me? How could an ostensibly inclusive event eject participants on the basis of suspected Zionism? And how could the Dyke March deploy the term “pinkwishing,” a noxiously anti-Semitic trope that dismisses Israel’s commitment to LGBTQ rights as a cynical publicity stunt? This Thursday, I’ll be moderating a panel hosted by the World Jewish Congress and A Wider Bridge to explore these issues—and ask how we can challenge the growing hostility toward Jews within certain pockets of the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe Dyke March was not the first time that Jews have been singled out and excluded from an ostensibly progressive LGBTQ space. Anti-Semitism also tarnished 2016’s Creating Change conference, an annual gathering sponsored by the National LGBTQ Task Force. Creating Change brings together LGBTQ groups across the country, and the January 2016 conference was scheduled to include a presentation by A Wider Bridge and the Jerusalem Open House for Pride and Tolerance, an LGBTQ community center. But the Task Force canceled this reception shortly before the conference began, bowing to pressure from groups like the Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity, which demanded that the conference’s organizers “reject Zionism” and “the forces of oppression and occupation.”\n\nFollowing widespread outcry, the Task Force reinstated the event. But shortly after it began, a group of about 200 protesters marched through the conference and crashed the reception holding signs that read “Cancel Pinkwashing” and “Zionism Sucks.” Some participants allegedly used anti-Jewish slurs. The speakers from Jerusalem Open House were quickly escorted out, and the presentation was canceled.\n\nLet’s be clear: This is anti-Semitism. Protesters selected the most overtly Jewish presentation at the conference and shut it down because of its Jewish character. Their actions provided a clear illustration of how “anti-Zionism” has become a euphemism for anti-Semitism. At the heart of this protest lay chilling malice toward Jewish people and the Jewish state. Protesters combined outwardly anti-Semitic epithets with anti-Israel chants to create an environment in which Jews could not possibly feel safe. And this at a conference that purports to support “full freedom and liberation for LGBTQ people and allies.” Do LGBTQ Jews simply not count?\n\nUnfortunately, the Creating Change catastrophe was representative of a broader trend on the American left: The vilification of Israel—including progressive Israeli organizations and citizens—in the name of LGBTQ equality. It is a puzzling phenomenon. Israeli’s record on LGBTQ rights is not perfect, but it exceeds that of many Western nations, and all other Middle Eastern countries. The country’s dedication to LGBTQ equality should be recognized as a human rights victory. And yet, perversely, some activists cite Israel’s expansion of LGBTQ rights as a mark against the Jewish state. Why? Because, the theory goes, Israel is merely “pinkwashing,” passing and touting pro-LGBTQ laws to distract liberals from other policies to which they object.\n\nTo my mind, the version concept of pinkwashing draws on classic anti-Semitic tropes—conspiratorial Jews using insincere diversions to distract from their misdeeds. But leaving that aside, the practical effect of the pinkwashing fixation is to drive LGBTQ Jews out of LGBTQ spaces. According to this new dogma, support for Israel is mutually exclusive with support for human rights, including the equal dignity of gay and transgender people. Thus, all LGBTQ Jews must repudiate Israel in order to be authentically pro-LGBTQ.\n\nThat is dangerous, divisive nonsense. There is no reason why LGBTQ people and their allies cannot be proudly Jewish and proudly Zionist. These identities are not contradictory; they are complementary. Full equality for our community would require that many more countries adopt LGBTQ policies like Israel’s. Jews must not be compelled to renounce our principles in order to remain welcome in LGBTQ spaces. It is, after all, these principles that inspire us to fight for a more just and inclusive world.\n\nWe encourage you to continue this dialogue and attend Thursday’s event! Click here to RSVP.",

Desperate to regain his skills and the material luxuries they afford, he travels to the exotic city of Kamar-Taj, where he meets a guru known as the Ancient One, played by Tilda Swinton.

Read earlier stories in The Magic Compass about this film and watch the trailers by clicking HERE and HERE.\n\nCumberbatch is also slated to play a more down to earth magician in The War Magician. In this film he will play Jasper Maskelyne, an English magician that uses the principles of stage magic to defeat Nazis with magic tricks. Not only did Maskelyne influence the outcome of WWII but he developed warcraft magic whose principles are still in use today. The War Magician will be scripted by former Star Wars: Rogue One screenwriter Gary Whitta. This story was also previously released in The Magic Compass. CLICK HERE to read that story.\n\nWhy is Benedict Cumberbatch being cast in these magical roles? Is it because he is a versatile actor or is it because he is an actor that also does magic?

  "latent_4337": "Regenerative medicine researchers at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center have addressed a major challenge in the quest to build replacement kidneys in the lab. Working with human-sized pig kidneys, the scientists developed the most successful method to date to keep blood vessels in the new organs open and flowing with blood. The work is reported in journal Technology.\n\n“Until now, lab-built kidneys have been rodent-sized and have functioned for only one or two hours after transplantation because blood clots developed,” said Anthony Atala, M.D., director and professor at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine and a senior author on the study. “In our proof-of-concept study, the vessels in a human-sized pig kidney remained open during a four-hour testing period. We are now conducting a longer-term study to determine how long flow can be maintained.”\n\nIf proven successful, the new method to more effectively coat the vessels with cells (endothelial) that keep blood flowing smoothly, could potentially be applied to other complex organs that scientists are working to engineer, including the liver and pancreas.\n\nThe current research is part of a long-term project to use pig kidneys to make support structures known as “scaffolds” that could potentially be used to build replacement kidneys for human patients with end-stage renal disease. Scientists first remove all animal cells from the organ – leaving only the organ structure or “skeleton.” A patient’s own cells would then be placed in the scaffold, making an organ that the patient theoretically would not reject.\n\nThe cell removal process leaves behind an intact network of blood vessels that can potentially supply the new organ with oxygen. However, scientists working to repopulate kidney scaffolds with cells have had problems coating the vessels and severe clotting has generally occurred within a few hours after transplantation.\n\nThe Wake Forest Baptist scientists took a two-pronged approach to address this problem. First, they evaluated four different methods of introducing new cells into the main vessels of the kidney scaffold. They found that a combination of infusing cells with a syringe, followed by a period of pumping cells through the vessels at increasing flow rates, was most effective.\n\nNext, the research team coated the scaffold’s vessels with an antibody designed to make them more “sticky” and to bind endothelial cells. Laboratory and imaging studies -- as well as tests of blood flow in the lab – showed that cell coverage of the vessels was sufficient to support blood flow through the entire kidney scaffold.\n\nThe final test of the dual-approach was implanting the scaffolds in pigs weighing 90 to 110 pounds. During a four-hour testing period, the vessels remained open.\n\n“Our cell seeding method, combined with the antibody, improves the attachment of cells to the vessel wall and prevents the cells from being detached when blood flow is initiated,” said In Kap Ko, Ph.D., lead author and instructor in regenerative medicine at Wake Forest Baptist.\n\nThe scientists said a long-term examination is necessary to sufficiently conclude that blood clotting is prevented when endothelial cells are attached to the vessels.\n\nThe scientists said if the new method is proven successful in the long-term, the research brings them an important step closer to the day when replacement kidneys can be built in the lab.\n\n“The results are a promising indicator that it is possible to produce a fully functional vascular system that can deliver nutrients and oxygen to engineered kidneys, as well as other engineered organs,” said Ko.\n\nUsing pig kidneys as scaffolds for human patients has several advantages, including that the organs are similar in size and that pig heart valves – removed of cells – have safety been used in patients for more than three decades.\n\nThis study was supported, in part, by Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center at the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.\n\nCo-researchers were Mehran Abolbashari, M.D., Jennifer Huling, B.S., Cheil Kim, M.D., Ph.D., Sayed-Hadi Mirmalek-Sani, Ph.D., Mahmoudreza Moradi, M.D., Giuseppe Orlando, M.D., John D.

Obama picked him to lead the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), technically a national security post within the Department of the Treasury.\n\nMir was chairman of the organization from 2009 to 2014. During that time, he was instrumental in CFIUS’s decision to approve the sale of Uranium One to Russia’s agency Rosatom.\n\nRussian nuclear industry officials have been accused of engaging in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering to secure the deal in a scandal that has involved the State Department, the FBI, Department of Justice, the Clinton Foundation, and the Russian government.\n\nMir also played a key role in the Treasury Department’s refusal to investigate the UAE’s Gulftainer 35-year cargo container terminal lease at Port Canaveral, a critical military infrastructure facility for U.S. naval and space operations, the Center for Security Policy writes. Both decisions severely damaged United States national security.\n\nMir’s Islamist connections are troubling. The Islamic Society of North America is the largest Muslim advocacy group in the country, and a front group for Muslim Brotherhood. They are also unindicted co-conspirators in the 2008 Holy Land Foundation/HAMAS terrorism funding trial.\n\nFurther, Aimen Mir is the son of Kashmir-born physician Dr. Ghulam Nabi Mir, an ISNA Founders Committee member. Dr. Mir is also the president of the World Kashmir Awareness Forum (WKAF), an Islamic platform Dr. Mir uses to aggressively advocate for Kashmir’s secession from India in order to join Pakistan. WKAF’s Secretary General “Dr.” Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai, is a convicted felon, also from Kashmir, who served as a Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI) operativeinside the United States.\n\nIn 2011, Fai was arrested by the FBI for covertly operating as a foreign agent while receiving millions from the ISI. He used some of that money to fund an elaborate lobbying operation pushing Kashmiri “independence” on unsuspecting U.S. officials who remained seemingly unaware that Pakistan was running the operation.\n\nIn 2013, Fai was granted early release from U.S. federal prison by the Justice Department.\n\nLike his father’s ISI partner Fai, Aimen Mir appears to have been running his own operation at CFIUS. Aimen Mir was the CFIUS Staff Chairperson from 2009 until 2014. During Mir’s five years in the staff chairperson’s seat, CFIUS approved Russia’s 2010 purchase of Uranium One, effectively handing Vladimir Putin control of 20 percent of America’s uranium. Also during Mir’s term, the Treasury Department refused to conduct two legally-required CFIUS investigations of Port Canaveral’s 2014 container terminal lease concession to the UAE’s Gulftainer.\n\nThat deal placed some very nefarious people inside the workings of a national security-sensitive US port.\n\nThe Treasury Department promoted Aimen Mir to Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investment Security in 2014 after the Clinton Foundation-connected Uranium One and Gulftainer Port Canaveral deals closed. Mir’s LinkedIn profile and post-Trump administration inauguration posts show he’s still at the Treasury Department, now as a career civil servant.\n\nAnd now Mir is handing over America’s uranium resources to Vladimir Putin, and it was all arranged by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nEverything goes as planned.\n\nFacebook has greatly reduced the distribution of our stories in our readers' newsfeeds and is instead promoting mainstream media sources.

Each finalist was invited to the Agora Ballroom in Dallas to play for the grand prize, a new Dean ML. Abbott's mother had to accompany him to the club because he was not old enough to get in. A quiet, almost shy Darrell easily won the event. Months later, when the contest ran again, Darrell entered and won that contest also, causing the contest sponsors to ask him not to enter the next time so someone else could win.[9] He then sold the Dean ML guitar to luthier Buddy Blaze, who installed a Floyd Rose bridge and emblazoned it with Abbott's signature lightning bolt paint job; Blaze returned it some years later.[10] Coincidentally, his father had also bought him a Dean ML the morning before the first competition, but it had a cherry sunburst finish instead.[11] Abbott met his long-time girlfriend Rita Haney at a young age, when he was in third grade.[12]\n\nMusic career [ edit ]\n\nPantera [ edit ]\n\nAbbott formed Pantera in 1981 with his brother Vinnie Paul on drums. Upon forming, Abbott came up with the alias 'Diamond Darrell'.[13] The band was influenced by thrash metal acts such as Slayer, Megadeth, Venom, and Metallica as well as traditional metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Motörhead, and Judas Priest. With Rex Brown on bass and Terry Glaze on vocals, Pantera released three albums, Metal Magic (1983), Projects in the Jungle (1984), and I Am the Night (1985).\n\nShortly after singer Phil Anselmo joined Pantera, Darrell was invited by Dave Mustaine to join Megadeth. Darrell was willing to join, but on the condition that Mustaine also hire his brother Vinnie on drums. As Mustaine still had drummer Chuck Behler, Darrell decided to stay with Pantera.[14] With Anselmo on vocals, Pantera released their fourth album, Power Metal in 1988.\n\nPantera would go on to become a key formulator of the post-thrash subgenre of \"groove\" metal. In 1990, Pantera released their fifth album, Cowboys from Hell, which proved to be a crucial turning point towards major success. Pantera's \"groove\" style came to fruition when releasing their sixth album, Vulgar Display of Power, released on February 25, 1992, which saw the replacement of the power metal falsetto vocals with a hardcore-influenced shouted delivery and heavier guitar sound. Pantera's success rose to even better expectations when releasing their seventh album, Far Beyond Driven in 1994. Abbott, who had been listed on all prior albums under the aliases \"Diamond Darrell\", was listed as \"Dimebag Darrell\". On the night before Pantera's live appearance at the Monsters of Rock in England's Donington Park, the Abbott brothers got involved in altercations at a local club with journalists from magazines Kerrang! and Raw.[14] Despite the recent success, there were mounting tensions between band members, largely due to vocalist Phil Anselmo's rampant drug abuse. In 1996, Pantera released their eighth album, The Great Southern Trendkill. In 2000, the band released one more studio album, Reinventing the Steel.\n\nIn 2001, the group went on hiatus, during which time Anselmo worked on side projects, such as Superjoint Ritual and Down. This caused a rift within the band, as the Abbott brothers were kept waiting for Anselmo to become available to work with them again. Losing their patience with Anselmo, Pantera officially disbanded in 2003.[15]\n\nDamageplan [ edit ]\n\nAfter a year, the Abbott brothers formed Damageplan, a heavy metal band, which continued to feature the Pantera-style groove metal sound. They recruited former Halford guitarist Pat Lachman on vocals, and Bob Zilla on bass. Damageplan released its first and only studio album, New Found Power, in the United States on February 10, 2004, which debuted at No. 38 on the Billboard 200, selling 44,676 copies in its first week.[16] The song \"Ashes to Ashes\", a collaboration with Alice in Chains guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell, was not completed in time to be featured on the album,[17] but it was featured on the soundtrack to the 2004 film The Punisher, and was a bonus track on the Japanese version of New Found Power.[18][17]\n\nWhen writing music for the new group, Dimebag said that \"we wanted to stretch out and expand our capabilities to their fullest.\"[19]\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Loudwire, Vinnie Paul revealed that there are five unreleased Damageplan tracks that were meant for the band's second album that was set to be released in 2005, but that those tracks have no vocals, only Vinnie and Darrell are playing on them.[20] Vinnie said that he did not know what to do with those tracks, but he often thought about having some of Dimebag's favorite singers like Rob Halford of Judas Priest and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden to record vocals for the songs, but he did not have time to do it because he was focused on his band Hellyeah.[20]\n\nOther projects [ edit ]\n\nIn 1992, Pantera teamed up with Rob Halford (of Judas Priest) for a track called \"Light Comes Out of Black\". Darrell played all the guitar parts, Rex Brown played the bass, Vinnie Paul played the drums, Rob Halford sang lead vocals, and Philip Anselmo sang backing vocals. This song was released on the Buffy the Vampire Slayer soundtrack on July 28, 1992. In 1996, Darrell contributed the Ace Frehley song \"Fractured Mirror\" to the Ace tribute album Spacewalk: A Salute To Ace Frehley. Then, in 1997, a new Ace Frehley tribute album called Return Of The Comet: A Tribute to Ace Frehley was released. The Abbott brothers covered Ace's song \"Snowblind\" on track 7. On and off between 1996 and the formation of Damageplan, the Abbott brothers and Pantera bassist Rex Brown teamed up with country singer David Allan Coe for a project called Rebel Meets Rebel. The album was released May 2, 2006 on Vinnie's Big Vin Records label.\n\nDarrell played guest guitar solos on several Anthrax songs during their John Bush era: \"King Size\" and \"Riding Shotgun\" from Stomp 442, \"Inside Out\" and \"Born Again Idiot\" from Volume 8: The Threat Is Real, \"Strap It On\" and \"Cadillac Rock Box\" (with a voice intro from Dimebag as well) from We've Come for You All. In an interview, Anthrax bassist Frank Bello said \"Darrell was basically the sixth member of Anthrax\". Abbott also performed a solo on the title track of King Diamond's Voodoo album. A sample from a guitar solo by Abbott was used in the Nickelback song \"Side of a Bullet\", and he also played guitar on Nickelback's cover of Elton John's \"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\" along with Kid Rock.\n\nIn 1999, Pantera recorded a theme tune for their favorite ice hockey team, the Dallas Stars, called 'Puck-Off'. The song was eventually released in 2003 on the album 'Dallas Stars: Greatest Hits'. In 2000, Darrell played the guitar solo on Believer for the new Randy Rhoads tribute album. Vocals were by Sebastian Bach, rhythm guitars by Kane Roberts, drums by Michael Cartellone, and bass by Mike Bringardello. This was the only track that Darrell contributed to on this album.\n\nShortly before Darrell's death, he went into the studio with a band known as Premenishen to do a guest solo on a track titled \"Eyes of the South.\"[21] Darrell was also confirmed as one of the original guitar player choices for Liquid Tension Experiment by Mike Portnoy.[22] Darrell's musical roots were in country western music; he supported the local music scene in Dallas and sometimes recorded with local musicians. He played in a country band called Rebel Meets Rebel with country performer David Allan Coe.\n\nIn December 2006, a rare track of one of his collaborations was discovered. Darrell sat in on a recording session with local Dallas musician \"Throbbin Donnie\" Rodd and recorded \"Country Western Transvestite Whore\". It features Dimebag on lead guitar and lead vocals.[23] Darrell and his brother, Vinnie Paul, along with Rex Brown (during the Pantera Era) and Bob Zilla (Damageplan Era) performed at their New Years party every year under the name \"Gasoline\", originally the name of a group featuring Dimebag and Vinnie plus Thurber T. Mingus of Pumpjack. Stroker of Pumpjack also played with Gasoline on several occasions.\n\nDimebag, Vinnie, and Rex also recorded a cover of the ZZ Top song \"Heard It on the X\" under the band name \"Tres Diablos\" for ECW wrestling's Extreme Music soundtrack. In 2012, a previously unreleased track, \"Twisted\", featuring Dimebag on lead vocals and guitar, was used in a promotional video for Elephant Brand Skateboards's \"Dimebag Tribute Skateboard.[24] \"Twisted\" was also released as an MP3 download.[25]\n\nDeath [ edit ]\n\nA fan pays tribute at the Alrosa Villa, in Columbus, Ohio , three days after the murder.\n\nOn December 8, 2004, Damageplan was in the midst of the Devastation Across The Nation tour,[26] where the band performed at the Alrosa Villa, a large nightclub in Columbus, Ohio. A crowd of approximately 250 had watched four support acts (two local bands entitled Volume Dealer and 12 Gauge,[27] and the tour support Shadows Fall and The Haunted). Moments into Damageplan's set, 25-year-old former Marine Nathan Gale jumped onto the stage, drew his 9mm Beretta M9 and shot Darrell in the head five times. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Some in attendance initially believed the shooting was part of the act, but as Gale continued shooting, the audience quickly came to the realization that the event was not staged.[citation needed]\n\nFiring a total of 15 shots, Gale killed three other people and wounded seven more. Jeff \"Mayhem\" Thompson, the band's head of security, was killed trying to subdue Gale. Alrosa Villa employee Erin Halk was also killed. Audience member Nathan Bray was killed while trying to perform CPR on Darrell and Thompson. It was rumored that one crowd member leapt in front of the perpetrator, saving the lives of several band members.[28] Damageplan's drum technician, John \"Kat\" Brooks, was shot three times as he attempted to disarm Gale, but was overpowered and taken hostage in a headlock hold. Tour manager Chris Paluska was also injured in the process.\n\nResponding within three minutes to a 911 call made at 10:15 pm, seven police officers entered through the front entrance and moved toward the stage. Officer James Niggemeyer came in through the back door, behind the stage. Gale only saw the officers in front of the stage, but did not see Niggemeyer, who was armed with a 12 gauge Remington 870 shotgun, approaching him from the opposite side of the stage, past a group of security guards. Seeing Gale lift his gun to Brooks' head, Niggemeyer fired a single shot, striking Gale in the face, killing him instantly. Gale was found to have had 35 rounds of ammunition remaining.[29]\n\nEarly speculation about motive suggested that Gale, who was once a fan of Pantera, might have turned to violence in response to the breakup of the band, or the public dispute between Darrell and Anselmo, but these were later ruled out by investigators.[30] In VH1's documentary, Behind the Music, Damageplan's sound engineer, Aaron Barnes, stated that after shooting Dimebag, Gale was looking for Vinnie Paul,[31] possibly planning to murder him too. Another conjecture was that Gale believed Darrell had stolen a song that he had written.[32] This was not the first time that Gale engaged in onstage violence. About six months prior to the shooting, Gale got into an altercation at a Damageplan concert in Cincinnati in which he damaged $5,000 worth of equipment and had to be removed from the stage by security.[33] Darrell is buried beside his mother Carolyn and brother Vinnie at Moore Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Arlington, Texas.[34]\n\nInfluences and guitar skills [ edit ]\n\nAbbott once said in a Guitar World interview that \"if there were no Ace Frehley, there would have been no Dimebag Darrell\". Abbott bore a tattoo of the Kiss guitarist on his chest.[35] Frehley signed the tattoo in pen ink upon meeting him, at Dimebag's request, and the autograph was later tattooed over.\n\nAbbott stated in various interviews that his riffs were largely influenced by Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath.[36] Iommi also influenced Dimebag's guitar tone and tunings, which often went down to D♭ or lower. Pantera covered Black Sabbath songs \"Planet Caravan\", \"Hole in the Sky\" and \"Electric Funeral\". Eddie Van Halen was another big influence on his style. He learned \"Eruption\" note-for-note and often played it live in his early days.[37]\n\nPete Willis of Def Leppard was seen as another major influence for Darrell. In his Guitar World magazine tribute issue, Abbott was quoted as saying, \"Man, that first Leppard album really jams, and their original guitarist, Pete Willis, was a great player. I was inspired by him because I was a small young dude and he was a small young dude, too—and he was out there kickin' ass. He made me want to get out there and play. Def Leppard used the two-guitar thing much more back then than they do now.\"[38]\n\nIn the late 1980s, around the time of Power Metal, Abbott often covered songs by guitarist Joe Satriani, such as \"Crushing Day\". He also incorporated elements of Satriani songs like \"Echo\" into his live solos as well. Dimebag mentioned in an interview with Guitar World that the clean chord passages in the intro to \"Cemetery Gates\" were influenced by the clean chordal passages found in much of Ty Tabor's (King's X) playing. As with Billy Gibbons, Abbott frequently made use of pentatonic scales and pinch harmonics in both his leads and rhythms. Both guitarists employ blues scales, start / stop dynamics and pedal tones, as in Abbott's southern style riff in \"The Great Southern Trendkill\" and the main riff to ZZ Top's \"Tush\".\n\nRandy Rhoads-style chord arpeggios can be heard in much of Abbott's playing as well, noted examples being \"Floods\", \"Shedding Skin\", \"The Sleep\" and \"This Love\". Three of Abbott's solos were ranked in Guitar World magazine's Top 100 of all-time: \"Walk\" (No. 57), \"Cemetery Gates\" (No. 35), and \"Floods\" (No. 15).[39] Abbott stated that \"Eddie Van Halen was heavy rock and roll, but Randy was heavy metal\".[35]\n\nEddie Van Halen, whom Abbott had made friends with, placed his original black with yellow stripes guitar (commonly called \"bumblebee\") into the Kiss Kasket Abbott was buried in. Abbott had mentioned that those colors were his favorite combination, and Van Halen had agreed to craft a copy for Abbott only several months before his untimely death. However, upon hearing of the tragedy, he offered to place the original guitar in the casket. According to Darrell's girlfriend Rita, Van Halen stated: \"Dime was an original and only an original deserves the original!\"[40]\n\nAccording to an interview with Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, Abbott told him that during the recording of Reinventing the Steel he compared his guitar tone with Cazares's. Incidentally, during the making of Fear Factory's Demanufacture, Cazares compared his guitar tone to that of Vulgar Display of Power.\n\nAbbott made popular, and was one of the original users, of the \"Whammy Harmonic\" technique, which consisted of lowering the pitch of the strings with his Whammy Bar, using his left hand to create a harmonic, and then lifting the Whammy Bar again, beyond the strings' original pitch, to create a high pitched, screaming noise.\n\nEquipment [ edit ]\n\nGuitars [ edit ]\n\nA Dimebag Darrell signature guitar headstock\n\nAbbott's first guitar was a Les Paul copy by Hondo, and he began playing Dean Guitars in the early 1980s. His father bought him a cherry sunburst 1979 Dean ML in 1981 and later that day he won a burgundy ML in a guitar competition. He later sold this guitar to purchase a car. The guitar was subsequently heavily customized; the neck was re-shaped, a lightning bolt paint job was applied and a Floyd Rose tremolo system was installed. This guitar was later returned to Abbott as a gift, and became known as the \"Dean From Hell\", which he used from 1988 until 1994. He also played a sunburst ML customized to his own specs on Vulgar Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven. When Dean temporarily closed down, he collaborated with Washburn to recreate the ML body style. When the Washburn contract ended, he made arrangements to be the sole endorsee of the re-opened Dean. Abbott's death came shortly before the Dean contract was set to begin.\n\nSome of Abbott's other guitars included a blue Hamer ML, a white 1984 Dean ML and a red ML for the \"This Love\" video, and two Jackson Rhoads guitars.\n\nThe Dean From Hell guitar had Bill Lawrence pickups. The Seymour Duncan guitar pickup company made a signature pickup called the Dimebucker, modeled after the Bill Lawrence original L-500XL pickups.[41] After Dean guitars' demise in 1994 he signed with Washburn, going back to Dean again in 2004. He was buried with a Charvel guitar which was owned by Eddie Van Halen.\n\nAbbott co-designed a guitar with Dean just months before his death. Called the Razorback, it was a modified version of the ML. It was more pointed and had extra barbs on the wings. The design spawned variations, such as a 24-fret version, different paint jobs including a flamed maple top with natural finish and EMG pickups. He also helped design of the V-shaped version, the Razorback V (lacking the neck-pointing front wing).\n\nAbbott was a fan of Randall amplifiers, namely the Century 200 model head, of which he owned around 30. He used these amplifiers live as well as in the studio.\n\nAbbott was also known for using many effects, including the Digitech whammy WH-1, Rocktron Hush Noise Gates, several Dunlop Wah pedals including his signature model The Dime Crybaby From Hell and He was known for using MXR Six Band Graphic Equalizer pedals to achieve his heavily scooped guitar tone.\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nThe black ribbon sticker appearing on vehicles in honor of Dimebag Darrell\n\nAbbott was praised for his instrumental tone and was included in \"The 50 Greatest Tones of All Time\" by Guitar Player magazine.[42] Remembered for his amiable nature and rapport with fans, Abbott was described by AllMusic as \"one of the most influential stylists in modern metal.\"[43]\n\nLegacy [ edit ]\n\nThe book Riffer Madness was compiled from Abbott's frequent appearances in guitar magazines and in readers' polls, and from the long-running Guitar World magazine column that he wrote.[44] Ride For Dime Inc., a nationally registered 501(c)(3) charity, was formed in 2005. It hosts annual motorcycle runs and concerts, with all proceeds going to Little Kids Rock, and towards funding the Ride For Dime Scholarship Fund.[45][46] Ride For Dime is the only charity recognized and supported by the Abbott Estate.[47]\n\nDiscography and filmography [ edit ]\n\nAbbott performed on Anthrax albums, including Stomp 442 (1995); Volume 8: The Threat Is Real (1998); the Inside Out EP (1998) and We've Come for You All (2003). With Damageplan, Abbott played on the Devastation Sampler (2003) and on the album New Found Power (2004). With Pantera, Abbott recorded a number of albums, EPs, singles, and videos including Power Metal (1988), Cowboys from Hell (1990), Vulgar Display of Power (1992), and Hostile Moments (1994). He also recorded music under his own name, including the album Country Western Transvestite Whore and the song \"Caged in a Rage\" on the 1996 Supercop soundtrack, and he recorded an album with David Allen Coe titled Rebel Meets Rebel (2006).\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

With this game, its a hit or miss. Most people are to impatient and dont get to the main story before they quit, thus giving it a bad review. For a free game, it has excellent gameplay, gets updated often and has an amazing friendly atmosphere (unless its pvp, then the players can be a little toxic). You dont have to buy any thing extra to advance in the game, and anything on the zen market can be bought through in game currencies by the conversion system. I do recommend buying what you like through the market, as it is a free game with great game play. Nothing bought from the market will change end game in anyway, maybe fast exp but for the most part its either appearance items or another bag. End game is the most fun (in my opinon) but can get a tad bit repetitive, however if you're like me and dont mind grinding to get your character the absolute best it can be, then this game is for you!",

  "latent_4558": "\"Chutes and Ladders\" redirects here. For the song by Korn, see Shoots and Ladders (song)\n\nSnakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game regarded today as a worldwide classic.[1] It is played between two or more players on a gameboard having numbered, gridded squares. A number of \"ladders\" and \"snakes\" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped or hindered by ladders and snakes, respectively.\n\nThe game is a simple race contest based on sheer luck, and is popular with young children.[2] The historic version had root in morality lessons, where a player's progression up the board represented a life journey complicated by virtues (ladders) and vices (snakes). A commercial version with different morality lessons, Chutes and Ladders, is published by Milton Bradley.\n\nEquipment [ edit ]\n\nThe size of the grid (most commonly 8×8, 10×10 or 12×12) varies, as does the exact arrangement of the snakes and ladders, with both factors affecting the duration of play.[original research?] Each player is represented by a distinctly coloured game piece token. A single die is rolled to determine random movement of a player's token in the traditional form of play.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nSnakes and Ladders originated in India as part of a family of dice board games that included Gyan chauper and pachisi (present-day Ludo and Parcheesi). The game made its way to England and was sold as \"Snakes and Ladders\",[3] then the basic concept was introduced in the United States as Chutes and Ladders (an \"improved new version of England's famous indoor sport\"[4]) by game pioneer Milton Bradley in 1943.[5]\n\nGyan chauper/Jnan chauper (game of wisdom), the version associated with the Jain philosophy[6] encompassed the concepts like karma and Moksha.\n\nThe game was popular in ancient India by the name Moksha Patam. It was also associated with traditional Hindu philosophy contrasting karma and kama, or destiny and desire. It emphasized destiny, as opposed to games such as pachisi, which focused on life as a mixture of skill (free will[7]) and luck. The underlying ideals of the game inspired a version introduced in Victorian England in 1892. The game has also been interpreted and used as a tool for teaching the effects of good deeds versus bad. The board was covered with symbolic images, the top featuring gods, angels, and majestic beings, while the rest of the board was covered with pictures of animals, flowers and people.[8] The ladders represented virtues such as generosity, faith, and humility, while the snakes represented vices such as lust, anger, murder, and theft. The morality lesson of the game was that a person can attain salvation (Moksha) through doing good, whereas by doing evil one will inherit rebirth to lower forms of life. The number of ladders was less than the number of snakes as a reminder that a path of good is much more difficult to tread than a path of sins. Presumably, reaching the last square (number 100) represented the attainment of Moksha (spiritual liberation).\n\nWhen the game was brought to England, the Indian virtues and vices were replaced by English ones in hopes of better reflecting Victorian doctrines of morality. Squares of Fulfillment, Grace and Success were accessible by ladders of Thrift, Penitence and Industry and snakes of Indulgence, Disobedience and Indolence caused one to end up in Illness, Disgrace and Poverty. While the Indian version of the game had snakes outnumbering ladders, the English counterpart was more forgiving as it contained each in the same amount.[9] This concept of equality signifies the cultural ideal that for every sin one commits, there exists another chance at redemption.\n\nThe association of Britain’s Snakes and Ladders with India and gyan chauper began with the returning of colonial families from one of Britain’s most important imperial possessions, India. The décor and art of the early English boards of the 20th century reflect this relationship. By the 1940s, very few pictorial references to the Indian culture were found due to the economic demands of the war and the collapse of British rule in India.[10] Although the game’s sense of morality has lasted through the game’s generations, the physical allusions to religious and philosophical thought in the game as presented in Indian models appear to have all but faded. There has even been evidence of a possible Buddhist version of the game existing in India during the Pala-Sena time period.\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh, this game is popularly called Vaikunthapali or Paramapada Sopana Patam (the ladder to salvation) in Telugu.[5][10] In Hindi, this game is called Saanp aur Seedhi, Saanp Seedhi and Mokshapat. In Tamil Nadu the game is called Parama padam and is often played by devotees of Hindu god Vishnu during the Vaikuntha Ekadashi festival in order to stay awake during the night.\n\nIn the original game the squares of virtue are: Faith (12), Reliability (51), Generosity (57), Knowledge (76), and Asceticism (78). The squares of vice or evil are: Disobedience (41), Vanity (44), Vulgarity (49), Theft (52), Lying (58), Drunkenness (62), Debt (69), Murder (73), Rage (84), Greed (92), Pride (95), and Lust (99).[8]\n\nGameplay [ edit ]\n\nChutes and Ladders gameboard c. 1952. The illustrations show good deeds and their rewards; bad deeds and their consequences. Milton Bradleygameboard c. 1952. The illustrations show good deeds and their rewards; bad deeds and their consequences.\n\nEach player starts with a token on the starting square (usually the \"1\" grid square in the bottom left corner, or simply, off the board next to the \"1\" grid square). Players take turns rolling a single die to move their token by the number of squares indicated by the die roll. Tokens follow a fixed route marked on the gameboard which usually follows a boustrophedon (ox-plow) track from the bottom to the top of the playing area, passing once through every square. If, on completion of a move, a player's token lands on the lower-numbered end of a \"ladder\", the player moves the token up to the ladder's higher-numbered square. If the player lands on the higher-numbered square of a \"snake\" (or chute), the token must be moved down to the snake's lower-numbered square.\n\nIf a player rolls a 6, the player may, after moving, immediately take another turn; otherwise play passes to the next player in turn. The player who is first to bring their token to the last square of the track is the winner.\n\nVariations [ edit ]\n\nVariants exists where a player must roll the exact number to reach the final square. Depending on the variation, if the die roll is too large, the token either remains in place or goes off the final square and back again. (For example, if a player requiring a 3 to win rolls a 5, the token moves forward three spaces, then back two spaces.) In certain circumstances (such as a player rolling a 6 when a 1 is required to win), a player can end up further away from the final square after their move, than before it.\n\nIn the book Winning Ways the authors propose a variant which they call Adders-and-Ladders and which, unlike the original game, involves skill. Instead of tokens for each player, there is a store of indistinguishable tokens shared by all players. The illustration has five tokens (and a five by five board). There is no die to roll; instead, the player chooses any token and moves it one to four spaces. Whoever moves the last token to the Home space (i.e. the last number) wins.[11]\n\nSpecific editions [ edit ]\n\nThe most widely known edition of Snakes and Ladders in the United States is Chutes and Ladders released by Milton Bradley in 1943.[12] The playground setting replaced the snakes, which were received negatively by children at the time.[12] It is played on a 10×10 board, and players advance their pieces according to a spinner rather than a die. The theme of the board design is playground equipment, showing children climbing ladders and descending chutes.\n\nThe artwork on the board teaches morality lessons: squares on the bottom of the ladders show a child doing a good or sensible deed, at the top of the ladder there is an image of the child enjoying the reward; squares at the top of the chutes show children engaging in mischievous or foolish behavior, on the bottom of the chute the image shows the children suffering the consequences.\n\nBlack children were depicted in the Milton Bradley game for the first time in 1974.[12] There have been many pop culture versions of the game, with graphics featuring such children's television characters as Dora the Explorer and Sesame Street. It has been marketed as \"The Classic Up and Down Game for Preschoolers\". In 1999, Hasbro released Chutes and Ladders for PCs.\n\nIn Canada the game has been traditionally sold as \"Snakes and Ladders\", and produced by the Canada Games Company. Several Canadian specific versions have been produced over the years, including a version substituting Toboggan runs for the snakes.[13] With the demise of the Canada Games Company, Chutes and Ladders produced by Milton Bradley/Hasbro has been gaining in popularity.[citation needed]\n\nThe most common[citation needed] in the United Kingdom is Spear's Games' edition of Snakes and Ladders, played on a 10×10 board where a single die is used. Another early British version of the game depicts the path of a young boy and girl making their way through a cartoon railroad and train system.[13]\n\nDuring the early 1990s in South Africa, Chutes and Ladders games made from cardboard were distributed on the back of egg boxes as part of a promotion.[citation needed]\n\nEven though the concept of major virtues against vices and related Eastern spiritualism is not much emphasized in modern incarnations of the game, the central mechanism of Snakes and Ladders makes it an effective tool for teaching young children about various subjects. In two separate Indonesian schools, the implementation of the game as media in English lessons of fifth graders not only improved the students' vocabulary but also stimulated their interest and excitement about the learning process.[14][15] Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University found that pre-schoolers from low income backgrounds who played an hour of numerical board games like Snakes and Ladders matched the performance of their middle-class counterparts by showing improvements in counting and recognizing number shapes.[16] An eco-inspired version of the game was also used to teach students and teachers about climate change and environmental sustainability.[17]\n\nMathematics of the game [ edit ]\n\nThe cumulative probability of finishing a game of Snakes and Ladders by turn N\n\nAny version of Snakes and Ladders can be represented exactly as an absorbing Markov chain, since from any square the odds of moving to any other square are fixed and independent of any previous game history.[4] The Milton Bradley version of Chutes and Ladders has 100 squares, with 19 chutes and ladders. A player will need an average of 39.2 spins to move from the starting point, which is off the board, to square 100. A two-player game is expected to end in 47.76 moves with a 50.9% chance of winning for the first player.[18] Those calculations are based on a variant where throwing a six does not lead to an additional roll; and where the player must roll the exact number to reach square 100 and if they overshoot it their counter does not move.\n\nIn popular culture [ edit ]\n\nThe phrase \"back to square one\" originates in the game of snakes and ladders, or at least was influenced by it – the earliest attestation of the phrase refers to the game: \"Withal he has the problem of maintaining the interest of the reader who is always being sent back to square one in a sort of intellectual game of snakes and ladders.\" [19] [20]\n\nThe game is a central metaphor of Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children. The narrator describes the game as follows:\n\nAll games have morals; and the game of Snakes and Ladders captures, as no other activity can hope to do, the eternal truth that for every ladder you hope to climb, a snake is waiting just around the corner, and for every snake a ladder will compensate. But it's more than that; no mere carrot-and-stick affair; because implicit in the game is unchanging twoness of things, the duality of up against down, good against evil; the solid rationality of ladders balances the occult sinuosities of the serpent; in the opposition of staircase and cobra we can see, metaphorically, all conceivable oppositions, Alpha against Omega, father against mother.[21]\n\nOne episode of SpongeBob SquarePants, called \"Sailor Mouth\", features a parody of this game, known as \"Eels and Escalators\".\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nBibliography\n\nAugustyn, Frederick J (2004).

He has also played in the NBA for the Utah Jazz, Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks, New Jersey / Brooklyn Nets, Boston Celtics, Washington Wizards, and Phoenix Suns. Humphries played college basketball for the Minnesota Golden Gophers of the University of Minnesota, and for the United States men's national basketball team.\n\nEarly years [ edit ]\n\nHumphries was born in Minnesota to Debra and William Humphries. His father was a football player, at the University of Minnesota.[2] Humphries is half African-American from his father.[3] He has two older sisters, Krystal and Kaela. His first success in sports came in competitive swimming, where he was the top 10-year-old in the nation in six events, first, beating young Michael Phelps in the remaining events. Kris Humphries held the US national record for the 50-meter freestyle for 10 and under boys for 18 years until it was recently broken.[4] At age 12 he gave up swimming to pursue a career in basketball.\n\nHumphries attended Hopkins High School, where he led the team to a 25–2 record in 2002 and its first Minnesota state championship in 49 years.[2] He was named a 2003 McDonald's All-American and named Second Team All-USA by USA Today.[5] He was also named to the Super 25 Basketball Team by USA Today, named Minnesota Mr. Basketball, and state player of the year by the Minneapolis Star Tribune and College Basketball News.[5] He was one of 10 finalists for the 2003 Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award, averaging a double-double in his final three seasons, averaging 25.7 points, 11.4 rebounds and 5.0 assists a game as a senior.[5]\n\nConsidered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Humphries was listed as the No. 2 power forward and the No. 15 player in the nation in 2003.[6]\n\nHumphries accepted a scholarship offer to Duke University, but later reconsidered and chose the University of Minnesota.[7]\n\nCollege career [ edit ]\n\nAt Minnesota, Humphries was named 2004 Big Ten Freshman of the Year and named to the All-Big Ten First Team by the media and coaches. He was named Honorable Mention All-America by the Associated Press and by Rivals.com. He was the first freshman to lead the Big Ten in scoring and rebounding in the same season. He scored in double figures in all 29 games, with 16 point/rebound double-doubles on the season for Minnesota. He averaged 21.7 points and 10.1 rebounds (both tops in the Big Ten), while shooting .444 percent from the field and .742 from the line. On February 18, 2004 he set a school record with 36 points in a game against Indiana. He also set a school record for most points by a freshman for a season with 629 and was the first Big Ten freshman to be named conference Player of the Week in two of the first three weeks of the season. Humphries only played one season for Minnesota before declaring for the NBA Draft.\n\nAlthough Humphries was personally successful at Minnesota, the team struggled. The Gophers finished 12–18, with a 3–13 record in the Big Ten during Humphries' lone season, tying Penn State for the worst record in the conference.[8] Critics accused Humphries of playing selfishly, preferring to inflate his statistics and NBA draft stock rather than help the team win games.[9] The team had a .500 record before his arrival and finished with a 10–6 conference record in the season after he left.\n\nProfessional career [ edit ]\n\nUtah Jazz (2004–2006) [ edit ]\n\nHumphries was drafted by the Utah Jazz with the 14th overall selection in the 2004 NBA draft.[10][11] He spent two seasons with the Jazz, averaging 3.6 ppg and 2.7 rpg in 11.6 minutes per game.[12]\n\nToronto Raptors (2006–2009) [ edit ]\n\nOn June 8, 2006, Humphries was traded along with Robert Whaley to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Rafael Araújo.[13] In the 2006–07 season, after a slow start in which he did not receive many minutes from Raptors coach Sam Mitchell, Humphries proved to be a valuable rebounder and energy player and contributed to the Raptors capturing their first ever division title.[14] On March 28, 2007, he grabbed seven offensive rebounds in 27 minutes against the Miami Heat, both a game-high[15] and a career-high.[16] He followed up this performance with nine offensive and 18 total rebounds in a win against the Detroit Pistons on April 13, 2007, again both game and career-highs.[17][18] Humphries concluded his inaugural season with the Raptors with a career-high 3.1 rpg and .470 field goal percentage, as well as 3.8 ppg.[12]\n\nDallas Mavericks (2009–2010) [ edit ]\n\nOn July 9, 2009, Humphries, Shawn Marion and Nathan Jawai were traded to the Dallas Mavericks as a part of the four-team deal among Raptors, Mavericks, Orlando Magic and Memphis Grizzlies.[19]\n\nNew Jersey/Brooklyn Nets (2010–2013) [ edit ]\n\nOn January 11, 2010 the Mavericks traded Humphries along with G/F Shawne Williams to the New Jersey Nets in order to re-acquire Eduardo Nájera.[20] On January 27, 2010, Humphries scored a career-high 25 points against the Los Angeles Clippers. He previously recorded career highs of 15 and 21 points respectively as a New Jersey Net.[citation needed] The 2011 season was a breakout season for Humphries as he averaged a double-double in points and rebounds. On December 21, 2011, Humphries signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the New Jersey Nets.[21]\n\nOn July 17, 2012, Humphries signed a two-year, $24 million contract with the Nets, who by that point had moved to Brooklyn.[22]\n\nBoston Celtics (2013–2014) [ edit ]\n\nOn June 27, 2013, ESPN.com reported that the Nets and Boston Celtics had worked out a trade that would send Humphries and four other players (Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Joseph and Gerald Wallace) as well as three future first-round draft picks to Boston in exchange for Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Jason Terry as well as D. J. White.[23] The deal was finally completed on July 12, 2013.[24]\n\nWashington Wizards (2014–2016) [ edit ]\n\nHumphries warming-up with Wizards in November 2014.\n\nOn July 19, 2014, Humphries was acquired by the Washington Wizards in a sign-and-trade deal that sent a protected 2015 second round pick and a trade exception to the Boston Celtics.[25] On October 9, 2014, he underwent successful surgery to repair nerve damage in his right small finger, and was subsequently sidelined for three to four weeks.[26]\n\nOn November 14, 2015, Humphries made 5-of-8 three-pointers on his way to a game-high 23 points, helping the Wizards defeat the Orlando Magic 108–99. Prior to the 2015–16 season, Humphries had gone more than a decade since making a three-pointer. He hit two in his 2004–05 rookie season, and none after that, until this game.[27]\n\nPhoenix Suns (2016) [ edit ]\n\nOn February 18, 2016, Humphries was traded, along with DeJuan Blair and a 2016 protected first round draft pick, to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Markieff Morris.[28] He made his debut for the Suns the following day in a 116–100 loss to the Houston Rockets, recording 18 points and 12 rebounds in 27 minutes off the bench, becoming the 13th Suns player to have a double-double in his debut.[29] On February 28, after three starts in four games, he was waived by the Suns in a buyout agreement.[30]\n\nAtlanta Hawks (2016–2017) [ edit ]\n\nOn March 1, 2016, Humphries signed with the Atlanta Hawks.[31] Three days later, he made his debut for the Hawks in a 106–77 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, recording 14 points, eight rebounds, one steal and one block in 22 minutes off the bench.[32]\n\nOn July 15, 2016, Humphries re-signed with the Hawks.[33]\n\n2017–18 season [ edit ]\n\nOn September 25, 2017, Humphries signed with the Philadelphia 76ers[34] but was waived on October 14, 2017, as one of the final roster cuts.[35]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nHumphries began dating reality TV personality Kim Kardashian in October 2010. They became engaged in May 2011,[36] and married on August 20, 2011.[37] A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a \"media blitz\" related to the wedding.[38] On October 31, 2011, it was announced that Kardashian had filed for divorce from Humphries after 72 days of marriage.[39][40] On December 1, 2011, Humphries filed his response to Kardashian's petition, requesting an annulment on the grounds of fraud or a decree of legal separation rather than Kardashian requested divorce.[41] Several news outlets have surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt for financial gain orchestrated by E! Entertainment, Kris and Kim Kardashian to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.[42] In April 2013, after a lengthy legal battle, Humphries and Kardashian reached a divorce settlement.[43] Their divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013.[44]\n\nNBA career statistics [ edit ]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high\n\nRegular season [ edit ]\n\nPlayoffs [ edit ]\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2007 Toronto 6 0 11.5 .333 .000 .375 2.8 .2 .2 .3 1.5 2008 Toronto 3 0 0.7 .000 .000 .000 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 2013 Brooklyn 7 0 11.9 .452 .000 .429 3.3 .1 .1 .4 4.4 2015 Washington 1 0 5.0 1.000 .000 .000 3.0 .0 .0 .0 2.0 2016 Atlanta 4 0 14.0 .464 .500 1.000 6.0 1.0 .5 1.3 9.3 2017 Atlanta 1 0 3.0 .000 .000 .000 0.0 .0 .0 1.0 0.0 Career 22 0 9.9 .449 .500 .571 3.0 .3 .2 .5 3.6\n\nInternational career [ edit ]\n\nHumphries was on the 2002 U.S. Junior World Championship Qualifying Tournament Team, alongside future Raptors' teammate Chris Bosh.[5] The team finished with a 4–1 record and the bronze medal and qualified for a berth in the 2003 FIBA Junior World Championship.[2] Humphries averaged 9.0 ppg and 5.0 rpg in five games.[2]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

  "latent_4652": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade. Citing rising employment and economic activity, the central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise its target for the federal funds rate (the rate that banks pay to loan each other money overnight) to between 0.25 and 0.5 percent. Interest rates across the economy are expected to climb along with it.\n\nThis may not sound significant, but the Fed’s interest rate decisions have a huge impact on the American and global economies. The rate is one of the main mechanisms that the Federal Reserve uses to cool the economy and quell inflation. The last time the Fed raised it was in 2006. Then came the housing market crash, the Great Recession, and the Fed’s unprecedented response: nine years of near-zero rates aimed at spurring economic growth.\n\nA growing contingent of influential economists believe that it is too soon to take moves that will slow economic growth, arguing that raising rates now will do the most damage to those who can least afford it: the poor and minorities. They say the Fed should only step in when there are clear signs of rising inflation, the traditional trigger for tightening monetary policy, which hasn’t happened yet.\n\nThe decade of near-zero interest rates have brought the economy into such unfamiliar territory, however, that other economists say we can’t predict the consequences of this move by the Fed. “The environment we’re in is just so out of the range of our models that we are a bit in the dark,” says Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nThe one point everybody agrees on is that while the impact of this first hike may be minor, Yellen has indicated that more may follow and those will shift gears in the American economy. Everyone will be affected, with some clear winners and losers.\n\nThe big winners are likely to include:\n\nThe financial sector: Big banks and financial institutions have already seen a bump from the anticipated rate hike. Banks typically benefit from rising rates, because that means they are able to lend at higher long-term interest rates while borrowing at lower short-term ones. The financial sector also benefits from hard-on-inflation policies, since high inflation erodes the value of their investments. “Unexpected increases in inflation are wealth transfers from creditors to debtors,” explains Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the progressive Economic Policy Institute. “The finance sector really, really dislikes unexpected inflation.”\n\nPeople with savings in the bank: Ralph Nader recently published a condescending letter that he wrote Yellen, urging her to raise rates for the sake of “the savers of America.” (Yellen responded with her own letter defending the Fed’s policies). Nader was onto something though: An extended period of low rates hits hardest ordinary people who keep their savings in bank accounts. With interest rates near zero, their savings stagnate. But there’s a twist. The very poor are generally unable to save much, which means that they don’t have much to lose. People with significant savings tend to put their money in the stock market, which has soared over the past few years.\n\n“If you’re talking about people that have any significant savings at all—more than $5,000 or $10,000—they’re not keeping it in a checking account, they’re doing things like putting it in stock and bonds. And the price of stocks and bonds have actually been driven higher by the Fed’s policies,” says Bivens.\n\nSmall businesses (maybe): This seems counterintuitive. After all, “cheap money,” or low interest rates, are supposed to benefit borrowers. But since the financial crisis, big banks have all but cut off lending to small businesses. The lack of bank loans has pushed small business owners into the open arms of non-bank lenders, who charge far higher rates. (The Wall Street Journal cites a lender that charges 39 percent, as opposed to the 5 percent to 6 percent a bank would charge.) Some commentators have pointed out that higher rates could encourage banks to loosen their purse strings.\n\nBut at the same time, small businesses will be among the first to suffer if domestic demand drops—and some are worried that this could happen with higher interest rates. The Fed is betting that the economy is strong enough, but only time will tell.\n\nThe economy as a whole (maybe): The big question mark is whether so-called bubbles are already forming in some areas of the economy. There is no agreement on this point, but cheap debt historically encourages a rapid rise in prices in certain sectors followed by a sudden drop, which is what happened when the bubble “burst” in the housing market during the Great Recession. Some economists are worried that we could make the same mistake again. Calabria from the Cato Institute, explains that even though he has been arguing in favor of a rate hike for several years, he is concerned about this rate hike and the implications for “financial stability.” The discussions about it remind him of those from 2003 and 2004, before the last crisis. Some economists see a bubble growing in the housing market, while others, including former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, have sounded alarms about a potential bubble in the bond market.\n\nThe losers include:\n\nLow-wage workers and the unemployed: Many pro-rate hike economists point to the unemployment rate as a reason to support the Fed’s move. The economy has been steadily adding jobs in recent months—including 211,000 in November—and unemployment, now at 5 percent, has returned to pre-recession levels. The point of low rates is to create jobs, so with unemployment down, some say the Fed has already done its job.\n\nBut although unemployment has dropped, underemployment—or the rate of people working in jobs that don’t match their skill level or working part time when they would prefer to work full time—is still high at 9.9 percent, according to Jared Bernstein, former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden. What’s more, wages are rising well below target levels.\n\nSome economists argue that it’s worth keeping rates low until their benefits spread to a greater number of low-income workers. “If [this hike] sets off a too-steep series of interest rate increases, I think the big losers are the literally couple of a million Americans who would not have jobs 12 to 18 months from now…and really tens of millions of Americans who will have slower wage growth over that time if we restrict economic growth too much,” says Bivens. Another argument for keeping rates low is that high employment disproportionately benefits black workers, who have been hit the hardest by the past two recessions.\n\nEmerging markets: Developing economies such as Russia, Turkey, and Brazil may also take a hit from the rate hike. By attracting investors to the United States with higher returns, the Fed’s rate hike is expected to strengthen the dollar relative to other world currencies. For the many companies in emerging markets who have taken out dollar-denominated debt, this could be a major problem; they will have to pay more on their loans even as their own countries’ currencies remain weak. International investors are already expected to pull more than $500 billion out of emerging markets this year, making 2015 the first year in nearly three decades that more money has left emerging markets than entered them.\n\nExporters: The United States is tightening monetary policy just as the European Union, Japan and China move in the opposite direction, which will make the dollar even more attractive to foreign investors. A stronger dollar would push up the price of US exports, leaving some American companies at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nTaxpayers: Finally, raising rates will push up one cost we all share—the cost of servicing government debt. Borrowing costs will rise along with interest rates, which will make it just that much harder for the government to close its deficit.",

The team conducted their research by selecting 135,000 randomly chosen participants – 19,000 of whom had used psychedelic drugs, including LSD and psilocybin, the active ingredient in shrooms.\n\nThe study found no evidence of a link between mental health issues and use of psychedelic drugs. “Over 30 million U.S. adults have tried psychedelics and there just is not much evidence of health problems,” said Johansen. He acknowledged that those who used the drugs were still susceptible to mental health issues (and not immune from having bad trips), but no more than anyone who had not tried psychedelics.\n\nIn fact, the study’s co-author Teri Krebs revealed that using psychedelic drugs is often much less dangerous than using other legal substances. “Drug experts consistently rank LSD and psilocybin mushrooms as much less harmful to the individual user and to society compared to alcohol and other controlled substances,” said the neuroscientist. In addition, “many people report deeply meaningful experiences and lasting beneficial effects from using psychedelics,” said Krebs.\n\nMost psychedelic drugs have been illegal in the U.S. since President Nixon signed the Controlled Substances Act in 1970. LSD and shrooms come under a further restricted category that prohibits not only their sale and consumption, but also their use in medicine. In the wake of relaxed marijuana laws around the country, some are wondering if the time has also come to alter the strictures around psychedelic drugs.\n\n“Concerns have been raised that the ban on use of psychedelics is a violation of the human rights to belief and spiritual practice, full development of the personality, and free-time and play,” said the study’s authors.",

  "latent_5161": "Barry Bonds\n\nFollowing the federal indictment of Barry Bonds for perjury and obstruction of justice last week, media reports cited the baseball player’s refusal to “admit that steroids contributed to his swollen head and bloated physique,” and drew a line from his alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs to his “noticeably bigger” skull. Can doping really make your head get bigger?\n\nYes, but steroids can’t. Although much of Bonds’ testimony dealt with anabolic steroids, he is also charged with having lied about taking human growth hormones. And HGH can indeed affect the size of your noggin. The hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland, normally stimulates bone and tissue growth throughout the body. If there’s too much of it, the body starts to develop an abnormal amount of flesh and bone. This affects the entire body to some degree, but in some places the chemical receptors tend to be especially sensitive. In an adult, very large doses of HGH can cause the skull to thicken and the forehead and eyebrow ridge to become especially prominent. Hands and feet also grow out of proportion with the rest of the body.\n\nAlmost all adults with this condition, called acromegaly, have a tumor in the pituitary gland, and the changes happen so gradually that they might only notice after looking at themselves in an old photograph. If a patient is young enough that his or her bones are still growing, exposure to all that HGH will result in gigantism, the condition that Andre the Giant is believed to have had. But adults that develop acromegaly get thicker, not taller, with the most striking changes usually in the head, hands, and feet.(One book about Bonds claimed that his hat size grew from 7⅛ to 7½, a difference of about an inch in circumference, and that his shoe size shot from 10½ to 13. Bonds has countered that nothing’s changed, saying in one interview, “My head hasn’t grown. I’ve always been a 7¼ to a 7⅜ my whole career.“)\n\nWhat about anabolic steroids? They don’t give you a big head, but they might make you a bit more like a woman—a bald woman. The body converts a portion of anabolic steroids, which are synthetic forms of testosterone, into estrogen, which causes breast enlargement. Researchers also believe that huge doses of testosterone can cause testicles to shrink by one-quarter or one-third of their original size. And anabolic steroids, like testosterone, can cause hair loss.\n\nGot a question about today’s news?

  "latent_5164": "A few years ago, I wrote about the raid on Geraldine and Caroline Burley for the Huffington Post:\n\nWhen Caroline Burley, now 51, first heard the boom around 5:30 on the evening of June 13, [2007] it sounded like it had come from outside her bedroom window. She rushed to investigate, and as she came out of the room, a man with a gun confronted her, threw her into a wall and then hurled her to the floor. A SWAT team had burst through her front door. Wearing only her nightgown, she asked for mercy. She recently had back surgery, she explained. Instead, one officer, then another kept her close to the floor by putting a boot in her back, according to court filings. Caroline’s mother, Geraldine Burley, was sitting at her computer in the basement when she heard a loud thud overhead, followed by a scream from her daughter and a man’s voice ordering Caroline Burley to the floor. When she ascended the stairs, she too found a gun pointed at her head, and a man ordered her to get on the floor as well. She thought at first that she was being robbed. Geraldine, now 70, pleaded with the man to let her move to the floor slowly, explaining to him that she’d had both of her knees replaced. Instead, another officer approached, grabbed her by the face, demanded that she “get the [f–––] on the floor,” then threw her into a table. She tumbled to the ground. At that point, she said later in a deposition, everything turned to “a fire, white and ringing in my ear.” Another officer came up from the basement with her grandson, stepping on her knees in the process. She cried out again in pain.\n\nThis was part of Operation Eight Mile, a three-day period in 2007 in which drug cops from 21 federal, state and local police agencies conducted hundreds of raids on the famously crime-ridden road. (For all that manpower, the raids didn’t turn up much: 50 ounces of marijuana, 6.5 ounces of cocaine and 19 guns.) The Burleys tried to get the officers’ names and badge numbers to file a complaint. This presented a problem:\n\nAccording to the Burleys’ accounts, the officers who raided their home were clad in black. Some wore balaclava masks or face shields that hid all but their eyes. Others pulled their hats down low to shield their identities. They had also obscured their names and badge numbers. Once the Burleys’ house had been thoroughly searched, both women asked the officers for their names. After holding an impromptu meeting, the officers told the Burleys that they wouldn’t divulge any information that could identify them individually. Instead, they told the women that they had just been raided by “Team 11.” The women weren’t given a search warrant.\n\n“Team 11” didn’t actually exist. It was part of a Drug Enforcement Administration squad called “Team 6.” But for the Eight Mile operation, the team was partially split up and reorganized with members of state and local police agencies, then renamed just for that particular operation.\n\nThe whole affair was coordinated by the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office. When the Burleys asked the office for the names of the officers who raided their home, the office said it had no record of that raid, directing them instead to the DEA. The DEA told the Burleys that the agency was transitioning to a new administration and couldn’t respond, but that it would eventually get back to them. It never did. The Burleys finally filed a lawsuit in state court, which forced the Wayne County Sheriff’s Department to give them the records of the raid that the office previously said didn’t exist. Included in those records was a DEA report with the names of the agents who participated in the raid.\n\nFor their lawsuit, the Burleys sent the named agents questionnaires. The agents filled them out, denying that they ever violated the women’s civil rights. But notably, none of the agents denied that they had participated in the raid.\n\nThat all changed during depositions for the lawsuit. In what came as a complete surprise to the Burleys’ attorneys, every agent named in the report denied participating in the raid. Instead, they claimed that “Team 11” had actually been split into two on that particular day. One team raided the Burleys, while the other raided a home nearby. The agents claimed that the DEA report must have included the names of the wrong half of “Team 11” by mistake. They were all in the other house.\n\nSo the Burleys’ attorneys did what you’d expect them to do: They deposed the other half of the team. You probably know where this is going. All of those agents also claimed to have been in the other house. No one denies that the Burleys were raided. No one denies that one half of “Team 11” conducted that raid. But both halves of “Team 11” insist it was the other half that was in in the Burleys’ home. Deputies from the Wayne County Sheriff’s Department were also on the raid, but apparently stood outside the home while the DEA agents did the dirty work. Yet none of the deputies on the Burley raid could remember which DEA agents were with them.\n\n“It’s one of the most bizarre things I’ve ever seen,” Burley attorney Stanley Okoli told me a few years ago. “I asked, ‘which amongst you went to one address?’ and they said they couldn’t remember. So I asked, ‘which amongst you went to the other address?’ and they said they couldn’t remember.”\n\nTo file a civil rights lawsuit against law enforcement officers, you need to know the names of the actual officers. The courts won’t allow you to file a civil rights claim against a police or government agency in general. By the time the DEA agents sprang their surprise on the Burleys, the statute of limitations on their lawsuit had nearly run out.\n\nThe Burleys filed their lawsuit anyway, hoping they could persuade a court to compel the DEA to name the officers who participated in the raid. It just got worse from there:\n\nIn June 2012, U.S. District Court Judge Bernard Friedman first dismissed the Burleys’ claims against Wayne County, then preempted a jury verdict in the trial against the federal agents. He ruled that, given the evidence, no reasonable jury could find in the plaintiffs’ favor, and in addition ordered the Burleys to pay the DEA agents $5,000 to compensate them for court costs. “These women are destitute,” Okoli told HuffPost. “That was completely discretionary. He didn’t have to do that.” Because the women couldn’t pay, the government moved to garnish their Social Security disability checks to cover the fine.\n\nThe following year, a panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the dismissal of the sheriff’s deputies from the lawsuit, but reinstated the claims against the federal agents and vacated the order for the Burleys to pay court costs. The panel found that “the agents’ intent to conceal contributed to the plaintiffs’ impaired ability to identify them.”\n\nThe problem: The appeals court did not require the DEA to produce a definite list of names of the agents who participated in the raid. The Burleys’ lawsuit was reinstated, but they were also right back where they started.\n\nOkoli welcomes the Sixth Circuit’s decision. But he said that, in addition to having to go before Friedman — who appeared hostile to his clients’ case — again, the Burleys are at even more of a disadvantage than they were in the first trial. The agents and their attorneys are now aware of inconsistencies the first trial exposed in their stories, and can attempt to explain them away. “We lost that element of surprise,” Okoli said.\n\nBack before Judge Friedman, the Burleys argued the second time around that the burden of producing the real officers’ identity should fall on the officers named in the report, not the Burleys. They cited a case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had taken that approach in ruling on an unlawful arrest lawsuit. In that case, police in San Francisco arrested a woman at a protest but refused to give their names or badge numbers. In her lawsuit, she named all the officers on the arrest report (in San Francisco, police policy is apparently to name all the officers on the scene in an arrest report). Because neither the officers nor the city would name the officers involved in the arrest, the court shifted the burden to the city to prove that the arrest was lawful.\n\n“This minimal burden shifting forces the police department, which is in the better position to gather information about the arrest, to come forward with some evidence of probable cause. . . . By shifting the burden of production to the defendants, we prevent this exact scenario where police officers can hide behind a shield of anonymity and force plaintiffs to produce evidence that they cannot possibly acquire.”\n\nBut the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, of course, has no authority over a district court in the Sixth Circuit. Judge Friedman rejected the burden-shifting argument. So the Burleys had to argue that the police officers named in their lawsuit violated their rights based only on a DEA report that the officers themselves claim was in error. Because the women themselves never saw faces, name tags or badge numbers, it was a hopeless fight. Friedman did at least let this trial go to the jury, but the jury acquitted, finding that the Burleys hadn’t proved that the agents named in their lawsuit were the agents who conducted the raid.\n\nThe Burleys appealed again. Last week — nearly nine years after the raid — a panel of Sixth Circuit appellate judges shot them down. Like Friedman, the panel rejected the burden-shifting argument. Here was their reasoning:\n\nUnder plaintiffs’ proposal, a law officer who raises an “I wasn’t there defense” can only avoid constitutional liability by mustering evidence of who was there instead, and by implication, who was responsible for the alleged excessive force. In other words, once a plaintiff has put forth some evidence of an officer being present at a raid in which a constitutional violation has allegedly occurred, that officer is presumed to be liable if he claims he was not there, unless he proves who was and who did it.\n\nThat’s a fair point. But the Burleys didn’t create this problem; the DEA did. In a criminal context, it makes sense to put the burden of proof on the prosecution. But this is a civil case, and the defendant is basically the government. These women were wrongly raided by federal cops. The women’s inability to name the federal cops involved is due to those agents concealing their identities after the raid, then what was either gross incompetence or — more likely — corruption and cover-up by those federal cops and/or the agency that employs them. The law requires the Burleys to identify the cops by name. The government refuses to do so. The panel is right that this presents a legal conundrum. Someone was going to get a raw deal in this ruling. But why should it be the Burleys?\n\nIt’s worth noting that there are some fictions at work here, too. The Burleys are required to identify the police officers individually, but it’s almost certain that if they were identified and found to have violated the Burleys’ constitutional rights, they’d be indemnified by the DEA. Any award would be paid by taxpayers. Treating the officers as individuals requires the plaintiff to find their identities and assign and prove each violation. You can’t simply sue the DEA or your local police agency after a botched raid and say, “My rights were violated by your officers.” It’s not an insignificant task, given that these raids are often done at night and are designed to confuse and disorient their targets. Yet in the rare event that a plaintiff wins, the officers are treated not as individuals, but as agents of the agency that employs them. (This does make it easier for plaintiffs to collect. But the dichotomy is interesting.)\n\nThe Sixth Circuit panel did express at least a little sympathy for the Burleys:\n\nWe do not condone the behavior of those individuals who perpetrated the alleged excessive force. We are cognizant of the fact that at this juncture our decision leaves plaintiffs without a remedy because all other defendants (state, county, and local) have been dismissed. However, at the second trial, plaintiffs had the opportunity to present evidence as to why they believed these federal defendants participated in the raid and committed excessive force. The jury simply did not credit their evidence when they found to the contrary.\n\nBut the reason the Burleys proceeded with those agents is because those were the only names they were given. Not only was time running out for them to find the real names, but there’s also no indication that the DEA would ever have produced them, no matter how long the statute of limitations. (This, of course, assumes that the agents named in the lawsuits were telling the truth about not participating in the raid — not at all a given.)\n\nThese kinds of raids are inherently violent, dangerous and volatile. The drug war also operates on dirty information — tips collected from informants, anonymous sources, even rival drug dealers. The rewards for drug cops who bust major drug operations can be significant — prestige, career advancement, seizure of money and property that goes back to the police department. Massive undertakings like Operation Eight Mile are particularly fraught with the potential for mistakes. When you’re conducting hundreds of raids at once, there’s less time to do the necessary follow-up, corroborating investigation and double-checking to make sure there’s probable cause for each raid and that each raid is carried out at the correct address.\n\nIt’s critical that there be some pushback to ensure quality control — to give police an incentive to go out of their way to make sure innocents aren’t subjected to these tactics. (I’d argue that these tactics are inappropriate for drug searches in general, but that’s another matter.) The Exclusionary Rule is a (somewhat weak) incentive to make sure that there’s real probable cause and that searches are conducted legally. But that rule doesn’t protect innocent people. The only policy protecting them is a civil rights lawsuit. You could make a good argument that this Sixth Circuit panel just gave police a pretty good template to avoid these sorts of lawsuits, at least in raids involving multiple police agencies: Conceal your identity from everyone, then create a bureaucratic morass that makes it nearly impossible for any potential litigants to figure out who you are.\n\nThe beef here isn’t only with the Sixth Circuit panel. (As if often the case, from my reading, the ruling was probably correct under the law, although one can envision a legally justifiable ruling for the Burleys as well.) What about the DEA? It’s been nine years now. Why hasn’t the DEA made an effort to identify the agents who raided the Burleys? Why is the agency ducking accountability and denying the Burleys a real day in court? Is the DEA’s official position here that the Burleys are lying about ever being raided? That’s certainly the implication — if none of the “Team 11” agents admit to participating in the raid, then they’re basically claiming that the raid never happened. What about U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade? Is she comfortable allowing the DEA to operate in her district this way?\n\nAs for the rest of us, are we really ready to just be okay with the idea that masked, heavily armed agents of the government can break down a door, terrify two innocent women, leave without presenting a warrant, their names, their badge numbers or revealing their faces … and get away with it?\n\nThe same year the Burleys were raided, the conservative pundit Michael Ledeen put up a short post on the Pajamas Media site that has always stuck with me. (The post is no longer up, but I excerpted it at the time.) A news agency had just released a series of photos about a drug bust in Tehran. Ledeen, who was agitating for war with Iran at the time, wrote:\n\nTerrifying pictures, to be sure. For me, the most revealing thing about them is that the police feel obliged to wear masks while conducting a drug bust in the capital. tells you something about the relationship between the people and the state.\n\nYes. It certainly does.",

We were in Denver for a month, and then Telluride, then Boulder, then Aspen, and it was just so stunning and majestic and rustic. We all pretended we were cowboys at one point, and the food was epic and the mountains were insane. We got to fly fish and horseback ride and so much more. It was just amazing.”\n\nTom had this to say when it came to what to expect this season. “A little snow. A little weather. It’s a great season, it’s a little different than most. The chefs this season are the last of the molecular-gastronomy phase and the chefs are doing more comfort food and more back to basic cooking which is pretty cool to see.”\n\nHe revealed that Last Chance Kitchen is back and there will be something Olympic-related for the upcoming season. He also joked that the chefs wouldn’t be skiing for their ingredients like they did in the final episodes of Top Chef: Dallas.\n\nOne of Tom, Padma and Gail’s favorite challenge this season revolves around the chefs going camping. “It was crazy,” Gail exclaimed. “We set up this camping challenge in the middle of May, and it snowed a foot and a half the night before while the chefs were sleeping in this state park. And then, they had to cook in a foot and a half of snow with very little implements so that was definitely the most challenging challenge that they did.”\n\nTom, Padma and Gail pretty much were all in unison that their favorite season so far was the one they won their Emmy for- Season 6 in Las Vegas.

The team is currently 4-0 to start the season, and co-captain Chad London joined Casey Light of Mile High Sports to discuss their hot start, as well as what to expect down the road.\n\nAfter finishing as champions the past two seasons in the Pacific Rugby Premiership, the Raptors are now competing in the Major Rugby Championship this season. With four straight wins, including three straight 50-point performances to start the campaign, London doesn’t feel the competition has changed too much since they changed leagues, and thinks the Raptors have done a great job of playing to their strengths, sticking with what works.\n\n“We have a specific style of play that we’ve always tried to obtain,” said London. “It’s just been something that we’ve always done since I’ve been part of the Raptors.”\n\nAll sports teams in Colorado know the biggest advantage they have doesn’t come from a player, scheme or game plan. Altitude has always been an issue for visitors, which is why the Raptors direct so much attention towards being in better shape than their opposition, capitalizing off the opponent’s fatigue and blowing them out late in games.\n\n“First of all, we’ve been working quite a lot on our fitness. We’ve been trying to blow teams away in the second half. As you know, with the altitude, that kind of plays into our favor,” said London.\n\nWith long-time Raptors strength and conditioning coach Dave Williams being named head coach for the current season last November, some may be surprised by the Raptors’ dominant start thus far. London and his teammates feel the transition was very smooth, and have nothing but good things to say about their coach.\n\n“It’s actually been really great. All the boys on the team respect him, have a lot of good things to say about him.”\n\nThe popularity of rugby is rapidly growing in America, and the Glendale Raptors and their world-class facility, Infinity Park, have a lot to do with it. Another step has been taken towards bringing rugby to the top of American sport popularity, as the Raptors, along with other teams across the country, now have some players making rugby their full-time jobs; dedicating themselves fully to the game.\n\n“It just allows the guys not to worry about all those extra things, like paying rent and finding jobs and things like that, it just allows them to focus solely on playing rugby and get better at playing rugby,” said London.\n\nThe Raptors must keep their foot on the gas headed into their next game against Rugby Utah, who were the USA Rugby Club 7s National Champions last season. London expects it to be a fast-paced, physical game with potential for a lot of scoring, stating “a lot of teams that come out of Utah are always very big and physical.”\n\nThe two will face off at Infinity Park in Glendale, Colorado on Saturday, March 11, 2017 at 3 p.m.\n\nListen to the full interview with Chad London, including his thoughts on his time with the Denver Stampede, in the podcast below.\n\nImage courtesy of the Glendale Raptors/Twitter",

  "latent_5957": "Interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose says it's \"shameful\" that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pulling back from the combat mission against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, even as the United States lauds the new Canadian contribution.\n\nThe Alberta MP said Trudeau's plan to pull CF-18 fighter jets back from the region by Feb. 22 was tantamount to surrendering Canada's role in the fight against global Islamic terrorism.\n\n\"Mr. Trudeau likes to say 'Canada is back,' when in fact we are stepping back,\" Ambrose told reporters in Moncton, N.B.\n\n\"Every ally in the fight against ISIS has stepped up their military efforts in the bombing mission, and Canada is now, today, ending our combat role against what is the most heinous terrorist organization we've seen in my generation.\"\n\nThe interim Conservative leader pointed to the extremist group's rampage through Iraq and Syria, its enslavement of women and children and its \"barbaric\" treatment of gay and lesbians as proof that ISIS is the \"greatest threat to human rights in the world.\"\n\n\"Mr. Trudeau doesn't think its our fight,\" Ambrose said. \"If he doesn't think that we should use our military against this group, I don't know when he thinks we would ever use our military. It's shameful, it's absolutely shameful.\"\n\nConservative Leader Rona Ambrose condemns Justin Trudeau's decision to end the bombing mission against ISIS. 2:14\n\nThe prime minister announced Monday that while Canada's role in the bombing campaign would end, that contribution would be supplanted by a much larger contingent of military trainers on the ground and an increase in the number of Canadian military personnel overall.\n\nCanada will also provide hundreds of millions of more dollars in humanitarian aid for the region to help Syrian refugees fleeing the horrors of the civil war that has beset their country.\n\nTraining boost 'great call'\n\nSteve Day, the former top commander of Canada's elite JT2 special operations force, was broadly supportive of Trudeau's move, saying the Liberals are on the \"right track.\"\n\n\"I think [the new mission] will make a significant difference because you are tripling the capacity of that training mission and, for the long-term win, you need to build that indigenous [Iraqi] capacity and capability. Tripling the training mission is a great call.\n\nPulling the CF-18s fighters is a loss of capability for the coalition, Day conceded, but \"if the calculation is less aircraft equals more trainers, then OK, I can understand that logic.\"\n\nDefence policy expert Michael O'Hanlon discusses how Canada's new plan to fight ISIS may impact coalition partners 9:13\n\nTrudeau tried to preempt criticism of his plan Monday, saying his government would not resort to hyperbole in its fight against the terrorist group.\n\n\"Call us old fashioned, but we think we ought to avoid doing what our enemies want us to do. They want us to elevate them, to give into fear, to indulge in hatred, to eye one another with suspicion and to take leave of our faculties. The lethal enemy of barbarism isn't hatred, it's reason,\" the prime minister said.\n\nAmbrose said those remarks are a display of Trudeau's naïveté.\n\n\"I think it's dangerously naive. I don't know what else to call it. This is a group of people that enslave women and children, that throw gay people off of the top of rooftops to their death and that burn people alive in cages.\n\n\"There's no reasoning with terrorists of this kind, that's why it's important to send a very clear signal that we are willing to do what it takes to fight a threat of this nature,\" Ambrose said in a later interview with Rosemary Barton on CBC News Network's Power & Politics.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday that Canada will pull back its CF-18 fighter jets from Iraq and Syria, while tripling the number of special operations forces training Iraqi troops on the ground. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\n'Open-ended combat' mission\n\nThe New Democrats took a much different tack Monday, raising red flags about potential mission creep as the number of military trainers increases.\n\n\"We are concerned that the Liberal government has chosen to place Canadian Forces personnel deeper into an open-ended combat military mission in Iraq,\" the NDP's foreign affairs critic, Hélène Laverdière, said in a press release Monday.\n\n\"The Liberals are tripling the size of so-called advisers to the Iraqi military, with some forces working in a 'battlefield context' and others working to 'enhance in-theatre tactical transport.'\n\n\"[The] Liberals promised to end the Conservative government's mission and said we need a clearer line between combat and non-combat. Today's announcement actually blurs these lines even more,\" Laverdière said.\n\nInterim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose responds to the government's plan to change Canada's role in the fight against ISIS 11:58\n\nU.S. applauds\n\nWhile the Conservatives slammed the move, the United States, which is leading the coalition against ISIS, said Monday it supported the Liberals' mission shift, calling it a model for other countries looking to take the fight to ISIS.\n\n\"The Canadian announcement is the kind of response the secretary's been looking for from coalition members as the United States and our coalition partners push to accelerate the campaign against [ISIS],\" Peter Cook, a Pentagon spokesperson, said on behalf of U.S. Defence Secretary Ash Carter.\n\nThe U.S. official seemed to reject the assertion that air bombings alone are what is required to defeat ISIS in the region.\n\n\"It is not all aircraft, there are a host things other countries could do that we think would further this effort and Canada is an example of a country that is adjusting its contributions in very specific ways that will certainly help the coalition moving forward,\" Cook said.",
  "latent_6048": "Photo: AP\n\nMultiple outlets are reporting that former CIA agent and conservative strategist Evan McMullin is launching an independent presidential bid in the hopes of siphoning votes from the Trump campaign.\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed’s McKay Coppins, McMullin’s bid is supported by “key players in the GOP’s anti-Trump movement,” and appears designed to split off votes in states like Idaho, Texas and Utah, where McMullin was born and went to college, and anywhere else Gary Johnson had a shot at picking up a few votes.\n\nMcMullin, the 40-year-old chief policy director of the House Republican conference, has never held political office. A graduate of Brigham Young University and the Wharton School of Business, McMullin’s brief bio also includes a Mormon mission and stints in the CIA and Goldman Sachs. At the time the BuzzFeed story went to press, he had just 135 followers on Twitter (that number has since jumped to 1,752.)\n\nAccording to ABC, his bid was arranged by the anti-Trump group, Better for America, which spent months searching for an appropriate candidate and is prepared to back him financially. They are also reportedly prepared to give legal cover in states like Texas, where he might have to sue to get on the ballot at such a late stage in the election.\n\nMcMullin is not the first unknown conservative to have his name floated as a potential challenger to Trump—we have Bill Kristol to blame for that—but according to BuzzFeed, McMullin will file his papers today around noon. BuzzFeed also reports McMullin will have “the backing of serious Republican donors and fundraisers” to help him mount a challenge to Trump in several key states.\n\nMcMullin appeared to confirm the rumors to ABC in an exclusive statement, pretending his candidacy is anything other than a way to push Trump down in conservative states:\n\n“In a year where Americans have lost faith in the candidates of both major parties, it’s time for a generation of new leadership to step up,” McMullin said. “It’s never too late to do the right thing, and America deserves much better than either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton can offer us. I humbly offer myself as a leader who can give millions of disaffected Americans a conservative choice for President.”",
  "latent_6078": "? A tax exemption enabling business owners to pay no state tax on business income is a boon to many Kansas lawmakers.\n\nNearly 70 percent of lawmakers or their spouses own a business or property that allows them to benefit from the exemption, according to an analysis from The Wichita Eagle.\n\nTo determine whether lawmakers qualified, The Eagle reviewed the statements of substantial interest for all 165 lawmakers, another 50 legislative candidates and all six state executive officers. The Eagle also checked the Secretary of State’s business database and conducted numerous interviews with lawmakers to determine how businesses were organized and whether they qualified for the exemption. The actual tax returns are not public.\n\nThe analysis found that those with the potential to take advantage of the law include 35 of 40 state senators and 79 of 125 state representatives. Gov. Sam Brownback, who championed the 2012 law, also stands to benefit, along with the lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state and insurance commissioner.\n\nThe law exempts the owners of limited liability companies, S-corporations, limited partnerships, family farms and sole proprietorships from paying state income tax on their non-wage business income. The law also extends to other sources of pass-through income, such as rents, royalties and trusts.\n\nThe tax exemption has come under increasing scrutiny as the state has struggled with budget shortfalls in recent years. Since the tax cuts went into effect, the state has cut its budget multiple times and increased the sales tax in 2015. Attempts in the Legislature to roll back the exemption fell short of passage the past two years after the governor promised to veto the bills.\n\nBrownback wouldn’t discuss his family’s taxes when asked at the Capitol last month. But his spokeswoman, Eileen Hawley, said it is a benefit for the state to have business owners involved in decisions about tax policy as members of the Legislature.\n\n“They understand the real implications of tax policy for their fellow citizens and we welcome their expertise as business people and policy makers,” she said.\n\nBut readers who asked The Eagle to look into the lawmakers’ business holdings said having so many lawmakers potentially benefiting from the law presented a troubling conflict of interest.\n\n“It certainly raises questions about whose interests they’re representing: their own personal interests or the public,” said Steve Kimball, a 72-year-old retired teacher from Belle Plaine. “That raises an eyebrow.”",
  "latent_6112": "At Thursday's UFC 158 press conference, Nick Diaz intimated on more than one occasion that his Saturday night opponent, Georges St-Pierre, is using performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nSt-Pierre brushed aside the accusations. But just in case anyone thought Diaz was kidding around, the former Strikeforce welterweight champion reiterated his claims on a radio interview Thursday afternoon.\n\nSpeaking on Toronto's Fan 590, Diaz stated that not only is the UFC welterweight champ using steroids, but he doubts that anyone is actually going to test the fighters after the fight.\n\n\"I believe that he's on plenty of steroids and I don't believe they've tested him as well,\" Diaz said. \"I don't care what they're saying or marketing to the media. I don't think either of us are going to be tested. And if so, he's probably got a bottle of piss in his pocket. I doubt they're standing over him, making sure he's not on steroids.\"\n\nAsked by the hosts, Tim Micallef and Sid Seixeiro, if he really meant what he just said, Diaz followed \"Sure, why not? Lance Armstrong is on steroids, and it was really a ridiculous thing that he was on steroids, as far as he was concerned.\"\n\nWhile never testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs, Diaz has twice been suspended by the state of Nevada for having marijuana metabolites show up in sufficient amounts in urine tests. Even with Dana White saying Thursday that he'd probably have to cut Diaz if Diaz again came up positive, the challenger wouldn't guarantee he can pass the test this time.\n\n\"Hell no, I'm not guaranteeing anything,\" Diaz said. \"Last time I was -- nanograms -- I tested positive. Dude, a nanogram. I'm like two over, a nanogram over. So, yeah, I can tell you I did a little better than last time, so if I don't pass the test, I'm sorry. But, you know, I could probably use another year off vacation, you know, it's not like I enjoy this, taking punches to the mouth. I need to feed my family, and hopefully one day I can acquire, if I survive this s***.\"\n\nThe steroid speculation was one of just a variety of topics discussed in the interview. Another tangent ensued after the hosts asked Diaz whether the UFC wants him to lose Saturday night. In his own unique way, Stockton's favorite son managed to tie the question in with both the advertising done by food conglomerations and the UFC's marketing of Rich Franklin.\n\n\"I would imagine that they do,\" Diaz said about whether the company wants him to lose. He paused and laughed, then added, \"I think the UFC wants me to lose the fight, especially the way they've been marketing this. And you know, it's not [the fans'] fault. It's not their fault, they are educated, but they're educated on what's been marketed to them. Just like any company does. Just like any foods they market, they advertise, and there's a certain amount of money that goes out, to make sure this money does its job, and you better believe it's going to work. That's why there's fat people, because they ate it right up, and it was bulls***, and it was poison, and they need to start learning marketing and advertisements.\"\n\n\"That's what I learn from this sport, that's what this sport's taught me.\" Diaz continued. \"Look at what happened to Rich Franklin. He goes in there and he's a schoolteacher. He goes in there with Anderson Silva and he's way behind there, but they marketed him as the best fighter. They marketed that and people believed it, they ate right up, they bet on him.\"\n\nDiaz concluded the interview by saying he'll always fight for what he believes is right.\n\n\"I may not be able to keep fighting for money for a living, but I will always have to fight for my dignity, because that's who I am. I will always tell the truth. I will always tell the fighters out there and the martial artists. I'll never sell you a handful of wolf tickets that you're going to go home, feed your family, and poison them, and poison their future. It's not, it's, morally it's just not me. I don't think Georges is a bad guy. I don't. I think he's a good guy, I don't think he deserves anything bad, I think he's a nice guy. I think he just put himself in a stupid position to sell this fight.\"",

The tryout is an attempt to stay in game shape and hope he can pique the interest of an NHL side looking to improve their goaltending.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHere's Bryzgalov's quote, via the Wranglers:\n\nStory continues\n\n“[Wrangers head coach and GM] Mike Madill’s passion for the game, his team, and his excitement about training camp were a big part of the reason why I chose to participate in the Wranglers training camp,” said Bryzgalov. “Having missed camp this year, an experience like this is critical for me to be ready for NHL play, and I can’t wait to get on the ice. Everyone’s motivation here is largely driven by an unparalleled passion for the game, and this will offer me a very interesting perspective and be a great opportunity for me to reflect on why I started playing this great game in the first place. It’s going to be something very special, and I expect I will learn as much from this experience as any other I have had in my career.” “To be clear, I intend to return to the NHL, and to be ready for game action when an NHL opportunity opens up. I intend to work hard while I am here in Las Vegas, and to return the support I have received from my family, the many fans who have reached out to me with words of encouragement, and the Wranglers organization with actions, not words. This is a unique opportunity for me to be an example to my own children, to the young fans who have supported me, to my new teammates, and eventually to the NHL teammates who will come to rely on me again,” said Bryzgalov.\n\nBryz won't talk again until after training camp.\n\nThere was talk that the Pittsburgh Penguins were interested in the 33-year old goaltender, but those were rumors shot down, for the time being at least.

  "latent_6552": "Big Love, which spurred a lot of pre-emptive worry in the Mormon church before it premiered, is now being criticized for a scene in Sunday’s episode that depicts a certain sacred church ritual, apparently for the first time on TV. HBO, in response, has issued one of those I’m-sorry-if-you-feel-that-way apologies but will air the episode as is.\n\nThe subject of the flap is the re-creation of an endowment ceremony, a ritual affirmation of faith which is allowed only to be witnessed by church members in good standing. Why this differs from numerous other pop culture depictions of sacred ceremonies—say, the famous baptism scene in The Godfather—appears to depend on the church tradition of keeping the ceremony closed to outsiders. (The producers say they relied on extensive research, including the accounts of an ex-Mormon, to re-create the ceremony.) But as the Salt Lake Tribune notes, some church members disagree among themselves on how secret the ceremony should be.\n\nAll this circles back to the eternal question: how obligated are outsiders to follow the traditions of a religion they don’t belong to?\n\nReligious traditions about representation are often strict and absolute—that, in part, is the point of them. Like dietary laws or other religious-cultural traditions, they serve to keep the group cohesive by drawing bright lines between it and outsiders.\n\nThe question is—as with the controversy over cartoons of Mohammed, which broke Islamic rules against depicting the Prophet—why and when people outside the religion should be expected to stay within those bright lines.\n\nNow, as a wholly secular person—and a Big Love fan—I may be too biased on this for my opinion to even matter. To me, the issue is execution. I think artists should be able to depict Mohammed; but to do it only to provoke people and prove you can, with no greater point, is still obnoxious. Likewise, if Big Love portrays the ceremony in such a way that it thoughtfully serves its characters’ stories—which, as a fan of the show, I’d expect it to do—then I’d say it’s justified. But I wouldn’t expect LDS church members to agree with me.\n\nBut that’s the problem when art meets religion: agreeing to disagree has its limits when you’re dealing with absolutes of faith. So far the official church, while disapproving the episode, has pointedly not called for boycotts or other action, mirroring the mostly low-key approach it took to the debut of Big Love. Back then, a major concern in the church was that the series would make today’s LDS Mormons look like polygamists and erase the distinctions between mainstream Mormonism and the fundamentalists. But the series—in which the intense rifts between those groups is a major and constant issue—has done anything but that.\n\nNow, I’m sure the LDS church would not like how some of its members—like starchy hypocrite Ted—are portrayed, but it’s not as if Roman Grant and company are a picnic, either. And in any case, I’d argue you’d have a hard time watching the show regularly and not realizing that the LDS church and the compound fundies are far, far different entities.\n\nThe fact is, if dealing with religion in art or entertainment required treating it only in ways that most members of that religion would approve of, it would be hard to treat religion substantively at all. Who’s to draw the line between respect and offensiveness? Who’s to say they can’t exist in the same work?\n\nMaybe the best example of that was the South Park episode on Mormonism, which treated the religion searingly—mostly, by literally dramatizing its actual founding story. And yet—after Stan rejects a new Mormon kid in town because he finds his religion ridiculous—it ends by giving the kid what is, by South Park standards, a powerful and even moving last word on tolerance:\n\nMaybe Joseph Smith did make it all up. But I have a great life. And a great family. And I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don’t care if Joseph Smith made it all up. Because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that’s stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you’re so high and mighty you couldn’t look past my religion and just be my friend back. You’ve got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls.\n\nI’m guessing the Big Love episode will have a different tone, but still. I’ll be curious to see what the church has to say about the episode after it airs, if any of its representatives end up watching.",

Bernie Sanders for president.\n\nTom Duane, the former Manhattan state senator and city councilman who was known as the first out HIV-positive elected official in the country, announced today he is backing Mr. Sanders, the Vermont independent. In a statement sent by the Working Families Party, which also recently endorsed Mr. Sanders, Mr. Duane said the self-described democratic socialist is “giving voice to people who are pushed aside and left out in a democracy.”\n\n“He’s mobilizing unprecedented enthusiasm, and he’s doing it by telling the truth, just as he has for his entire career,” Mr. Duane said. “I am excited to have the opportunity to endorse Bernie Sanders, because I have long admired him. I know there are deep wells of support for Senator Sanders among progressive voters across New York.”\n\nMr. Duane’s successors on the city level don’t feel the same way. The aforementioned Ms. Quinn is backing Ms. Clinton, the front-runner for the nomination, and Councilman Corey Johnson, who now represents the same West Side neighborhoods Mr. Duane once did, also endorsed Ms. Clinton, a former New York senator.\n\nBut there are progressives in New York City, particularly in more affluent neighborhoods where Mr. Sanders has long been a liberal icon, that may throw Mr. Sanders some votes.

State Senator James Sanders of Queens (no relation) did post photographs of himself and the Vermont senator on Facebook, leading some politicos to speculate that he would want to serve as a delegate for Mr. Sanders.

  "latent_7161": "8 Questions We Still Have About Thor: Ragnarok By Adam Holmes Random Article Blend There's less than two months to go until the release of Thor: Ragnarok, which looks like it could be one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's craziest movies yet. While Chris Hemsworth's God of Thunder has most recently appeared in Avengers: Age of Ultron and the Doctor Strange mid-credits scene, it's been nearly four full years since his last solo movie, Thor: The Dark World, was screened in theaters. As Marvel has shown in the previews, Ragnarok will blend the Asgardian/Nine Realms mythology that the first two movies appropriately leaned on with the cosmic weirdness that has been the bread and butter of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. The Thor: Ragnarok marketing campaign will soon be kicking up a few notches to tease even more of the movie's content. But as we continue to count down the days until we can see Thor and his allies prevent all of Asgardian civilization from being destroyed, here are the questions that we're still wracking our brain about over the upcoming MCU feature. What's Happening With Odin? To be fair, part of the question has already been answered. After disappearing towards the end of Thor: The Dark World, we've since learned that Odin was banished to Earth without his abilities. Without the All-Father around, Loki was free to impersonate his dad and rule Asgard as he saw fit. However, as was teased in the Doctor Strange mid-credits scene, the beginning of Thor: Ragnarok will see Thor and Loki looking for Odin with Doctor Strange's help, and we assume they'll eventually find him wandering the streets of Manhattan as a homeless guy. But from there, it's unclear how Odin fits into the story. Anthony Hopkins hasn't shown up in any of the previews released so far, so what's happening with him? Will he get his mighty abilities back, return to Asgard and lead the fight against Hela? Or will the Asgardian goddess of death eliminate him before he's able to return to full power? Whatever the explanation, I can't help but feel that the future doesn't bode well for Odin. Why Was Valkyrie Banished? Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie was originally part of an elite group of troops put together by Odin to defend Asgard from extreme threats, including Hela. However, judging by the snippets shown of this conflict in the Thor: Ragnarok trailers, battling the goddess of death doesn't end well for these soldiers, and it's possible Valkyrie was the only one who made it out alive. When we meet Valkyrie in the present day, she'll be working as a bounty hunter for Grandmaster after years in exile from Asgard. The big question is, why did Odin banish her? Was he disappointed that she failed to stop Hela, and banishment was her punishment? Or is there another reason the All-Father took such harsh action. Once Thor and Valkyrie are on good terms, maybe she'll be willing to shed light on the matter. Why Is Loki Hanging Out With Grandmaster? Thor and Loki have had their differences over the years, but they'll have to put those aside at the beginning of Thor: Ragnarok when they go searching for Odin. Now here's where things get confusing. Sometime early in the movie, Hela will destroy Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, and somehow ensure that he's trapped on Sakaar. Evidently Loki is able to track down his brother, as he's seen in the Thor: Ragnarok teaser trailer sitting in Grandmaster's luxury bx to watch the clash between the God of Thunder and Hulk. But why is Loki being so chummy with Grandmaster? Have they formed an alliance, and Loki is up to another one of his schemes? Or is Loki actually acting outside of his self-interest and staying near Grandmaster to ensure that he can get Thor off Sakaar? We already know Loki's time on Sakaar will take a turn for the worse as evidenced by Thor, Valkyrie and Bruce Banner finding him chained up in a room, so it will be interesting to find out what led to his predicament. Does Heimdall Have The Soul Stone? The Soul Stone is the final Infinity Stone left to be revealed in the MCU before Avengers: Infinity War is released, and there's a fan theory making the rounds that Heimdall, Asgard's trusted gatekeeper, is in possession of it. Some believe that because the Soul Stone and Heimdall's eyes are the same color (orange), the Asgardian has somehow been imbued with the artifact's power, giving him his amazing sight. Heimdall himself in Thor: The Dark World said he's able to peer into ten trillion souls across the Nine Realms, so why is he the only Asgardian gifted with such an ability? Perhaps the Soul Stone is responsible, and the reason he was blind in Thor's vision during Avengers: Age of Ultron is because the Stone was taken away from him. Because Thor: Ragnarok is the last cosmic movie before Infinity War, it makes sense to answer what the deal is with the Soul Stone one way or another. How Is Surtur Involved In The Main Story? One of the many pieces of information that was provided at last year's Thor: Ragnarok set visit was that the movie opens with a montage of the many adventures Thor has had since the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron. This includes Thor battling Surtur, the fire demon who's been a member of the God of Thunder's rogues gallery for decades. We also know that Surtur will be one of Hela's allies during the main story, but that doesn't explain how he shows up again. No doubt Hela finds a way to release Surtur from whatever imprisonment he's been forced into while Thor is dealing with his predicament on Sakaar, but how does she find him? How does Hela persuade him to join her cause? Judging by the end of the Thor: Ragnarok summer trailer, Surtur is going to be a major opponent for The Revengers (especially Hulk), so we're eager to find out how he gets drawn into these events. Why Did Thor And Jane Foster Separate? Thor and Jane Foster were quite the MCU item for years, and while Jane didn't appear in Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Asgardian warrior and human astrophysicist were still together. But we've since learned that by the time of Thor: Ragnarok, Thor and Jane Foster are no longer a couple, and it was confirmed last year that Natalie Portman will not appear in the threequel. So why did they break up? Admittedly, they left very different lives, with Thor traveling across the Nine Realms to fight evildoers and Jane focusing on her scientific work on Earth. With that much separation, perhaps those two crazy kids felt it was better to go their separate ways rather than drag out a long distance relationship. What Happened To Lady Sif And The Warriors Three? Jane Foster is the only major absence in Thor: Ragnarok. Lady Sif and the Warriors Three haven't been seen in any of the movie's promotional material, it hasn't even been officially confirmed whether or not they will even appear. Those four were among Thor's closest allies in the first two Thor movies, so to not have them show up or even addressed would be weird. Fortunately, producer Brad Winderbaum says that Thor: Ragnarok will reveal what happened to Sif, Fandral, Hogun and Volstagg, and we might even see them as opposed to just hearing them be mentioned. Still, it can be surmised that they won't play a major role in the third Thor movie, so it will be most welcome when we find out what's befallen them. While it's certainly possible that they could make it out of Thor: Ragnarok alive, it's reasonable to fear that they may be killed during Hela's assault on Asgard. Where Does Bruce Banner Get His Duran Duran Shirt? This question is by no means important for shedding light on Thor: Ragnarok's plot, but it's still worth posing. Remember, Bruce Banner last transformed into Hulk during Avengers: Age of Ultron's climactic battle, and apparently the Green Goliath hasn't reverted to his human form once in the two years that have passed since then. That explains why he's built a bigger vocabulary while on Sakaar. Anyway, sometime after Thor and Hulk's fight in the gladiator ring, the latter will finally turn back into Banner, and when that happens he'll have fresh clothes ready for him, including a blazer and a shirt depicting the \"Rio\" album artwork. But where did these clothes come from? It's not like Hulk traveled back to Earth and grab some of Banner's duds from Avengers Tower. It's possible Banner just kept a spare outfit aboard the Quinjet just in case. However the movie explains why those clothes are on Sakaar, I hope this means that Duran Duran has gone intergalactic.

  "latent_7185": "MIAMI (Reuters) - Florida marine conservationists have come up with a simple recipe for fighting the invading lionfish that is gobbling up local reef life — eat them.\n\nA lionfish is pictured in the waters near Miami Florida, in this undated photograph released on December 29, 2010. REUTERS/REEF/Handout\n\nThe Key Largo-based REEF conservation organization has just released “The Lionfish Cookbook,” a collection of 45 recipes which is the group’s latest strategy to counter an invasion of the non-native reddish brown-striped fish in Florida waters.\n\n“It’s absolutely good eating — a delicacy. It’s delicately flavored white meat, very buttery,” Lad Akins, director of special projects for Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF), told Reuters. He authored the cookbook along with a professional chef, Tricia Ferguson.\n\nRed lionfish, a prickly predator armed with flaring venomous spines like a lion’s mane that give them their name, are native to the South Pacific, Indian Ocean and Red Sea.\n\nWith few natural predators, they have been rapidly expanding in Caribbean and Atlantic waters, voraciously preying on local fish, shrimp and crab populations across the region and in Florida, which has world-famous coral reefs.\n\nSome scientists are now listing the invasive lionfish species among the top 15 threats to global biodiversity.\n\nWhile REEF has organized local fishing “derbies” to hunt the lionfish, including handling tips and tasting sessions, Akins said making humans the invading species’ top predator was the best way to fight back against the threat it posed.\n\n“Fishermen and divers realize it’s a danger to our native marine life, through its predation. But there really aren’t government funds to provide bounties or removal programs. So creating a demand for the fish, a market for the fish, is in effect a de facto bounty,” he told Reuters.\n\nU.S. government researchers believe the red lionfish was introduced into Florida waters during Hurricane Andrew in 1992 when an aquarium broke and at least six fish spilled into Miami’s Biscayne Bay.\n\n“CARIBBEAN’S NEW DELICACY”\n\nThe front section of the cookbook, which calls the lionfish “The Caribbean’s New Delicacy,” gives useful tips on collecting, handling and preparing the colorful species, as well as providing expert background on its ecological impact.\n\nAkins says the fish, which lives among coral, can be netted, speared or caught by rod and reel, but he recommends handling them with puncture-proof gloves to avoid a painful prick from the mantle of venomous spines.\n\n“They can be quick over a short distance, but they’re not a free-swimming ocean fish like a tuna or a mackerel,” he said.\n\nUnlike the toxic Fugu pufferfish or blowfish, which is an expensive delicacy in Japan but requires careful expert preparation to avoid potentially fatal poisoning, Akins says lionfish meat is safe to eat and contains no venom.\n\n“The venom is only in the spines. Cooking the fish would denature the venom, even if you left the spines on. It’s simple enough just to cut the spines off,” he said.\n\nAkins said he hoped the cookbook could help create a commercial market for lionfish that would speed their eradication. But he wasn’t sure whether the brightly colored invader would appear on the menus of Miami Beach eateries.\n\n“It certainly is on the menu in many other countries — the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, Dominican Republic, Mexico,” he said, adding that orders for the recipe book, which can be purchased online at www.reef.org, were coming in fast.",
  "latent_7296": "Precious few of Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie’s free-agent signings have panned out this season. Cornerback Tarell Brown, on the other hand, has acquitted himself well in his first go round with the team across the bay from the one he used to play for.\n\nThat, of course, would be the 49ers, the team that Brown spent the firs seven seasons of his NFL career playing for, including 2011-13, when the 49ers sandwiched NFC Championship Game appearances around a Super Bowl appearance.\n\nThe 49ers opted to go young and cheap at cornerback this season, which forced Brown to hit the free-agent market. McKenzie wasted little time handing Brown a one-year, $3.5 million contract.\n\nBrown has rewarded McKenzie and the Raiders with a very solid season at a position that has been in flux since McKenzie arrived in 2012.\n\n“The guy goes out there and he gives you a solid day’s work every single day out there in practice, and that’s important,” Raiders coach Tony Sparano said. “He’s been a durable player back there for us. I’ve been really pleased with what he’s done.\n\n“He really is a good pro, a good guy to sit and visit with when you’re just talking about your football team a little bit and you want to pick somebody’s brain. He’s a good guy to sit and visit with that way. I like all the things he brings to the table for us. And I like the way he plays.”\n\nBrown knows the feeling of playing for a losing team. However, he grew accustomed to winning in a big way during 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh’s first three seasons.\n\nSo far this season, the Raiders are 1-11. However, fired coach Dennis Allen and interim coach Sparano have managed to keep the team from splintering, pointing fingers and shutting down.\n\n“I’m still jacked up about signing here,” Brown said. “I love the guys. I love the locker room. I love the organization. We just don’t have the wins we feel like we should have. We let a couple slip through our hands, and it’s a learning experience. When you have a younger team, you have those ups and downs and things of that sort, but I wouldn’t change it for anything in the world.”\n\nMcKenzie, or whoever is calling the shots for the Raiders in 2015, is going to have somewhere in the neighborhood of $70 million to spend in free agency.\n\nInvesting some of that in Brown seems like a pretty sound strategy. As for what McKenzie thinks about Brown, who knows? He still hasn’t spoken with the media since the season started — the news conference to introduce Sparano as coach doesn’t count, either.\n\nCornerback has been a revolving door, or sorts, in the McKenzie era. He signed Ron Bartell and Shawntae Spencer in 2012, and both players flopped. Last season, he signed Tracy Porter and Mike Jenkins as his starters. Porter and Jenkins played better than their predecessors.\n\nThis season, McKenzie turned to Brown and fellow former 49ers cornerback Carlos Rogers. Brown has sparkled from the outset. Rogers played well, at times, before he suffered a knee injury and was placed on season-ending injured reserve last week.\n\n— If you’re wondering how many carries each running back is going to get against the 49ers on Sunday, or whether wide receiver Rod Streater will be activated to the 53-man roster, don’t bother. Sparano is going all Bill Parcells on these matters, thinking it gives the Raiders a competitive edge.\n\nSome might counter that having Tom Brady at quarterback or Barry Sanders at running back gives you a true edge. But, hey, to each his own.\n\n“He’s getting closer,” Sparano said about Streater’s rebound from a broken foot. “We still have some more time here, so whether or not I see him getting there or not, you guys will have to find that out on Sunday.”\n\nActually, the deadline is Saturday, so coach Sparano might be disappointed to learn that the 49ers are going to have more time to react to the news of whether Streater is active or not.\n\nAs for the running backs situation, now that Latavius Murray is back to full strength, you really will have to wait until Sunday to see how that unfolds.\n\nSparano already knows how he’s going to handle the workload. Again, he’s pulling a Bill Belichick or Sean Payton and keeping such classified information to himself, certain that doing so is of immense benefit to the Raiders.\n\n“I’ve got a pretty good idea in my head of what I want the rotation to be before Sunday as we get going right now,” Sparano said.\n\nCare to shed anymore light on the situation, coach?\n\n“I can’t tell you about the number of carries,” Sparano said. “In other words, it just depends on how the game is going at that point. But when I say rotation, I’m talking about who I see in when, and then if the carries come, they come.”\n\nSan Francisco defensive coordinator Vic Fangio is going to be pretty disappointed when he reads this blog post and discovers that he’s going to have to wait to see if Streater is going to play and how Sparano intends to use his running backs.\n\nOakland offensive coordinator Greg Olson had this to say Thursday:\n\n“We’re all excited to see him now that he is healthy again and give him the opportunity to carry the football this week,” Olson said. “There is some anticipation, and there is some excitement this week seeing him out on the practice field. We’re excited to see him play.”\n\n— Punter Marquette King is on pace to set the franchise record for most punts in a season. Naturally, that’s a record he would care to avoid. However, the absurd number of punts doesn’t detract from how well he’s performing in his second season.\n\n“He’s been really important,” Sparano said. “He’s been a real bright spot in a lot of situations.\n\nKing has a 45.3 gross average. More impressive, he has 24 punts inside the 20-yard line vs. only two touchbacks.\n\n“I like what he’s done right now,” Sparano said. “He’s getting better and better. He’s knocking the ball down in tight there. I realize, like anything else, he’s a guy that needs to continue to get better, but he’s really starting to figure the thing out.”\n\n— Fourth-year receiver Denarius Moore has gone from a promising young player to an afterthought in short order. He has fallen so far that he wasn’t even active against the Rams last Sunday.\n\n“A little bit of that is just the progress of some of the other players, too.” Sparano said. Kenbrell [Thompkins] has come on and done some good things in flashes and has shown us some good things. Vincent Brown has come on and has shown us some good things there. We feel like at that position right now, there’s a couple of guys there that we’ve had to get a look at and we kind of like what we see there.”\n\nIn the interim, Moore is keeping his head down, working hard and waiting his turn.\n\n“D-Mo’s working hard out there,” Sparano said. “I appreciate what he’s doing out there on the field. … I’m sure at some point here with the next four weeks, we’ll see. He may get another opportunity out there and if he does, I’m sure D-Mo’s ready to make the most of that opportunity. He’s practicing really much better.”",
  "latent_7310": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nThis story was originally published by ProPublica and NPR’s Shots blog.\n\nTwo years ago, Margaret O’Neill brought her 5-year-old daughter to Children’s Hospital Colorado because the band of tissue that connected her tongue to the floor of her mouth was too tight. The condition, literally called being “tongue-tied,” made it hard for the girl to make “th” sounds.\n\nIt’s a common problem with a simple fix: an outpatient procedure to snip the tissue.\n\n“I was taken advantage of because I was a captive audience.”\n\nDuring a pre-operative visit, the surgeon offered to throw in a surprising perk. Should we pierce her ears while she’s under?\n\nO’Neill’s first thought was that her daughter seemed a bit young to have her ears pierced. Her second: Why was a surgeon offering to do this? Wasn’t that something done free at the mall with the purchase of a starter set of earrings?\n\n“That’s so funny,” O’Neill recalled saying. “I didn’t think you did ear piercings.”\n\nThe surgeon, Peggy Kelley, told her it could be a nice thing for a child, O’Neill said. All she had to do is bring earrings on the day of the operation. O’Neill agreed, assuming it would be free.\n\nHer daughter emerged from surgery with her tongue newly freed and a pair of small gold stars in her ears.\n\nOnly months later did O’Neill discover her cost for this extracurricular work: $1,877.86 for “operating room services” related to the ear piercing—a fee her insurer was unwilling to pay.\n\nAt first, O’Neill assumed the bill was a mistake. Her daughter hadn’t needed her ears pierced, and O’Neill would never have agreed to it if she’d known the cost. She complained in phone calls and in writing.\n\nThe hospital wouldn’t budge. In fact, O’Neill said it dug in, telling her to pay up or it would send the bill to collections. The situation was “absurd,” she said.\n\n“There are a lot of things we’d pay extra for a doctor to do,” she said. “This is not one of them.”\n\nKelley and the hospital declined to comment to ProPublica about the ear piercing.\n\nSurgical ear piercings are rare, according to the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that maintains a database of commercial health insurance claims. The institute could only find a few dozen possible cases a year in its vast cache of billing data. But O’Neill’s case is a vivid example of health care waste known as overuse.\n\nInto this category fall things like unnecessary tests, higher-than-needed levels of care or surgeries that have proven ineffective.\n\nWasteful use of medical care has “become so normalized that I don’t think people in the system see it,” said Dr. Vikas Saini, president of The Lown Institute, a Boston think tank focused on making health care more effective, affordable and just. “We need more serious studies of what these practices are.”\n\nExperts estimate the U.S. health care system wastes $765 billion annually—about a quarter of all the money that’s spent. Of that, an estimated $210 billion goes to unnecessary or needlessly expensive care, according to a 2012 report by the National Academy of Medicine.\n\nProPublica has been documenting the ways waste is baked into the system. Hospitals throw away new supplies and nursing homes discard still-potent medication. Drugmakers combine cheap ingredients to create expensive specialty pills and arbitrary drug expiration dates force hospitals and pharmacies to toss valuable drugs.\n\nWe also reported how drug companies make oversize eyedrops and vials of cancer drugs, forcing patients to pay for medication they are unable to use. In response, a group of U.S. senators introduced a bill this month to reduce what they called “colossal and completely preventable waste.”\n\nBut any discussion of waste needs to look how health care dollars are thrown away on procedures and care that patients don’t need—and how hard it is to stop it.\n\n“There are a lot of things we’d pay extra for a doctor to do,” she said. “This is not one of them.”\n\nJust ask Christina Arenas.\n\nArenas, 34, has a history of noncancerous cysts in her breasts so last summer when her gynecologist found some lumps in her breast and sent her for an ultrasound to rule out cancer, she wasn’t worried.\n\nBut on the day of scan, the sonographer started the ultrasound, then stopped to consult a radiologist. They told her she needed a mammogram before the ultrasound could be done.\n\nArenas, an attorney who is married to a doctor, told them she didn’t want a mammogram. She didn’t want to be exposed to the radiation, or pay for the procedure. But sitting on the table in a hospital gown, she didn’t have much leverage to negotiate.\n\nSo, she agreed to a mammogram, followed by an ultrasound. The findings: no cancer. As Arenas suspected, she had cysts, fluid-filled sacs that are common in women her age.\n\nThe radiologist told her to come back in two weeks so they could drain the cysts with a needle, guided by yet another ultrasound. But when she returned she got two ultrasounds: one before the procedure and another as part of it.\n\nThe radiologist then sent the fluid from the cysts to pathology to test it for cancer. That test confirmed—again—that there wasn’t any cancer. Her insurance whittled the bills down to $2,361, most of which she had to pay herself because of her insurance plan.\n\nArenas didn’t like paying for something she didn’t think she needed and resented the loss of control. “It was just kind of, ‘Take it or leave it.’ The whole thing. You had no choice as to your own care.”\n\nArenas, sure she’d been given care she didn’t need, discussed it with one of her husband’s friends who is a gynecologist. She learned the process could have been more simple and affordable.\n\nArenas complained to The George Washington Medical Faculty Associates, the large Washington, D.C., doctor group that provided her treatment. Her request to have the bill reduced was denied. Then bill collectors got involved, so she demanded a refund and threatened legal action.\n\nShe said she never got to speak to anyone. Her demand was routed to an attorney, who declined her request because there was “no inappropriate care.” She also complained to her insurance company and the Washington, D.C., attorney general’s office, but they declined to help reduce the bill.\n\nOvertreatment related to mammograms is a common problem. The national cost of false-positive tests and overdiagnosed breast cancer is estimated at $4 billion a year, according to a 2015 study in Health Affairs. Some of this is fueled by anxious patients, some by doctors who know that missing a cancer diagnosis can be grounds for a medical malpractice lawsuit. But advocates, patients and even some doctors note the screenings can also be a cash cow for physicians and hospitals.\n\nWith Arenas’ permission, we shared her case with experts, including Dr. Barbara Levy, vice president of health policy for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and three radiologists.\n\nLevy said there’s a standard way to treat a suspected breast cyst that’s efficient and cost-effective. If the lump is large, as in Arenas’ case, a doctor should first use a needle to try and drain it. If the fluid is clear and the lump goes away there’s no cause for concern or extra testing. If the fluid is bloody or can’t be drained, or the mass is solid, then medical imaging tests can determine if it’s cancerous.\n\nHowever, doctors often choose to order imaging tests rather than drain apparent cysts, Levy said. “We’re so afraid the next one might be cancer even though the last 10 weren’t,” she said. “So, we overtest.”\n\n“It’s sort of this perfect storm where no one is really evil but the net effect is predatory.”\n\nLevy and the radiologists agreed that at least some of Arenas’ care seemed excessive. But their opinions varied, which shows why it can be difficult to reduce unnecessary care. Standards are often open-ended, so they allow for a wide range of practices and doctors have autonomy to take the route they think is best for patients.\n\nThe American College of Radiology recommends an ultrasound for a 32-year-old—Arenas’ age at the time of the procedure—with an unidentified breast mass. Mammograms are also an option, but “most benign lesions in young women are not visualized by mammography,” the guidelines state.\n\nDr. Phillip Shaffer, a radiologist who’s practiced for decades in Columbus, Ohio, said he didn’t think Arenas needed the mammogram. “I wouldn’t do it,” he said. “If I did an ultrasound and saw cysts, I’d say you have cysts. In 32-year-olds the mammogram does almost nothing.”\n\nDr. Jay Baker, chair of the American College of Radiology breast imaging communications committee, agreed that the ultrasound alone would have “almost certainly” identified the cyst. But, he said, maybe something about the lumps concerned Arenas’ radiologist, so a mammogram was ordered.\n\nNone of the radiologists consulted by ProPublica could explain why two ultrasounds on the return visit would be necessary. According to Arenas’ medical records, the practice told one reviewer that two were done to make sure the cysts hadn’t changed.\n\nShaffer didn’t buy it. “They just billed her twice for one thing,” he said.\n\nLevy, the gynecologist, said it’s “excessive” to do two ultrasounds. And, she said, there was no need to send clear fluid to pathology.\n\nArenas offered to waive her privacy rights so the practice that provided her treatment could speak to ProPublica. Officials from the practice declined to comment. Her medical records show that in response to reviews by her insurance company and the attorney general’s office, her doctors said the care was appropriate.\n\nSince then she has her cysts drained without images in her gynecologist’s office for about $350. But Arenas said on two occasions she’s used a needle at home to do it herself. (Doctors do not recommend this approach.) She admits it was an extreme choice, but at the time she worried she would be subjected to more unnecessary tests.\n\n“I was taken advantage of because I was a captive audience,” she said.\n\nIn a brick-and-glass office park just outside Roanoke, Virginia, Missy Conley and Jeanne Woodward have battled on behalf of hundreds of patients who believe they’ve been overtreated or overcharged. The two work for Medliminal, a company that challenges erroneous and inflated medical bills on behalf of consumers in exchange for a share of the savings.\n\nThe two women excitedly one-up each other with their favorite outrages. How about the two cases involving unnecessary pregnancy tests? One of the patients was 82—decades past her childbearing years. The other involved a younger woman who no longer had a uterus.\n\nAnother case involved an uninsured man who fell off his mountain bike and hurt his shoulder. The first responders pressured him to take an air ambulance to a hospital when it would have been faster for his friends to drive him. He got charged $44,000 for the whirlybird. Such unexpectedly pricey flights—and the aggressive billing that comes with them—have been featured in stories by NPR, the New York Times and The Atlantic.\n\nMedliminal gets dozens of calls a week from consumers who are fed up with the medical system.\n\nWoodward, a nurse and certified medical auditor, regularly sees patients billed for unnecessary lab tests. A man with diabetes may only need his glucose measured, but the doctor may order a bundle of 14 unnecessary tests, she said. The extra tests inflate the tab.\n\nIf there’s a billing dispute it can take months of phone calls and emails to get a case resolved, said Conley, who gained an insider’s knowledge during years working for insurance companies.\n\nPatients fighting bills on their own often give up and pay the bill or let it go to collections, she said. “The whole system is broken,” Conley said.\n\nSaini, president of The Lown Institute, said profit is a major driver of overuse.\n\n“Providers are getting constant messages from superiors or partners to maximize revenue,” Saini said. “In this system we have, that’s not a crime. That’s business as usual.”\n\nPatients aren’t true health care consumers because they typically can’t shop by price and they often don’t have control over the care they receive, Saini said. The medical evidence may support multiple paths for providing care, but patients are unable to tell what is or is not discretionary, he said. Time pressure adds urgency, which makes it difficult to discuss or research various options.\n\n“It’s sort of this perfect storm where no one is really evil but the net effect is predatory,” Saini said.\n\n“We’re so afraid the next one might be cancer even though the last 10 weren’t. So, we overtest.”\n\nOnce the service or treatment is provided, the bill is on its way, with little forgiveness.\n\nIn 2015, Dr. Dong Chang, the director of the medical intensive care unit at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, a public hospital in Los Angeles, decided to see whether the care being delivered in his ICU was appropriate.\n\nResources were scarce in his ICU, and he suspected it might be possible to manage them better. So, he and his colleagues reviewed the records of all the patients in the unit over the course of a year to see whether the patients might have been either too sick, or too healthy, to benefit from intensive care.\n\nThe results shocked them. They determined the care may not have been beneficial to more than half of the patients. “ICU care is inefficient, devoting substantial resources to patients less likely to benefit,” their study, published in the February edition of JAMA Internal Medicine, concluded.\n\nChang and his team also reviewed the use of intensive care at 94 hospitals in two states, Maryland and Washington, focusing on four common conditions that can lead to treatment in an intensive care unit.\n\nThey found wide variation in the types of patients hospitals determined needed intensive care. One hospital put 16 percent of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, a serious condition that can result in a coma, in intensive care, while another hospital did so with 81 percent of such patients. The range for patients with pulmonary embolisms was from 5 percent to 44 percent and for those with congestive heart failure, it was 4 percent to 49 percent.\n\nChang attributes the difference to doctors using intensive care based on their habits, hunches or training. Profit, he said, may also be a motive, but it didn’t appear to be a driving force.\n\n“We really don’t have good standards and a good discussion going on about who should receive ICU care,” Chang said.\n\nThe unnecessary intensive care can also be harmful. The study found intensive care patients underwent more invasive procedures, like the insertion of catheters, including central lines, which carry the risk of infection. Overuse of the ICU is bad for patients who don’t need it, Chang said. Survival rates were also no better at the hospitals that used intensive care the most.\n\nReducing unneeded intensive care stays would save big money. Intensive care costs about $10,000 for a typical stay and accounts for 4 percent of national health care expenditures, according to research cited by Chang’s team.\n\nIf the hospitals in Maryland and Washington with the highest rates of intensive care use had behaved more like those with lower use, it would save around $137 million, the study estimated. That’s the savings for fewer than 100 hospitals in two states. There are about 4,000 hospitals nationwide, suggesting that reducing unnecessary intensive care use could save billions of dollars a year.\n\nChang hesitated to call the overuse of intensive care “wasted” health care spending. He said the medical literature calls it “non-beneficial” care, which is maybe a nicer way of saying the same thing.\n\nFor O’Neill, her dispute of the fee for her daughter’s ear piercing was a trip into the hell of medical billing.\n\nO’Neill is an attorney, so she knows how to weed through fine print. But it took her untold hours and phone calls to the hospital and her insurance company to root out the issue. The hospital had initially billed her insurer for the $1,877.86 for “operating room services” related to the ear piercing. The company rightly rejected payment for the cosmetic procedure. So, the hospital billed the family, according to her medical and billing records and correspondence.\n\nThe surgeon billed the family an additional $110, which O’Neill paid.\n\nThe operative report describes the piercing in obscure technical terms: “The bilateral lobules were prepped with betadine and a 18 gauge was used to pierce the left lobule in the planned position …”\n\nO’Neill said she got nowhere in several conversations with the manager of the hospital’s team that deals with payments directly from consumers. Then in mid-July, O’Neill wrote a letter to the manager explaining that they were at an impasse and urged the hospital to cancel the bill.\n\nIn early August, ProPublica contacted the hospital and surgeon to inquire about the ear piercing. The hospital spokeswoman replied in an email that, generally speaking, ear piercings during surgery are rare and only done at the request of a family. (The medical records say O’Neill requested the ear piercing.) It would not result in a separate operating room charge, she wrote.\n\nThe spokeswoman’s explanation didn’t jibe with the hospital’s bill, which even listed the billing code for ear piercing. She declined to discuss O’Neill’s case or explain the discrepancy.\n\nIn mid-August, the self-pay manager sent O’Neill a letter saying, “the remaining balance of $1,877.86” would be removed “as a one-time courtesy adjustment.”\n\nThe manager added that the hospital hadn’t done anything wrong. The account was “correctly documented, coded, charged and billed according to industry standards,” she wrote.\n\nAnd that’s just the problem. The hospital’s $1,877 bill for the ear piercing was within industry standards.\n\nAs for O’Neill, she and her daughter had to endure one additional insult. The surgeon’s piercing of one ear was off-kilter so it had to be redone. This time O’Neill had it done at the mall, for about 30 bucks.",

Get the Recipe: Vegetable Sushi\n\nMorimoto rolls sushi using bamboo mats, available at kitchen-supply stores. You can find nori, or seaweed sheets, at many large grocery stores.\n\nCombine the rice and 3 1/4 cups water in a rice cooker and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions. A rice cooker is the best way to get perfect sticky-firm rice, but if you don't have one, just use a saucepan.\n\nCombine the vinegar, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Transfer the cooked rice to a large wooden bowl (traditionally, a wooden tub). Drizzle a quarter of the vinegar mixture over a wooden spoon or spatula onto the rice.\n\nFold the rice gently with the spoon to cool it and break up any clumps; be careful not to smash the grains.

  "latent_7559": "One of the staples in San Antonio is the taco. We eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Tacos can be found in mobile food trucks, hole-in-the-walls, lobbies of where we work and high class restaurants.\n\nBut to paraphrase the Bard, would a taco by any other name taste as sweet?\n\nRecently there was a discussion at my workplace about the difference between a taco and a burrito. This launched a huge discussion between the nuances of each item.\n\nWant info about SA without the spam? Subscribe to the SA Flavor newsletter.\n\nI have experienced this conundrum firsthand. Growing up on the South Plains, I always referred to the breakfast meal of eggs, bacon and cheese in a tortilla as a “breakfast burrito.” Coming to San Antonio, many of my coworkers kept asking me if I would like a bean and egg “breakfast taco.” I kept declining because I could not understand why anyone would want a crispy taco shell with beans and eggs first thing in the morning.\n\nIt was several months before I realized that breakfast tacos in San Antonio did not come in a crispy shell but rather a soft tortilla. Once I became enlightened to this fact, I have happily ordered breakfast tacos ever since.\n\nThis led me to develop what I refer to as the I-20 Taco Theory. Interstate 20 more or less cuts Texas right in the middle as the road travels East to West passing through DFW and Midland before swooping down South to El Paso. People who live either side of this line have drastically different views on tacos.\n\nSan Antonians and people who live South of I-20 cannot imagine calling the tortilla wrapped treat anything other than a taco. To them, a burrito is anything that comes in a larger tortilla, a la Freebirds. By default, anything purchased in the morning is in a normal sized tortilla so they logically refer to it as a taco. If they want a hard shelled taco, they will always specifically ask for a “crispy taco.”\n\nThe contingent who lives North of I-20 referred to the morning item as a breakfast burrito. This group feels that by default the word taco implies a crispy shell. Folks North of the line refer to anything in a tortilla as a burrito although there are some factions who deviate and call the smaller tortilla item a soft taco.\n\nYou then have the people who live right on the line who are confused on whether to call an item a burrito or taco. There are tons of places in the DFW Metroplex that serve tacos and an equal amount that serve burritos. These Texans have adapted and just call it by the name that is at the restaurant. The only exception might be in El Paso where it seems that it more often than not referred to as a taco.\n\nWhile I am not advocating for either the use of the word “taco” or “burrito,” it is my hope that this article can at least provide some insight to those traveling to Texas or within Texas to understand what the heck they should ask for depending on what city they are visiting.\n\nBeing in San Antonio for the past six years, I have adopted “breakfast taco” into my vernacular. However, when I use this term while visiting my parents I often get funny looks and quickly say, “I mean, I’d love a bacon and egg breakfast burrito.”\n\nUPDATE: I was actually interviewed by my friend over at Hilah Cooking for her newest edition of the Breakfast Taco Book (the I-20 Theory even made it into her book)!

Visited by millions of fans year-round, the long summer days are without a doubt the main event (that’s not to say the “cold and rainy” winter might just be the city’s best kept secret).\n\nWhen you consider the extent of things to see and do in Cape Town, it comes as no surprise that the scenic city at the end of Africa continues to receive a wealth of international recognition – from The New York Times and Telegraph to TripAdvisor – they have all decorated Cape Town with adoring adulation in recent times.\n\nNow people come from all corners of the world, some even doing travel crowdfunding, to absorb the colours and culture of trendsetting Cape Town: From paragliding off famous Lion’s Head, Sundays at Mzoli’s, and wine tasting tours to nights out at Shimmy Beach Club, sundowners at Llandudno Beach, and days and nights spent at the We Love Summer outdoor music parties; the Mother City inspires freedom, beauty, and creativity, and forms the perfect playground in one of the most stunning settings on Earth.\n\nLion’s Head Paragliding\n\nLion’s Head is the most hiked mountain in Cape Town – it’s free to hike the head, and it offers the best, 360-degree views of the city’s peninsula including Table Mountain, Camps Bay, the 12 Apostles, Sea Point Promenade, and Table Bay. Now imagine feasting your eyes on all of this plus the magnificent Lion’s Head from the air while strapped into a para-glider for a good 20 minutes of heavenly bliss. And yes – I have experienced this for myself on a classic sunny Cape Town Saturday and whether you reside in the city, or you’re merely visiting for a few days, I highly recommend it!\n\nWe Love Summer\n\nThe week is over – leave the books behind, slap on some sunblock, ease into your flip flops; and book your spot at another We Love Summer weekend. The We Love Summer parties, now over a year running, have burst on to Cape Town’s outdoor party scene to popular demand – every party is sold out. In fact, their last party’s first batch of tickets was sold out in a record-breaking 1 hour. And it is not surprising why We Love Summer has such a loyal following. Started by young entrepreneurs Wes Billet, Brett Aitken, Gal Ezra, and Aviv Levi, the day and night of a We Love Summer jol is overflowing with the best Deep House DJs Cape Town has to offer, a new and exciting venue situated on the likes of a wine farm, Cable Ski Resort, a hidden valley, or rooftop in the city, and almost every familiar face in their twenties with the same mindset on hand – to dance through the setting suns into the night and forget about all those weekly stresses with the people they love most.\n\nNewlands Brewery Tour\n\nBelonging to the 2nd largest brewing company in the world, SAB Miller, the Newlands Brewery Tour takes you on a trip through South African beer history and culture, leaving a salivating sensation no beer-lover can deny. Take a tour through Africa’s oldest brewery dating back to 1820 and learn about the brewing and bottling processes, the figureheads involved over time such as Charles Glass, and the brewery’s road to international acclaim. Brewery tours are inexpensive, and include two complimentary pints in the private underground cellar of this beer-making fortress.\n\nWine Tasting\n\nCape Town is undoubtedly Africa’s wine capital, and whether you choose to visit the Constantia Wine Valley, Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, the Riebeek Valley or all of them, the estates of the Western Cape boast some of the finest and full-bodied flavours to sip in the most picturesque of settings. Travel an hour outside of Cape Town and experience the Franschhoek wine tram. If your stay is time-sensitive explore the lush Constantia Valley much closer to the City Bowl. Here you will find unique tasting experiences and sumptuous restaurants plus the oldest wine farm in the country in Groot Constantia.\n\nCape Camping\n\nSummer ain’t complete without a camping trip away with your friends. Camping close to the city includes the coast of Kommetjie, but I strongly urge you to get out of the city for this experience, after all, any good camping trip is about being around your best friends and family, soaking in the simple life in all its pleasures from mesmerising sunsets, starlit night skies, unforgettable campfire stories, and Braaing every meal on an open flame. The best recommended campsites in close proximity to the Mother City are Beaverlac in the Cederberg, Secret Falls in Tulbagh, Berg River Resort in the Paarl Winelands, and Tietiesbaai Beach Camp up the West Coast.\n\nShimmy Beach Club\n\nThis is an absolute no-brainer. Shimmy is where Cape Town’s premier beach party vibe goes down complete with infinity pools, a sand-filled dance floor, gorgeous people, and a music line-up that drums your ears for days to come. Shimmy’s Submerged Sundays features a weekly headline act of Cape Town born and bred Summer House duo, Goldfish, and supporting acts from both local and international shores such as Bakermat, Dean Fuel, and Lexer. On Friday and Saturday nights the club dances to a different beat with some of the biggest international names in electronic music setting up at Shimmy Beach Club.\n\nNewlands Cricket\n\nOkay, so wherever you are in South Africa, a summers day at the cricket is always recommended, especially if AB is on fire like he was against the Windies at The Wanderers several weeks ago. At Sahara Park, in the leafy suburb of Newlands near Cape Town, fans are treated to the best grass embankment seats in the country, with Castle Corner offering an enviable side-on view of the action – Table Mountain as backdrop. Not too shabby hey?\n\nCape Town Tens\n\nThe world’s biggest sporting tournament of its kind, the Cape Town Tens is a 2-day affair which draws in Boytjies from all over the country as well as from international borders. This is where rugby, beer, sunshine, good music and a ton of South African “gees” join forces to give the city of Cape Town one helluva show. And it’s not just a guy’s affair, in addition to the 100 rugby teams, there are also 50 netball teams which battle it out on the courts. This year, the Cape Town Tens is taking place on 7 and 8 February at Hamilton’s Rugby Club in Green Point. If beer and rugby are your thing, make sure you’re there.\n\nAlso read:\n\nKirstenbosch Summer Sunset Concerts\n\nNestled at the base of Table Mountain is Kirstenbosch Gardens – most days people come here to picnic close to nature. On Sundays in summer, the gardens come alive with the Kirstenbosch Summer Concerts. From Goldfish and Jeremy Loops to international acts such as Ben Howard and the Lumineers, the Kirstenbosch Summer Concerts feature good music in a lush and scenic setting utterly unique to the city of Cape Town.\n\nCape Town Beaches\n\nThe turquoise waters and exquisite sunsets found along Cape Town’s Atlantic Seaboard play their part in attracting droves of visitors each year. The drop-dead gorgeous beaches of Clifton, Camps Bay and Llandudno are the very core of the Cape Town summer. The vibe around these hotspots rival that of South Beach Miami and Copacabana. Clifton’s Fourth Beach and Camps Bay are for beach bumming until your skin can’t handle it; thirst quenching sundowners at Bungalow or Caprice usually follow. Further down the coastline, just before Hout Bay, is Llandudno which is less crowded; the surf break here attracts ballsy wave riders from far and wide. No matter which beach you choose, the ice cold waters are not for the faint-hearted!\n\nFree Bo-Kaap Walking Tours\n\nAdd some history and culture to your Cape Town summer with free walking tours to the Bo Kaap. You pay for your walking tour by tipping your guide a discretionary amount decided by you. The walking tour of the Bo Kaap takes you through the narrow lanes and cobbled streets of that area with the colourful houses; points of interest along the way include the oldest Mosque in Cape Town, Chiappini Street, The Atlas Spice Trading Centre, Green Market Square and much more. You will learn all about Cape Town history and the Cape Malay culture – free Bo Kaap walking tours take place every day at 2pm and you simply need to rock up at the corner of Wale Street and St. George’s Mall. Cape Town Free Walking Tours also offer a daily historic tour of the city centre at 11am and a paid Lion’s Head sunset hike at 4pm every day.\n\nMother City Hikers\n\nA Table Mountain or Lion’s Head hike is a given in the Cape Town summer – do not leave without going on at least one hike. If you’re new to the many hikes around Cape Town you’ll soon realise there are a lot of routes and trails to choose from. For an optimal and safe experience head out with the clan from Mother City Hikers. Lauren and her experienced crew have trekked all over the mountains of the Cape – they’re driven by their passion for the outdoors and the natural beauty of Cape Town.

Come meet South Africans and international guests from all walks of life – after all, everyone flocks here (on a Sunday especially) for a common purpose – beer and Mzolis’ internationally acclaimed shisa nyama. Mzoli’s is both a bar and butchery – more than that it is an institution. It’s reasonable, festive, and it’s the one place you can go and buy your meat, have it braaied for you and soak it all down with the an ice-cold Zamalek.\n\nThe Neighbourgood’s Market\n\nThe Neighbourgood’s Market, founded by Justin Rhodes and Cameron Munro in 2006, is frequented by both locals and visitors to this fine city every Saturday morning and there’s no surprise why. Taking place at the Old Biscuit Mill in the gentrified suburb of Woodstock, the weekly market sees a collaboration of local entrepreneurs and craftsmen selling their goods to the public. There is a strong focus on cutting out the middle man at this enticingly unique market with the buyer being rewarded the opportunity to go directly to the source to purchase one’s goods.

Arias, Seattle Post-Intelligencer Photo: Gilbert W. Arias, Seattle Post-Intelligencer Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Scout councils defend logging of their lands 1 / 3 Back to Gallery\n\nFor nearly a century, the Boy Scouts of America have proudly described themselves as campside conservationists, good stewards of the land.\n\n\"The Boy Scouts were green before it was cool to be green,\" said national spokesman Deron Smith.\n\nBut in recent decades, local Boy Scout councils around the nation have ordered clear-cutting or other high-impact logging on tens of thousands of acres of forestland they own, often in a quest for a different kind of green: cash.\n\nA Hearst Newspapers investigation has found dozens of cases in which the scouts ordered the logging of prime woodlands or sold them to big timber interests and developers, turning quick money instead of seeking ways to save the trees.\n\n\"In public, they say they want to teach kids about saving the environment,\" said Jane Childers, a longtime scouting volunteer in Washington state who has fought against scouts' logging. \"But in reality, it's all about the money.\"\n\nScout councils nationwide have hired loggers to carry out clear-cutting and salvage harvests in ecosystems that provided habitat for a host of protected species, including salmon, timber wolves, bald eagles and spotted owls, records show.\n\nAt times, the scout councils have logged or sold wild properties that had been bequeathed specifically for use as scout camps.\n\nIn some cases, councils have sought revenues from logging or land sales to make up for funding lost because of the organization's controversial bans on gays and atheists.\n\n\"The Boy Scouts had to suffer the consequences for sticking by their moral values,\" said Eugene Grant, president of the Portland, Ore., Cascade Pacific Council's board of directors. \"There's no question\" that the Scouts' anti-gay, anti-atheist stance has cost the organization money, he said. As a result, he said, \"every council has looked at ways to generate funds ... and logging is one of them.\"\n\nThe scouts insist they manage the wild lands they own with sensitivity and care.\n\nBut the investigation - a nationwide review by five newspapers of more than 400 timber harvests, court papers, property records, tax filings and other documents since 1990 - also found that:\n\n-- Scout councils have ordered the logging of more than 34,000 acres of forests - perhaps far more, as forestry records nationwide are incomplete.\n\n-- More than 100 scout groups - one-third of all Boy Scouts councils nationwide - have conducted timber harvests.\n\n-- Councils logged in or near protected wildlife habitat at least 53 times.\n\n-- Councils have authorized at least 60 clear-cutting operations and 35 salvage harvests, logging practices that some experts say harm the environment but maximize profits.\n\nA renewable resource\n\nScout officials generally defended logging as sound land stewardship. Trees are a renewable resource, said some, and the income from logging is put back into scouting, providing needed funds to underwrite programs and maintain scout camps and other properties.\n\nForestry records confirm that many councils practice only sustainable forestry. They selectively log to remove hazard trees, reduce fire risks and improve habitat, records show. With the help of professional foresters, dozens of councils have implemented long-range management plans to better manage woodlands, records also show. But the investigation also revealed that some stewardship plans were ignored. Most scout timber harvests were relatively small - 50 to 100 acres - and occurred mainly in the Western timber states. But scout councils across the country have authorized logging, Hearst Newspapers found.\n\n\"Every time (a council) gets a new scout director, they call a state forester to come out and see if there is any good timber to harvest,\" said Paul Tauke, Iowa state forester. \"There's always pressure to make money.\"\n\nSome scout councils say they have reluctantly resorted to logging simply to shore up sagging operating budgets.\n\n\"I butchered the property,\" said Bruce Faller, a district commissioner for a Vermont scout council, describing a 2006 logging operation he ordered for financial reasons. \"It was old, big beautiful wood ... I wouldn't have done it if there (were) any other way.\"\n\n26 logging councils\n\nOthers unabashedly identify themselves as logging councils that manage scout camps as for-profit tree farms.\n\nThe Cascade Pacific Council in Portland, Ore., and the Andrew Jackson Council in Jackson, Miss., are among 26 councils nationwide that log camps as tree farms under what they view as sustainable management plans.\n\n\"This is pine country,\" said Arnold Landry, the Mississippi council executive. \"We cut when it's best for us to cut. We replant and ... make the best use of the property.\"\n\nProperly managed logging is simply another resource councils can tap, some say, in an era when funding is hard to find.\n\n\"People talk about what a bad, evil, horrible thing it is to cut a tree,\" said Tim McCandless, executive for the Spokane, Wash., Inland Northwest Council. \"But our mission is kids, not trees.\"\n\nIn southwest Washington, along a gravel county road, a denuded hillside piled with logging debris at the Pacific Harbor Council's Camp Delezene offers testament to how, even amid today's stagnant timber markets, trees are like gold.\n\nThe scout council obtained $140,000 by clear-cutting 12 acres of 80 year-old Douglas fir, said scout volunteer Douglas Dorr. The income allowed the scouts to put a new roof on the old lodge at the camp and make other improvements. The logging was done by the book, he said.\n\nBut a conservation biologist hired by Hearst Newspapers to review the project said the scouts' logging broke state rules meant to protect endangered salmon in a nearby stream.\n\n\"There are blatant rules violations here,\" said the consultant, Chris Mendoza. He said the council failed to leave a buffer zone of trees along the bank of the stream and on the slopes of a hillside - measures that would have protected the stream from mudslides and erosion.\n\n\"These were some big, valuable trees,\" Mendoza said. \"It looks like they wanted to take as many as possible and broke the rules to do it.\"\n\nCouncil officials disagreed, saying the logging followed all regulations and was thoughtfully planned to minimize impact.\n\nThe logging at Camp Delezene was one of several cases in which scouts were criticized for allegedly deviating from environmental laws, forestry rules or rules written into logging plans.\n\n\"It pays to do that,\" said Mendoza, who has worked for timber corporations and also serves on a state forest practices committee. \"Some landowners are more prone to bending the rules, because if they get away with it, it can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"\n\nSmith, the Boy Scouts national spokesman, says the scouts are not just out to make a buck at the environment's expense.\n\nThe scouts are \"good stewards of their resources,\" he said.\n\nFunding scout programs\n\nAmong nonprofit groups, the scouts are perhaps the nation's biggest landowners, some scout officials say. How their land is used is largely left up to administrators and volunteer board members running the 304 local scouting councils. Tapping a council's assets, such as timber, can help ensure that there's money to fund scout programs, scout officials say.\n\nIn California, scout councils often cited moneymaking as an important goal of logging projects proposed for scout wildlands. Public records show that the foresters hired by the scouts to log their properties have usually followed California forestry rules. But critics caution that forestry agencies - even in heavily regulated timber states like California - can be lax in enforcement.\n\nAround the country, critics have complained that logging operations on scout lands weren't conducted as promised.\n\nLogging carried out by the Central Minnesota Council at its Parker Scout Reservation north of St. Cloud in 2005-2007 earned the scouts more than $100,000, records show, but it also drew complaints. One neighbor said she thought the project would be low-impact.\n\n\"I have watched with horror the devastation being exacted on the camp,\" neighbor Mary Novakowski wrote to a state forester. \"The equipment being used has moved through the forest crushing many small trees that might have had a chance to benefit from the open canopy.\"\n\nLogging at Virginia's Pipsico Scout Reservation led to a \"direct discharge\" of sediment into a pond and Chesapeake Bay, degrading waters and harming fish, a consultant's report said.\n\nOn a remote hillside in the Siskiyou National Forest in southwest Oregon, the McCaleb Scout Ranch overlooks the pristine Illinois River, an unobstructed stream with wild runs of salmon and steelhead.\n\nSalvage logging\n\nOfficially declared a state Scenic Waterway in 1970, the Illinois made the nation's list of Wild and Scenic Rivers in 1984.\n\nNevertheless, the Crater Lake Council conducted widespread logging at its camp after the huge Biscuit Fire in 2002. More than six years later, a massive mound of logging debris remained piled on a ravine's edge above the protected salmon stream. \"They savagely logged it,\" Roy Keene, a former timber industry forester-turned-activist, said of the scout camp.\n\nCouncil officials say that after the wildfire, they simply salvaged what revenues they could from the scorched but still valuable timber at the camp. They used the revenue - $67,000 - to rebuild camp buildings lost in the fire. But a growing number of forestry experts say such post-catastrophe logging is ecologically harmful.\n\nThe case is among at least 35 salvage harvests conducted by scouting groups nationwide since 1990, Hearst found.\n\n\"Salvage logging is almost never a positive for ecological recovery,\" said Jerry Franklin, professor of ecosystem analysis for the University of Washington's College of Forestry. \"It is done to salvage economic values.\"\n\nRecent scout-pursued salvage harvests have occurred in Georgia, California, New York, Montana and Pennsylvania after hurricanes, tornadoes, ice storms and insect infestations. After fires in 1999 and 2002, the scouts' National Council conducted by far the largest of scout salvage harvests reviewed - in all, nearly 3,400 acres - at the nation's premier scouting camp, the Philmont Scout Reservation in New Mexico.\n\nSome critics say the 2002 salvage at the McCaleb Ranch on Oregon's Illinois River never should have happened anyway.\n\n\"The old woman who donated that property to the scouts had entered into an agreement with the state to protect it from logging,\" said Keene, senior forester for the Institute of Wildlife Protection\n\n\"No trees, shrubs, or brush shall be destroyed, cut, or removed from the restricted area without a written permit from (the state),\" according to the 1974 easement signed by the donor, the late Betty McCaleb.\n\nNevertheless, the state gave the scout council permission to cut all \"fire-killed trees of merchantable size\" from the 106-acre ranch just a couple weeks after the fire burned across it.\n\nJan Houck, a parks official who approved the plan, said such logging \"isn't necessarily prohibited\" under the easement, \"it just needs our permission first.\"\n\nScout council executive Rick Burr, who was hired after the logging, defended the harvest as \"a one-time deal.\"\n\n\"The money from the (timber) sale was used to rebuild the structures,\" he said.\n\nTo critics, it was a dispiriting transaction.\n\n\"I've got nothing against the Boy Scouts,\" said Joseph Vaile, an Oregon environmental activist. \"But it was really disheartening to see clear-cut logging right next to a Wild and Scenic River.\"",

  "latent_7930": "The “unusual approach” taken by Ontario Court Justice Marvin Zuker in convicting Mustafa Ururyar of raping fellow York University student Mandi Gray came under unusually harsh criticism from an appeal judge Tuesday. During the appeal hearing of Ururyar’s 2016 conviction, Superior Court Justice Michael Dambrot referred to Zuker twice as “lazy,” accused him of “showing off,” observed his reasoning appeared to be “unmoored,” and once, after a lawyer quoted a confusing statement made by Zuker, simply heaved a dramatic sigh.\n\nMandi Gray organized a protest before Tuesday's appeal hearing, in part to highlight the cost of sexual assault on victims. ( Bernard Weil / Toronto Star )\n\nThe central issue to be decided is whether Zuker’s decisions to convict Ururyar and sentence him to 18 months in jail and his comments about the accused showed bias or the appearance of bias. But the hearing ended up spending some time delving into what the role of a judge should be in a time of national public debate about how the criminal justice system prosecutes sexual assault cases. Crown lawyer Danielle Carbonneau argued Zuker’s lengthy commentary about rape myths, victim-blaming, the meaning of informed consent, trauma and the “need to understand the pressures of the legal system and create solutions that change cultural consciousness as well as law” stemmed from the current social context.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nZuker, who is now retired, saw a need to inform and perhaps respond to the public and the media’s concerns given that his decision came in the wake of the high-profile Jian Ghomeshi trial and the Justice Robin Camp inquiry, Carbonneau suggested. “These cases do lead the public to lose confidence in the administration of justice and so it is a pressing objective to try to instill confidence … that courts are not applying these outdated stereotypes,” Carbonneau said. Dambrot disagreed that Zuker took the right approach.\n\nMustafa Ururyar, left, walks out of Superior Court at 361 University Ave. with his lawyer Mark Halfyard after being granted bail in August. Ururyar is appealing his sexual assault convicion, alleging the judge was biased. ( Andrew Lahodynskyj )\n\n“Of course it is important to dispel myths, but you do that by deciding cases correctly and appropriately not by using your podium of reasons for judgment as a place for your own manifesto,” he said. “It is dangerous thing. Judges judge. They should do it right. They should do it according to the principles that apply. And they should do it fairly in accordance with their oath. They should not apply myths and if counsel suggests a myth then (they) absolutely should say ‘what are you talking about?’ ”\n\nUruryar’s lawyer Mark Halfyard argued Zuker’s 179-page judgment is illogical, hard to understand, fails to properly analyze the evidence and, along with his comments in court after the ruling, shows bias against the accused. The judge engaged in a “scathing and personal condemnation” of the accused’s evidence, he argued, adding that Zuker’s academic references, which were never addressed in court, led him to distort the evidence of the accused, or at least create the appearance of bias.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nDambrot slammed Zuker for issuing a 55-page pre-written and printed sentencing decision immediately after hearing defence submissions and without taking time to consider the defence materials. “We are talking about the appearance of justice,” he said, stressing the importance of judges listening with an open mind. He also took issue with the “sarcastic tone” used by Zuker and his habit of regurgitating large portions of evidence verbatim with no analysis. (This isn’t the first time Zuker’s reasons have been criticized. In 2014, Zuker found that a man’s Charter rights had been violated due to racial profiling and acquitted him. But an appeal judge ordered a retrial since “unfortunately, it is not clear what the trial judge did and why he did it.”) Dambrot found it “troublesome” that Zuker spent so much time commenting in general about myths and stereotypes like “nice guys don’t rape” rather thank than making clear factual findings in this particular case. “He spent a lot more time talking about the rape myths than the evidence,” Dambrot said. “There are cases where judges have said next to nothing (about their credibility assessments) but they don’t usually take 179 pages ... if he’s got the time to write 179 pages, he could have written 180 pages.” The hearing spent very little time on whether Zuker made the right decision in convicting Ururyar. Dambrot said the Crown’s explanation of what Zuker meant in his reasons were persuasive. The issue, Dambrot said, that Zuker himself failed to explain why he made the decision he did. “He seems very preoccupied with three-way sex and hot sex but he doesn’t get to the point,” Dambrot said. Carbonneau argued Zuker’s decision to spend a lot of time explaining rape myths was because “rape myths arose in this case as they often do in criminal cases of sexual assault.” (Ururyar’s lawyer disagreed that any rape myths were raised in the case.) But Dambrot said Zuker didn’t clearly connect the rape myths to the evidence in the case, and that if that was all he wanted to do he could have just relied on case law rather than social science research. At one point in the hearing Dambrot suggested that it was simple for judges to avoid rape myths. “It is pretty easy not to apply rape myths,” he said. “You just don’t apply them.” But he was challenged by Gray’s supporters in the courtroom when he suggested there is no rape myth stemming from the defence suggestion Gray made up a false allegation to support a “political agenda.” “Yes there is,” the supporters loudly responded, prompting Dambrot to say they should be quiet or leave the courtroom. A group including Gray left the courtroom shortly after in “utter contempt of the court” as activist Jane Doe later put it. Outside the court, Gray said she sometimes wishes Zuker had just delivered a short and simple decision. “For a lot of reasons I’m annoyed and angry that he needed to pull this male hero type approach to the matter like he could alleviate all the problems of the justice system at the expense of someone who should just be convicted and has now prolonged this for me,” she said. “But on the other hand we wouldn’t be having these conversations otherwise. If the conviction is overturned and a new trial is ordered a key issue in the appeal may also not be decided: whether it was appropriate for Zuker to order Ururyar to pay Gray $8,000 in legal fees for the lawyer she hired. If Dambrot decides to overturn the conviction on other grounds, he may not deal with the question at all. His decision is expected on June 8.",

  "latent_8180": "People love to complain about facadism -- the act of maintaining only the shell of historic structures as part of new development -- but some projects highlight just how successful the practice can be. A case in point is King + Condos at Sherbourne and King, which recently unveiled the painstakingly restored exterior of the former National Hotel.\n\nWhile the building still needs some work completed before a ground floor tenant can move in, the condo has recently started residency and the hoarding has come off the lovely brick facade. It was not without some drama that the development got to this state.\n\nThe developer initially wanted to demolish and rebuild the facade, but the city refused forcing a much more delicate construction process. Back in spring 2013, the site was rather remarkable to behold, as bright yellow braces propped up the remains of the old hotel, which date back to the mid 19th century.\n\nNow, as works begins to wrap up on the project, you have a gorgeous street-level structure that'll breath new life into the intersection. Back in the 1980s, the building looked rather drab despite being in quite good shape given its age. With the brickwork restored and the original paint scheme reinstated, one can once again get a sense for the care with which our old hotels were built.\n\nSo, yes, it would be superb if we could retain buildings like these in their entirety, but this is a decent-looking condo in an area that makes sense. After some wrangling, the developer got it mostly right on this one, and the city benefits for having and old gem at least partially restored to its former glory.\n\nPhotos by Derek Flack, Chris Bateman (#2), and via the Toronto Archives.",

Number two, we've got a whole lot of business that we do with China and Russia, and I'm not going to have one case of a suspect who we're trying to extradite suddenly being elevated to the point where I've got to start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a whole host of other issues,\" the US President said.\n\nObama also dismissed suggestions that the US might try to intercept Snowden if he were allowed to depart Moscow by air and said he is not going to be \"scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker\".\n\nThe US has been seeking Snowden's custody since he leaked details of secret US government surveillance programmes.\n\nWashington has annulled Snowden's passport and wants him returned to face espionage charges.\n\nSnowden is believed to be hiding in the transit area of the Sheremetyevo airport near Moscow, the Russian capital.\n\nEcuador ignores US warning\n\nMeanwhile, Ecuador has announced that it will renounce the trade benefits under a US trade agreement unilaterally to demonstrate its principled approach to the asylum request of Snowden.\n\nState officials said on Thursday that the country will not be subject to pressure from Washington, after a senior US politician issued a strong warning to cut ties with Ecuador if that country takes Snowden in.\n\nSpeaking in a news conference in capital Quito, Communications Minister Fernando Alvarado said that Ecuador gives up, “unilaterally and irrevocably”, the said customs benefits.\n\nIn a deliberately cheeky touch from the leftist government of President Rafael Correa, Ecuador also offered a multimillion donation for human rights training in the US.\n\n\"What's more, Ecuador offers the United States economic aid of $23 million annually, similar to what we received with the trade benefits, with the intention of providing education about human rights,\" Alvarado added.\n\nQuito’s reaction came after Robert Menendez, the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that he would seek to end the preferential treatment for goods if the South American nation offers political asylum to Snowden.\n\nRichard Patino, the country's foreign minister, said on Wednesday during a state visit to Malaysia that it took two months for the country to make a decision in the case of Julian Assange, the founder of whistleblowing website Wikileaks, and that Snowden's case would take at least as long from the time the request was filed.",

  "latent_8573": "Okay, I gotta’ warn you, I may swear a lot in this diary. I’m gonna’ try not to, but I’m not making any promises.\n\nThis whole New Hampshire debate charade between DWS and the Clinton campaign is friggin’ (nice job, Bob!) hilarious! I mean, it is side-splittingly funny! I haven’t stopped laughing all night!\n\nSuddenly, out of nowhere, an unsanctioned debate pops up right on the eve of the New Hampshire primary? (This right after an out-of-the-blue sanctioned forum last night.) Really? And DWS really puts her foot down and shouts, “Absolutely not!” And the Clinton camp immediately acquiesces to the debate and shouts, “We’re in!”\n\nReally? Who couldn’t have predicted this? (I did. Numerous times in the Rec list diary on the debate, and was chastised for my observations by some Clinton folks.)\n\nFuck (damn it!), we did not just fall off the turnip truck, Hillary!\n\nThis kabuki between DWS and Clinton signals only one thing:\n\nComplete fucking desperation on the part the Clinton campaign. I predict right now that their internals in Iowa are in complete free fall. Total collapse. This stupid, transparent stunt has Bill’s reactionary flop-sweat panic all over it.\n\nAnd I am abso-fuckng-lutely loving it!\n\nWhy should Sanders do her a favor and debate her before New Hampshire? He has zero incentive to bail her out. Sanders’ numbers are on the rise in New Hampshire. He slingshots with momentum out of wins in Iowa and New Hampshire into her firewalls of Nevada and South Carolina. (I suspect those numbers are sinking for her, too. How else to explain this inane stunt today?)\n\nAnother bungled Hillary Clinton campaign. Losing the first two states to a Democratic socialist? That has to be galling. And no one on her team saw it coming.\n\nYou know why Clinton and her team of geniuses are worried? Here’s why:\n\nEven though the Clinton team has sought to convey that it has built a national operation, the campaign has invested much of its resources in the Feb. 1 caucuses in Iowa, hoping that a victory there could marginalize Mr. Sanders and set Mrs. Clinton on the path to the nomination. As much as 90 percent of the campaign’s resources are now split between Iowa and the Brooklyn headquarters...\n\nOh my god, this is high comedy. And it’s all the indication we need of what a pathetic general election candidate she’d be. We have been continuously told by the important people that we must nominate Hillary or risk a crushing defeat in November. Tell you what, I think our biggest risk of a crushing defeat in November is nominating Hillary.\n\nI have been writing a few diaries the last few weeks about her flailing and floundering effort:\n\nAbout her choice of King Sleazeball, David Brock to be her designated hit man.\n\nHer decision in the last two years to take millions in speaking fees from the financial and pharma industries and her inability to defend her actions, especially about her three Goldman Sachs speeches.\n\nAbout the campaign’s misjudgments and misallocation of resources and putting all their eggs in the Iowa basket.\n\nHer decision to hold a big ticket fundraiser just days before the Iowa caucus hosted by an investment firm that may be facing federal scrutiny for its shady practices.\n\nThe miscalculations made by her campaign that have brought her to a point where she is being seriously challenged by a 74-year-old, self-described Democratic socialist from a tiny state, including her campaign’s decision to limit debates:\n\nOh, and about making sure Debbie Wasserman Shultz and the DNC limited debates, and, thus, limited exposure for Hillary’s opponents? (And, yes, the Clinton team pressed DWS and the DNC to limit debates.) That plan has backfired, too:\n\nQuoting The New York Times:\n\nSeveral Clinton advisers are also regretting that they did not push for more debates, where Mrs. Clinton excels, to more skillfully marginalize Mr. Sanders over his Senate votes in support of the gun industry and the enormous costs and likely tax increases tied to his big-government agenda. Instead Mrs. Clinton, who entered the race as the prohibitive favorite, played it safe, opting for as few debates as possible...\n\nSo tell me again how this new New Hampshire debate “just popped up.”\n\nI’m sorry… I just cannot stop laughing.\n\nI think she still has the inside track to the nomination based on her massive institutional advantages. But, by no means, is she necessarily a better bet in November. These past couple of weeks of inane, backfiring attacks and outright stupidity on the part of her campaign provide dangerous omens for this fall should she be our nominee.\n\nUPDATE\n\nThis from Politico this evening:\n\nBut a few hours later, the DNC countered with a statement from chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. “Our next DNC-sanctioned debate featuring our major candidates will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin hosted by PBS on February 11th, with another already scheduled for March 9th with Univision and the Washington Post,” Wasserman Schultz said. “We have no plans to sanction any further debates before the upcoming First in the Nation caucuses and primary, but will reconvene with our campaigns after those two contests to review our schedule.\" That statement landed minutes after Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri said the front-runner would be happy to participate in the proposed debate if the other candidates joined, thereby allowing it to be sanctioned.\n\nLove it...",
  "latent_8577": "Yesterday afternoon, FC Dallas held a media event at the American Airlines Center debuting the brand new Budweiser Poolball that will become a fixture on the Budweiser Beer Garden. It was a great event that doubled as a sort of media day and I was able to get some exclusive time with Doug Quinn to chat about a number of topics including Fernando Clavijo, opening day with NBC, a jersey sponsorship update and much more. Look for exclusives with Ugo Ihemelu and Clavijo coming up on Thursday and Friday!\n\nThis interview is a bit of a daunting read, but I thought it would be good to post the entire thing as getting this time with the GM is pretty rare and I think there's some really great stuff in here including $4 20oz beer on the beer garden(!), an update on how ticket sales are going for opening day and more.\n\nFirst off, talk about your excitement to have Fernando Clavijo here in Dallas\n\nI’m beyond excited…he’s my guy, the administration that I’ve gotten to build in the past year and a half, after we decided to go in a different direction with technical director last year, we said what do we need? We didn’t rush which is I think the important thing and we started looking at what we need. What we need and what everyone else needs in the league are much different because of who we are. We’re not just a pro team, we’re a youth development program and we have the #1 academy in the country. The business that we want to build is a business that replicates the models of the Barcelonas, Madrids, Ajax’s and Chivas Guadalajaras of the world where you start with kids as young as seven years old, you develop them through the system and you have homegrown players like we have many of and you have guys that have the ability to make it to your 18, ultimately your 11, and become Messi or Rooney.\n\nKeep reading, trust me you don't want to miss any of this interview\n\nBut you also have guys that you showcase out and loan out in the world and you can be able to generate revenue like Brazil does basically as a machine giving our young American players opportunities all over the world and driving up revenue for us to continue to raise the quality of product on the field. He knows exactly how to do all of that. In his spot with Traffic Sports as an agent in Miami and Central America, Latin America, he knows everybody and in real time knows everybody because the names and faces and everything changes at clubs and agencies. The relationships he has with them are right now. The relationships he has with Major League Soccer, and Major League soccer moves a little differently, the people up in New York I kind of know those as well, but he knows both games. He knows the college game, he scouted college, he knows MLS and probably best of all is that he and Schellas are very like minded and add that to the fact that Dan Hunt has basically been our pseudo-technical director for the past X months. He and Fernando are very like minded. Also, his meeting with Clark Hunt, the chairman, went incredibly well. All of us recognized his character, all of us recognized his unique skill sets and all of us recognize he would be a perfect fit for us.\n\nFernando said everything came together very quick, can you talk about the process of this hiring?\n\nIt did come really really quick. I basically said, we’ve gotten through the draft, we’ve gotten through building the team for 2012, really I was not under any pressure to find somebody in time for the summer transfer window, maybe Aprilish, but his resume came across my desk from Schellas and I called him up. We chatted for an hour and a half, and it was a great conversation. I asked him if he was going to be in Dallas any time soon and he said he would be here for the U23 Mexico-USA game. That was like the next week so I said great, Clark and Dan happened to be here, Schellas was here, I was here, so we all just sat down had a conversation and we unanimously looked at each other, including Fernando, and said do you want to do this? And he said yeah, I want to do this and it was over and done.\n\nMoving on to opening day, you’ve got a lot of new initiatives coming along, what did you identify from last year that maybe you needed to improve on this year and what are you most excited about with your improvements.\n\nThe most important thing you can do with any club is create an organic environment that will stimulate involvement and engagement by your fans. Our fans are 18-34+, the sweet spot is that 20-28 year olds and they don’t remember the world without soccer in America and Major League Soccer. Supporters groups don’t happen by someone saying \"we need to build a supporters group\" they happen organically and you create an environment that allows them to do the things they want to do and be excited. So we did two things, one we took all our pregame activities and focused them inside the stadium. Last year we had the march to the match, beer garden, north concourse, this year there’s three spaces everything is inside. The club, we’ve completely renovated, the Winstar River Club, we hired an all new concessionaire, the guys that do the Cowboys and the Yankees, they’re going to have an amazing experience in the club. We also created something completely brand new called Lamar’s Tailgate. If you know Lamar, or knew Lamar, and I’m from Kansas City, he put on the greatest tailgates in the history of the world. So in honor of that, we have that great piece of real estate in the north concourse, we talked to the Legends people and I said \"if FC Dallas were a food, what would it be?\" and I said, of course, Bar B Que, so we bought a 1,000 pound, $18,000 bar b que and the other thing is street tacos, street food is all hip and cool right now…were also going to have food specials before every game. So you can come in and if a beer, braut and bag of chips is $12.50 it will be $10 or something like that, every game will be something different. We’ll have the same thing down on the beer garden for those 21 and older, we will have poolball going on, foosball tables, HD tv’s and even more exciting to me is we put 225 seats down on the field. So the beer garden now flows into those seats and those seats are sold on a per game basis, we’re not selling season tickets so that’s the environment for that 21 and older crowd. Budweiser has done an amazing job, they’re putting in a neon sign right now that was not cheap. All the standing tables, we’re adding, I want to say 50 tables to the beer garden, you can get in-game beer service in the bleachers and, by the way, a 20oz beer is going to be $4 bucks. The other big change, food specials every game so if you’re on a budget you can have something to drink and eat and it won’t break the bank. Also, we’re going to maintain those specials all game long because it’s an enclosed space, like the club, you can have beer and it goes past the 75th minute all the way through. Because we’ve made it a closed club, now food can’t go in and out and the fact that we’re extending it all the way through the game.\n\nHow did it come about getting NBC to come to Frisco for the first game?\n\nFirst kick has become an increasingly important initiative to Major League Soccer, the most important thing for the league is to put their best foot forward to the public. The commissioner called me and he says \"can you sell out opening day?\" and I said \"Who are you going to give me?\" he said \"how about New York\" and we just finished with them so absolutely. We almost always sell out New York anyways, in my tenure we sell out LA, New York, Opening day and fourth of July, so I think we’ve got about 2,000 tickets left, we’ll be sold out even if the rain comes and I don’t think it’s going to. With that, we started talking about the programming things and we’re going to put on a heck of a show, it’s going to be something to see.\n\nSelling out opening day and LA is great, but what is the key to selling out next weekend against Portland and so on…\n\nThat’s simple too, you’ve got to have season tickets. The foundation of any professional sports franchise, I don’t care what league it is or what sport it is, is you’ve got to have season ticket holders. We tripled season tickets last year, we’ll double season tickets this year, we’re already up 40% over last year and that was a week ago. We’re selling at a pretty rapid pace, our ticket sales department is, I want to say 300 times larger than when I started. It’s a large group and they’re all trained. The great thing is the culture of the place is everyone recognizes that everyone is working very hard. The guys on the field, the coaches are working very hard and also it’s a special place and a special time. In the next two to three years, my vision is sold out 18 games and a waiting list and there’s no reason we shouldn’t have that with the size of the soccer market in Dallas. Even if we just went after Collin County, that’s 2 million people within 20 miles of the building, that’s bigger than Kansas City.\n\nDo you feel the team as it’s built right now can compete for MLS Cup?\n\nOh, absolutely. I think this team can win MLS Cup, the challenges for us, and for everyone else, is you’ve got to stay healthy all year and it’s a long season. The other challenge for us is I’ve got a lot of guys that are going to be going off to the Olympics or national team duties which is a good problem because any other good teams are going to have the same problem. I’d rather have a bunch of those guys than non-those guys.\n\nWhere are we at on a jersey sponsor? Is it the kind of thing like the technical director where it could come together very fast but you’re waiting for the right spot?\n\nIt could exactly be like that, same thing with the naming rights partner. Part of the challenge is that I just haven’t had the time, in the past 18 months my first focus was to build my executive team, the second focus was to build the right plan and really get my handle around what needed to be changed and what needed to build a winning team on and off the field. I’ve got the executive team in place, Fernando[Clavijo] was the final piece to the puzzle. Because I didn’t have a Fernando for a long period of time, I’ve been operating as general manager as well as chief business officer and now that I have him, no one is happier than me and my commercial group because now my focus is going to be on jersey and stadium rights as well as servicing all other commercial needs which is what I was truly brought in to do.\n\nAre you hoping to bring in another international team this summer?\n\nWe are, obviously we’re working with the Cowboys for the Brazil-Mexico game. We’ve been working witht hem on a number of possible games. The reality this year is with the Euros, I don’t want to get a B team or an A team without their A players. I’ve seen what Inter Milan is without their A players, I’ve seen what Barcelona is without their best and if we’re going to do it, we’re going to do it right. There are going to be opportunities, you’ll see the Rio Grande Plate again whether its Tigres or another Mexican club. We had an amazing experience in Cancun with Atlante and they really are working very hard with us for us to do that every year…so we’re going to definitely have a Mexican team but I’m not going to have a team that’s not right.\n\nSo what do you think? Are you ready for Sunday yet?",

  "latent_8680": "Cathelicidin gene characterization\n\nSix cathelicidins were identified in the Tasmanian devil genome. Cathelicidin names were assigned at random and do not imply their position on the chromosome or orthology with other species. All six cathelicidins are located on chromosome two29, however their relative positions on the chromosome are unknown due to the fragmented nature of the genome assembly.\n\nMultiple sequence alignment revealed that Tasmanian devil peptides contained all the characteristic features of cathelicidins, including peptide domains and motifs (Supplementary Figure S1). All six genes contained four exons, similar to other cathelicidins. The prepropeptides ranged from 154 to 172 amino acids in length and contained a signal peptide, conserved cathelin domain and variable antimicrobial domain.\n\nThe signal peptide sequence ranged from 21–27 amino acids in length with a high proportion of leucine residues. The cathelin domain ranged from 89 to 95 amino acid residues in length and contained a number of conserved residues. The characteristic four cysteine motif, which is an identifying feature of cathelicidins, was present and is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. The antimicrobial domain was highly variable in length and composition, ranging from 20 to 37 amino acids with a high proportion of charged residues. This imparts a cationic charge on the mature peptide, ranging from 3.9 to 8.1 at pH7 (Table 1). Few conserved residues were evident, with only 17 to 47% similarity amongst Tasmanian devil mature peptide sequences. Significant sequence heterogeneity was also observed within marsupial mature peptides, as Tasmanian devil sequences were only 15–40% similar to tammar wallaby and 3–30% to opossum.\n\nTable 1: The amino acid sequence of six Tasmanian devil cathelicidins, their molecular weight, charge at pH7 and hydrophobic percentage. Full size table\n\nAs expected, Tasmanian devil cathelicidins cluster with those of other marsupials in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1), indicating that they are more similar to marsupial cathelicidins than to those of monotremes or eutherians. Saha-CATH1 and 2 cluster with opossum and tammar wallaby cathelicidins, suggesting that these genes arose prior to the divergence of these species around 70 million years ago30. In comparison, Saha-CATH3, 5 and 6 form a species-specific clade, which suggests that they have arisen through more recent gene duplications.\n\nFigure 1: Neighbour joining phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary relationships among Tasmanian devil Saha-CATH1 to 6, tammar wallaby MaeuCath 1 to 8, opossum Modo-CATH1 to 7 and 9 to 12, platypus Oran-CATH1 to 7, human CAMP, mouse CAMP, pig Protegrin-1 and PMAP-37, cow Bac5, BMAP-27 and BMAP-28, sheep SMAP-29 and chicken fowlicidin-1. Full size image\n\nExpression profile\n\nExpression level of Tasmanian devil cathelicidins were assessed in a wide range of immune, reproductive, secretory, respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues using relative qPCR (Fig. 2). Saha-CATH1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 were expressed in all tissues tested, whilst Saha-CATH3 was not expressed in the pouch, lung or heart. As expected, all six cathelicidins were present in blood, spleen and lymph node as they are stored within neutrophil granules. Saha-CATH1 and 4 were most highly expressed in the blood, whilst Saha-CATH3, 5 and 6 were most highly expressed in the spleen. Conversely, Saha-CATH2 was present at the lowest levels within the spleen and was most highly expressed in the pouch. Saha-CATH1, 4, 5 and 6 were also expressed in the pouch at lower levels compared to their expression in other tissues. Additionally, transcripts of Saha-CATH1, 2, 5 and 6 were also detected in a milk transcriptome31. Cathelicidin expression within the mouth mucosa, skin, pouch, uterus and milk supports their functional role in protecting naïve young during development.\n\nFigure 2: Relative fold expression of Tasmanian devil cathelicidin genes in different tissues. For each cathelicidin, relative expression was calculated in comparison to the tissue with the lowest expression (i.e. the tissue with fold 1 expression in each graph). Three tissues (pouch, lung, and heart) that showed no detectable Saha-CATH3 expression were not included in the CATH3 graph. Full size image\n\nChange of pouch microbiome during lactation\n\nTo test the hypothesis that the microbial community in devil’s pouch undergoes compositional changes in response to lactation, we examined the pouch microbiota of three non-lactating and three lactating devils by sequencing PCR amplicons of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region (around 465 bp) on the Illumina MiSeq System. A total of 468,268 sequences were obtained after quality filtering, with the smallest number of sequences obtained for one sample being 44,880 and the largest being 116,364. These sequences were grouped into 4,410 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which were categorised to 26 bacterial phyla, 79 classes, 138 orders, 261 families, and 487 genera. Consistent with previous observation32, the pouch flora of non-lactating devils consisted mainly of bacteria from five phyla: Proteobacteria (35.3%), Firmicutes (28.4%), Fusobacteria (27.5%), Bacteroidetes (5.7%), and Actinobacteria (1.9%) (Fig. 3).\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of pouch microbiome between non-lactating (NL) and lactating (L) Tasmanian devils. (A) Relative abundance of bacterial families. (B) PCoA analysis of unweighted UniFrac distances. (C) Bacterial phylotype richness inferred using Chao1 metric and 40,000 sequences for rarefaction. Full size image\n\nSeveral differences were detected between the pouch of non-lactating and lactating devils (Fig. 3). Firstly, the unweighted UniFrac distance within the non-lactating group (0.58 ± 0.03) was significantly lower than the distance between lactating and non-lactating samples (0.68 ± 0.07), suggesting a high degree of compositional dissimilarity between the pouch flora of non-lactating and lactating devils. This can be seen in the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plot (Fig. 3) where non-lactating samples grouped together but were separate from the lactating samples. Thirty-four OTUs exhibited significantly lower relative abundance in the lactating pouch than in non-lactating samples (Wilcoxon rank sum test p < 0.05), with the most pronounced changes occurring in the level of Leptotrichiaceae (20.9% in non-lactating samples vs. 0.4% in lactating), Porphyromonas (4.5% vs. 0.3%), Pasteurellaceae (1.7% vs. 0.1%), and Parvimonas (1.0% vs. 0.2%). Despite the decrease in these bacteria, the overall level of bacterial diversity in the pouch of lactating and non-lactating devils was similar (Fig. 3), which may be a result of faecal contamination from the pouch young. Indeed, the prevalence of Cetobacterium (1.9% in non-lactating samples vs. 10.9% in lactating) and Clostridium (1.0% vs. 4.3%), two genera that are main components of devil gut microbiota, significantly increased in the pouch that had pouch young present.\n\nAntimicrobial activity\n\nTo assess the antimicrobial activity of devil cathelicidins, we tested synthesized mature peptides on 25 bacterial and 6 fungal strains (Table 2). As there were no Tasmanian devil specific isolates available, human and veterinary strains were used. The antimicrobial activity of Tasmanian devil cathelicidin mature peptides Saha-CATH1 to 6 against bacteria and fungi is summarised in Table 2. Saha-CATH1, 2 and 4 did not show antimicrobial activity against the bacteria and fungi tested, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of greater than 64 μg/mL. As such, these values are not included in Table 2. Saha-CATH3 had highly specific activity, as it was unable to kill any bacteria, but killed Cryptococcus neoformans. Saha-CATH6 killed a number of Streptococcus species and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF), however was ineffective against other bacteria. On the other hand, Saha-CATH5 had broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and killed the drug resistant pathogens VREF and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Table 2). The antifungal activity of Saha-CATH5 and 6 was more restricted, but both peptides showed activity against Candida krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. The MIC values for ampicillin, tetracycline and fluconazole were within the acceptable limits for ATCC strains according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI) guidelines, and are included in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Antimicrobial activity of Tasmanian devil cathelicidins Saha-CATH3, 5 and 6 against bacteria and fungi, expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Full size table\n\nCytotoxicity and haemolysis\n\nFurther experiments were carried out to assess cytotoxic and haemolytic potencies of devil cathelicidin mature peptides. Tasmanian devil cathelicidin mature peptides Saha-CATH1, 2, 3 and 4 were not toxic to the human cell line A549 as seen in Fig. 4a. Cell survival of Saha-CATH1 treated cells remained close to the control at all concentrations. Survival of Saha-CATH2 treated cells also remained close to the control over dilutions ranging between 1.9 μg/mL to 250 μg/mL, however survival of cells at 500 μg/mL was significantly higher than the growth control (p < 0.05). The same pattern was observed for Saha-CATH3 at 1.9, 7.9, 15.6 and 250 μg/mL and all dilutions of Saha-CATH4 ranging between 15.6 to 500 μg/mL (p < 0.05). The significant increase in cell survival above the level of the untreated growth control, as seen in Fig. 4a, does not necessarily indicate cathelicidins are inducing proliferation of A549 cells, rather it is more likely a reflection of cell growth throughout the assay. Alamar blue is an indicator of mitochondrial activity, hence cell growth during the assay results in an increase in the reduction of alamar blue and an elevated percentage cell survival relative to the growth control. Cell survival of Saha-CATH5 and 6 treated cells was significantly higher than the growth control over the concentrations of 1.9 to 250 μg/mL, and 3.9 to 250 μg/mL respectively (p < 0.05). As such, Saha-CATH5 and 6 were non toxic up to a concentration of 250 μg/mL. Saha-CATH5 was the most toxic as treatment of cells with 500 μg/mL resulted in 42% cell survival compared to the untreated growth control (p < 0.05). Similarly, treatment with Saha-CATH6 at the same concentration resulted in 59% cell survival (p < 0.05).\n\nFigure 4: Toxicity of Tasmanian devil cathelicidins Saha-CATH1 to 6 to human cells.

Full size image\n\nThe majority of Tasmanian devil cathelicidin mature peptides did not lyse human red blood cells as shown in Fig. 4b. Saha-CATH1, 2, 3 and 4 caused very low levels of haemolysis, below 7% at all concentrations compared with the positive control. Despite this, mean absorbance values for red blood cells treated with Saha-CATH2 at 500 μg/mL, Saha-CATH3 at 250 and 500 μg/mL and Saha-CATH4 from 125 to 500 μg/mL were significantly different from the negative control (p < 0.05). Similarly, mean absorbance values of Saha-CATH5 and 6 from 31.25 to 125 μg/mL were significantly different from the negative control (p < 0.05), however lysis remained below 15% at these concentrations. Saha-CATH6 was moderately haemolytic at 250 and 500 μg/mL, however lysis remained below 26% (p < 0.05). In support of the cytotoxicity data above, Saha-CATH5 was the most toxic as it caused 37% haemolysis at 500 μg/mL (p < 0.05).",

While it lacks eyes, it has pointed ears with purple insides and a mouth with two sharp teeth on each jaw. A male will have larger fangs than the female. It has purple wing membranes support by two, elongated fingers, and two long, thin, tails.\n\nZubat lives in abundance in caves. It has evolved to have neither eyes nor nostrils, instead navigating through dark environments with echolocation. As demonstrated in the anime, it will leave its abode at night with a mass of other Zubat in order to seek prey. During the daytime, Zubat sleeps hanging upside down in caves, forests, or under the eaves of old buildings, avoiding sunlight at all costs. Daylight causes Zubat to become unhealthy, and prolonged exposure can even burn its skin.

Also, Zubat and Woobat have somewhat similar English names, both having rhyming prefixes and bat as a suffix.\n\nas a suffix. Zubat and its evolutionary relatives share their category with Woobat. They are all known as the Bat Pokémon.\n\nZubat, along with Golbat, has appeared in every regional Pokédex. This is due to the Unova Pokédex's expansion in Black 2 and White 2.\n\nZubat and Golbat are the only Pokémon to appear in the lineup of every villainous team in the main series games.\n\nZubat can be seen as a parallel to Noibat, as they are both Flying-type Pokémon based on bats and can have Infiltrator as a possible Ability. They also share the same base stats, with their Attack and Special Attack switched around.\n\nOrigin\n\nZubat's design is inspired by bats, specifically vampire bats, which produce toxic saliva with anticoagulant properties that is secreted when biting prey to draw blood. Zubat's lack of eyes is a reference to troglomorphism, and may also be influenced by the misconception that bats are blind or primarily dependent on echolocation to navigate. The claim that Zubat suffers harm, and even burns, when exposed to sunlight alludes to mythological vampires.\n\nName origin\n\nZubat may be a pun based on both bat and ずばっと zubatto, an onomatopoeia for when an edged tool forcefully pierces something (possibly referring to its fangs or the sound a bat makes).\n\nIn other languages\n\nRelated articles",

  "latent_9144": "UPTON, NY – In a step toward engineering ever-smaller electronic devices, scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory have assembled nanoscale pairings of particles that show promise as miniaturized power sources. Composed of light-absorbing, colloidal quantum dots linked to carbon-based fullerene nanoparticles, these tiny two-particle systems can convert light to electricity in a precisely controlled way.\n\n“This is the first demonstration of a hybrid inorganic/organic, dimeric (two-particle) material that acts as an electron donor-bridge-acceptor system for converting light to electrical current,” said Brookhaven physical chemist Mircea Cotlet, lead author of a paper describing the dimers and their assembly method in Angewandte Chemie.\n\nBy varying the length of the linker molecules and the size of the quantum dots, the scientists can control the rate and the magnitude of fluctuations in light-induced electron transfer at the level of the individual dimer. “This control makes these dimers promising power-generating units for molecular electronics or more efficient photovoltaic solar cells,” said Cotlet, who conducted this research with materials scientist Zhihua Xu at Brookhaven’s Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN, http://www.bnl.gov/cfn/).\n\nScientists seeking to develop molecular electronics have been very interested in organic donor-bridge-acceptor systems because they have a wide range of charge transport mechanisms and because their charge-transfer properties can be controlled by varying their chemistry. Recently, quantum dots have been combined with electron-accepting materials such as dyes, fullerenes, and titanium oxide to produce dye-sensitized and hybrid solar cells in the hope that the light-absorbing and size-dependent emission properties of quantum dots would boost the efficiency of such devices. But so far, the power conversion rates of these systems have remained quite low.\n\n“Efforts to understand the processes involved so as to engineer improved systems have generally looked at averaged behavior in blended or layer-by-layer structures rather than the response of individual, well-controlled hybrid donor-acceptor architectures,” said Xu.\n\nThe precision fabrication method developed by the Brookhaven scientists allows them to carefully control particle size and interparticle distance so they can explore conditions for light-induced electron transfer between individual quantum dots and electron-accepting fullerenes at the single molecule level.\n\nThe entire assembly process takes place on a surface and in a stepwise fashion to limit the interactions of the components (particles), which could otherwise combine in a number of ways if assembled by solution-based methods. This surface-based assembly also achieves controlled, one-to-one nanoparticle pairing.\n\nTo identify the optimal architectural arrangement for the particles, the scientists strategically varied the size of the quantum dots – which absorb and emit light at different frequencies according to their size – and the length of the bridge molecules connecting the nanoparticles. For each arrangement, they measured the electron transfer rate using single molecule spectroscopy.\n\n“This method removes ensemble averaging and reveals a system’s heterogeneity – for example fluctuating electron transfer rates – which is something that conventional spectroscopic methods cannot always do,” Cotlet said.\n\nThe scientists found that reducing quantum dot size and the length of the linker molecules led to enhancements in the electron transfer rate and suppression of electron transfer fluctuations.\n\n“This suppression of electron transfer fluctuation in dimers with smaller quantum dot size leads to a stable charge generation rate, which can have a positive impact on the application of these dimers in molecular electronics, including potentially in miniature and large-area photovoltaics,” Cotlet said.\n\n“Studying the charge separation and recombination processes in these simplified and well-controlled dimer structures helps us to understand the more complicated photon-to-electron conversion processes in large-area solar cells, and eventually improve their photovoltaic efficiency,” Xu added.\n\nA U.S. patent application is pending on the method and the materials resulting from using the technique, and the technology is available for licensing.

  "latent_9150": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — Steve Bannon said the campaign crisis created last year with the revelation of Donald Trump’s ribald conversation with “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush proved to be a moment that showed who was loyal to Trump and who was not.\n\nIn an interview with Charlie Rose of “60 Minutes,” Bannon said that the release of the Bush tape during the fall campaign was a “litmus test.”\n\n“And I said it the other day to [White House Chief of Staff] General [John] Kelly during the Charlottesville thing, afterwards. It’s a line I remember from the movie ‘The Wild Bunch,'” he said. “William Holden uses it right before that huge gunfight at the end. ‘When you side with a man, you side with him,’ okay? The good and the bad. You can criticize him behind, but when you side with him, you have to side with him.”\n\n“CBS This Morning” released more excerpts of the interview on Friday. The full interview will air Sunday on “60 Minutes.”\n\nAfter The Washington Post released the tape on Friday, Oct. 8, it created a crisis in the campaign and over that weekend, a number of Republicans called on Trump to drop out of the race. Bannon, who served as campaign CEO and later White House chief strategist, said that Reince Priebus, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Trump, “You have two choices. You either drop out right now, or you lose by the biggest landslide in American political history.”\n\nRelated Steve Bannon on ’60 Minutes’: Catholic Bishops ‘Need Illegal Aliens to Fill the Churches’\n\nBut Bannon said that he told Trump that he still had a “100% probability of winning.”\n\n“And that’s what Billy Bush weekend showed me,” Bannon said. “Billy Bush Saturday showed me who really had Donald Trump’s back to play to his better angels. All you had to do, and what he did, was go out and continue to talk to the American people. … People didn’t care. They knew Donald Trump was just doing locker room talk with a guy. And they dismissed it. It had no lasting impact on the campaign. Yet, if you see the mainstream media that day, it was, literally, he was falling into Dante’s Inferno.”\n\nTrump dismissed his conversation with Bush as “locker room talk.” But in the interview, Rose pressed Bannon on that characterization, given that Trump talked about grabbing a woman “by the p—-.” Bannon, though, insisted that it was merely “locker room talk” that working class voters didn’t care about.\n\nAs they weighed their options after the tape’s release, Bannon said that he continued to insist Trump would win.\n\n“Appealing to the American people and to the working class people in this country, absolutely. You know why? ‘Cause – it was a winner. That’s why I told him ‘double down’ every time. And on that day, that’s the first time and only time he ever got upset with me. He goes, ‘Come on, it’s not 100%.’ I go, ‘It’s absolutely 100%.’ And I told him why. ‘They don’t care.'”\n\nBannon also said that Chris Christie, who had endorsed Trump, fell out of favor that weekend when he didn’t show up to support Trump.\n\n“I told him, ‘The plane leaves at 11 o’clock in the morning. If you’re on the plane, you’re on the team.’ Didn’t make the plane,” Bannon said.",

  "latent_9705": "Apple CEO Tim Cook revealing the new MacBook. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith The new MacBook is Apple's thinnest, lightest laptop ever. But it's also a major step backward.\n\nSpeed test data uploaded to Geekbench reveals that when it comes to the processor, the new laptop is on par with the MacBook Air that Apple released way back in 2011, MacRumors reports.\n\nThe processor has a single-core score of 1,924 and a multi-core score of 4,038. (A higher number is better, indicating faster speeds.) In contrast, the mid-2011 i5 MacBook Air clocks in with 2,192 and 4,288.\n\nFor reference, the high-end mid-2014 MacBook Pro has a single-core score of 3,876, and 14,703 for multi-core.\n\nThe data comes from a single MacBook rather than a combined average of multiple tests (as is standard on Geekbench), and it has since been deleted. (A cached version is available here.) But it's in keeping with what we know about Intel Core M processors, which Digital Trends notes \"are slower than their standard Core equivalents.\"\n\nOf course, the new Macbook will have other advantages over the 2011 MacBook Air. Its graphics processing will be considerably faster, for example, and most likely contribute to faster overall performance.\n\nBut still: The device's processor is weaker than one included in Apple devices four years ago. It's just part of the extraordinary lengths Apple has undergone to cut down on the size of its latest laptop. The device has also been criticised for ditching all its traditional ports — including the charger — in favour of a single universal USB-C port. This means users can't plug in a second screen or copy files to their iPhone at the same time as charging their MacBook unless they buy an add-on splitter cable.\n\nPhotos of the inside of the device also reveal that the actual logic board — the brain of the computer — has been shrunk down to a tiny size to make room for all the batteries required. According to Digital Trends, its logic board is actually smaller than the notably compact Raspberry Pi computer.\n\nAs Geekbench's speed test suggests, that size comes as cost.",
  "latent_9768": "Every couple of months, I see another post in my Facebook feed about a band that was cut off by an 18-wheeler or skidded on a patch of black ice and rolled their van into a ditch. Some members are injured, and they’re launching a Kickstarter campaign to pay for medical bills and to get back on their feet.\n\nMy heart (and often, money) goes out to them. But if you need to crowdfund your hospital costs, you were never on your feet to begin with. After many years as a touring artist myself, I’m honestly surprised that the person in that ditch has never been me.\n\nTouring is, of course, the most ancient business model available to artists — and in many ways, it remains a vital part of their livelihood, even while the surrounding industry undergoes major upheaval to accommodate the new paradigm of streaming music. In response to the shift in revenue sources, standard recording contracts now intrude into the numerous nonrecording aspects of an artist’s career. But the advice given to the creative generators of this multibillion dollar industry is still one that would be recognizable to a medieval troubadour: Go on tour.\n\nAnd yet from a business standpoint, it’s hard to find a model more unsustainable than one that relies on a single human body. This is why we have vice presidents, relief pitchers and sixth men. When applied to music’s seemingly limitless streaming future, the only scarce resource left is the artists themselves. You would think the industry would protect such an important piece of its business model, but in fact, the opposite is true.",
  "latent_10016": "Feature\n\nApple's force sensing 3D Touch technology is greatly expanded in the newly released iOS 10 update, adding new capabilities to the Control Center shortcuts for flashlight, timer, calculator, camera, and smart home accessories. In addition, Control Center marks the only place in iOS 10 where Apple emulates 3D Touch on non-3D Touch devices.\n\nControl Center gets a major revamp in iOS 10, adding new dedicated panes for music and HomeKit controls. But there are also hidden capabilities within the update, found only by pressing firmly on the Control Center shortcuts.On the main Control Center view, four icons remain, offering quick links to flashlight, timer, calculator and camera. Press with force against these on an iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus or the iPhone 6s series, and you'll discover new 3D Touch options for even greater control.With the flashlight, Apple offers users the ability to choose brightness intensity levels of low, medium and high.For the timer shortcut, a 3D Touch press brings up four quick options: 1 hour, 20 minutes, 5 minutes, or 1 minute.The camera shortcut in Control Center can be pressed firmly to bring up options to take a traditional photo, record in slow motion, record a video, or take a selfie.Finally, the calculator shortcut will present users with the ability to copy the last result from the application.Swiping toward the left from the traditional Control Center input brings up a dedicated music menu, which does not have any 3D Touch capabilities. But one more swipe toward the left presents a new HomeKit view where 3D Touch input is possible.In the default \"Favorite Accessories\" view, using 3D Touch on a specific accessory pops up a new menu with more advanced controls. In the case of HomeKit-connected light bulbs, 3D Touch offers quick access to brightness controls, as well as another menu link to adjusting colors. A total of six default colors are presented, and can be edited to a user's liking.The HomeKit Control Center menu also features a link to user-programmed scenes. These can also be pressed with 3D Touch to access further options, based on devices and settings.The new Home Control Center is noteworthy because it appears to be the only place in iOS 10 where Apple \"emulates\" 3D Touch on legacy devices. Presumably because of the necessity of offering more advanced brightness/color controls for bulbs without cluttering the interface, a long press on HomeKit items in Control Center will \"pop\" open the item when using an iPhone SE, iPhone 6 series or earlier.In other instances of 3D Touch input on non-3D Touch devices— such as actionable notifications on the lock screen, where users must swipe left and select from menu options— Apple has found other, less convenient ways to interact with the content.This article was originally published in June following Apple's announcement of iOS 10 at WWDC 2016. It has been updated and republished to coincide with the mobile operating system's public release. For more on iOS 10, see AppleInsider's ongoing Inside iOS 10",

  "latent_10144": "When preparing my last blog “Perth’s population – a story of economic boom”, I initially made a statement which I’ve long believed, though I forgot where I heard it. That is the “fact” that Perth is the most remote city of more than a million people on Earth. It seems right (certainly a long flight from Sydney or Melbourne and then it’s the Indian Ocean for many thousands of km in the other direction!) It’s been quoted about the place, and I’ve always taken it at face value.\n\nSo I checked it. Turns out, it’s false.\n\nThis Wikipedia article states that this meme came from Bill Bryson in his book Down Under, but says that it was originally about cities of more than 500,000, which isn’t how I originally heard it, it was definitely a million.\n\nThe nearest city of over 1 million (or 500,000) to Perth is Adelaide, which is 2,104km away as the (Adelaide) crow flies.\n\nIf you use 1 million population as the criterion, the most remote city in the world is actually Auckland, New Zealand. Auckland is 2,153km from Sydney, and with no other million cities in New Zealand, Sydney is the closest to Auckland. This is 49km further than Adelaide to Perth.\n\nIf you use 500,000 people as the criterion, which the original statement apparently did, then Honolulu, population 953,000 in the 2010 Census wins hands-down, having about three-quarters of the population of Hawaii and being 3,841km from San Francisco the closest large city. Not only that, Honolulu’s population is rapidly growing towards the 1 million mark, and then there can be no argument.\n\nMaybe Bill Bryson was referring to road distance, in which case it’s about 2,600km from Adelaide to Perth. But in that case, it’s hardly fair to Honolulu or Auckland which you can’t drive to from the next equivalent size city.\n\nMaybe it’s all about a feeling of remoteness? Certainly Perth feels more remote than Auckland, which has many other significant sized centres in New Zealand within a few hundred km, while most of the other centres in WA require a flight to reach from Perth, or a very very long drive.\n\nAs always, definitions of these things are tricky – while these sort of demographic statements can ring true, it doesn’t mean they’re always correct – anyway I won’t be using that particular meme again!\n\nLearn more about the City of Perth’s population.

  "latent_10187": "Computer network upgrades will put Wayne State University researchers in the fast lane\n\nDecember 20, 2012\n\nDETROIT – Researchers at Wayne State University are about to experience a power surge in the ability to do their jobs, thanks to an upgraded computer network infrastructure supported by a federal grant.\n\nDavid Cinabro, Ph.D., professor of physics and astronomy in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, is principal investigator for the project, which comprises two major components and will be funded with a two-year, $360,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (No. 1245719).\n\nThe first component builds a dedicated, very high-speed network that will enable WSU researchers to transmit and receive large amounts of data quickly, across the campus or around the world. Those researchers may include physicists who collaborate on international projects in particle, nuclear and astrophysics; computer scientists working on high-speed networking; and biomedical researchers sequencing genes.\n\nThe dedicated network, or “Science DMZ,” as investigators call it, will be exclusive to scientific research and separate from the standard university network for day-to-day traffic. The new network is scheduled for completion around mid-2013.\n\nPatrick Gossman, Ph.D., deputy chief information officer for Computing and Information Technology and a co-investigator for the grant, likened the Science DMZ to a dedicated lane on the freeway with a 700 mph speed limit.\n\nThe upgrade will use specialized monitoring equipment on each end of a connection to identify bottlenecks and help keep data moving. Bottlenecks are a huge problem for researchers, Gossman said, especially when they are moving images from telescopes, particle accelerator data, brain maps or DNA sequences.\n\n“They need to move huge files here, where they have the computing power to analyze them, or send them to collaborators at other institutions,” he said. “This upgrade will greatly speed up our researchers’ ability to work, moving their research forward.”\n\nThe second project component will upgrade the local network infrastructure in the physics building. This component will provide the necessary on-off ramps to the new Science DMZ as well as speed up their daily work.\n\n“If you spend three days doing a calculation, you don’t want to spend another three days waiting for it to download,” Cinabro said. “With the new connection, that download could take just minutes.”\n\nIn order to receive the grant, for which only 33 other institutions around the country were successful, WSU had to demonstrate a science-based need. The university’s case was bolstered by the work of physicists with national and international research entities like the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the Large Hadron Collider and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).\n\n“Without a science underpinning as to why we need a better computer network infrastructure, we wouldn’t have gotten this done,” Cinabro said.\n\nIn addition to the science, Gossman said, NSF officials also were interested in Wayne State’s proposal because it includes exploration of software-defined (virtual) networking, which allows a physical network to be split into multiple separate networks, and because of the Science DMZ.\n\nThe new dedicated network includes 10-gigabit-per-second links between four buildings on campus: physics, Computing and Information Technology, computer science in the College of Engineering, and the Applied Genomics Technology Center at the School of Medicine, a tenfold improvement over current capacity. The Science DMZ can be extended to other critical research areas on campus for little additional cost, investigators said.\n\nThe Science DMZ also includes a 10 Gbps link to StarLight, a Chicago-based switch/router facility for access to high-performance national and global networks.\n\n“It’s very important that we have this fast link to StarLight and other Tier 1 data sites, because they have fast links to other places,” Cinabro said. “We need access to that data to do this science, but we didn’t have very good connections, and that was an impediment.”\n\nThe future of science will involve collaborations using big data sets, he said. For example, the LSST, which he is working on, will photograph the entire available sky from northern Chile every few nights and thus produce terabytes of data daily. Additionally, some of his colleagues who collaborate internationally are trying to arrange it so researchers around the world can do things with Wayne State equipment.\n\n“Without a fast, dedicated network, that’s not even possible to contemplate,” Cinabro said. “This is a great way to enable us to do more science — not just more of what we’re already doing, but new kinds of things — and collaborate more directly in data-intensive activities.”\n\nInvestigators are pleased the NSF has recognized the value of WSU research and the potential for accelerating it through this grant award. Once the network improvements are in place, future grant proposals can involve more data-intensive research and the possible creation of a WSU data farm, where large amounts of enhanced data drawn from larger hubs could reside for local use.\n\n###\n\nWayne State University is one of the nation’s pre-eminent public research universities in an urban setting. Through its multidisciplinary approach to research and education, and its ongoing collaboration with government, industry and other institutions, the university seeks to enhance economic growth and improve the quality of life in the city of Detroit, state of Michigan and throughout the world.

  "latent_10317": "Despite what Carly Fiorina says, the employment situation for women isn’t all that bleak.\n\nAccording to an analysis of the November employment report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) women in the U.S. gained 158,000 jobs last month. Most of these jobs were in educational and health services (55,000 jobs) and retail (50,000 jobs).\n\n“This is strong growth and it’s pretty consistent growth,” says Heidi Hartmann, president and founder of IWPR.\n\nCourtesy of the Institute of Women’s Policy Research\n\nMen’s jobs increased by 113,000, meaning that the women’s share of job growth was 58%. “Most months [in the past year], women have a higher share of job growth than men,” Hartmann says.\n\nCarly Fiorina had previously said that “92% of the jobs lost during Barack Obama’s first term belonged to women.” While she later admitted that this statistic wasn’t true, she did insist that “it is factually true that women have been hit very hard by progressive policies.”\n\nIt is true that women were “hit hard” during the recession. The women’s labor force participation rate in October was 56.5%—2.9% lower than the rate in December 2007, at the start of the recession.

  "latent_10338": "Homesteading in Central Appalachia certainly has its benefits, but one of them is NOT its proximity to appealing and well-paying jobs.\n\nIn all honesty, when Ian told me he wanted to apply for the position director of Big Laurel, my first thought was “well s***, what am I supposed to do now?”\n\nMy job options out here are somewhat limited. I am only eligible to work for AmeriCorps for two years and with Ian’s new job, our commitment here is for at least three. Though it might be possible for me to get a job off the mountain a town or two away, it would probably cause us to get a second car and me spending close to two hours each day driving. Worst of all, a normal job wouldn’t allow me to take springs and summers off to help with the groups and summer camps we host on the mountain.\n\nWorking full-time off the mountain would take away much of what I love about living here.\n\nBut even so, I can’t easily justify taking a year of work off. Not the least because I’d go crazy. I need to be constantly stimulated or I wig out. Ask my mom how well I did with snow days growing up. I was that kid, the one that cried because she couldn’t go to school. I’m also a planner, so this situation has bothered me for months. I’ve turned inwards, trying to figure out what could be fulfilling for me that someone would be willing to pay me to do.\n\nAnd then it came to me. Writing.\n\nOf all the new experiences I’ve had since moving to the mountains, this blog has been the biggest surprise. I absolutely love it. I love the writing, the picture-taking, and the increased intentionality that I go through my day with when I know I want to document it later. I love the science of writing online; the constant tweaking of templates and posts to get them to do well on different platforms. The amount I’ve learned is incredible, but there always so much more to experiment with. I can lose myself in my writing for hours, so much so that I forget to eat, sometimes even to sleep.\n\nIf I love doing it for free, why not try to find a way to get paid?\n\nSo I tentatively began to research freelance writing opportunities. At first the news was pretty glum. 500 word articles were selling for pennies in ‘content mills’ that capitalize on a free market system where low-ball bids from South Asia were monopolizing all the jobs. The better paying opportunities I found were for obscure business-related topics I knew nothing about or for sites where I would have to go through the work of submitting an original 3,000 word article without any obligation from the company to buy it. Writing online seemed like a time sucking dead-end.\n\nBut more research revealed that there are people and companies that ARE willing to pay for high quality content. The trick is to find them and get them to appreciate the value you can bring to their business. So I threw myself into research, spending a week signing up for accounts, tweaking profiles and building up portfolios. If I was going to play this game, I wanted to give myself the best shot at success.\n\nI’m relying on two main websites now, Iwriter and Upwork. Both are targeted towards freelancers but they have different strategies and serve different needs.\n\nUpwork\n\nUpwork is a bidding site. Users are given a certain amount of tokens per month that they can use to ‘bid’ on projects that they feel qualified for. Projects extend far beyond writing: to SEO (search engine optimization), graphic design, software engineering and whatever else can possibly be contracted over the web. Clients get to look at applicants’ cover letters and profiles and choose the applicant they want for the task. Pay rates can range wildly from $2 per 500 words to hundreds of dollars per hour. It all depends on the skills of the applicant and the value of the project. Upwork takes a 10% cut on all contracted work.\n\nThe tricky part of Upwork is getting your first few jobs. The site is over-saturated with writers, and clients are picky about choosing applicants that don’t have any reviews. Most applicants need to drastically undersell their work at first to build up a good reputation. But for those that build a name for themselves and get consistent clients, the pay can be very lucrative.\n\nIWriter\n\nIwriter is a faster paced game. Instead of bidding, paid writing projects are available immediately after creating an account. Clients post jobs on the site and the writer that clicks on the link first gets the job. Projects range from 150 words to over 3,000 and cover every topic imaginable. Writers have a set amount of time to complete the project, and if they don’t finish it gets returned to the project list for someone else to pick up. Upon completion the client has the opportunity to accept or reject the work. Upon acceptation, the writer gets paid. It’s set up so that you can start earning money in five minutes; the catch is that the beginning rates are very low. $1.50 per page low.\n\nThe key to Iwriter is that there are different levels of writer. Everyone starts out as a ‘Standard’ writer and earns the lowest rates until they move up to the ‘Premium’ level by completing 30 projects and maintaining a high ranking. After Premium comes ‘Elite’ and then ‘Elite Plus”. The price per article goes up exorbitantly as you gain levels, so that a project that would net you $5 as a standard writer is worth $15 in Premium, $30-50 in Elite, and well over $100 in Elite Plus. For the speedy writer this can add up fast.\n\nSo How am I Doing?\n\nAfter a week of research, I have been actively applying for freelance jobs for 3 days now and have made just over $50 total in what I estimate to be about 4 hours of work per day. Not a great takeaway for twelve hours of work, but it’s still beyond my expectations for just starting out.\n\nMuch of my time has been spent writing cover letters for Upwork positions. At my experience level they are the key to getting jobs, so I’ve spent over half an hour on each one. At this point I have applied for six positions, heard back from four, and landed two jobs that paid $15 each for a 600 word article. I’m still waiting to complete my interview on the other two, but they are for bigger projects and for significantly more money. The first article was in the healthy food niche, the second for a travel blog. The rate I am comfortable with would be three times what I was paid, but at this stage I want to be flexible and take jobs that give me experience and build up my portfolio.\n\nIwriter has been a different experience. I’ve written 13 articles and have earned just over $20. Those stats would make me cry except that the articles have been so ridiculous that it’s been a blast. I’ve written articles about cat pee, why men with beards are better, and why weeds always grow near the edges of lawns. These articles take a lot of research on a wide variety of topics, but there isn’t ever a guarantee they will even be accepted by the client. Kind of a raw deal, but hopefully worth it in the long run. Those articles have gotten me 13 reviews closer to qualifying for the Elite level. And that’s where I could start earning $20-$25 per hour of writing.\n\nWhat are my Goals?\n\nAt this point, I’m willing to put in the work to try to make this a success. One year from now I would like to be averaging over $1,000 per month strictly from writing. That sounds ambitious, but I’m surprised how quickly I picked up jobs on Upwork and think at least one has the opportunity of turning into long-term work.\n\nThis field of work is incredibly appealing to me. It feeds my competitive streak to write faster, rank better, and get more jobs than everyone else. I want to be able to work completely location independent, so that regardless of where Ian gets hired in two years I will still have my own career. I want to have the flexibility to choose my own hours, my own work assignments, my own work coffee.

  "latent_10365": "Explaining Extreme Events Of 2014\n\nBy Paul Homewood\n\nhttps://www2.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/publications/bulletin-of-the-american-meteorological-society-bams/explaining-extreme-events-from-a-climate-perspective/\n\nIn their annual attempt to convince us that global warming is causing extreme weather, the AMS, with the help of the Met Office’s Peter Stott, has published the latest propaganda.\n\nThere is no mention, of course, of all the extreme weather events which did not happen last year, such as another quiet Atlantic hurricane season, lack of tornadoes, not to mention all of the places which did not flood or have droughts. Or that some of these occurrences may have been due to global warming.\n\nIt is important to realise that all of these case studies are reliant solely on “models”, and therefore need to be taken with a large pinch of salt.\n\nI will look at some of the studies in another post, but first it is worth looking at some of the weather events that they could not blame on global warming:\n\nThe reduced daily temperature variability should not come as any surprise, although it destroys the “extreme temperature” myth.\n\nThe summary links this to a reduction in the polar-equator temperature gradient.\n\n————————————————————\n\nWhat “global warming hiatus”? Didn’t they get the memo?\n\n————————————————————\n\nThis was, of course, Slingo’s favoured explanation. In any event, there is absolutely no evidence that the warming in the Pacific was “anthropgenic-induced”, as there is no known mechanism as to how GHG can warm parts of the ocean in isolation from others.\n\nThey conclude:\n\n————————————————————\n\nIt was nature wot done it! (Of course, if they had bothered looking at 1929/30 they would have found exactly the same sort of conditions, which led to even wetter weather, and for four months and not three).\n\nBut contrast their conclusions about the shorter duration extremes,\n\nFigures 10.2b,d,f illustrate the effect of human influence on extreme rainfall for synoptic conditions similar to 2013/14. The ALL and NAT (highcorrelation) ensembles are not distinguishable for both DJF and R10x based on Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests (p values greater than 0.2). However, a minor (not statistically significant) shift to wetter conditions\n\ndue to anthropogenic forcings is identified for R10x, translating to an increase in the chances of getting an extreme event by a factor of about seven.\n\n[R10x is defined as an index for shorter events (R10x), defined as the wettest period during the year over 10 consecutive winter days]\n\nwith the Met Office news bulletin on the AMS Report,\n\nThe first shows a link between global warming and the exceptional UK rainfall of the winter 2013/14. It found that, under the same weather pattern (a persistent westerly flow), extreme rainfall over 10 consecutive winter days is now seven times more likely than in a world without man-made greenhouse gas emissions. This is in line with initial Met Office research which we published in February 2014.\n\nhttp://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/release/archive/2015/BAMS-report\n\nSo the report finds only a minor, not statistically significant shift to wetter conditions for 10-day extremes. But the Met Office blatantly misrepresent this, giving the false impression that such events are now much more likely. This is breathtakingly dishonest.\n\n————————————————————————–\n\nRather puts to bed all of those “melting candle” theories!\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_10433": "Beer: Beachwood BBQ and Brewing (Long Beach) “Hops of Brixton”\n\nStyle: English Style ESB\n\nEnglish ESB (extra special bitter) is one in a category of English bitters (ordinary bitter, special bitter, and extra special bitter). Bitters were traditionally the standard bearers in any English brewer's repertoire with the ESB (as the name might suggest) being the brewery's flagship beer. Despite their name these beers are not bitter. In fact they are often very mild, brewed to be malty and slightly sweet/fruity with a subtle hoppy aroma and light hop bitterness. In today's vernacular these beers are \"session beers.\" Lower in alcohol and medium bodied, bitters are meant to be drank in social situations where one might want to drink more than one and still be able to walk away from the bar.\n\nAmerican craft brewers have adopted the style but craft their ESBs to American tastes. Using domestically grown malt and hops the American ESB is slightly more aggressive in its hop profile, so a bit more bitter than its English cousin, but it’s also full bodied and rich in malt sweetness, which balances the additional hops. If you’re looking to introduce a reluctant friend to the world of craft beer, ESB is a great place to start.\n\nBeachwood's version of the ESB Hops of Brixton bucks the American trend and tries to remain faithful to the British original. Hops of Brixton features a traditional British malt bill that including Maris Otter, and caramel malts with a bit of flaked barley added to the mash resulting in a medium-bodied beer that reveals rich aromas and flavors of toast, or fresh baked bread, a toffee like sweetness and a mild bitterness brought on by those quintessential English Kent Goldings hops, which provide the beer with a traditional \"English style\" hop finish. At 6.1% abv (alcohol by volume), I wouldn't call Hops of Brixton a session beer (though some would and I’ll admit the growler I bought went down quite easily this past weekend). It is ultimately a delicious example of an English/American ESB.\n\nESBs are food friendly beers and, given their pub history, work extremely well paired with pub grub like fish and chips, bangers and mash, corned beef, but they are equally happy paired with BBQ, roasted meats (lamb and pork especially), grilled sausages, English cheeses (Cheddar, Stilton, and Costwold pair particularly well) and smoked and preserved meats.",
  "latent_10463": "Comcast, Charter May Soon Get Even Larger With Joint Acquisition Of Sprint\n\nfrom the merge-ALL-the-things!!! dept\n\nWith the telecom sector seeing the Trump administration as somewhat of a blank check, the industry is busy considering all manner of mergers and acquisitions that would have been blocked under any number of previous administrations for being competition-killers. Verizon has made an offer to buy Charter (Spectrum), Sprint has been trying to merge with T-Mobile, AT&T's pushing for approval of its acquisition of Time Warner, Altice USA is gobbling up smaller providers hand over foot, and the industry is consolidating at a faster rate than ever.\n\nWhile obviously not all M&As are bad by default, ignored in this rush is that several recent high-profile telecom deals have been utter shitshows for the American consumer.\n\nWhile the Obama administration did block both AT&T and Sprint's attempted acquisitions of T-Mobile (which wound up being a very good thing for competition and consumers), its approval of Frontier's acquisition of Verizon's unwanted DSL customers in Florida, California and Texas resulted in endless outages and problems courtesy of a bungled integration. The Obama administration also approved Charter's $79 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House, resulting in not only much higher prices for consumers, but (somehow) even worse customer service for already one of the least-liked companies in America.\n\nUndaunted by any potential history lessons, now Trump-era merger mania rolls on with the news that Charter and Comcast are considering either a joint acquisition of Sprint, or a minority ownership stake in exchange for a more lucrative network sharing deal for both companies' wireless services:\n\nU.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp is in talks with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp about a partnership to boost the two U.S. cable companies' wireless offerings, according to sources familiar with the matter. Sprint, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with U.S. wireless peer T-Mobile US Inc on hold till the end of July, the sources said on Monday.\n\nSaid deal could involve an outright acquisition of Sprint by the two cable giants, though one source suggests that's unlikely at first. More likely is a joint minority investment by both companies in exchange for a discount network sharing arrangement to help fuel both cable companies' attempts to get into the wireless sector. Comcast has already launched a WiFi-centric wireless voice service that uses the Verizon Wireless network for backup, and Charter is planning a similar service for 2018. That would, depending on how it went, likely evolve into a full acquisition of Sprint down the road.\n\nBoth companies had already struck a deal to partner on handset contracts, including a promise not to acquire a wireless carrier without first informing the other company. That deal was criticized on some fronts as a way for the two cable companies to avoid having to directly compete as they pushed their respective services to market.\n\nHow all of this shakes out (and whether it's good for anybody not named Sprint, Comcast or Charter) remains unclear. The deal could be an improvement over a Sprint acquisition of T-Mobile as it would not only keep the four major wireless competitors intact, but would bolster Sprint's historically rocky balance sheet ensuring it remains a somewhat viable competitor. That said, Charter and Comcast are no strangers to anti-competitive behavior, and adding another entire service segment to this well-documented dysfunction could prove disastrous for what's already some of the worst customer service in any industry in America.\n\nFiled Under: acquisition, antitrust, broadband, competition, fcc, mergers, mobile\n\nCompanies: charter, comcast, sprint",
  "latent_10484": "The Lions vs. Patriots Match Up Was Not What Lions’ Fans Wanted To See Out Of Their Starters, But There Were Some Positive Takeaways.\n\nLions vs. Patriots: Preseason Week 3\n\nThe third week of preseason is typically considered the dress rehearsal for the regular season. The starters see the most live action they’ve seen all preseason. We get to take a look at what the coaches intend to run in terms of scheme and play calling.\n\nThis gives fan the best look at what they can expect from their team in the regular season. This Lions vs. Patriots match up gave us a lot to take away going into the regular season. The Lions are not ready. Both their first team offense and defense were embarassed by the Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots are among the league’s best teams, if not the best but this is not what you want to see out of your team. The coaches need to get this team ready for the regular season. They looked lost tonight.\n\nLions vs. Patriots: Defense\n\nThe defense got off to a really rough start, getting marched on through the first drive via a series of passes to the slot receivers. They followed it up with giving up a touchdown on the first play of their second drive on the field. Lawson had tight coverage on a deep ball along the left sideline, but couldn’t break up the pass. As the first real test the Lions first team defense faced this year, this was very concerning.\n\nIt's almost like the Lions aren't playing Christian Hackenberg anymore — Kyle Meinke (@kmeinke) August 25, 2017\n\nJarrad Davis needs some improvement in coverage. This wasn’t a huge weakness for him in college but he needs to improve in order to survive at the NFL level. Coverage from the linebackers was a huge issue for the Lions last year and they cannot afford to get worse at the position going into this year.\n\nHe made a lot of plays, collecting eight tackles in the first half but was out of position on a number of plays. These things come with being a rookie. He will improve with more experience.\n\nhttp://gty.im/833027214\n\nJalen Reeves-Maybin, the other rookie linebacker, had a really nice showing. He looked really good when he was getting downfield with the play in front of him. He made some nice hits on the ballcarriers and looks like he will be pushing for a starting spot sooner rather than later.\n\nReeves-Maybin has made a couple nice plays today. Had that run stuff early, good instincts on screen there. https://t.co/HY0HyoIOji — Dave Birkett (@davebirkett) August 26, 2017\n\nA’shawn Robinson continues his really nice preseason. His pass rushing ability appears to have really improved. This is an area that he struggled in during his rookie season. The Lions have really lacked pressure from their interior defensive lineman. If A’shawn can provide that this year, it should help across the defense.\n\nReally liking @AshawnRobinson improved bull rush this year. Loved his athletic upside in pass rush coming out. Very strong at vs run #Lions — Zac Warber (@Warbs24) August 26, 2017\n\nQuandre Diggs gave up a long pass that was just out of his reach but otherwise had a really nice showing. He made several nice open field tackles and his coverage on the deep pass was beaten by a beautiful pass from Tom Brady.\n\nWhile the interior of the line looked improved, the defensive end position was concerning. Ziggy Ansah isn’t back yet, so we should expect this to improve but this lack of punch from the depth is not what you want to see against starting offensive linemen.\n\nAfter watching Zettel in three preseason games I am comfortable saying he can't rush the passer. Need Ansah badly. — Brett Whitefield (@PFF_Brett) August 25, 2017\n\nContaining outside run plays was an issue last year and it continued to be an issue in this game. This is one of many things that the Lions showed little to no improvement on in this game. This will not be acceptable when the regular season comes around.\n\nZero edge contain on runs so far. Was an issue last year, too. #NEvsDET — Zac Warber (@Warbs24) August 25, 2017\n\nGlover Quinn intercepted Tom Brady on a deep pass to the end zone that appeared to be a miscommunication between Brady and Hogan. Quinn should be much improved with a return to a more favorable role in the defense. He had to support poor linebacker coverage far too often last year. He should be able to play deep more often this year, which is a better fit for his skill set.\n\nLions vs. Patriots: Offense\n\nThe Lions offense also had a really rough start. First play of their first drive, Golden Tate coughs up the football along the right sideline. The second drive went three and out after Matthew Stafford throws a crossing route to Kenny Golladay a yard short of the sticks. Their following drive also ended in three and out with a pass short of the sticks. Three and outs were a problem for the Lions last year that need to be rectified.\n\nThe Lions have run one play. They're down 13-0. — Kyle Meinke (@kmeinke) August 25, 2017\n\nThe Lions initial first down came with under a minute left in the first quarter. At that point, they were already down 24 points. Neither side of the ball showed well early.\n\nDespite the early struggles, the offense came alive late in the first team’s showing. Stafford went 8 for 9 in the final drive of the first half and the first drive of the second half.\n\nAmeer Abdullah is vital to the success of the offense this year. He is far and away the best running back on the roster and it is not particularly close. He showed that he looks ready for the season and looks just as explosive as we remember. As long as Abdullah can stay on the field, the running game should be vastly improved.\n\nAmeer Abdullah brings the potential to take the Lions running game to a level that fans have not seen in years. He didn’t look afraid to run between the tackles and showed nice leg drive, despite his smaller stature.\n\nhttp://gty.im/607563858\n\nThe Lions used Abdullah primarily between the tackles in this game. This is strange usage for a player that is so electric in open space. He excelled on outside stretch plays, but ran an alarmingly high percentage of his carries between the tackles. It is nice to see that he is capable of this type of running but it would be nicer to see the coaches utilize his skill set more appropriately.\n\nThe offensive line looks really good in pass protection; Stafford saw very little pressure. This is very encouraging for an offensive line that is still missing its left tackle in Taylor Decker. The passing game wasn’t clicking at many levels but the protection was solid against a decent New England pass rush.\n\nGraham Glasgow was the lone sore spot on the offensive line. He showed well last year in his limited action but this was not a good performance for him. He looks to be the sure starter heading into week one, so he is going to have to improve to help shore up an otherwise impressive offensive line.\n\nhttp://gty.im/625632922\n\nStafford threw a beautiful deep pass to Marvin Jones on the sideline. Jones dragged his feet but the ball moved when he hit the ground and the refs ruled the play incomplete. The next play was an interception that was tipped into the air off Kenny Golladay. The pass appeared to be intended for Marvin Jones but Golladay’s route crossed the path of the ball. The promising drive was brought to an immediate halt. This is an issue with play design.\n\nMarvin Jones looked good this game. His route running looked improved and he made some really nice plays on the ball. His usage looked largely the same as it did last year. He was primarily a deep threat, which is slightly disappointing. Fans were looking for him to take a step forward and become a more multi-dimensional wide receiver. That wasn’t necessarily the case in this Lions vs. Patriots match up, but this was a small sample size.\n\nJake Rudock looked good when he came in with the second team offense. He made some really nice throws and moved around outside the pocket really well. His mechanics and footwork still need work but this was a really good showing for him. He looks like he has a strong hold on the second quarterback spot. That would mean that either Kaaya heads to the practice squad, or the Lions keep three quarterbacks.\n\nDwayne Washington looks like a lock to make the roster at this point. He is handling return duties, he looks improved in the run game, and his vision and patience are better. Washington is running well, albeit with the second stringers but still running well. He got the bulk of the work with the second team offense today. Dwayne Washington looked really poor last year but he has appeared much improved throughout camp and preseason this year.\n\nJace Billingsley and Jared Abbrederis appear to be fighting for the final wide receiver spot. Both have looked really good throughout camp and both had really nice games today. Abbrederis caught a touchdown pass from Jake Rudock, while Billingsley made a few really nice catches and is really shifty after the catch.\n\nRudock looking solid, but it seems like he's throwing off his back foot a little too often. — Bryce Rossler (@btrossler) August 26, 2017\n\nLions vs. Patriots: Extra Notes\n\nPenalties and discipline were a huge issue throughout this game. It is preseason but this stuff needs to get cleaned up. The defense committed multiple penalties in coverage. Ngata got called for what appeared to be a debatable defensive holding call. They covered up the center on an extra point which led to a two point conversion. These are things that cannot happen in the regular season. This is really discouraging to see in what is typically the most important game of the preseason.\n\nLions couldn't even line up for the PAT right. So the Patriots went for 2. Got it. https://t.co/USRYL73c0M — Kyle Meinke (@kmeinke) August 25, 2017\n\nCoaching and game preperation needs to be better, this cannot be overstated. The team did not show up ready to play. The game plan was not appropriate for the team they were facing. On defense, players were constantly put in unfavorable situations. Jarrad Davis should not be in coverage against Julian Edelman. Quandre Diggs at 5 feet and 9 inches, should not be manned up against Rob Gronkowski. These are things that can be blamed on the coaches. It’s preseason, so the game planning will be more diligent when the regular season starts but this was not a good preview of what fans have to look forward to.\n\nDwayne Washington took the first couple of kick return reps, Agnew followed with the next couple. At this point, it appears to be a two horse race. I still think Agnew could win that job but Washington is still in the mix and likely in the lead. Agnew muffed a punt early in the second half. You can’t do that as a guy that is fighting for both a starting position and a roster spot. He is a really talented player that needed to have a much better showing in this game.\n\nThat's going to hurt Agnews chances — Brandon Knapp (@BKnappBlogs) August 26, 2017\n\nThe Lions stayed mostly healthy, that is always good to see in a preseason game. The primary concern was seeing Golladay leave with an ankle injury. It is unclear how serious it is but it doesn’t appear to be anything to be overly concerned about yet. Cole Wick took a hard hit on a high throw by Stafford but appears to be fine. Tahir Whitehead suffered a knee injury, but there is little information on it thus far.\n\nTahir Whitehead out with a knee injury for the Lions — Dave Birkett (@davebirkett) August 26, 2017\n\nThanks for checking out the article everyone.

  "latent_10587": "How does a timeless logo design survive the Nazis, a World War, and a world that’s constantly changing?\n\nIn the 1960s, the Volkswagen Beetle became famous thanks to the Disney film, “The Love Bug.” During the same decade of love, the Volkswagen T1 bus became a symbol of peace, non-violence, and resistance.\n\nIt’s hard to believe Adolf Hitler is associated with either of these now famous timeless cultural icons.\n\nThey’re decades and ideas apart, but Volkswagen, or “The People’s Car,” was the brainchild of the Nazi party. Yeah, sorry to spoil the Herbie series for you.\n\nBut in my defence, your image of the “Love Bug,” should have been ruined by the Lindsay Lohan reboot.\n\nThrough the years, Volkswagen has changed (thank goodness!), but the “V” and the “W” on their logo remains.\n\nIt’s a testament to the designers that a logo can survive a World War and the Cold War to be one of the most recognizable logos in the history of the automobile industry.\n\nBut how did they do it? For the answer, we need to go back to the original design.\n\nA Brief History of the timeless logo design: Umm… you see it too right?\n\nNo, it’s not just you. The first iteration of the Volkswagen logo looked like a stylized version of the Nazi flag.\n\nTry to focus on the centre. The circular shape and the “V” and “W” should look familiar too.\n\nBefore the start of the second World War, Volkswagen redesigned their logo. They removed the fan-like structure and opted for a more industrial “cog” appearance.\n\nIn 1949, Volkswagen removed the cog altogether for a much cleaner look.\n\nVolkswagen injected the logo with colour in the 60s and 70s to create a friendlier image for the brand. And to further distance itself from its, shall we say, infamous origin.\n\nThe More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same\n\nThrough the years of war, peace, and revolution, the logo’s key characteristics have stayed the same:\n\nSuperb Lettering – The designers impeccably constructed the “V” and the “W.” The two letters interact wonderfully together. Along with the perfect circle that surrounds the letters, the logo embodies one of the car company’s core values: precise German engineering.\n\nSimplicity – Let’s remember the purpose of Volkswagen. It was meant to be “a car for the people.” You see this underlying idea of simplicity throughout their car designs and in their logo.\n\nLegibility & Use of Negative Space – The use of negative space is as much a part of the logo as the letters and the circle. It allows for maximum legibility and clarity.\n\nVolkswagen’s gone through some tough times recently. Like, some very hard and brand-damaging times.\n\nBut it’s hard to imagine they’ll move away from the logo that’s made them so recognizable for nearly 80 years. (Don’t quote us on that)\n\nIt’s not like you can create a timeless logo design like Volkswagen.\n\nBut there are logo design professionals, like us, who devote themselves to learning about what makes logos like Volkswagen’s so memorable.\n\nWith history’s lessons on hand, we might be able to create a logo that’s uniquely yours that can also stand the test of time.",
  "latent_10589": "Gnomecopter Tours was removed after an update.\n\nThe contents of this page no longer exist in RuneScape, and this article is kept for historical purposes.\n\nGnomecopter Tours was a special system which was released in the Gnomecopters update on 31 March 2008[1] and could be accessed by both members and non-members. The main point of the Gnomecopters was to show free players some of the popular members features such as Castle Wars, Pest Control, Hunting, and the Burthorpe Games Room. It could take riders from the cow field in Lumbridge to various members-only places, including:\n\nAt the date of release, this area was filled with people. A few weeks after the release, the popularity died down, due to loss of interest. Based on the Patch Notes released on 25 March 2009, the Gnomecopters were removed from the game and replaced by Beefy Bill and Farquie the Cleaner, as Jagex no longer wished to advertise members content on free-to-play worlds.\n\nContents show]\n\nThe area\n\nThe area is located east of Draynor Manor and north of Lumbridge windmill. There is a sign like the ones you see on the ride just by Lumbridge Windmill. You enter the area through a cow pasture and then go to the back where Gnomecopters are spread out. Players must first speak to Hieronymus Avlafrim, a gnome sitting at the east side, to get the permission of using the Gnomecopters. Then, they must speak to another gnome, Sasquine Huburns, who sits in the middle of the area, to get a ticket to take a ride.\n\nA Gnome Landing pad cleaner, Farquie the Cleaner, roams the area.\n\nPlayers can trade Hieronymus Avlafrim items like a general store. He stocks the usual general store as well as other things like redberries, jugs of water and spinach rolls. Many players use this shop for redberries because they are cheaper than Wydin's food store in Port Sarim and there is an infinite supply unlike redberry bushes and the food shops. This is also the only general store in free play areas to sell jugs with water already in them (free players often use this method to speed up soft clay making, as they do not need to fill the jugs).\n\nTo the west, there used be some deposit bins, where you could deposit items into the bank, provided you have room. Together with the nearby cow farm, it was a good cowhide hunting area.\n\nTo the centre, you may see the landing area on the west and riding area on the east.\n\nThe ride\n\nPlayers must be 5'6\" tall to ride the Gnomecopters, but this is not a problem, since all players are tall adult humans. To take a ride, players must first speak to Sasquine Huburns in the centre of the row of Gnomecopters to get a ticket. In order to take a ride, all capes, helmets (except Bomber cap and Cap and goggles), weapons, and shields must be unequipped.\n\nDuring the ride, players can view and chat with other players riding a Gnomecopter in that area. None of the areas that may be visited are an actual members area. Although characters that appear to be members appear in the various areas, they are not actual members, or even players. They are computer NPCs which have been programmed to complete certain actions and say certain phrases. Thus, visitors are merely viewing a simulation of a member's area, and not an actual P2P world. Viewing players are restricted as to the places they may go within each area, and cannot pickpocket, talk or attack the locals, or otherwise interact with them in any way. Viewers are also restricted from unlocking any music for the places they visit, although they may listen to the background music while in each area. All interfaces are disabled, except for the Friends and Ignore lists, Clan chat, and the Options menu. Players can activate run mode to make the gnomecopter fly faster, but it will not deplete their energy.\n\nThe players' Inventory interface is not removed, but it only displays the Gnomecopter controls along with various information about the current area:\n\nAt the top\n\nThe first button is for choosing manual or automatic riding\n\nThe second button is for returning to the starting point (Lumbridge)\n\nIn the centre\n\nInformation about the current area\n\nAt the bottom\n\nArrows that switch pages of introduction\n\nCertain places in the area you can only go to when your gnomecopter is set to manual riding. Signposts are located in each area which viewers may click to see extended information about an area or feature.\n\nOccasionally, the Wise Old Man can be seen sledding down Trollweiss Mountain whilst looking at one of the signs in the Trollweiss Hunter area. He says \"Hic senex, ludavit unum...ludavit knickumnackum\", which is Latin for \"This old man, he played one... he played knick-knack\". Apparently, the Wise Old Man is on holiday in the area.\n\nCharacters\n\nIn the Gnomecopter rides, running characters in the members' area only seem to run, but are actually moving at walking speed. All spoken phrases are actually quick chat.\n\nGlitches\n\nIt was possible to fight players on the Gnomecopters in PvP worlds. When the player would die, they'd die on the floor on the place the Gnomecopters are. This has been fixed.\n\nThere was another glitch which allowed you to get a Saradomin/Zamorak cloak and bandages for Castle Wars in F2P worlds. The glitch also allowed players to fly around without the gnomecopter. This has been fixed.\n\nTrivia\n\nIf you talk to the cleaner at the gnome copter, he will tell you that: 'Everyone has gone away on a honeymoon and left me here to clean up their mess.'\n\nIf you flew the Gnomecopters to Pest Control, you could've seen players in the \"running\" animation, but were actually going at (or slower than) walking speed.\n\nAfter the Castle War glitch was fixed, Jagex had gotten rid of Gnomecopters altogether attempting to prevent any other 'mishaps'.\n\nThe gnome cleaning the Gnomecopters stand seems to be cleaning the same station for the entire time Gnomecopters have been removed.\n\nTaking a ride with the Gnomecopters was a medium Lumbridge and Draynor tasks until Gnomecopter Tours were removed and replaced with Beefy Bill and Farquie the Cleaner. After that date (25 March 2009) using Beefy Bill to bank items is the new medium task.\n\nAlthough the gnomecopters have been removed from the game, the gnomecopter unit remains in Armies of Gielinor.\n\nIf you followed someone while on a gnomecopter, then had the person leave the gnomecopter, you could return and have the gnomecopter leave the field and go about half-way to Lumbridge before you were forced to turn back if you positioned the returning person correctly.\n\nIf you examined any of the fake players, it would say \"a player\" even though normal players could not be examined at the time.\n\nGnomecopters were once used as fast skirmish units with a short range explosive attack, as seen in the FunOrb game Armies of Gielinor.\n\nGnomecopters have returned to the game in the form of a Home teleport animation.",

The lefthanded-hitting Kramer could boost his prospect stock significantly if he keeps hitting the ball with as much authority as he did in April.Low Class A Lansing (Midwest) The second-youngest player to open the season on an Opening Day roster, the 18-year-old Guerrero also is one of the most promising. He has had no trouble acclimating to full-season ball after ranking as the No. 1 prospect in the Rookie-level Appalachian League a year ago. Guerrero had nearly as many extra-base hits (nine) as strikeouts (11) in April.Low Class A Lansing (Midwest) A 2016 second-rounder and Florida prep, Bichette torched the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in his debut, hitting .427 with power in 22 games, until a bout of appendicitis truncated his season. He has picked right up in full-season ball where he left off last year. Bichette teams with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to form perhaps the most formidable left side of the infield in the minors.Double-A New Hampshire (Eastern) A knee injury and concussion short-circuited Alford's 2016 season, but he appeared to be in fine form while making his Double-A debut this season. With good feel to hit (.356 average), plate patience (nine walks) and plus speed (seven stolen bases), Alford profiles as an impact table-setter.Double-A Erie (Eastern) Stewart hit just .218 in a month at Double-A last season, but he still finished with 30 home runs and 86 walks on the year. Both totals ranked among the highest in the minors. The 2015 first-rounder continues to play to his strengths this year— minus the slow start —with plus power and patience.Low Class A Kane County (Midwest) The D-backs made Wilson, a California prep, a supplemental second-round pick in 2014, projecting him to grow into more strength. That has begun to happen this season for the 20-year-old, who also has benefited from greater maturity . Wilson flashed a bit of everything—power, speed, contact ability, patience—in April.Low Class A Kannapolis (South Atlantic) A Nationals first-round pick last June, Dunning joined the White Sox organization, along with Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo Lopez, when Chicago traded Adam Eaton to Washington. A product of the University of Florida, Dunning and his above-average fastball and changeup were too advanced for the South Atlantic League, so the White Sox bumped him to high Class A Winston-Salem in May.Double-A Springfield (Texas) Sharper control and physical gains have helped Flaherty's stuff dominate in his first taste of Double-A. The Los Angeles prep and 2014 first-rounder leads a Springfield rotation that also includes top prospects Sandy Alcantara, Dakota Hudson and Austin Gomber.High Class A Florida (Florida State) Gohara failed to make a full-season Opening Day roster in four years in the Mariners system, but after Seattle traded him to the Braves in January, he not only made the high Class A Florida roster—he dominated. Gohara has prototype size (6-foot-3) and power stuff (fastball, slider) to profile as a front-end starter, provided that he keeps throwing strikes.Low Class A Columbia (South Atlantic) Gonzalez shined in the short-season New York-Penn League last year and jumped out to a fast start in full-season ball in 2017. He has been so sharp that he was one of five qualified minor league pitchers to not allow an earned run in April. Gonzalez blends an excellent fastball-curveball combo that could play in a big league rotation if he develops sufficient command.Double-A Pensacola (Southern) Mahle threw the second perfect game in Southern League history in April and exhibits fine command of a fastball up to 97 mph. With further improvement to his slider—which is entirely possible given how far his fastball has come in pro ball—Mahle will pitch in a big league rotation.",
  "latent_10708": "How important are those preliminary ideas and sketches, however scrappy?\n\nAfter you’ve done your initial research (the more in depth the better), it’s time to take the plunge and start sketching. The beauty of initial sketches is that, while you needn’t expend too much effort on them, they can give you a great insight into where you think you should be going with a logo, as well as what works and what most definitely doesn’t. However, many designs can undergo a fair number of revisions before the client is happy with them. So what sort of things must you consider in the initial stages of logo design?\n\nThe brief\n\nGetting a good brief is incredibly important. Consider this the bones of your logo design; you want something fairly sturdy to start with, and the better your brief the less (or at least the less drastic) revisions your logo design should need to undergo. The brief should tell you what sort of thing the client wants, what you should avoid, preferred colours (particularly if there are brand ones to adhere to) and ideally a number of suggestions to start you off in the right direction.\n\nExisting logos\n\nMany companies approach logo designers not just to create completely new logos but also to revamp their old ones (take a look at Scott Hansen’s attempt to rework the Playboy logo, for example). If a redesign is what’s required then time should be taken to study the current (or hopefully soon to be old) logo, with the client conveying in their brief exactly what they want kept and changed if at all possible.\n\nBrainstorming\n\nBrainstorming is an excellent opportunity for a designer to get all their ideas – as well as those of the client – down in order to mull them all over. Seeing all of your ideas written down can often help you better picture them in addition to helping you come up with new ones you might not have otherwise had.\n\nSketching\n\nYou have to start drawing somewhere, and often the best way to kick start the actual logo design process proper is to simply put pen to paper (or perhaps stylus to tablet). As previously mentioned, initial sketches can really help in figuring out where you want to go with a logo, and are also useful for showing to the client in order to illustrate progress and make alterations if needs be.\n\nThe finished product?\n\nOf course, the ultimate aim of the drafting process is to move you closer to the goal of having a design you feel is good enough to show the client. Ideally this is not one design but several, giving the client a choice between the various ideas you’ve been working on and thus allowing them to the select the one – or ones – they like best for further development.\n\nFinding inspiration and then successfully using it to produce sketches that may eventually become the final logo design is definitely ones of the knacks of a good logo designer. A well-written brief is also a great asset, and can help ensure that both the client and designer’s visions align and thus maybe even result in a quicker logo design process overall. In Part 4, we will be looking at memorability, the all-important X-factor of logo creation that can ensure that a design – and thus the company it belongs to – stays with those who see it long after it’s out of sight.",
  "latent_10789": "SALT LAKE CITY — Aubrey and Eric Jackson’s possessions have been packed in a U-Haul truck for the past several weeks.\n\nThat’s because they had to suddenly move out of their Salt Lake apartment when the complex was sold, Eric Jackson said, and since then they’ve been living in his sister's basement in Highland, struggling to find a reasonably affordable place to live in the Salt Lake area.\n\nWith a 3-year old son and his wife seven months pregnant, Jackson said they’re desperate to find a new place to live as soon as possible, but the search for a new apartment has been painstaking.\n\n“About a year and a half ago, we had a ton of options to rent a two-bedroom apartment for around $1,200 a month,” he said. But now they’re struggling to find something within their budget to fit their family.\n\nEager to remain in Salt Lake City, near Aubrey's work and their son’s preschool, they submitted an application for a $1,700 a month, two-bedroom loft near Pioneer Park. But their application wasn't accepted when the landlord explained to them that multiple others had offered a higher price for the same apartment.\n\n“For us it’s so bizarre that people are willing to pay more for rentals in this market. They’re just little, two-bedroom duplexes with no yard,\" he said. \"It's definitely the landlord's market right now.\"\n\nWhile nationwide and statewide trends reflect steadily increasing real estate prices, renters in the greater Salt Lake area are under particularly intense pressure as employment opportunities and the population are flourishing.\n\nRental rates are skyrocketing due to high demand for apartment living and limited unit availability. In Salt Lake City, vacancy rates linger at a low 3 percent.\n\nMap key: Green marker: 100 percent affordable units Yellow marker: Mixed (affordable and market rate) Red marker: Market rate housing\n\nDevelopers have reacted by building high-quality, high-price units, according to new research by James Wood, a senior fellow at the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah.\n\n“We are in the biggest apartment boom in Salt Lake County and Salt Lake City in 30 years,” Wood said.\n\nStatewide, 20,000 apartment units having been built in the past five years, yet demand persists. In Salt Lake City specifically, Wood said there have been 2,500 class A — or high-end — apartments built in the past five years.\n\n“There appears to be very high demand for these units despite having high rental rates of $1,300 to $1,400 for two-bedroom apartments,” Wood said.\n\nThe demand allows landlords to mark up monthly bills. Ten years ago, the average two-bedroom, two-bath unit in Salt Lake City rented for about $890 a month, Wood said. But now, the average rent for the same type of unit is about $1,050.\n\nThat's a 17 percent increase over the past 10 years, Wood said.\n\nAnd yet, incomes haven’t kept pace with demand. In the past 10 years, the median income of renters increased only 3 percent, according to Wood’s research.\n\nConsequently, the number of renters with housing cost burdens — those who spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs — has ballooned in the past 10 years. In 2005, 50 percent of Salt Lake County renters earning between $20,000 and $34,999 a year were cost burdened. In 2014, that number has increased to 80 percent, Wood wrote.\n\n“It’s squeezing renters' budgets,” Wood said. “Affordability is most of an issue on the renter’s side. That’s where you have the greatest need.”\n\nHousing forecast\n\nAbout 5,416 new town house, apartment or condo units have been recently built or are in the planning stages, estimated to be available to Salt Lake renters or buyers within the next six to 24 months, according to the Salt Lake City Planning Division.\n\nNearly 80 percent of those — 4,227 — are projected to have market-rate price tags.\n\nThat leaves 1,189 roughly expected within in the next two years to be classified as affordable, targeting renters with incomes below 80 percent of area's median income. Most of those units will be for those making 26 precent to 40 percent of the area median income, which is $72,200 for a family of four in Salt Lake County according to 2015 data.\n\nEncouraging developers to build affordable units is part of an effort to fill Salt Lake's citywide shortage of roughly 8,000 affordable rentals for low-income households.\n\nIn 2014, former Mayor Ralph Becker launched the 5000 Doors Initiative to provide 5,000 affordable units over 5 years. However, with some projects still in the planning stages and not expected to be completed as far as two years out, Salt Lake City is facing a daunting task to fill that 8,000 door gap, especially having to swim upstream against rising rents.\n\n\"Obviously with rents going up, there isn't as much affordable housing access,\" said Mike Akerlow, the city's director of Housing and Neighborhood Development. \"But what's encouraging to me is that we're seeing the number of affordable units increasing.\"\n\nIn Salt Lake's 2015 to 2016 fiscal year, 179 affordable units were in-progress or completed. In the current fiscal year, so far 709 affordable units have been proposed or planned. The other 301 are so far projected for fiscal year 2017 to 2018.\n\n\"We're seeing developers do more, and the city has really worked hard on being a partner,\" Akerlow said, noting that his office has been working with Mayor Jackie Biskupski's administration to \"modify\" Becker's 5000 Doors Initiative.\n\n\"We have been working really hard to come up with recommendations or some new tools that can be used, and we will be presenting them to the mayor in the next couple of weeks,\" Akerlow said.\n\nHe added that they're seeking ways to extend beyond the usual affordable housing tool: tax credits.\n\n\"Tax credits will always be a part of this, but we're limited in how many we get, so we're looking for other tools we can use to supplement the tax credits or just finance affordable housing on its own,\" he said. \"If you look at the gap — if Salt Lake City were to get every tax credit in the state, it would still take us 15 years to fill that gap of 8,000 units.\"\n\nAffordability vs. quality of life\n\nKenzie Smith, 23, currently pays $508 a month for a studio apartment at SoDo Lofts, an affordable housing complex, near I-15 in downtown Salt Lake City.\n\n\"This is a deal of a lifetime,\" she said. \"When people hear how much my rent is, they're like, ‘What? Can I get your landlord's number?’”\n\nBut the 18-unit complex is usually fully occupied, and Smith said it took \"hundreds\" of calls to the landlord to get her foot in the door.\n\nPlus, she said she only qualified for the restrictive income rate a year and a half ago because she was working as a server at Stoneground Kitchen, making less than $20,000 a year. But since then, she said she's upped her salary, now working as a graphic artist for a local beverage company and expanding her freelance clientele.\n\nWhile Smith knows her monthly rate is rare as she enjoys her 10-minute commute to work, she's turned her eyes to real estate listings because she said she's frustrated living in a small apartment with her two dogs.\n\nShe said she's looking throughout Salt Lake County — willing to trade up to a 45-minute commute for a larger apartment or a small house.\n\n\"I'm comfortable paying the $500, but if it came down to it, I could pay $1,000 a month if I had to,\" she said, noting that she could also find a roommate to help offset the cost. \"It would be worth it.\"\n\nWhile Smith could make that choice, other renters throughout Salt Lake County aren't so lucky. Some are forced to spend a majority of their income just to keep a roof over their head. According to Wood's research, 91 percent of Salt Lake County residents earning $20,000 or less a year were cost burdened in 2014.\n\nSearch for solutions\n\nSalt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams said cost-burdened households, especially those spending upward of 70 percent of their income on housing, are a \"blip away from being evicted from their homes\" — and that's one reason he said affordable housing is at the root of some of Utah's most challenging issues like homelessness.\n\n\"When a family is a small crisis away from homelessness because two-thirds of their paycheck is going to housing, whether it's for sickness or their car breaks down, they may have to choose between paying rent or fixing their car so they don't lose their job,\" he said.\n\nThe Salt Lake metro area currently faces a 43,000 shortage of affordable housing units, McAdams said.\n\n\"Another thing we know is because of lack of affordable housing, people are having to locate further and further away from their jobs,\" which he said could be contributing to wear and tear on roads and the valley's battle with air quality.\n\n\"These are the challenges we face,\" he said, adding that he feels like the county is \"losing ground, not gaining ground on affordable housing,\" when considering rising rents and the demand for high-end apartments.\n\nBut solutions are in the works, McAdams said, pointing to funding that the Utah Legislature secured this year for homeless prevention.\n\n\"It's a start. It's not going to be enough yet to solve all of our challenges, but we're heading in that direction,\" he said.\n\nAs for Salt Lake City, Biskupski said she has directed her Housing and Neighborhood Development team and the Redevelopment Agency to \"look at the 5,000 door plan in a broader sense to achieve broader goals.\"\n\n\"We're coming out with a new model to move forward so we are a little more aggressive in addressing the low-income housing needs in the city,\" Biskupski recently told Deseret News/KSL editorial boards. \"Part of the vision moving forward is to make sure that wherever possible we are incorporating very mixed income housing opportunities. Every housing project that is being looked at we are doing our best to incorporate mixed-income opportunities.\"\n\nBiskupski did not increase funding for affordable housing in her budget proposal Tuesday, but that's because she said she wants to first initiate a \"harder look\" at the issue.\n\n\"It's 'How are we doing this? What are some things that we're missing?'\" she said. \"How do we incorporate more mixed-income housing into everything that we have some control over?\"\n\nMcAdams also noted his homelessness steering committee is working on developing a \"formula\" to understand more about the county's 43,000 gap in affordable housing units.\n\n\"We know the metro area has the shortage, but where in the metro area, and how do we best address that?\" he said. \"We're laying the groundwork but this is a problem that took years to make, and it's going to take years to solve.\"",
  "latent_10821": "Written by Patrick Howell O'Neill\n\nA three-week long wave of cyberattacks against several popular dark web marketplaces has left the notorious underground e-commerce economy drenched in uncertainty and wondering if, like earlier this year, this is a prelude another round of arrests.\n\nJust two months after police brought down a slew of the most well-known dark web markets, those left standing can’t quite figure out — nor defeat — who has been behind a three-week long denial-of-service offensive that’s knocked their sites offline.\n\nAs if looking to further stoke fear and uncertainty, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recently spoke in Washington, D.C. on how the Department of Justice is continuing to target crime on the dark web.\n\nDeputy AG Rosenstein said today the DOJ is focusing in on dark net markets. pic.twitter.com/Ms4kvMdmAK — Patrick O'Neill (@HowellONeill) October 25, 2017\n\nParanoia haunts the mood of those who remain as many wait for the next looming law enforcement sting. Those actions have sown a deep distrust among the markets’ purveyors and customers, whom are often looking for drugs, malware, stolen data, exploitation material and other ways to commit fraud. This is on top of a customer base that already goes to great lengths to conceal identity, hiding behind anonymization technology like the Tor browser, and paying for wares via cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Monero.\n\nThe turbulence these dark web marketplaces have dealt with beyond the arrests has been unprecedented. Scams and cyberattacks are common, as those looking to replace the reliable crime superstores of the past are struggling. To top it off, a new class of scammers is seizing on the chaos, launching phishing attacks to steal cryptocurrency from the dark web’s faithful.\n\n“This year turned things the other way around,” one dark net market customer lamented on a subreddit dedicated to the marketplaces. “It is like a dead place now to be very honest. Sales have dropped, there are more scammers in the market now, people are losing their money or assets, most of the good vendors are gone, people are scared.”\n\nThere are “a few hints but definitely more questions than answers,” Emily Wilson, a researcher at Terbium Labs, told CyberScoop. “We know the markets are being DDoSed, we know it’s a fairly coordinated effort. It’s been going on for two weeks now.”\n\nThe attackers have made what some forum administrators call “silly demands,” implying that lucrative extortion is the goal. The latest incident echoes past incidents, like the 2013 denial of service attack against Silk Road when hackers successfully made the market pay a ransom in order to for attacks to stop.\n\nBut more recent history shows AlphaBay, the largest dark web market for a period of around three years, went dark for nearly two weeks before it was revealed that an international law enforcement operation was behind the outage.\n\nOne result of the attacks are increasing distrust of centralized markets. Instead of sticking to the big players, dark web dwellers are now following smaller, speciality vendors to get their malware, fraudulent data and drugs.\n\nThe impact has been uneven. The drug market has been hit hardest, but crooks selling fraud and malware have carried on with little downtime in large part because those economies also operate on the public web.\n\nTo deal with the denial-of-service attacks, some markets have put up site mirrors at different addresses. The tactic makes it more difficult for attackers to hit a moving target, but it also makes it easier for phishing scams to fool victims who don’t know which market is real or fake.\n\n“We can’t expect to see nine markets DDoSed forever,” Wilson said. “It depends on who is behind it. The fact that the DOJ has made hardline remarks about going after the dark net makes me think we’ll see increased instability over the coming months and years. The question then is, are people going to pop up new markets and take their chances? Will we see more peer to peer trade? We’re all waiting to see.”\n\nIf a mountain of unanswered questions looms over the dark web, at least one has been answered.\n\n“The question we all had six months ago was, ‘Are we going to see another AlphaBay pop up quickly?'” Wilson said. “The answer is no.”",
  "latent_10899": "Male college students accused of rape after casual alcohol and sex hook-ups have been handed over to campus feminist sex crime “courts” that provide little to nothing in the way of due process.\n\nEvery survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported. https://t.co/mkD69RHeBL — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 23, 2015\n\nIn Fox News Reporting: The Truth About Sex & College, host Martha MacCallum explores the so-called “rape epidemic” on college campuses that has been hyped by President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and other political leaders such as Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand – who invited mattress-carrying rape accuser and sex tape producer Emma Sulkowicz to the State of the Union address in January.\n\nMilitant feminist professors and administrators at schools such as Occidental College have used a “guidance” letter sent out by Obama’s Department of Education, which threatens to strip federal funding from colleges that do not treat accusations of sexual assault according to its own politicized perspective, to form their own tribunals. These “courts,” however, have charged the students facing them without allowing them the advice of counsel of their own and the opportunity to face their accuser or to introduce relevant evidence such as texts that suggest a consensual sexual relationship.\n\nSenior attorney at Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) and former U.S. Education Department attorney Hans Bader appeared in the special report.\n\n“The Obama administration is misdirecting federal rape awareness funding by focusing on colleges rather than other settings where the rape rate is much, much higher, based on a fictional campus rape epidemic,” he observes to Breitbart News in an email statement. “The net result is to shortchange rape victims who need help.”\n\n“[I]n an April 4, 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter, the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR)…declared that schools cannot use a clear-and-convincing standard of proof typical in school disciplinary procedures for sexual harassment or sexual assault cases,” Bader noted in a prior Examiner article, observing the Department’s insistence on the use of the “preponderance of evidence” standard to resolve these cases.\n\n“’Preponderance of the evidence’ means that if a school thinks there is as little as a 51 per[cent] chance that the accused is guilty, the accused must still be disciplined,” he wrote, adding, “The Education Department’s position was based on a mistaken understanding of who is subject to Title IX, the federal law banning schools from committing sex discrimination. Title IX’s requirements apply to schools, not individual students.”\n\nWriting at National Review, Kevin Williamson notes the rape rate – across all age categories, including young people – has actually declined by 64% over the last 20 years.\n\n“President Obama, who gives every indication of being committed to the bitter end to his belief in the omnipotence of his merest utterance, gave a speech in which he affirmed his position that rape is wicked and that we should discourage it,” Williamson writes. “Instead of giving a content-free speech, he should have directed his Department of Justice to put together some definitive data on the question.”\n\nHe continues:\n\nThe fictitious rape epidemic is necessary to support the fiction of ‘rape culture,’ by which feminists mean anything other than an actual rape culture, for example the culture of the Pakistani immigrant community in Rotherham in the United Kingdom. ‘Rape culture’ simply means speech or thought that feminists disapprove of and wish to suppress, and the concept has been deployed in the cause of, inter alia, bringing disciplinary action against a Harvard student who wrote a satire of feminist rhetoric, forbidding politically unpopular speakers from speaking on campuses, and encouraging what often has turned out to be headlong and grotesquely unjust rushes to judgment, as in the case of the Duke lacrosse team. Feminism is about political power, and not the Susan B. Anthony (‘positively voted the Republican ticket — straight’) full-citizenship model of political power but rather one dominated by a very small band of narrow ideologues still operating under the daft influence of such theorists as Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, each of whom in her way equated political opposition to feminism with rape.\n\nThe fact that many of these so-called campus “sex crimes” occur after a night of heavy drinking and subsequent poor judgment on the part of both parties is also spun by college campus feminists to favor their politics rather than to finding usable information.\n\nWilliamson notes:\n\nFor example, feminists energetically protest that advising women to take such precautionary measures as moderating their alcohol intake at college parties is a species of rape-culture victim-blaming (rather than reasonable advice), and so it is no surprise that, as the DoJ notes, many surveys inquire of rape victims whether they believed their attackers to have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol but decline to ask the victims whether they were under the influence. Evidence very strongly suggests that rapists frequently use intoxicants, openly or surreptitiously, as part of a strategy conceived with malice aforethought to render their victims vulnerable. It might be useful to know how often this is the case and how often it works or fails to work, but we will not know if we refuse to ask the question.\n\n“But if your interest were in making opposition to feminist political priorities a quasi-criminal offense and using the horrific crime of rape as a cultural and political cudgel, then you’d be doing about what we’re doing right now,” Williamson concludes.",

Three incidents in the capital in the past few days alone are being treated as criminal offences.\n\nOn Monday the Met issued a warning about the potential consequences of the craze, saying it can “leave people feeling scared, anxious and intimidated”. It came after a man in a clown suit and wielding a chainsaw sparked chaos after running through the grounds of Brunel University, Uxbridge.\n\nMattie Faint, curator of the Clowns’ Gallery in Cumberland Close, said the craze could spark a lifelong phobia of clowns.\n\n“Anyone who’s been affected may think twice about wanting a clown at their party,” he added.\n\n\"Anyone who’s been affected may think twice about wanting a clown at their party.

At one time everyone used to book a clown and then other characters came along. Girls might want a fairy or boys will want a pirate. Gone are the days when there were only clowns to choose from.”\n\nMattie, who spent 25 years working in hospitals as a clown doctor, said: “It is an amazing job and it is so positive. It really hurts when these scores of stupid people dressed in clown masks are even called clowns, because to us that’s just abhorrent.”\n\nHe continued: “This is something that happens every year, but this year more than ever because of social media.\n\n“They are people wearing masks you can buy over the Halloween period and as soon as that’s over they will disappear into the ether, after they have come out and scared a lot of people all over the country.\n\nMattie (far right) with Spotty, Ginger Nutt and Bluebottle outside the Clowns International Gallery and Archives, Cumberland Close, Dalston.

Even when hospital medics produced an X-ray he was sceptical.\n\nDante Autullo, who thought his skull was only grazed in the nailgun accident, with neurosurgeon Leslie Schaffer. Photograph: M Spencer Green/AP\n\n\"When they brought in the picture, I said to the doctor 'Is this a joke? Did you get that out of the doctors joke file?'\" the 32-year-old said. \"The doctor said 'No man, that's in your head.'\"\n\nHis companion, Gail Glaenzer, bathed what looked like a flesh wound after Autullo misfired the gun. He went on with his work, did some snow plowing and only agreed to go to hospital the next day after waking up feeling nauseated.\n\nAutullo had surgery at Advocate Christ medical centre in Oak Lawn, where doctors removed the 3 1/4-inch (7.62cm) nail.

  "latent_11702": "Five months ago, Lilli Burdon was a middling middle distance runner on an elite college program, struggling to have a breakthrough on the track.\n\nToday, her career is in full bloom, with an expanded track repertoire and a successful return to cross country for the top-ranked Oregon women�s team, which is hosting the Pac-12 championship meet on Friday at Springfield Golf Club.\n\nAll it took was a nudge to run further.\n\nMore of a shove, actually.\n\nIn the week leading into the Pac-12 Outdoor Track & Field championships at Hayward Field last season, Burdon, a 1,500-meter runner by trade, was added to the 5,000 field by assistant coach Maurica Powell, no questions asked.\n\n�I wasn�t real happy with Maurica in that moment,� Burdon recalled with a laugh. �But it was very worthwhile because it was the turning point in my season.�\n\nIn her first-ever race at that distance, Burdon finished sixth in 16 minutes, 15.06 seconds at the conference meet. She followed with a qualifying time at the NCAA West Preliminaries and then a ninth-place finish at NCAA Outdoors in 15:50.15 � ninth fastest all-time at Oregon � coming within one runner of scoring for the Ducks and earning all-American status.\n\nOregon coach Robert Johnson said adding the 5,000 to Burdon�s lineup was intended to ease the pressure on her going into the 1,500, �just in case she went out there and didn�t do well, you know, don�t worry about it, you got the 5,000 coming up, you�ve got the fallback. It was a safety net at first and turned out to be a blessing in the end.�\n\nFast forward to September and the lessons Burdon learned running the 5,000 last spring have been instrumental to the success she is having in cross country.\n\nThe 19-year-old from Queensland, Australia, who will be a junior in track come January, is a redshirt freshman in cross country, having arrived in Eugene just in time for the start of the 2016 indoor track season and then sitting out last fall.\n\nIn Oregon�s season-opener, Burdon finished second overall behind teammate Katie Rainsberger in the 6,000-meter Bill Dellinger Invitational, crossing in 19:05.8.\n\nIt was her first cross country race in nearly three years.\n\n�It was actually really, really fun,� Burdon said. �I forgot how much I love cross country. I really love the team aspect of it. I love standing at the start line together and being surrounded by the girls on my team.�\n\nProving her debut was no fluke, Burdon finished seventh overall and again was the second Duck behind Rainsberger at the Pre-Nationals Invitational in Louisville, Ky., two weeks ago, as Oregon got a glimpse of the course it will run on Nov. 18 when the Ducks defend their national title.\n\n�I think our team is in a really good place right now,� Burdon said. �We�re all on the same wavelength and have the same objective of bettering ourselves every day in practice. � We�re really excited to get out there and put together a good race.�\n\nThat�s what was missing for Burdon last spring in the 1,500.\n\nAfter a freshman season that included a spot on the Ducks� NCAA Indoor qualifying distance medley relay team, and making the 1,500 for the NCAA Outdoor meet, Burdon was struggling as a sophomore, despite a second all-American turn on the indoor DMR team.\n\nShe ran 4:17.07 at the Stanford Invitational to open her 2017 season, then followed with a 4:27.63 at the Bryan Clay Invite, a 4:24.68 during the Pac-12 prelims, and 4:35.85 at the NCAA West Prelims, keeping her out of that race at the NCAA meet.\n\n�I was improving a lot in practice and working out really well,� she said. �It was more of my mental side and getting too anxious for races. I was overcomplicating things, mentally. In the 1,500 once you�re in your own head it�s hard to get out of it. The 5K was my saving grace and pulled me through.�\n\nBurdon said she still identifies as a 1,500 specialist, and jokingly said she hopes her three 5,000 races last season were the first-and-only of her career.\n\n�I like the 5K, but I love the 1,500,� she said.\n\nAfter the college season ended in June, Burdon showed her fitness when she ran 4:11.19 in a 1,500 at the Stumptown Twilight in Portland, nearly a 6-second personal-best time that would have put her in the top-five all-time at Oregon if she hadn�t been competing unattached.\n\nIt also gave her plenty of confidence going into the cross country season.\n\n�It�s a different kind of toughness having that longer grind,� Burdon said. �The 1,500 is more intense and you don�t really have a lot of time to process things and think about the pain or what other people are doing in the race. I learned in the 5K how to be composed in a state of stress, and I�ve definitely taken that into my cross country season.�\n\nFollow Chris Hansen on Twitter @chansen_RG .

  "latent_11708": "MedicalResearch.com Interview with:\n\nTed Alcorn, MHS, MA\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety\n\nBrooklyn, New York\n\nMedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study?\n\nResponse: Two decades ago, opponents of gun violence prevention recognized that they could curb the development and enactment of effective laws if they halted scientific research on which good policy would be grounded or justified. So they adopted a strategy of intimidation towards the leading federal agencies funding research on this topic and generating data on which analysis relied. Journalists that observed the pattern and scientists that lived through it often described the “chilling effect” this had on the field of gun violence prevention research.\n\nMedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings?\n\nResponse: This study provides a measure of the actual volume of publications over the last fifty years and observes trends very consistent with what had before only been understood anecdotally. Gun violence research emerged in the 1980s and grew rapidly until the mid-1990s, when Congress waged a high-profile campaign against the CDC over their firearm injury prevention research. In the fifteen years that followed, the share of scientific research devoted to gun violence plunged by 64% — and only in 2013-14 did it begin to rebound.\n\nEven then, the number of researchers actively publishing in the field remain very small, just a dozen in any given year.\n\nMedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report?\n\nResponse: While committed scientists have built a considerable body of evidence about effective gun violence prevention measures — over 2,000 relevant articles were identified in this research — good policymaking to address the country’s gun violence crisis remains constrained by what we know and what we are ignorant of.\n\nThis analysis suggests we would be better equipped if the field of gun violence research had continued growing between 1998 and 2012 rather than stagnating. Federal support for research, whether from the CDC or other agencies like the National Institute of Justice, is a critical component, and ought to be expanded. And Americans of all political stripes should agree that we can better address gun violence if we learn how to do it better.\n\nIt’s promising that the volume of publications rebounded considerably in 2013-14, but we don’t yet observe an appreciable increase in the number of dedicated researchers working in this field. That speaks to the importance of findings ways to attract and mentor new scientists committed to improving our understanding of this problem.\n\nMedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this study?\n\nResponse: This research demonstrates a new method for evaluating the volume of scientific attention devoted to gun violence and trends over time, but there’s much more to be done to understand what contributes to those changes. What are the sources of funding for identified studies and what share of the changes in publication volume can be attributed to them? There is also more to be done examining the subject matter and quality of the research, to gauge where researchers have focused and what has proven most meaningful for public safety.\n\nMedicalResearch.com: Thank you for your contribution to the MedicalResearch.com community.\n\nCitation:\n\nAlcorn T.

No.\n\n“But have cities ever been destroyed and radiation traces left everywhere? Yes.\n\n“So the effects and the devastation have to be completely real looking.”\n\nThe official Godzilla trailer:\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAnd, just like the 1954 original film, Edwards's flick references the US bombing on Hiroshima during WWII.\n\n“At the time Japan wasn’t able to make movies about how they suffered through events like that,” he says.\n\n“Yet they could make a giant monster movie which touched on all those things – it was like therapy for them, I guess.\n\n“And here the nuclear thing is very much at the heart of the movie, as is man’s abuse of nature.\n\n“And, as we all know, when it comes to man versus nature, nature is always going to win.”\n\nThe film stars an eclectic line-up including Juliette Binoche, Ken Watanabe, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Sally Hawkins.\n\nBut it’s Bryan ‘Breaking Bad’ Cranston who’s at the film’s emotional core, playing a scientist who becomes convinced that a series of recent cataclysmic events are anything but natural disasters.\n\n“What happened here wasn’t an earthquake or a typhoon,” intones the Golden Globe winning actor in the latest online trailer, as footage of widespread decimation plays out in the background.\n\n“You’re hiding something out there, and it’s going to send us all back to the Stone Age.”\n\nEdwards adds it’s for that very reason that he sought out such a respected, heavyweight cast, to give the story an anchor once the CGI maelstrom that is Godzilla itself gets unleashed.\n\n“My goal is to make a more grounded, character-driven journey,” he says.\n\n“It was important to ensure that the audience really cared about the people up on the screen and could root for them, so when all the craziness starts it becomes all the more powerful.\n\n“But because it’s such an important brand with so much money invested in it you have to try to appeal to everybody.\n\n“That’s the balancing act – how to make a movie you feel is artistic and would want to see, but which also has mass appeal.”",
  "latent_12025": "Governing is a lot harder than running a business, according to the businessman who promised to revamp the United States government by running it like a business.\n\nThis surprising admission was made by President Donald Trump last Friday, during an interview with Reuters in which he confessed that being president is “more work than in my previous life” and that he “thought it would be easier.” No doubt this will shock many of Trump’s biggest fans, who admired (read worshipped) the billionaire as a candidate and thought he would make a great president explicitly because he was a successful and wealthy businessman. (Whether Trump was truly successful in business is debatable, of course, and he has always greatly exaggerated his wealth.)\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIt has long been assumed by many Americans that if you can succeed in business and make a great deal of money, then you can succeed in just about anything. Becoming rich is, after all, the American dream.\n\nOver the years this rationale has led many conservatives to conclude not only that businessmen — and they do seem to prefer businessmen — are best suited to run the government but also that government should be run as if it were a giant, for-profit business. Though Donald Trump’s understanding of government has always been wanting, he was perceived by many as a kind of street-smart business genius and therefore the ideal candidate from the conservative perspective. Not knowing anything about government was actually a good thing, as he would come into office and do what right-wingers have long proposed: run the government like a business.\n\nOf course, there are many problems with this line of reasoning — not least the fact that business and government have completely different functions and thus require very different skills and temperaments. It's not a coincidence that many of the worst presidents in American history have been businessmen, which certainly doesn’t help the argument. Even Trump appears to be grasping this reality after three months in office. Just a few days before his interview with Reuters, he told the Associated Press that “in business, you don't necessarily need heart, whereas [in government] almost everything affects people.”\n\nTrump continued, “Everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas, in business, most things don't involve heart. In fact, in business, you're actually better off without it.”\n\nIn other words, being heartless and borderline psychopathic often breeds success in the business world, while blatantly screwing over your constituents often leads to angry voters and tough election years — at least in any remotely democratic country.\n\nWhich brings us to another obvious contrast between managing a private business empire and managing a government with checks and balances built into the system. Business owners like Donald Trump tend to run their companies like private autocrats and become accustomed to ruling with an iron fist. This kind of background is not particularly useful, however, for someone who wants to run a constitutional government. And while Trump has attempted to transfer this authoritarian style into the presidency — signing more executive orders in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman's term — it has resulted in some embarrassing failures.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThough Trump has offered his executive orders as proof that he has accomplished more than any of his predecessors in his first 100 days, some of his most notable orders have been struck down as unconstitutional by the judiciary. In addition, the president has been unable to effectively legislate — even with his party's controlling both the House and Senate. It's not a surprise then that in a recent interview with Fox News, Trump complained that the constitutional system that limits his unilateral powers is “a very rough” and “archaic system” and is “really a bad thing for the country.” This indicates that Trump will continue trying to bypass the Constitution while governing like a heavy-handed autocratic businessman.\n\nWhen conservatives insist that businessmen should run the government as if it were their own business, the one area where their experience is thought to be invaluable is the economy. If a person can flourish in the private sector and make millions or even billions of dollars running a business, the thinking goes, then surely he or she can balance the budget and have the economy running smoothly again. Trump accordingly touted his business experience as if it were some kind of superpower, repeatedly promising that he would bring back jobs and restore the American economy, without offering any specific blueprint for how he would accomplish this, beyond “making deals.” Americans were expected to take Trump’s word for it, and because he was a billionaire businessman, millions did just that.\n\nOne hundred days into his presidency, however, Trump’s economy is hardly booming. On Friday the Commerce Department revealed that America’s gross domestic product had grown a paltry 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2017 — representing the weakest quarterly growth in three years. While it wouldn’t be fair or accurate to blame this on a president who has been in office for just more than 100 days, one suspects that Trump would be gloating on Twitter had the GDP grown substantially instead of stagnating.\n\nThe truth is that Trump is as ignorant about economics as he is about government, and he will be unable to accomplish what he promised because it is, quite simply, impossible. For example, Trump vowed that he would bring back American manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the past several decades. But the vast majority of these jobs vanished as result of automation technologies, not outsourcing. (It is much easier, however, to scapegoat Mexicans and Chinese people than robots and computers.)\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMillions of Americans voted for Trump because they saw him as a rich, street-smart businessman who could use his business expertise to “make America great again.” But here’s the thing: You don’t have to be particularly intelligent or knowledgeable to make a lot of money — especially if you inherited a fortune from your father, as the president did. In the end, Donald Trump is and always will be a glorified showman who was fortunate enough to be a member of the lucky-sperm club. If anything, perhaps his presidency will finally dispel the ridiculous notion that having a lot of money qualifies someone for anything other than spending a lot of money — or that running the government like a business is a good idea.",

Sometimes it seems like there’s a bit of artful word voodoo being practiced to get fair discussion and even-handed dialogue shutdown.\n\nIt’s almost like getting jammed in a corner while someone keeps repeatedly shooting fireballs from the opposite side of the screen, and you’re stuck because you picked Zangief after watching Snake Eyez play at EVO but then you realized that you suck playing Zangief, and your opponent won’t even give you a chance to catch a break.

  "latent_12457": "by\n\nThroughout much of Latin America motherhood is more destiny than decision for many young women despite limited abilities to care for a child.\n\nVera Cordeiro, Founder and General Superintendant of Associação Saude Criança, gives details of the situation in Brazil that spans throughout many places in Latin America about the inherent beliefs of motherhood:\n\nCordeiro says, “…in the favelas of Brazil the identity of motherhood is status–a ‘destination’ sought by teenage girls who view the opportunity to have a baby as a validation of their esteem even though they are unprepared to raise a child. Favelas can be violent places to live. The rules are often different in places affected by abject poverty. And for young girls, pregnancy is often viewed as ‘protective’ in ways that outsiders may not understand. As it was explained to me, having a baby by a leader in the community associates that girl with a powerful man. That identity can protect her as her child will be recognized as belonging to the leader. This is the destination sought by many young girls.” (La Vie Childfree blogpost: Making Motherhood a Choice in Brazil.)\n\nThe Aconchego Project\n\nWhile this debilitating mindset and incumbent social gridlock are prevalent, efforts are being made to combat the underlying challenges. Associação Saúde Criança was founded in 1991 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to help “poor families by providing help in the areas of education, health, income, housing, and citizenship” (Vera Cordeiro: Making Motherhood a Choice, Not a Destination). In 2005 the organization launched a major initiative called “Aconchego Teen” targeting teenage women and birth rates.\n\n“Aconchego Teen,” which means coziness, a place for warmth and security, is designed as a public square in which teenage girls receive education regarding motherhood and pregnancy. The objective was to change the embedded view in poor teenagers that suggests motherhood is a destination instead of a personal choice. (Vera Cordeiro: Making Motherhood a Choice, Not a Destination.)\n\nThe Aconchego Project, sponsored by Johnson & Johnson, spans an average of two years for each adolescent and emphasizes other interests and perspectives so that the rate of teen pregnancy decreases (Vera Cordeiro: Making Motherhood a Choice, Not a Destination).\n\nThe project seems to be a success with teen pregnancy in Brazil dropping by 34.6% between 2000 and 2010 according to Brazil’s Health Ministry.\n\nSo far, over 200 teenagers have participated in Aconchego Teen and the feedback from both parents and teenagers is strongly positive. Not only has the project helped teens understand the difficulties of motherhood but it has also paved the way for a better communication and understanding with their parents. We encourage teens to stay in school and prepare themselves for the labor market. That way, they will experience motherhood when [and if] they are ready to embrace the joys of having a child.

  "latent_12465": "Evan J. Smith Freelancer July 17, 2017\n\nIn 2003 Ford released a spectacular display of power when it introduced the boosted SVT Cobra Mustang. It packed the punch of a 390-horsepower DOHC intercooled and supercharged 4.6L engine, backed by a durable 6-speed and with the styling was right on point. Realistically, those Cobras produced about 425 horsepower, but the kicker was the Manley steel rods and forged pistons, that almost encouraged owners to crank up the boost.\n\nIt was a winning recipe and Terminator Cobras immediately became the ones to lust after. Amazingly, 14 years later, Terminator Cobra’s haven’t lost their luster. Even despite there being more powerful factory Mustangs, they carry iconic, cult-like status. Enthusiasts love features like the smooth front bumper, twin nostril hood, and some even like the independent rear suspension.\n\nFord fanatic Paul Guenther knows the history of the SVT Mustang. He’s comes from a line of Ford enthusiasts and has owned and raced his share of Blue Oval machinery. “My 74-year-old father has been the biggest influence on me when it comes to drag racing. He has raced since the 1960s, and the other big influence would be my long-time good friend Ken Miele.”\n\n“I’ve always had a passion for Ford cars and Stock and Super Stock racing,” Paul said, “but until now I have always had bracket cars.

In the early 2000s Paul raced clean 1984 Capri that ran 8.60s, but an unfortunate incident led to a crash and the end of the Merc.\n\nThe Performance red Cobra could pass as being street legal. Guenther is fighting the urge to “sticker” it up with the NHRA contingency decals.\n\n“I was racing at Englishtown and blew the ring gear off the flywheel during a run. It just peeled off, then it went through the blowproof bell, cut the transmission lines and tranny fluid dumped on the tires,” he explained. “That was it—I was sideways and into the wall.” Thankfully, Paul was okay, and he transferred the 532 big-block Ford into an ex-Roy Hill Pro Stock Truck owned by a friend. “We put the motor in there and ran 8.30s. We later did a 598ci engine that went 7.80s at 170 mph. It was fun, but I always had a thing for Stock and Super Stock. In the ’60s my dad ran Stock at Atlantic City Speedway in a Cobra Jet. I just have a passion for it,” Paul added.\n\n“So back in the spring of 2014 I found this one for sale on Racingjunk. It was love at first sight. It was the perfect starting point for a Super Stocker,” he said. “I made the trip to Iowa and purchased the rolling chassis that had been newly built and had never seen the track. I still had my work cut out for me to make it NHRA-legal, but it was definitely a good head start.”\n\nNHRA Super Stock allows racers to mix and match engines and bodies from the same manufacturer. And since the Cobra was without its heart, Paul decided to stick with pushrod power. But this was no drop-in-and-go deal. “I had a few choices when it came to the engine combo. I could have gone with a 302, 351 Cleveland, a 429 big-block, an FE or something modern like a 4.6, 5.0 or a 5.4. In the end the 2010 428 Windsor EFI combo was most appealing to me.” This is an allowable engine that Ford designated as an option for the Cobra Jet.\n\nInterior is race ready with a roll cage, Kirkey seats and Sparco safety gear. Paul relies on the Precision Performance Products shifter and he collects his data with the Racepak logger.\n\n“The parts are readily available and it’s proven to make great power,” Paul said. “Once I settled on the 428 I called Chris Holbrook at Holbrook Racing Engines and put the wheels in motion.” With this combination, the Cobra fits into NHRA FGT/F within the Super Stock category.\n\nJim Morgan at Morgan International Race Engines handled prep on the Ford Performance aluminum cylinder heads. He began with the allowable porting and he decked the heads to minimize the combustion chamber size (within the limit of the specifications). The ports were then flowed, and finally the heads were assembled and shipped to Holbrook. After the engine was together, it was strapped to the dyno for testing and tuning. Holbrook did some R&D, fine-tuning the mill until it produced suitable numbers. “While the engine we being tested, I ordered a C-4 from Joel’s on Joy, along with an 8-inch converter from A-1 Performance.”\n\nThe driveline was coming along, but the Cobra was also lacking its interior. Paul located a donor car so he could gather the factory parts needed to make it Super Stock legal. He also had to remove the tubular K-member and A-arms that were previously installed, because they weren’t legal; he replaced them with OEM parts, and at that time converted the Cobra to a manual rack from Flaming River. The intricate Super Stock rules require the front suspension remain stock, although the K-member can be “altered” and you can use bolt-in aftermarket struts and springs.\n\nGlen Weeks at GW Performance Welding modified a stock K-member for oil pan and header clearance, and Paul set the 428 in place. He then turned to Nick at American Racing Headers for a set of custom pipes. “Nick and the guys at America Racing Headers made an awesome set of stainless steel triple-step headers that look good, fit perfectly and make great power,” Paul said.\n\nPaul Guenther’s SVT Cobra has taken on a new identity with a wicked 840hp 428ci Windsor transplant. Famed Cobra Jet racer Chris Holbrook built the engine to fit within the guidelines of the NHRA Super Stock rulebook.\n\nThe 428 sits in a beautiful engine bay that was smoothed, painted, and finished with fine detail. It’s like a showplace for the powerplant, and the way Paul sees it, the 428 has a lot to live up to since it replaced the awesome blown 4.6L beast. Up top is a Ford four-hole throttle-body that feeds the ported single-plane intake. Paul runs the required “Z304” heads that are mated to the bored block and a Canton pan seals the bottom-end. Holbrook went with a Callies crank, Oliver rods and Diamond pistons to achieve 12.7:1 compression from the small-block. EFI is from Big Stuff and it utilizes 60 lb/hr injectors, Aeromotive pump, and MSD ignition. It also features a Holbrook-designed custom cam, which spins sky high and produces 840 horsepower and 690 lb-ft of torque.\n\nLoving the stock look, Paul left the factory Red paint intact and the body mostly stock. But needing a bit more traction, Paul installed Strange double-adjustable struts along with soft front drag springs. The IRS was traded for a Ford 9-inch that’s suspended by a RJ Race Cars ladder bar with Strange coilovers and a Chris Alston’s Chassisworks anti-rollbar. Rear gears are currently 4.30:1, but that can change depending on track and weather conditions. Stopping power comes from lightweight Aerospace Brakes and rolling stock was replaced with Weld Wheels Alumistars in the front with American Racing Trackstars in the rear with 28.5x11.5-inch Phoenix slicks that fit nicely in the mini-tubs.\n\n“The Cobra came with an aftermarket cowl hood so I had to replace it with an OEM hood to be legal,” Paul told us. “I found one and brought it to Douglas at Starlight Restorations where he did a first-class job at matching the color. Last but not least, I called Sal Biondo from Biondo Racing Products for all my Sparco safety gear and weather station equipment.” Paul finally cracked the throttle in anger in April of 2017.\n\nTerminator Cobras look good from any angle. We love the single wheelie bar and big meats out back. Faux New Jersey plate is a play on Paul’s biggest fans, his daughters Kalyn and Corrine. He also gets big support from his wife Lori.\n\n“The first few runs went well, there was only some minor adjustments needed to be able to make full passes. The Cobra handles great,” Paul stated, “Ken Keir [Ken Kier Race Cars] was a huge help in getting it dialed in and going straight. Now it launches with the wheels up in true Super Stock fashion and it tracks perfectly straight. It's a very fun car to drive.”\n\nSet at a race weight of 3,355 pounds, the Cobra has turned a best of 9.40 at 143 mph. Paul has gone a few rounds, but his focus is on improving performance and eventually taking a shot at the FGT/F national record. “At this point I only have about 20 runs on the car so I’m still working out the bugs and getting used to tuning the EFI. But overall I’m extremely happy with my new Super Stocker. My goal is to run right around one second under my 10.10 index and with the power this motor made, I should have no problem getting there.”",
  "latent_12478": "The Islanders have a resurfaced emblem of locker-room affection, and it was ripped from the annals of the late 1990s.\n\nOr at least that’s the guess.\n\nA button-up varsity jacket, dark-blue and orange, possibly leather, was over the shoulders of captain John Tavares as he did his television interview following a 5-2 win over the Coyotes on Tuesday night at Barclays Center. The jacket — which for now remains unnamed — was making its first appearance this season after it was bought by defenseman Johnny Boychuk last year, the Islanders joining the many teams that hand out a player-chosen award after each victory.\n\nBoychuk said he paid, well, a princely sum for the relic on eBay, where its original owner had a classic turquoise “Eastern Conference” logo stitched onto the left arm. Yet it disappeared for a while in preparation for the move to Brooklyn, and has only now reemerged.\n\n“Oh, it’s a beauty,” said Tavares, who was also celebrating his own bobble-head giveaway night.\n\nForward Mikhail Grabovski did not come out for the third period, the team saying he had an upper-body injury.\n\n“I don’t have an update,” coach Jack Capuano said. “I should know more [Tuesday].”\n\nKyle Okposo had three assists, taking his career total to 200.\n\n“I think you just think of all that stuff when your career is over,” said the American-born Okposo, the Islanders’ first-round pick (No. 7 overall) in 2006 who played his first NHL game during the 2007-08 season. “I don’t really think about it too much. Just a number. I want to go out there and play as well as I can.”\n\nVeteran defenseman Marek Zidlicky, 38, was back in the lineup and played career game No. 800.\n\nZidlicky had been a healthy scratch for Friday night’s 4-1 win in Anaheim, the second leg of a back-to-back, in favor of rookie Adam Pelech, who played his first NHL game. Although Capuano said Pelech “played a great game, obviously, he’s going to continue to play games for us,” Zidlicky went back and paired with Brian Strait , and they had a very tough night.\n\n“He’s an offensive-minded guy,” Capuano said of Zidlicky. “He’s a cagey player, a veteran guy that understands the game. For me, he’s still learning the system that we play, but at the end of the day, he’s helped our hockey club.”",

I think both are necessary approaches, but I think, at least initially, political action is absolutely necessary and more effective. The shift in laws in the United States with regard to race may have not fully evened the playing field, but it gave blacks and whites a chance to work and study side by side and helped start the dissolution of fears and prejudices, though we still have a long way to go.\n\nThe situation in Jamaica is similar. If Jamaicans who fear an LGBT-friendly nation were given the chance to interact on a regular basis with LGBT Jamaicans (who could be more open because of protective laws) I believe we would begin to see a shift in attitudes.",
  "latent_12572": "The Witchfinder encounters a supremely poorly coded, ‘comedy’ SJW tool for evaluating levels of Reddit ‘bigotry’. The tool, Free Reddit Check, is made by a developer at Akismet manufacturers Automattic and even labels the phrase, ‘sargon of akkad’ as ‘potentially offensive’.\n\nEarlier today I was setting up Twitter preview cards for this site when I noticed a blog by Akismet (archive here). Akismet is the name of a commercial anti-spam tool. It can be used for excluding spam from WordPress blogs. I had evaluated it before but found it unsatisfactory.\n\nOne of their employees had participated in ‘Cultivated Wit’s Comedy Hack Day in Los Angeles’ and created a ‘Free Reddit Checker’ tool (archive here). The tool crawls a given user’s posting history and evaluates them with a percentage of how ‘Terrible’ they are. Although it is said to be a personal site and billed as a comedy, the Akismet blog promotes it, saying –\n\n“[…] While perfectly suited for a hack day which pairs developers and comedians, there is certainly usefulness in determining the respectability of a potential online acquaintance. Or just knowing who to ignore. And being obsessed with content analysis, community moderation, and keeping the web’s underbelly in check, we can’t help but think it’s a nifty idea […]”\n\nPut another way … there is a serious ‘underbelly’ to this ‘joke’ site. We are talking about ‘comedy’ ideological purity here.\n\nIt is clear that the developer, Dan Walmsley, was using the same skills he uses in his workplace to identify spam in his site to purportedly identify bigots. Unfortunately for him, he pretty much sucks. The tool has … design flaws.\n\nBelow is my result. Also below is the result from a random Ghazian. Without searching on the sample post text, can you tell which is which?\n\nThe tool ranks users based on key words or phrases and posting history. Unfortunately it is unable to distinguish context. The second user is a random Ghazian. I will not name them. Unfortunately, they used the term ‘gamergate’ whilst condemning us. Merely saying, ‘sargon of akkad’ is apparently also flagged as hate speech. They also visited KiA to condemn us. As a result of this, they were identified as a person who ‘probably hates’ ‘women’.\n\nMy account is the one above. Ironically, the tool has actually flagged fewer instances of ‘potentially offensive’ phrases for me. The ones it has flagged are wrong. I have written various posts condemning hate speech – the sample post it quotes is my criticism of Nick Denton’s Gawker.com commissioning a twitter script to tweet passages from Mein Kampf. A comment condemning a GamerGate opponent for using the words, ‘nigger’ and ‘faggot’ also flagged my account as using potentially racist language.\n\nBoth myself and the Ghazian used the word, ‘gamergate’ so we were both flagged as haters. It is like flagging someone as a Nazi for saying they are ‘anti-Nazi’. Tough break for the Anti-Nazi League. Hell, I was flagged for saying, ‘anti-GG’. Under this even Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian are evil misogynists. The program would take one look at Sarkeesian’s recent presentations and start a klaxon ringing!\n\nI contacted the author of the tool, Dan Walmsley (@danwalmsley), and he gave me this unhelpful comment –\n\n“[…] I deeply appreciate you confirming that my algorithm, while rudimentary, is also surprisingly accurate a lot of the time. On a more serious note, the issue of whether certain subreddits are primarily offensive or not is clearly up for debate, with well-meaning people on both sides. The fact that we took a particular side does not in any way diminish the fact that there _are_ two sides, and that there are people who consider anyone who posts to KiA to be terrible people (FWIW, I’m not one of them, since I’ve barely even been aware of Reddit until last weekend and I have no real experience with folks on either side – though I did go to the Rally to Restore Fear/Sanity and loved it, and had a soft spot for the Reddit logo ever since). We could pick any arbitrary set of subreddits and say they’re terrible or not and there would be good people on both sides, so I’d argue it’s not that we’re being unfair, but more that we picked the side that you’re not on. I also could dig in on whether your paraphrasing of derogatory terms is offensive or not, but you’re the almost-a-lawyer here, not me. I’d say if I was queer or a person of color I’d be shocked to see you using them without even attempting to recognise the power of those words to shock and offend. Look, I’m sure you’re not actually 100% Terrible, maybe even nice a lot of the time, and I haven’t done anything to link this automated analysis of your Reddit account to your real identity (nor could I). The best suggestion I have is that it only took me a weekend to build this site, maybe you could build one with a different algorithm, host it at betterfreeredditcheck.com and see which one people use? Regards, Dan p.s. I tried fixing the bug which adds quoted text to the score, but you were still 100% Terrible.”\n\n… whilst a spokesperson for his employer’s PR took the more pragmatic approach of disassociating themselves, (which might work better if they removed their blog link to the site) saying –\n\n“Thanks for reaching out. This is not an Automattic site however we did pass on your request to those responsible for it.”\n\nThe quality of Walmsley’s tool for detecting #GamerGate supporters left me … a little doubtful of his algorithmic skills. Akismet’s blog post specifically referred to the similarity of purpose between their product and Walmsley’s ‘comedy’, ‘hack’. I did a casual Google search to see if anyone had poor experiences with Akismet. Unsurprisingly, some people felt that ‘Akismet really sucks’. Others felt that ‘Akismet sucks’, whilst more users asked, ‘Does Akismet Suck Now?’ (archive here [1], here [2] and here [3]).\n\nYour author is being a little flippant and has admittedly deliberately sought critical sites. Clearly, however, there are questions to be asked about the quality of Akismet developer work. There are also questions to be asked about the judgement of Automattic management in permitting their brand to promote inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nShortly after my initial media inquiry, the ‘Free Reddit Check’ site changed its behaviour, branding me ‘awesome’ and ceasing to return results for any other username I tried –\n\nWalmsley chose to brand a subreddit with 50,000 members a ‘hate’ sub and now he has been called out he is making light of it. The only ‘comedy’ I see here is the standard of his code.\n\nBased on the accuracy level of ‘Free Reddit Check’, as a consumer, I would fear to install it! I am stuck with a ‘comedy’ image of alternate Akismet products. Imagine a web nanny program written by Walmsley or Akismet that trapped children in the .xxx domain?\n\nMany KiA users are technical professionals in a position to influence buying decisions and many have WordPress blogs. At the same time the recent SPJ Airplay has demonstrated that #GamerGate is gaining acceptance as a consumer movement. Why insult thousands of demographic-core customers?\n\nIf you feel that KotakuInAction is not a hate site, if you feel that ‘sargon of akkad’ is not offensive speech, or if you just feel that Akismet should focus on spam detection (and lets face it, it really needs to focus) then why not let Dan (@danwalmsley) and his boss, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenwegg (@photomatt) know?\n\nThe official WordPress Akismet plugin has over a million installs … but only about 400 reviews on the WordPress site. At present, 374 people have given Akismet 5 stars. That is less that 1% of the membership of /r/KotakuInAction/ and less than half a percent of Sargon’s subscribers. If any readers have tried Akismet recently, why not leave a polite, reasoned review or rating?",

Photo: Dborah Cannon Photo: Dborah Cannon Image 1 of / 17 Caption Close UT decides Longhorns have been pranked, will rip out maroon bluebonnets 1 / 17 Back to Gallery\n\nMaroon bluebonnets, at best an oxymoron and at worst a deep insult to the Austin community's burnt-orange sensibilities, are slated to be removed from the University of Texas main campus.\n\nUT officials would prefer not to announce the exact date the offending plants will be taken up, said Markus Hogue, the university's program coordinator for irrigation and water conservation.\n\n\"We anticipate soon,\" Hogue said Wednesday. \"We're trying to make it as discrete as possible, and we're trying to capture the seeds. Next year, we're going to pull any maroon bluebonnet as soon as we see it.\"\n\nNo one has confessed to secretly seeding two beds in the shadow of the UT tower with Aggie maroon bluebonnets, but Hogue said he suspects it was the work of Texas A&M supporters.\n\nAfter seeing an annual increase in the number of maroon bluebonnets in the two beds near the tower, Hogue said he did some research and learned that two A&M professors, Jerry Parsons and Greg Grant, developed a maroon strain of the Texas state flower.\n\n\"Dr. Parsons mentioned that maroon is a recessive trait, but we're seeing more and more,\" Hogue said. \"That leads me to believe that somebody is putting out more seeds. We should see a decreased number.\"\n\nAnother professor said he thought UT crews had planted the maroon flowers by mistake, but that's not possible, Hogue said.\n\n\"We haven't touched the bed in four years,\" he said. \"We're trying to get it native to where it survives on its own.\"\n\nThat's part of the reason Hogue became aware that the maroon bluebonnet patch had been getting bigger. The contraband flowers are in a bed that was switched five years ago to the \"xeriscape\" landscape design, requiring little or no irrigation.\n\n\"We've been monitoring it to see how much water it was using,\" Hogue said. \"We're trying to move the campus over to native plants to see how they hold up against traffic and the heat-island effect. I started noticing the flowers.\"\n\nBesides bluebonnets, the xeriscape bed has agave, rosemary, ornamental grasses and succulent plants such as cactus.\n\nAs an irrigation expert, Hogue had a few kind words to say about the alleged pranksters.\n\n\"I'm happy they chose a drought-tolerant plant,\" he said. \"During this time we're all struggling with water, even if this was done by an Aggie, it was done in good taste.\"\n\nAnd if Parsons and the A&M crew succeed in developing an orange bluebonnet, Hogue said UT will plant it.",

  "latent_13031": "Brett Duquette and Bob Gurnett are the type of fans that NHL dreams are made of. The diehard basketball fans used the NBA lockout as an excuse to check out pro hockey. Now they have plunged headfirst into a whirlwind love affair with all things NHL. The pair is channeling newfound puck-love into whatthehellisicing.com, a blog chronicling their growing obsession with the sport. “It’s gotten to the point where I seriously am not sure if I want basketball to come back. We’re having so much fun,” says Duquette, 27, who lives in New York, where he is an editor for a children’s book publisher. The close friends grew up in Omaha, Neb. — college football country — where Gurnett, 27, still lives and works in I.T. They are impressed with the speed of hockey, but admit it was a fight that first hooked them. “It was amazing how the play-by-play guys switched from talking hockey to being boxing commentators,” marvels Duquette. “Then we were amazed that nobody stopped it. In any other sport, a fight is a huge deal. In hockey, it’s just a part of it.”\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nBoth men speculate that they’ve watched more hockey this year than NFL and the World Series combined and they have nothing but good things to say about the fraternity they have joined. “One of the things that I think we’ve both been surprised with is how welcoming other fans are. When you are in a sports bar and tell people that you are new fan, they say ‘hey, welcome to hockey,’ ” says Gurnett. “It’s been great.” Talking to the guys over Skype, it is fun to hear their very fresh perspective on the sport.\n\nDuquette loves Marian Hossa and thinks Vancouver’s Sedin twins have extrasensory perception because of their non-verbal on-ice communication. Gurnett is amazed at how much coverage was generated just because Sidney Crosby’s practice helmet changed colour from white to black. As newbies, the pair have latched onto the Winnipeg Jets as their team. They say they were in part inspired by their love of The Weakerthans, Winnipeg’s great indie rock group, and plan to make a pilgrimage to the city to see a game. Admittedly, the movement of the NBA fan to NHL devotee sounds like a stretch to some, as while there are definitely plenty of all-sports fans, these two sports tend to have less overlap. But in the U.S. the narrative of hockey as basketball substitute is starting to gain some momentum. For example, Stephen Colbert’s Colbert Report recently created a sarcastic pro-NBA-owner commercial which warned of “NBA fans being forced to watch hockey.” As well, Bill Simmons at ESPN’s Grantland has launched a “Behind the Pipes” series. Simmons bought L.A. Kings season tickets and plans to have the site’s staff check it out and file their thoughts.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nDuquette and Gurnett say they’ve seen a few other major U.S. media outlets start to talk about the virtues of the NHL as a place for some bored basketball fans to check out. It’s clear that, particularly in the U.S., the NHL definitely has an opportunity to capitalize during the NBA’s labour dispute, but how to do it is the question. The Icing bloggers say it is still tough to find U.S. TV coverage, despite the $2 billion, 10-year deal the league signed with NBC earlier this year. But in some ways, that helps create the seminal experiences that forge true fandom. “I went to a sports bar down the street last week during the World Series and it was like, can you please switch one of your 20 TVs to a hockey game? It took some asking but the bartender eventually did it,” says Gurnett. While things are going great for these neophyte hockey bloggers, it is clearly less rosy for basketball bloggers, which is one reason why The Score’s The Basketball Jones decided to take matters into their own hands and hit the road. “We were just getting tired of waiting for the NBA to get their act together. If the NBA wasn’t going to provide any content, we know we can still continue to provide a quality product,” says Tas Melas. Faced with a lost season, they leave Nov. 1 on a six-week, 10-city tour called the TBJ Tour: No Season Required, which ends in Toronto on Dec. 9. They plan to do a show on location in each stop, host a fan meet-up and try to create more of the goofy viral videos they are well known for. “It should be pretty exciting because, well, nothing else is going on,” says Melas.",
  "latent_13035": "The LA Times is a good newspaper and is currently doing the best political coverage in California. They are also the most aggressive ad shoveling website I have ever seen. Their ad blocker blocker and paywall works, preventing me from reading articles.

But boy that page does not go quietly. Here’s how they reward their readers.\n\nThat’s a timeline of 30 seconds of page activity about 5 minutes after the article was opened. To be clear, this timeline should be empty. Nothing should be loading. Maybe one short ping, maybe loading one extra ad. Instead the page requested 2000 resources totalling 5 megabytes in 30 seconds. It will keep making those requests as long as I leave the page open. 14 gigabytes a day.\n\nThere’s no one offender in the network log, it’s a wide variety of different ad services. The big data consumer was a 2 megabyte video ad, but it’s all the other continuous requests that really worry me.\n\nA lot has been written about the future of journalism, the importance of businesses like the LA Times being profitable as a way to protect American democracy. I agree with that in theory. But this sort of incompetence and contempt for readers makes me completely uninterested in helping their business.\n\nEdit for pedantic nerds: for some unfortunate reason this blog post ended up on Hacker News where people raised eyebrows at my 14 gigabytes / day estimate. To be crystal clear: I did a half-assed measurement for 30 seconds and measured 5 megabytes. 5 * 2 * 60 * 24 = 14,400, or about 14GB.

If you want to leave a browser window open for 24 hours to measure the true number, be my guest; I’ll even link to your report here. (Hope you have lots of RAM and bandwidth!) I’m a web professional with significant experience measuring bandwidth and performance, I know how to do this right. But that’s the LA Times webmaster’s job, not mine, and I don’t have a lot of confidence that they much care.\n\n3.2 hours is the current record for measuring traffic before something crashes.\n\nEdit 2: for a lot of people visiting my blog I think it is their first view of a network timeline graph like this.

See the docs, but briefly you open dev tools and click on network and watch the waterfall graph. You want to open it before loading the page so it captures everything from the start. Beware a normal web page will end very soon and be boring; the LA Times is a very special website.\n\nHere’s a larger view of 200 seconds of that same LA Times article page, and a direct link to the full size image.

Written by same people as last discredited story on woman. WATCH!” Trump wrote in a tweet on Thursday morning.\n\n“None of this ever took place,” Trump told a Times reporter in a phone interview.\n\nFour women in the last 24 hours have accused Trump of kissing or groping them against their will.\n\nThe women who spoke to the Times, who are both supporters of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesman: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE, said they felt compelled to speak out after Trump said he had never done the things he was caught boasting about on a 2005 videotape released Friday.\n\nOn that tape, Trump bantered with “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush about going up to women and kissing them: “I don’t even wait.”\n\nHe also said he could get away with things because he was a celebrity, and that women would let him do anything. “Grab them by the p---y, you can do anything,” he says on the recording.\n\nTrump has repeatedly dismissed the comments as “locker room talk,” but the women said Trump’s words struck a nerve because the talk was similar to what they had experienced.\n\nJessica Leeds, now 74, told the Times that Trump groped her while seated on a flight more than 30 years ago. She said that Trump began to grab her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt as he sat next to her, the two strangers until the interaction.\n\n“He was like an octopus ... his hands were everywhere,” she told The Times.\n\n“It was an assault.”\n\nAnother woman, Rachel Crooks, told the Times that Trump kissed her on the month when she was a 22-year-old receptionist in 2005.\n\n“It was so inappropriate,” Crooks told The Times.\n\n“I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that.”\n\nA third woman told the Palm Beach Post, in a story published on Wednesday, that Trump had groped her at a resort near Miami in 2003.\n\nMindy McGillivray, now 36, told the Post that Trump grabbed her buttocks while she helped a photographer during a concert at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nPeople magazine published a story on Wednesday night by one of its former writers, who said she had received unwanted advances from Trump in December 2005 while she toured Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort for an interview with Trump and his wife.\n\nAfter Melania Trump left her along with Donald Trump, writer Natasha Stoynoff said Trump pushed her against a wall and forcibly kissed her.\n\nStoynoff said Trump then told her that they were going to have an affair and promised to take her to an expensive steakhouse. He also reportedly referenced the famous tabloid cover during his affair with Marla Maples declaring “Best Sex I Ever Had.”\n\nTrump’s campaign has fought back fiercely against all of the stories.\n\nIn a statement to People, a spokesperson for Trump said Stoynoff’s story never happened.\n\n“There is no merit or veracity to this fictional story,” the spokesman said. “Why wasn't this reported at the time? Mr. Trump was the biggest star on television and surely this would have been a far bigger scoop for People magazine.\n\n“She alleges this took place in a public space with people around. This is nothing [but a] politically motivated fictional pile-on.”\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller in a statement to the Times said its entire article was “fiction” and a “completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump.”\n\n“To reach back decades in an attempt to smear Mr. Trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this election.”\n\nTrump’s lawyers sent a late-night email to the Times demanding the retraction of the “libelous article” and threatened a lawsuit, according to a letter published by Buzzfeed News and other outlets.",

One of the suspects, a 22-year-old black male, was also shot and injured.\n\nAmiracle's father is believed to have shot one of the victims, Craig said.\n\nA dispute on Facebook culminated in a confrontation outside the Williams residence, where several young women had a physical fight Thursday afternoon, police said. The father, observing the fight, \"felt his daughters may have been in some sort of danger and responded by shooting one person at the scene,\" Craig said.\n\nAfter the first shooting, a second individual took out a machine gun and began to fire repeatedly, striking Amiracle and her three family members, he said.\n\nAs of 3 a.m. Friday, police had two suspects under arrest: the alleged second shooter, a 23-year-old black male, and the alleged driver of a getaway vehicle who had been shot in the incident. Craig said the alleged shooter had an outstanding warrant for his arrest for a felony charge in Virginia. At least one of the men has been involved in local gangs, he said.\n\nA TEC-9 machine gun was recovered as part of the police investigation.\n\n\"[The shooting was] a decision made by a coward, once again, another coward that goes out and engages in senseless violence,\" Craig said. \"We will continue our focus on eradicating violence, and certainly dismantling these street gangs here in Detroit.\"",

  "latent_13803": "The 1811 German Coast uprising was a revolt of black slaves in parts of the Territory of Orleans on January 8–10, 1811. The uprising occurred on the east bank of the Mississippi River in what is now St. John the Baptist and St. Charles Parishes, Louisiana. While the slave insurgency was the largest in US history, the rebels killed only two white men. Confrontations with militia and executions after trial killed 95 black people.\n\nBetween 64 and 125 enslaved men marched from sugar plantations near present-day LaPlace on the German Coast toward the city of New Orleans.[2] They collected more men along the way. Some accounts claimed a total of 200 to 500 slaves participated.[3] During their two-day, twenty-mile march, the men burned five plantation houses (three completely), several sugarhouses, and crops. They were armed mostly with hand tools.[4]\n\nWhite men led by officials of the territory formed militia companies, and in a battle on January 10 killed 40 to 45 of the escaped slaves while suffering no fatalities themselves, then hunted down and killed several others without trial. Over the next two weeks, white planters and officials interrogated, tried, executed and decapitated an additional 44 escaped slaves who had been captured. Executions were generally by hanging or firing squad. Heads were displayed on pikes to intimidate other slaves.\n\nSince 1995, the African American History Alliance of Louisiana has led an annual commemoration in January of the uprising, in which they have been joined by some descendants of participants in the revolt.[5]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nThe sugar boom on what was known as Louisiana's German Coast (named for immigrants in the 1720s) began after the American Revolutionary War, while the area near New Orleans was still controlled by Spain. In the 1780s, Jean Saint Malo, an escaped slave, established a colony of maroons in the swamps below New Orleans, which eventually led Spanish officials to send militia, who captured him. St. Malo became a folk hero after his execution in New Orleans on June 19, 1784. A decade later, during the height of the French Revolution, Spanish officials discovered a slave conspiracy at Pointe Coupee (established by French settlers around 1720 between Natchez and New Orleans). That slave uprising during the Easter holidays was suppressed before it came to fruition, and resulted in 23 executions by hanging (with the decapitated heads then displayed on the road to New Orleans) and 31 additional slaves were flogged and sent to serve hard labor in other Spanish outposts.[6]\n\nAfter the Haitian slave revolution, planters attempted to establish similar lucrative sugarcane plantations on the Gulf Coast, resulting in a dense slave population. They converted from cotton and indigo plantations to sugar cane, so that by 1802, 70 sugar plantations produced over 3,000 tons in a year.[7] However, they replicated the brutal conditions which had led to numerous revolts in Haiti—the high profits were made by working slaves longer hours and punishing them more brutally, so that they lived shorter lives than any other slave society in North America.[8] Some accounts claimed blacks outnumbered whites by nearly five to one by 1810, and about 90% of whites in the area owned slaves. More than half of those enslaved may have been born outside Louisiana, many in Africa, where various European nations established slave trading outposts and Kongo was ripped apart by civil wars.\n\nAfter the U.S. negotiated the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, both the Marquis de Lafayette and James Monroe declined to become the Territorial Governor. President Thomas Jefferson then turned to a fellow Virginian, William C.C. Claiborne, whom he appointed on an interim basis, and who arrived in New Orleans with 350 volunteers and eighteen boats. Claiborne struggled with the area's diverse population, particularly as he spoke neither French nor Spanish. The population also included a larger proportion of native Africans among the slaves than elsewhere in the U.S. In addition, the mixed-race Creole and French-speaking population grew markedly with refugees from Haiti (and their slaves) following the successful Haitian slave revolution. Claiborne was not used to a society with the number of free people of color that Louisiana had, but he worked to continue their role in the militia that had been established under Spanish rule. Long-term French Creole residents also complained to Washington, D.C. about Claiborne and new U.S. settlers in the territory, and wanted no part of President Jefferson's plan to pay 30,000 Americans to move into the new territory and amalgamate with the residents. Thus, by 1805, a delegation led by Jean Noel Destrehan went to Washington to complain about the \"oppressive and degrading\" form of the territorial government, but President Madison continued to support Claiborne, who had expressed great doubts about the planters' honesty and trustworthiness.[10] Lastly, Claiborne suspected that the Spanish in nearby West Florida might encourage an insurrection. Thus, he struggled to establish and maintain his authority.\n\nIn the overall Territory of Orleans, from 1803 to 1811, the free black population nearly tripled, to 5,000, with 3,000 arriving as migrants from Haiti (via Cuba) in 1809–1810. In Saint-Domingue they had enjoyed certain rights as gens de couleur, including owning slaves themselves.[11] Furthermore, between 1790 and 1810, slave traders brought around 20,000 enslaved Africans to New Orleans.[12]\n\nThe waterways and bayous around New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain made transportation and trade possible, but also provided easy escapes and nearly impenetrable hiding places for runaway slaves. Some maroon colonies continued for years within several miles of New Orleans. With the spread of ideas of freedom from the French and Haitian revolutions, European-Americans worried about slave uprisings, particularly in the Louisiana area. In 1805, they heard a traveling Frenchman was preaching about liberty, equality and fraternity to the French-speaking slaves, and arrested him as dangerous.[13]\n\nThe rebellion [ edit ]\n\nA group of Africans who had been forcefully enslaved met on January 6, 1811. It was a period when work had relaxed on the plantations after the fierce weeks of the sugar harvest and processing. As planter James Brown testified weeks later, \"The black Quamana [Kwamena, meaning \"born on Saturday\"], owned by Mr. Brown, and the mulatto Harry, owned by Messrs. Kenner & Henderson, were at the home of Manuel Andry on the night of Saturday–Sunday of the current month in order to deliberate with the mulatto Charles Deslondes, chief of the brigands.\" Slaves had spread word of the planned uprising among the slaves at plantations up and down the \"German Coast\", along the Mississippi River.\n\nThe revolt began on January 8 at the Andry plantation.[15] After striking and badly wounding Manuel Andry, the slaves killed his son Gilbert. \"An attempt was made to assassinate me by the stroke of an axe,\" Andry wrote. \"My poor son has been ferociously murdered by a horde of brigands who from my plantation to that of Mr. Fortier have committed every kind of mischief and excesses, which can be expected from a gang of atrocious bandittis [sic] of that nature.\"\n\nThe rebellion gained momentum quickly. The 15 or so slaves at Andry's plantation, about 30 miles (50 km) upriver from New Orleans, joined another eight slaves from the next-door plantation of the widows of Jacques and Georges Deslondes. This was the home plantation of Charles Deslondes, a slave driver (overseer who was himself enslaved) later described by one of the captured slaves as the \"principal chief of the brigands.\" Small groups of slaves joined from every plantation the rebels passed. Witnesses remarked on their organized march. They carried mostly pikes, hoes and axes, but few firearms, and they marched to drums while some carried flags.[4] From 10–25% of any given plantation's slave population joined with them.\n\nAt the plantation of James Brown, Kook, one of the most active participants and key figures in the story of the uprising, joined the insurrection. At the next plantation down, Kook attacked and killed François Trépagnier with an axe. He was the second and last planter killed in the rebellion. After the band of slaves passed the LaBranche plantation, they stopped at the home of the local doctor. Finding the doctor gone, Kook set his house on fire.\n\nSome planters testified at the trials in parish courts that they were warned by their slaves of the uprising. Others regularly stayed in New Orleans, where many had town houses,[18] and trusted their plantations to overseers to run. Planters quickly crossed the Mississippi River to escape the insurrection and to raise a militia.\n\nAs the slave party moved downriver, they passed larger plantations, from which many slaves joined them. Numerous slaves joined the insurrection from the Meuillion plantation, the largest and wealthiest plantation on the German Coast. The rebels laid waste to Meuillion's house. They tried to set it on fire, but a slave named Bazile fought the fire and saved the house.\n\nAfter nightfall the slaves reached Cannes-Brulées, about 15 miles (24 km) northwest of New Orleans. The men had traveled between 14 and 22 miles (23 and 35 km), a march that probably took them seven to ten hours. By some accounts, they numbered \"some 200 slaves,\" although other accounts estimated up to 500.[19] As typical of revolts of most classes, free or slave, the insurgent slaves were mostly young men between the ages of 20 and 30. They represented primarily lower-skilled occupations on the sugar plantations, where slaves labored in difficult conditions with a low life expectancy.\n\nThe suppression [ edit ]\n\nDespite his axe-wound, Col. Andry crossed the river to contact other planters and round up a militia, which pursued the rebel slaves. By noon on January 9, people in New Orleans had heard about the German Coast insurrection. By sunset, General Wade Hampton I, Commodore John Shaw, and Governor William C.C. Claiborne sent two companies of volunteer militia, 30 regular troops, and a detachment of 40 seamen to fight the slaves. By about 4 a.m. on January 10, the New Orleans forces had reached Jacques Fortier's plantation, where Hampton thought the escaped slaves had encamped overnight.\n\nHowever, the escaped slaves had started back upriver about two hours before, traveled about 15 miles (24 km) back up the coast and neared Bernard Bernoudy's plantation. There, planter Charles Perret, under the command of the badly injured Andry and in cooperation with Judge St. Martin, had assembled a militia of about 80 men from the river's opposite side. At about 9 o'clock, this local militia discovered slaves moving toward high ground on Bernoudy's plantation. Perret ordered his militia to attack the rebel slaves, which he later later wrote numbered about 200 men, about half on horseback. (Most accounts said only the leaders were mounted, and historians believe it unlikely the slaves could have gathered so many mounts.) Within a half-hour, 40 to 45 slaves had been killed; the remainder slipped away into the woods and swamps. Perret and Andry's militia tried to pursue them despite the difficult terrain.\n\nOn January 11, militia, assisted by Native American trackers as well as hunting dogs, captured Charles Deslondes, whom Andry considered \"the principal leader of the bandits.\" A slave driver and son of a white man and a slave, Deslondes received no trial or interrogation. Samuel Hambleton described his execution as having his hands chopped off, \"then shot in one thigh & then the other, until they were both broken – then shot in the Body and before he had expired was put into a bundle of straw and roasted!\"[20] His cries under the torture could intimidate other escaped slaves in the marshes. The following day Pierre Griffee and Hans Wimprenn, who were thought the murderers of M. Thomassin and M. Francois Tepagnier, were captured, killed, and their heads hacked off for delivery to the Andry estate. Major Milton and the dragoons from Baton Rouge arrived and provided support for the militia, since Governor Hampton believed them supported by the Spanish in West Florida.[21]\n\nThe trials [ edit ]\n\nHaving suppressed the insurrection, the planters and government officials continued to search for slaves who had escaped. Those captured later were interrogated and jailed before trials. Officials convened three tribunals: one at Destrehan Plantation owned by Jean Noel Destréhan in (St. Charles Parish), one in St. John the Baptist Parish, and the third in New Orleans (Orleans Parish).\n\nThe Destrehan trials, overseen by Judge Pierre Bauchet St. Martin, resulted in the execution of 18 of 21 accused slaves by firing squad.[22][23] Some slaves testified against others, but others refused to testify nor submit to the all-planter tribunal.\n\nIn New Orleans, Commodore Shaw presumed that \"but few of those who have been taken were acquitted.\" The New Orleans trials resulted in the conviction and summary executions of 11 more slaves. Three were publicly hanged in the Place d'Armes, now Jackson Square. One of those spared was a thirteen year old boy, who was ordered to witness another slave's death and then received 30 lashes. Another slave was treated with leniency because his uncle turned him in and begged for mercy. The sentence of a third slave was commuted because of the valuable information he had given.[24]\n\nThe heads of the executed were put on pikes, and the mutilated bodies of dead rebels displayed to intimidate other slaves. By the end of January, nearly 100 heads were displayed on the levee from the Place d'Armes in central New Orleans along the River Road to the plantation district and Ambry's plantation, nearly quadrupling the number of heads nailed to posts from New Orleans to Pointe Coupee after the 1795 slave uprising.[25]\n\nU.S. territorial law provided no appeal from a parish court's ruling, even in cases involving imposition of a death sentence on an enslaved individual. Governor Claiborne, recognizing that fact, wrote[26] to the judges of each court that he was willing to extend executive clemency (\"in all cases where circumstances suggest the exercise of mercy a recommendation to that effect from the Court and Jury, will induce the Governor to extend to the convict a pardon.\") In fact, Gov. Claiborne did commute two death sentences, those of Henry,[27] and of Theodore,[28] each referred by the Orleans Parish court.[29] No record has been found of any referral from the court in St. Charles Parish, or of any refusal by the Governor of any application for clemency.\n\nOutcome [ edit ]\n\nMilitias killed about 95 slaves between the battle, subsequent summary apprehensions and executions, as well as by execution after trials.[18] From the trial records, most of the leaders appeared to have been mixed-race Creoles or mulattoes, although numerous slaves were native-born Africans. Fifty-six of the slaves captured on the 10th and involved in the revolt were returned to their masters, who may have punished them but wanted their valuable laborers back to work. Thirty more slaves were captured, but returned to their masters after planters determined they had been forced to join the revolt by Charles Deslondes and his men.[18]\n\nThe heirs of Meuillon petitioned the legislature for permission to free the mulatto slave Bazile, who had worked to preserve his master's plantation. Not all the slaves supported insurrection, knowing the trouble it could bring and not wanting to see their homes and communities destroyed. As was typical of American slave insurrections, the uprising was short-lived and quickly crushed by local authorities.[19] Showing planter influence, the legislature of the Territory of Orleans approved compensation of $300 to planters for each slave killed or executed. The Territory accepted the presence of U.S. troops after the revolt, as they were grateful for their presence. The national press covered the insurrection, with some Northerners seeing it arising out of the wrongs suffered under slavery.\n\nLegacy [ edit ]\n\nMuch of what had once been the Kenner and Henderson Plantation is now Louis Armstrong International Airport, the New Orleans airport, ironically named after prominent African American Louis Armstrong. Destrehan is now a small, primarily black town on the old River Road shortly before Kenner, now the largest city in Jefferson Parish. While the Destrehan Plantation tour concentrates on architecture and white lifestyle and family histories, a small museum in a converted slave cabin (not on the standard tour) features folk paintings of the 1811 uprising.[32] Louisiana's historical marker for the former Andry plantation mentions \"Major 1811 slave uprising organized here.\"[33] Despite its size and connection to the French and Haitian revolutions, the rebellion is not thoroughly covered in history books. As late as 1923, however, older black men \"still relate[d] the story of the slave insurrection of 1811 as they heard it from their grandfathers.\"[34]\n\nSince 1995, the African American History Alliance of Louisiana has led an annual commemoration at Norco in January, where they have been joined by some descendants of members of the revolt.[5] The Whitney Plantation, in St. John the Baptist Parish, opened in 2014 and is the first plantation museum in the country dedicated to the slave experience. The Whitney Plantation includes a memorial and information to commemorate the 1811 Slave Uprising of the German Coast.\n\nArtist Dread Scott has planned a massive re-enactment of the uprising.[35]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nCitations [ edit ]\n\nSources [ edit ]\n\nLetters\n\n\"John Shaw to Paul Hamilton\", New Orleans, January 18, 1811, National Archives.\n\n\"Samuel Hambleton to David Porter\", January 15, 1811, Papers of David Porter, Library of Congress, in Slavery, Stanley Engerman, Seymour Drescher, and Robert Paquette, eds.

  "latent_13826": "I've spent most of the day traveling, and have had a bit of time to think, and one of the things I started pondering was how no one has bothered to ask about the propriety of Warren Buffett's role in this $700 billion orgy of disaster capitalism. Consider these facts:\n\n- Buffett is one of the top economic advisers to Barack Obama, a senator whose influence over whether this bailout passes is, ahem, not small.\n\n- Buffett took a sizable stake in Goldman Sachs today, investing $5 billion in the company. This came after Goldman reorganized itself in a way that will make it better able to capitalize on the bailout windfall.\n\n- Sure enough, Bloomberg News reports that if this bailout passes, it will mean a potentially huge windfall for Goldman Sachs - ie. now for Buffett. Additionally, Obama has now said he doesn't want the bailout measure to include any bankruptcy reform measures that would end up forcing bailout recipients like Goldman Sachs to take on more losses.\n\nKnowing all of these irrefutable facts, am I out of line to think Buffett's role -- and the Obama people allowing him to play this role -- could be perceived as a wee bit shady?\n\nHe's heavily investing in a company that stands to make a huge windfall if the bailout passes, and he's simultaneously advising the guy whose support is critical for passing the windfall. I'm not in any way saying Buffett already has insider information that Obama is going to support the bailout -- that seems like the insider trading-ish behavior Democrats say they want to stop.\n\nBut I am wondering why no one has even bothered to ask whether Buffett's dual role in all this is appropriate? Look, I'm sure Buffett is a great guy, and its terrific he's planning to donate a lot of his money to charity. But appearance-wise, this doesn't look good -- it seems, in fact, to reinforce the whole disaster capitalism image of this bailout. While there may be no overt improprieties here, while Buffett certainly may just be independently investing and then independently advising Obama, and while I know we are never ever supposed to question the awesomely unquestionable awesome Warren Buffett, the image that his dual role projects is not one that should inspire any confidence that this bailout is in the public's interest. I don't think I'm being a conspiracy theorist when I ask whether we should at least be asking about this (after all, something can't be a conspiracy if the facts are right out in the open).\n\nHow is it that no major journalist or news organization has asked simple questions about Buffett's role? And how is it that Obama's people aren't worried that McCain -- the quintessential opportunist -- is going to roll out the questions on their own, in the form of an attack ad? And how come progressives aren't asking those questions? Think of it this way -- if this was a McCain adviser doing the same thing, would we not question it?",

He briefly alluded to those articles, stemming from a profile in New York Times Magazine, but also offered his analysis on the impact the nuclear deal will have on broader relations with Iran.\"Many other aspects of Iranian behavior– and US-Iran relations– remain unchanged,\" Rhodes said. \"Iran has not ceased its support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah or its threats toward Israel. Iran has continued to test ballistic missiles. From Iraq to Yemen, Iran has continued to engage in destabilizing support for proxy organizations.\"Despite the diplomacy that has brought Iran into discussions about resolving the Syrian civil war, Iran continues to be one of the chief sponsors of an Assad regime that brutally murders the Syrian people,\" he continued. \"In short, Iran’s approach to its nuclear program has changed, but thus far, its broader foreign policy– and the nature of its regime– has not.\"But Rhodes reiterated a longstanding line from the White House: That the nuclear deal was never about changing Iran's system of government, about its broader foreign policy, or about rapprochement.\"Some argue that means the deal wasn’t worth it. We would argue the exact opposite,\" he said. \"Isn’t it better when a government with a ballistic missile program that supports terrorism doesn’t have a nuclear weapon? The Iran Deal stopped the spread of nuclear weapons to the world’s most volatile region, and prevented a possible war.Rhodes addressed the comparisons between the president's efforts to \"open\" relations with Cuba and Myanmar and his efforts with Iran, noting some suitable parallels but overall concluding that the policies are not analogous.\"Myanmar decided to change the nature of its own government. Cuba decided to change the nature of its relationship with the United States. Iran decided to change the nature of its nuclear program,\" he said. \"In that regard, while the nuclear deal is enormously consequential, the broader progress with Iran is the most limited.\"The greatest test of whether Iran is willing to shift its foreign policy lies in Syria, where constructive engagement to resolve the conflict \"has not been forthcoming,\" Rhodes said. But relations between the two foreign ministries make constructive engagement possible, he added, where it would not have been before Obama took office.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_14008": "The city on Wednesday filed a motion to dismiss a federal lawsuit over the right of women to go topless in Chicago, arguing that nudity is not protected expression under the Constitution and that “female breasts are considered erogenous in a way that male breasts are not.”\n\n“The (Indecent Exposure or Dress) Ordinance is substantially related to the City’s important objectives in ensuring public safety and protecting unwilling audiences from exposure to nudity, which, consistent with current community standards, includes the exposure of female breasts,” city lawyers wrote in their response.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in November on behalf of Sonoko Tagami, then 41, who was described as an ardent supporter of GoTopless, a nonprofit that “advocates for the right of women to appear bare-chested in public.“\n\nChicago police ticketed Tagami for indecent exposure last August during an event at Chicago's lakefront to promote the right of women to bare their breasts in public. An administrative law judge found her liable and ordered her to pay a $100 fine plus additional costs.\n\nFor several years, Tagami participated in GoTopless Day in Chicago, appearing in public with “opaque body paint” covering just enough of her breasts to comply with the city's decency law, her lawsuit stated.\n\nA YouTube video of the August incident showed Tagami wearing a purple dress with the top pulled down and her breasts painted a pale white. A female Chicago police officer told Tagami in the video that she needed to pull up her dress or risk arrest. She eventually complied but was ticketed.\n\nTagami's suit claims the city's ordinance barring women from exposing “any portion of the breast at or below the upper edge of the areola” is unconstitutionally vague and a violation of free speech. The suit also alleges that because men are excluded from that portion of the ordinance, it violates rights to equal protection under the law.\n\nHer lawyer, Kenneth Flaxman, said that Tagami thought she was complying with the ordinance by painting her chest because she had not been ticketed in previous years and that she was clearly participating in a protest at the time. He called the city’s stance “puritanical” and noted that women are allowed to breast-feed in public.\n\n“She was making a statement that the ordinance should be repealed, that it is unfair to women and that women’s breasts are not dirty and shouldn’t have to be covered in public,” Flaxman said. “That if women want to be top-free, they should be allowed to be top-free.”\n\nFlaxman said the city's ordinance is unclear and needs to be rewritten. As he reads it, he said it effectively bans clothing that many women wear every day, from low-cut dresses to tops exposing the sides of their breasts.\n\nCity lawyers, however, have argued that the ordinance is straightforward and that courts have repeatedly found that there is no First Amendment right to appear nude in public.\n\n“Passersby would have no way of knowing whether she intended to make a political statement or merely to sunbathe,” according to the city’s filing, which further noted that courts have held that local governments “have the power to enact public indecency statutes, as regulations directed at public health, safety, and morality lie at the heart of traditional police powers.”\n\nThe city also moved to dismiss Tagami’s allegation that the ordinance unjustly targets women, arguing that it “realistically reflects the fact that the sexes are not similarly situated in certain circumstances.”\n\ncdizikes@tribpub.com",

  "latent_14110": "1 Errata\n\n2017-10-07: IMap is not the only datatype supporting merge: ICache is mergable as well.\n\n2017-10-17: Java’s AtomicReferences may only be sequential (and linearizable in certain cases, like CaS updates), rather than linearizable. The literature is somewhat unclear on this point.\n\n2 Background\n\nHazelcast provides easy-to-use distributed data structures with rich, intuitive APIs and optional persistence. It is often deployed as a synchronization service for databases, caches, session stores, messaging buses, or for service discovery. Users may embed a full Hazelcast node directly into their JVM application, or use a lightweight network client (available in many languages) to talk to a dedicated Hazelcast cluster. Either way, Hazelcast offers transparent distribution for rich datatypes, with familiar Java APIs for sets, lists, maps, locks, semaphores, queues, atomic objects, id generators, and more.\n\nHazelcast’s high-level documentation, and the names of these objects themselves, imply that operations on these objects provide certain safety guarantees. For instance, the features page claims that Hazelcast’s AtomicReferences offers guaranteed atomic compare-and-set across a cluster, and the AtomicReference documentation confirms this claim. What the documentation for this datatype does not mention is that compare-and-set on AtomicReferences is not, in point of fact, atomic.\n\nIn section 26 of the manual, Network Partitioning - Split-Brain Syndrome, Hazelcast explains that in the event of a network partition, each component of the network continues to run independently. They go on to discuss a lost-update scenario when the MapStore persistence layer is enabled for Maps: both clusters could write conflicting entries to their backing database. The documentation does not mention that this problem also arises without a backing database—users could be forgiven for assuming that they won’t experience lost updates if they use Hazelcast as a purely in-memory store.\n\nThe documentation goes on to discuss split-brain merging: for Maps (and only Maps; a footnote explains that other datatypes are not merged), conflicting values for the same key are merged using a configurable merge policy. The built-in policies are a pair of non-commutative heuristics (larger or smaller cluster wins), last-write-wins, or higher-hits-wins. As we have seen in prior Jepsen analyses, all of these techniques can result in the loss of committed updates. For all datatypes other than Maps, updates to the smaller cluster (or an arbitrary cluster if the split is even) are thrown away.\n\nHazelcast goes on to explain:\n\nHazelcast’s Split-Brain Protection enables you to specify the minimum cluster size required for operations to occur. This is achieved by defining and configuring a split-brain protection cluster quorum. If the cluster size is below the defined quorum, the operations are rejected and the rejected operations return a QuorumException to their callers.\n\nYour application continues its operations on the remaining operating cluster. Any application instances connected to the cluster with sizes below the defined quorum will be receiving exceptions which, depending on the programming and monitoring setup, should generate alerts. The key point is that rather than applications continuing in error with stale data, they are prevented from doing so.\n\nThis implies that we should be able to update Maps, Transactional Maps, Caches, Locks, and Queues safely, so long as we choose a majority quorum policy for those data structures. This is, unfortunately, not the case:\n\nIt is normally seconds or tens of seconds before the cluster is adjusted to exclude unreachable members…. For this reason, there will be a time window between the network partitioning and the application of Split-Brain Protection.\n\nThat implies that operations on most Hazelcast datatype may be lost when the network is unreliable. In this analysis, we experimentally confirm this hypothesis, by testing the behavior of several Hazelcast datatypes when the network is allowed to fail.\n\n3 Test Design\n\nWe use the Jepsen distributed systems testing library to evaluate Hazelcast’s safety. We write a trivial server application which starts a Hazelcast instance on each of five nodes. We tune the Hazelcast configuration to speed up test times, making heartbeats more frequent and timeouts shorter. Cluster membership is fixed at startup, and all nodes are connected via direct TCP connections to every other node. We apply majority quorum constraints to every datatype that supports them.\n\nJepsen then uses the Hazelcast client library to connect to various nodes, and perform operations against Hazelcast datatypes. During these operations, we introduce network partitions lasting 15 seconds, followed by 30 seconds of full connectivity to allow the cluster to recover. Before performing any final reads to confirm safety, we allow Hazelcast 500 seconds of total network connectivity to fully heal , and merge any unmerged records. Once the test is complete, we analyze the history of operations to identify whether common-sense invariants on that datatype were preserved.\n\nThe operations we perform, and how we check for correctness, depend on the particular datatype being tested.\n\n3.1 Locks\n\nHazelcast’s feature list claims that locks provide guaranteed mutual exclusion across a cluster.\n\nIf you lock using an ILock, the critical section that it guards is guaranteed to be executed by only one thread in the entire cluster. Even though locks are great for synchronization, they can lead to problems if not used properly.\n\nSpecifically, those problems include:\n\nIn the split-brain scenario, the cluster behaves as if it were two different clusters. Since two separate clusters are not aware of each other, two members from different clusters can acquire the same lock.\n\nSo locks don’t guarantee mutual exclusion—but the docs go on to point to split-brain protection, so perhaps there’s a chance of safety. We’ll set the lock to use majority quorums, so only a cluster with more than 1/2 of the nodes can acquire a lock safely. In addition, we prevent Hazelcast from releasing a lock before another client explicitly unlocks it by omitting the leaseTime arguments to tryLock .\n\nOur clients perform a sequence of alternating acquire and release operations, and verify that the resulting history is linearizable; e.g. no two processes can hold the same lock at the same time. This test fails reliably as soon as a partition occurs, as this example shows.\n\nJust after the start of a partition, several clients succeeded in acquiring a lock which was already held. This diagram shows the concurrent structure of lock operations. Time flows left to right, and each concurrent process is shown as a row. Blue bars show successful operations, and pink traces show illegal transitions between operations. Here, process 0 had acquired the lock, and processes 2, 3, and 4 went on to successfully acquire the lock before process 0 had released it. This is the opposite of what a lock is supposed to do.\n\nLocks in Hazelcast are not really locks. They may provide mutual exclusion most of the time, but when a network failure occurs, multiple clients may hold the same lock concurrently. This occurs even in the absence of process crashes, without lock timeouts allowing Hazelcast to reclaim stale locks, and with majority quorum protection enabled.\n\n3.2 Queues\n\nHazelcast queues provide a distributed equivalent to Java’s BlockingQueue. The docs claim: “Using Hazelcast distributed queue, you can add an item in one machine and remove it from another one.” The manual goes on to note that Queues support split-brain protection. What they fail to mention is that this is not a guarantee of correctness: you can put an item into a queue on one machine, Hazelcast will dutifully acknowledge that item, and then consign it to the silent void of /dev/null .\n\nTo test this, we perform a mixture of enqueues and dequeues on a single queue. All enqueues are unique integers, so we can map enqueues to dequeues. At the end of the test, we heal all network partitions, wait 500 seconds to allow the cluster time to recover, and have every client drain all remaining elements from the queue—which should ensure that every added element has been dequeued at least once. We then examine the history to see whether this is the case.\n\nIn this 20 minute long run, roughly 1/4 of attempted enqueues appeared to succeed, and of those successfully enqueued messages, 2% were, in fact, silently discarded. The window for data loss is relatively small–only a few seconds at the start of each network partition—because we’ve aggressively tuned Hazelcast’s heartbeats to very short intervals. With the default timeouts, quorum protection takes longer to kick in, and the window for message loss is larger.\n\n{:valid? false, :lost #{1903 1952 1946 1948 1922 1930 1929 1895 1905 1052 1937 1966 1921 ... 1915 1935 1959 1974 1914 1951 1960 1967 212}, :recovered #{1853}, :recovered-frac 1/2665, :unexpected-frac 0, :unexpected #{}, :lost-frac 62/2665, :duplicated-frac 42/2665, :ok-frac 145/533, :duplicated #{186 188 210 ... 1843 199 183}}\n\n3.3 Atomic Longs\n\nAtomicLongs (and their cousins, AtomicReferences) provide a number (or arbitrary object) which can be read, written, and updated via atomic get-and-set & compare-and-set operations. Hazelcast’s feature list claims these operations are “guaranted atomic across … a cluster.” The documentation for IAtomicLong and IAtomicReference fails to mention that these operations are not in fact atomic: operations can be lost or improperly interleaved.\n\nWe could check that AtomicReference is linearizable. It’s not clear that Hazelcast intends for AtomicReferences to actually be linearizable, but the documentation might imply it. However, in this case it is more interesting to measure a weaker property: whether AtomicReferences allow for non-atomic or lost updates.\n\nWe begin with an AtomicLong (or an AtomicReference) initialized to 0 (null), and perform a sequence of atomic increment-and-get (get + compare-and-set) operations against it, across many nodes. If these operations are atomic, successful increment-and-get operations should record a sequence of unique integers, e.g. without duplicates.\n\nIn this 30-second test of an AtomicReference, with a single network partition, a little over 10% of all generated numbers were duplicated.\n\n{:valid? false, :attempted-count 239, :acknowledged-count 235, :duplicated-count 27, :duplicated {171 2, 172 2, 173 2, 175 2, ... 195 2, 196 2, 197 2, 198 2}, :range [1 208]},\n\nDuring a partition, AtomicLongs and AtomicReferences diverge, allowing different nodes to see and mutate different copies of the same “atomic” value. When the partition resolves, all but one of these divergent copies is discarded. Not only do AtomicLongs and AtomicReferences allow stale reads, but they also allow for lost updates and dirty reads. A strictly increment-only counter could go backwards on a single node, if a smaller value from another node were to overwrite it.\n\nNote that AtomicReference and AtomicLong do not support quorum protection; unlike locks and queues, they will diverge as long as the partition persists, instead of diverging for only a few seconds at the start of a partition. In this plot from a different run with a longer partition, the grey region indicates the duration of a network partition. Note that while one node refuses updates, the other nodes are more than happy to run independent copies of the AtomicReference for the full duration of the partition. In this case, almost half (312 of 824) of generated numbers were duplicates.\n\n3.4 ID Generators\n\nIf AtomicLong cannot provide safe atomic updates, a specialized datatype (like a flake ID) might be able to provide unique IDs without the need for AtomicLong’s coordination properties. Hazelcast provides an IdGenerator type for generating “cluster-wide unique identifiers.” What the documentation for IdGenerator does not mention is that IDs may not be unique in the event of a network partition. Indeed, IdGenerator is backed by an IAtomicLong internally, so it is subject to the exact same problems we saw in that type.\n\nWe perform the same uniqueness test as for AtomicLongs, but this time using an IdGenerator to generate unique numbers. IdGenerators, too, fail to provide uniqueness. If a pair of IdGenerators request a new block of numbers from their underlying AtomicLong during a partition, they will likely double-allocate that entire block of IDs.\n\nIn this 30-second test, Hazelcast allocated ~91,000 duplicated IDs out of ~834,000; a little over 10%. Like AtomicReferences, the fraction of duplicated IDs increases the longer a partition lasts; quorum protection does not limit the window for safety violations.\n\n{:valid? false, :attempted-count 834013, :acknowledged-count 834013, :duplicated-count 91179, :duplicated {705516 2, 705517 2, 705518 2, ... 705561 2, 705562 2, 705563 2}, :range [0 747591]}\n\n3.5 Maps\n\nHazelcast offers a Map, which is a distributed, sharded implementation of java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap. The documentation claims that Maps are “thread-safe to meet your thread safety requirements,” implying that operations on maps are safe in the presence of concurrent updates. For optimistic concurrency control, Hazelcast maps offer operations like putIfAbsent and replace (essentially, compare-and-set), which replace missing or given values for a particular key with some new value, unless the current value in the map differs.\n\nThese functions only make sense if operations have some total order, but as we discussed earlier, during partitions, there is no single value, or total order, of operations. What does it mean to replace A with B , when the current values are both A and C ? As we shall see, there is a good reason for Hazelcast to provide these operations, even when they may be, in general, unsafe.\n\nFirst things first: let us check whether replace actually works. We take a map containing a single key, and store in that key an array of longs, representing a set of numbers. We attempt to add elements to that set by reading the current value, then using replace (or putIfAbsent ) to replace the set we read with a new set now containing the added element. If replace obeys the contract of a ConcurrentMap, it should perform an atomic compare-and-set. Every successful replace should result in that particular element being present in all subsequent versions of the set.\n\nAfter performing our series of replace operations, we heal all network partitions, allow the cluster 500 seconds to recover, and perform a final read to identify which elements survived.\n\nUnfortunately, not all elements do. Quorum protection is insufficient to prevent the loss of acknowledged updates. In this test, Hazelcast lost four modifications to a single key, all clustered around the start of a network partition.\n\n{:valid? false, :lost \"#{1703..1704 1706..1707}\", :recovered \"#{}\", :ok \"#{1..2 4..36 ... 3724 3727..3728}\", :recovered-frac 0, :unexpected-frac 0, :unexpected \"#{}\", :lost-frac 2/1865, :ok-frac 1221/1865},\n\n3.6 Maps with CRDTs\n\nClearly, Maps are unsafe in the presence of network faults, even if majority quorums are used to prevent concurrent modification in independent clusters. However, Maps offer a feature no other Hazelcast datatype has: they can merge conflicting modifications after split-brain recovery. The default merge policy picks one of the disparate versions and discards the other, losing updates, but we could write a CRDT merge function instead, allowing us to preserve concurrent updates from isolated components of the cluster.\n\nIn this case, our data type is a grow-only set (a G-set), and our merge function is set union. We write a merge policy—a Java class—to merge two sets, and instruct the set to use that merge policy.\n\nIn this 300-second test, out of 1315 attempts, 1298 elements were successfully added to the set, and every one of those acknowledged elements was present in the final reads. These results are typical of CRDT map tests; they appear, at least in these particular circumstances, to safely preserve all operations.\n\n{:valid? true, :lost \"#{}\", :recovered \"#{}\", :ok \"#{0..11 13..83 ... 1286..1306 1311..1314}\", :recovered-frac 0, :unexpected-frac 0, :unexpected \"#{}\", :lost-frac 0, :ok-frac 1298/1315}, :valid? true}\n\nNote that the merge function is only called during split-brain recovery, which means that we must continue to use our composite read+replace strategy. It may help to understand a Hazelcast cluster as a cluster of components, where each component is updated using a sequential compare-and-set, and updates to disparate components are merged with our commutative, associative, and idempotent merge function.\n\nThis approach is not limited to G-sets. We can implement any CRDT we like, including observed-removed sets, booleans with or/and, integers with min/max, counters, composite types like maps, and so on. In addition, we can relax the quorum constraint on CRDT maps, allowing updates to proceed safely on all nodes in the cluster, instead of only on a majority component.\n\n4 Discussion\n\nAlthough Hazelcast’s partition-tolerance documentation hints that data loss might be an issue, it fails to make these properties explicit, and many datatypes claim to provide safety properties far stronger than what they actually guarantee.\n\nIn addition, the names of Hazelcast’s datatypes, and the functions provided on those types, imply a certain fitness-for-purpose, e.g. that users can use these types and functions in a meaningful way. What is the point of an ID Generator which emits duplicate IDs? A lock that doesn’t lock? Who wants an AtomicReference which is not atomic? Of what possible use is a queue which doesn’t, well, queue?\n\nBy providing familiar interfaces to Java programmers, and explicitly describing Hazelcast types as the analogue of well-known types like AtomicLong or ConcurrentMap, users are encouraged to treat Hazelcast types as if they offered the same concurrency safety properties of their Java counterparts. This would be a wonderful idea if Hazelcast maps did offer atomic replace , queues which didn’t lose inserted elements, and so on.\n\nThis is particularly vexing because there are existing systems and algorithms which do provide these safety properties over similar datatypes. Consensus systems like Zookeeper and etcd, for instance, provide linearizable updates and reads on registers, which is what Hazelcast claims to offer with its AtomicReferences. ID generators can be implemented with only a single round of consensus to initialize node IDs, either as local counters modulo node-count , or using flake IDs. Likewise: when cluster membership is fixed (e.g. by a round of consensus), counters can be made totally available with extremely low latency by using PN-Counters. Distributed queues cannot guarantee the ordering or exactly-once-delivery of their single-node counterparts, which means they are loosely equivalent to Observed-Removed Sets plus a loose temporal order, which could be, again, provided by flake IDs.\n\nThis is not to say that there are no safe uses of Hazelcast. Immutable records are obviously fine, provided users generate their own unique IDs for inserted records instead of relying on, say, IdGenerator, and so long as read-after-insert consistency is not expected. Engineers typically expect a distributed cache to lose updates and expose stale data, so using a Hazelcast Map as a cache is, in general, okay. So too, for applications where the consequences of data loss are relatively minor (e.g. metrics, service health, sensor data) and outages are infrequent. Pubsub messaging through topics, similarly, is often assumed to be best-effort, and occasional message loss is fine. Hazelcast could be well-suited for service discovery, since we want maximal availability, and incorrect or out-of-date information about what nodes run which services should only introduce liveness or performance, not safety problems.\n\nIndeed, most users featured on the Hazelcast web site seem more oriented towards caching and discovery instead of using Hazelcast to ensure data safety. However, there are some systems which do appear to rely on Hazelcast’s atomic primitives.\n\nConsider, for example, BagriDB, a recently featured partner on the Hazelcast Blog. BagriDB uses Hazelcast to implement its an MVCC transaction manager on top of Hazelcast. While BagriDB claims to provide ACID transactions up to Repeatable Read, the transaction IDs in BagriDB are generated by a Hazelcast AtomicLong, with a small wrapper, incremented at the start of each transaction. This means that BagriDB could pick the same transaction ID for multiple concurrent transactions, which might result in the violation of transactional guarantees. BagriDB explained:\n\nYes, the transaction IDs will be duplicated, but they will live in two different clusters after network partitioning and will be committed independently and successfully in most cases.\n\nWhen asked whether they were aware of AtomicLong’s non-atomicity, BagriDB responded:\n\nNo, I was not aware of this behavior of IAtomicLong at network partitioning.\n\nLikewise, OrientDB, one of eight partners featured on Hazelcast’s home page, uses Hazelcast Locks to guarantee only a single node at a time can initialize registered nodes and to elect new lock managers. Hazelcast maps are also used to exchange leader and membership information; stale or lost updates to these maps might result in unexpected behavior.\n\nWe asked OrientDB about this, and OrientDB’s engineers confirmed that they originally made extensive use of Hazelcast Locks for transactions. However, split-brain issues with Lock safety forced them to write their own distributed lock manager, and Hazelcast is now only used to reach consensus on cluster metadata on node startup. OrientDB plans to remove Hazelcast entirely in an upcoming release. They go on to note that they felt the documentation did not describe the potential for inconsistency:\n\nDocumentation doesn’t say anything about all of this. If you follow the documentation [it] looks like everything works as it’s supposed to do.\n\nRespondents on StackOverflow also indicate production use of Hazelcast for locking and atomic map updates. For instance:\n\nWe use extensive use of distributed locking to make sure SKU Items of inventory are modified in atomic way because there are hundred of nodes in our web application cluster that operates concurrently on these items.\n\nand\n\nWe are using Hazelcast from last 3 years in our e-commerce application to make sure availability (supply & demand) is consistent, atomic, available & scalable. We are using IMap (distributed map) to cache the data and Entry Processor for read & write operations to do fast in-memory operations on IMap without you having to worry about locks.\n\nWe recommend that Hazelcast users carefully review their use of Hazelcast primitives. In particular, we encourage you to ask:\n\nFor Locks, would the system be safe if the lock were omitted?\n\nFor IdGenerators, what would be the impact of giving multiple requestors the same IDs?\n\nFor Queues, what would happen if some enqueued messages were lost?\n\nAre there any uses of AtomicLongs or AtomicReferences in your code? Why?\n\nFor Maps, would the system be safe if any put were lost? What about a double-applied putIfAbsent ? Be especially wary of calls to replace .\n\nwere lost? What about a double-applied ? Be especially wary of calls to . Are your Map values structured as a CRDT with an appropriate merge function, or is order of operations important?\n\nAnd in general, ask:\n\nWould it be safe to read some prior state of Hazelcast, instead of the current state?\n\nDoes the system use Hazelcast as “fuzzy” state—e.g. as a cache, a discovery mechanism, or lossy store?\n\nAs for the Hazelcast team: we suggest that Hazelcast add appropriate warnings to the documentation for each datatype. Explicitly tell users that AtomicReferences are not atomic, that Locks are not exclusive, that Queues can lose messages, and so on. While the existing documentation on split-brain hints at these behaviors, more prominent warnings might prevent users from, say, building transaction management systems on top of non-unique ID generators.\n\nWe believe that Hazelcast’s primitives are useful, but objects like AtomicReferences and Maps with replace imply consensus, and therefore deserve a real consensus system. Hazelcast should adopt or implement a proven consensus algorithm, like ZAB or Raft, and use it to back these datatypes.\n\nHaving a consensus system also enables atomic management of cluster membership and shard allocation, which unlocks efficient, eventually consistent implementations of counters, ID generators, queues, and generalized CRDTs. We recommend that Hazelcast adopt coordination-free algorithms (e.g. PN-Counters, flake IDs, etc) for these data structures to simplify their implementation, improve performance, and prevent lost updates.\n\nFinally, almost all uses of lock services for safety in distributed systems are fundamentally flawed: users continue to interpret distributed locks as if they were equivalent to single-node mutexes. Lock services cannot guarantee exclusion in asynchronous networks, because there is no way to distinguish between a crashed node and a slow one: releasing any stale lock runs the risk of handing it to two processes concurrently. Even if we could provide a true distributed mutex, there is nothing which guarantees the network messages emitted by lock holders only take effect while the lock is held. This is why mature “lock services” like Chubby use a sequence number, which lock holders must use in their operations and downstream services must respect, to enforce exclusive and sequential execution of lockholder side effects. Hazelcast should remove or rename Locks to avoid this problem, or couple them to a sequentially consistent sequence number.\n\nThese problems are not bugs; they are fundamental design decisions. Hazelcast has placed sequential or linearizable datatypes atop an eventually-consistent replication system which makes unjustifiably optimistic assumptions about node and network reliability. Jepsen has not filed specific bug reports for these issues with Hazelcast; instead, we feel that a comprehensive re-evaluation of Hazelcast’s documentation, datatypes, and replication algorithms is in order.\n\nWe wish to thank Jordan Halterman for his discussion of Hazelcast use cases. Luigi Dell’Aquila & Luca Garulli from OrientDB, and Denis Sukhoroslov from BagriDB, were instrumental in understanding those systems’ use of Hazelcast. Thanks also to Julia Evans, Sarah Huffman, Camille Fournier, Moishe Lettvin, Tim Kordas, André Arko, Allison Kaptur, Coda Hale, and Peter Alvaro for reading and offering comments on initial drafts.

  "latent_14267": "Schimel (Photo: AP)\n\nEAGLE RIVER - The state Department of Justice is trying to unconstitutionally silence two Northwoods brothers accused of financial crimes and the journalists who are covering their case, according to legal documents filed this week by a coalition of news organizations including USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin.\n\nThe media coalition seeks to intervene in the prosecution of Brian and David Eliason of Vilas County to challenge the state's attempt to limit the defendants and their lawyers from speaking with reporters.\n\nThe proposed gag order would illegally restrict the \"constitutionally guaranteed right to gather news regarding the case,\" wrote Steven Mandell, a Chicago lawyer representing the press groups.\n\nState lawyers on Thursday defended the gag request, arguing that they were seeking to strike a balance \"between the important constitutional rights of a fair trial and free speech.\"\n\nThe brothers were each charged in late February with 10 felony counts of securities fraud. They live and work in Vilas County but have done business throughout the state and country, including in Wausau and Appleton.\n\nDepartment of Justice lawyers serving as special prosecutors claim the Eliasons misled investors by failing to disclose that their firm, Eliason Inc., was hemorrhaging millions of dollars and that auditors had questioned its ability to remain in business during last decade's economic recession. The company lost more than $8 million in 2006, $18 million in 2007 and nearly $28 million in 2008, when it was $63 million in debt, according to court records.\n\nThe financial condition of the firm mattered, prosecutors allege, because the brothers promised investors in 2009 that they were guaranteeing mortgages used to buy rental properties and had promised monthly payments backed by reserves. In fact, the company was insolvent, and in March 2009, one of the brothers told a bank that the company would not be able to cover operating expenses without an injection of between $3 million and $4 million, court records show.\n\nAt least 31 people had invested millions of dollars in a fund that was intended to generate revenue by renting out commercial and residential properties, according to court records. That fund filed for bankruptcy in 2011.\n\nBrian Eliason (Photo: Courtesy of The Lakeland Times)\n\nDOJ lawyers charged the brothers on Feb. 26 in Vilas County Circuit Court.\n\nDays after the charges were filed, the Eliasons' lawyer, Milwaukee defense attorney Stephen Kravit, issued a four-page press release blasting the decision to prosecute. Kravit acknowledged that Eliason Inc. had financial challenges, but he asserted that the charges were “wrongly and unjustly brought.\" Kravit claimed the Eliasons had made requisite disclosures to investors about the company's money troubles, and that they had done so after consulting a lawyer.\n\n“The criminal charge says the poor financial condition of Eliason Inc. wasn’t disclosed,” the press release reads. “That is not true.\"\n\nIt continues: \"We encourage all observers to watch this case closely, as it is an example of abuse of discretion in the use of criminal prosecution. This case is an object lesson of government overreaching and misjudgment.\"\n\nKravit also is preparing to challenge the constitutionality of the state law that prosecutors have accused the Eliasons of violating, saying that enforcement of it has been \"arbitrary and discriminatory,\" according to court records.\n\nLocal and state news outlets subsequently reported on the case, and on March 4, the state filed a request that a judge issue a gag order. The request initially sought to broadly prohibit the Eliasons and their attorneys from talking with the press and public about the court proceedings. Later in the request, the Justice Department asked to prohibit statements that would \"have the likelihood of materially prejudicing\" the proceedings, including tainting the jury pool in Vilas County, which has a population of about 21,000 people.\n\n“There is a legitimate concern that, without an order limiting statements made to the public, publicity in this case could have a substantial effect on the ability to empanel a fair and impartial jury from the citizens of Vilas County,” state attorneys wrote in the request for the gag order.\n\nThe media coalition is opposing the proposed gag order because it would violate the First Amendment and hamper the flow of information about the case, according to Mandell, the coalition's lawyer.\n\n“In making a clumsy attempt to muzzle its opponents, the state would impinge the rights of the parties, the press and the public,” Mandell wrote in court documents filed Monday.\n\nDavid Eliason (Photo: Courtesy of The Lakeland Times)\n\nAside from USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin, the media coalition includes publishers of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; Wisconsin State Journal and The Capital Times in Madison; The Lakeland Times in Minocqua; television stations in Wausau and Rhinelander; and the Wisconsin Newspaper Association and Wisconsin Broadcasters Association.\n\nThe coalition argues that the Justice Department has proposed “only the most extreme measure” to preserve juror integrity, and has failed to consider existing rules that govern lawyers' conduct. Those rules already prohibit lawyers from making statements that \"have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing\" proceedings. The rules also allow lawyers to speak publicly about legal claims and defenses, information that is public record and the status of cases.\n\nThe Eliason brothers also oppose the gag request.\n\nDepartment of Justice lawyers responded to that opposition on Thursday. In a new court filing, the state clarified that it was not seeking a total ban on statements to the press, but rather a \"narrowly tailored\" gag order that would not let the Eliasons and their attorneys:\n\nIdentify witnesses and any testimony they might give\n\nSecond-guess the department's decision to prosecute\n\nDiscuss claims of innocence\n\nPut forward legal arguments\n\nSuch an order has solid legal footing and would be less burdensome than moving a possible trial outside of Vilas County or calling in jurors from elsewhere, the state said. It also would help keep a lid on information that might not be admissible in court.\n\nSince the charges were filed, Brian Eliason has retained a separate defense attorney, which is common in criminal proceedings involving multiple defendants. His new attorney is Dean Strang, who represented Steven Avery and gained fame this winter after the release of the Netflix series “Making a Murderer.”\n\nThe brothers each face up to 95 years in prison and fines in the six figures if convicted.\n\nEven though the Department of Justice sought the gag order, Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel commented on the case to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in March. The proposed gag order, he said, is to prevent the case from being tried in the media.\n\nA Department of Justice spokesman declined comment for this story.\n\nA court hearing is scheduled for next week.\n\nJonathan Anderson: 715-898-7010 or jonathan.anderson@gannettwisconsin.com; on Twitter @jonathanderson.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1RZTeEZ",

Stein points to a lack of media coverage.\n\n“I've had essentially zip. So I consider it, actually, remarkable that we are polling as well as we are without the media having done its due diligence here. Americans have not only a right to vote but also a right to know who we can vote for,” she said.\n\nEven so, she does think she can win.\n\nStein’s platform centers around a “Green New Deal” which she says would stimulate the economy through the creation of “20 million jobs as part of an emergency plan to address climate change.” She’s calling for a 100 percent transition to clean, renewable energy by 2030, which would mean the elimination of fracking across the country.\n\n“Well it’s also going to take years for us to phase out the energy that we have. So what we call for is an immediate ban on new fossil fuel infrastructure but we continue what we’ve got while we build the renewables, the solar plants,” she said when asked about the thousands of jobs created by fracking in Colorado.\n\nSign up for the 9NEWSLETTER Thank You Something went wrong.

A proponent of free higher education, Stein wants the Federal Reserve to essentially buy $1.3 trillion in student loan debt.\n\n“Knowing that there are 43 million young people, that is a winning plurality of the vote. So just by mobilizing the vote to cancel student debt, we could actually win this election and completely change the political landscape,” she said. “Many economists argue the only way out of debt is through investments.”\n\nIn an attempt to pick up Bernie Sanders supporters, it seemed natural that Stein would throw her support behind ColoradoCares, an amendment on the November ballot for a single-payer healthcare system that Sanders has endorsed. While Stein commended the efforts of the state she has yet to support the measure saying “There are limits to what a state can do and that’s why my focus in particular is about our responsibility at the national level to make this possible by creating an improved medicare-for-all system at the national level.\n\nWhile she does not currently have high enough poll numbers to enter a presidential debate (15 percent is the threshold) she is making a much bigger mark than in her 2012 run and will likely talke more votes. But she doesn’t care much about the notion of stealing away votes from Clinton.\n\n“While Donald Trump says really outrageous, despicable things, outright racist, xenophobic, hate-mongering, demagoguery. At the same time, Hillary Clinton has an extremely troubling track-record and wants to start an air war over Syria by declaring a no-fly zone,” said Stein. “I won’t sleep well if Donald Trump is elected and I won’t sleep well if Hillary Clinton is elected.”\n\nCopyright 2016 KUSA",
  "latent_14392": "Apophasis (; Greek: ἀπόφασις from ἀπόφημι apophemi,[1] \"to say no\")[2] is a rhetorical device wherein the speaker or writer brings up a subject by either denying it, or denying that it should be brought up.[3] Accordingly, it can be seen as a rhetorical relative of irony.\n\nThe device is also called paralipsis (παράλειψις) – also spelled paraleipsis or paralepsis – or occupatio,[4][5][6][7] and known also as praeteritio, preterition, or parasiopesis (παρασιώπησις).\n\nUsage [ edit ]\n\nAs a rhetorical device, apophasis can serve a number of purposes.\n\nIt can be employed to raise an ad hominem or otherwise controversial attack while disclaiming responsibility for it, as in, \"I refuse to discuss the rumor that my opponent is a drunk.\" This can make it a favored tactic in politics.\n\nApophasis can be used passive-aggressively, as in, \"I forgive you for your jealousy, so I won't even mention what a betrayal it was.\"\n\nIn Cicero's \"Pro Caelio\" speech, he says to a prosecutor, \"Obliviscor iam iniurias tuas, Clodia, depono memoriam doloris mei\" (\"I now forget your wrongs, Clodia, I set aside the memory of my pain [that you caused].\")[8]\n\nApophasis can be used to discuss a taboo subject, as in, \"We are all fully loyal to the emperor, so we wouldn't dare to claim that his new clothes are a transparent hoax.\"\n\nAs a rhetorical device, it can serve various purposes, often dependent on the relationship of the speaker to the addressee and the extent of their shared knowledge. Apophasis is rarely literal; instead, it conveys meaning through implications that may depend on this context. As an example of how meaning shifts, the English phrase \"needless to say\" invokes shared understanding, but its actual meaning depends on whether that understanding was really shared. The speaker is alleging that it is not necessary to say something because the addressee already knows it, but is it so? If it is, it may merely emphasize a pertinent fact. If the knowledge is weighted with history, it may be an indirect way of levying an accusation (\"needless to say, because you are responsible\"). If the addressee does not actually already possess the knowledge, it may be a way to condescend: the speaker suspected as much but wanted to call attention to the addressee's ignorance. Conversely, it could be a sincere and polite way to share necessary information that the addressee may or may not know without implying that the addressee is ignorant.\n\nApophasis can serve to politely avoid suggestion of ignorance on the part of an audience, as found in the narrative style of Adso of Melk in Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, where the character fills in details of early fourteenth-century history for the reader by stating it is unnecessary to speak of them.[9] Conversely, the same introduction can be made sarcastically to condescend to an audience and imply their ignorance.\n\nAnother diplomatic use would be to raise a criticism indirectly, as in, \"It would be out of line for me to say that this action would be unwise and unaffordable, sir, as I only care about your best interests.\"\n\nExamples [ edit ]\n\nWhen apophasis is taken to its extreme, the speaker provides full details, stating or drawing attention to something in the very act of pretending to pass it over: \"I will not stoop to mentioning the occasion last winter when our esteemed opponent was found asleep in an alleyway with an empty bottle of vodka still pressed to his lips.\"[10]\n\nIn the 1984 U.S. presidential campaign debates, Ronald Reagan used a humorous apophasis to deflect scrutiny of his own fitness at age 73 by replying, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"[11] In 1988, he applied a harsher apophasis toward George H.W. Bush's opponent Michael Dukakis, who was rumored to have received psychological treatment, \"Look, I'm not going to pick on an invalid.\"[12]\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump frequently employs apophasis.[13] In 2015, Trump said of fellow Republican presidential candidate and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, \"I promised I would not say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground, that she laid off tens of thousands of people and she got viciously fired. I said I will not say it, so I will not say it.\"[13] In 2016, he tweeted of journalist Megyn Kelly, “I refuse to call [her] a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct.\"[13] In 2017, as president, he tweeted of the leader of North Korea, \"Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me 'old,' when I would NEVER call him 'short and fat?'\"[14]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",
  "latent_14432": "One of British Columbia’s most influential First Nations chiefs has turned down an invitation to participate in a reconciliation ceremony with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their visit to Canada, describing the symbolic ceremony as a “public charade” that papers over the Canadian government’s failure to keep its promises to indigenous peoples.\n\nThe Black Rod ceremony is slated to take place on Monday evening, in a private sitting room at the stately Government House in Victoria. Officials have spent more than a year carefully crafting every moment of the ceremony, which will see Prince William add a carved silver ring to the Black Rod, a ceremonial staff created in 2012 to commemorate the Queen’s diamond jubilee.\n\nThe staff is currently adorned with three rings, representing the province, Canada and the link to the UK. Prince William is expected to add a fourth ring – engraved with eagle feathers and a canoe – that will symbolise First Nations in the province.\n\n“Reconciliation has to be more than empty symbolic gestures,” said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs in explaining his decision to decline the royal invitation.\n\nWilliam and Kate urged to confront past colonial wrongs in Canada Read more\n\nHe had been asked to hand the ring to Prince William and invite the royal to affix the ring on the Black Rod. Last week he and the chiefs of the 115 First Nations represented by his organisation decided it would not be appropriate to attend or participate in the event. “The Chiefs-in-Assembly just didn’t feel that it was appropriate to feed into that public illusion that everything is okay.”\n\nWhen the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, swept into government nearly a year ago, there was a sense of great hope within the indigenous community, Phillip said. Amid crushing levels of indigenous poverty, sky-high suicide rates and thousands of missing and murdered indigenous women, Trudeau had campaigned on a renewed relationship with Canada’s indigenous peoples. He vowed to repeal legislation that failed to respect aboriginal and treaty rights, committed to closing the wide gap in education funding for indigenous Canadians and pledged to address the lack of clean water and dilapidated, overcrowded housing that plagues many First Nations across Canada, among other promises.\n\n“Yet that hasn’t happened,” said Phillip. Instead, the Liberal government has repeatedly ignored a ruling by the Canadian human rights tribunal that found the government was racially discriminating against aboriginal youth by underfunding the welfare system. Its first budget – billed by the government as making “historic investments” in indigenous communities – will not deliver the bulk of the funding until after 2019. “We’re sick and tired of the lofty, eloquent rhetoric on the part of Prime Minister Trudeau,” said Phillip.\n\nA similar situation has played out at the provincial level. “The British Columbia government has proven to be absolutely adversarial to the rights and interests of First Nation people in the province,” said Phillip, pointing to the province’s efforts to fast-track the Site C hydroelectric dam, a C$9bn (US $7bn) project that will see an area roughly equivalent to about 5,000 rugby fields flooded in north-east British Columbia. A campaign launched globally by Amnesty International last month calls on the federal and British Columbian governments to withdraw all permits and approvals for Site C, over concerns that the mega-project tramples on the rights of indigenous peoples in northeast British Columbia.\n\nPhilip said the hypocrisy of taking part in a reconciliation ceremony was laid bare last week as the organisation’s chiefs gathered for their annual general meeting. “There were tears and gut-wrenching first-hand accounts of the tragedies in our communities. At same time we’re asked to participate in a reconciliation ceremony that for all intents and purposes would suggest there is a very harmonious and robust relationship between the First Nation people and provincial and federal governments,” he said. “And that’s an illusion. We decided that for us it wasn’t appropriate to participate in such a public charade.”\n\nHe wasn’t sure if other aboriginal leaders would participate in the event and stressed that the decision was not meant to disrespect anyone. “I apologise for any inconvenience we may have caused with our decision.”\n\nThe duke and duchess, along with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, arrived in Canada on Saturday.

  "latent_14628": "History is pockmarked with moments where events spiral off into the surreal. These are the times that transcend simple acts of fate and hint boldly at the greater forces battling for our eternal souls. The profoundly disconcerting intersection of leftist icon Tina Fey and Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte is certainly one of those instances.\n\nAs we shall see, the correlation between these two figures must rank up there as one of the most challenging yet prophetic messages that we, as a culture, have ever faced. Ultimately, the Fey/Bonaparte paradigm can teach us much about the dangerous kinship of populism and dictatorship.\n\nStatistically Impossible Commonalities\n\nOne is imperious, the other imperial. Both began their lives as rambunctious children traumatized by body-awareness issues. Forced to look inward for strength, they survived and eventually thrived but their youthful inadequacies forever defined their caustic ambition as adults. Napoleon Bonaparte was driven to overcompensate for his short stature, while for Tina Fey it was her social status as a “nerd.”\n\nThe dictum Imagination rules the world can be described as the foundation of their personalities. Indeed, it was Napoleon who coined the phrase, and Fey who dedicated her life to it.\n\nTina Fey received a facial scar and spent years trying to cover up the truth of its origins. Napoleon’s facial scar was famously kept off his official portraits and even his death mask. The two share a height of 5 feet, 5 inches. Both adamantly refused to own cats, which is particularly unusual for Fey in an age when feline photos are the hottest thing in comedy.\n\nAgainst immense odds, Bonaparte and Fey evolved into revolutionary leaders in their respective arenas, yet never felt fully satisfied with their glories. Both harbor a delirious hatred of cigarette smoke, yet a profound love of cheeses, fried snacks and other unhealthful foodstuffs. Both were raised Catholic, yet abandoned their faith to embrace the emptiness of nihilism as well as a devotion to the metric system. Both are credited with having a strong intellect, an hypnotic charisma and a wonkish obsession with the minutiae. Fey once claimed to have purchased the Rosetta Stone, while it was Napoleon who actually discovered the artifact in the Egyptian desert.\n\nAnd that is merely the tip of the iceberg…\n\nA Concise Catalog of Cosmologically Inexplicable “Coincidences”\n\n• Napoleon was proclaimed the Emperor of France on May 18th. Tina Fey was born on May 18th.\n\n• Fey’s middle name is Stamatina, which means “this morning” in Italian. Napoleon was born in the morning to an Italian family.\n\n• Fey’s mother’s name is Zenobia, while H.M.S. Zenobia was the name of a creaking, overbearing ship that famously taunted Napoleon.\n\n• Napoleon was a Colonel in his formative years (in Corsica), while Fey wrote a column under the name, “The Colonel,” in her formative years.\n\n• Fey and Napoleon have a strange disdain for their feet. (The Emperor famously hated paintings that showed feet).\n\n• Neither Fey nor Napoleon first became famous in their capitals. The future Emperor launched his military career fighting battles far outside of Paris. For Fey, Chicago was her launching pad, far removed from New York City, the epicenter of comedy and American media.\n\n• Early in his career, Napoleon wrote a pamphlet entitled, Le souper de Beaucaire. The revolutionary content of this work impressed men such as Augustin Robespierre, and helped establish Bonaparte as more than just a soldier. Meanwhile, Fey wrote the script to Mean Girls, the revolutionary content of which helped establish her as more than just a comic actress in the eyes of important men at Paramount Pictures.\n\n• Fey married at age 32, while Napoleon’s first wife was 32 when they married.\n\n• Napoleon was obsessed with a particular type of Eau de Cologne and used eight quarts of it for rubdowns every month. The scent’s chief ingredient? Lemons! On the popular television series 30 Rock, Tina Fey played a character named “Liz Lemon,” and was often referred to as simply, Lemon!\n\n• Powerful figures advised Napoleon and Fey to make crucial moves that brought their already successful careers to new heights. For Napoleon, it was Talleyrand who counseled him to come to Paris and form a government. Lorne Michaels famously counseled Tina Fey to leave Chicago for New York’s Saturday Night Live, where she eventually formed a writing team that led the city’s comedy business. (Curiously enough, Lorne Michaels and Talleyrand look very much alike.)\n\n• Once in power, Napoleon granted himself luxurious accommodations, just as Fey has done in New York City. Both also used their power to appoint their brothers to significant positions in their respective fields. (Napoleon appointed his brother, Joseph, King of Spain. Fey named a character on 30 Rock after her brother Pete and appointed him Producer of TGS.)\n\n• Just as Napoleon could have wiped out the Vatican and the power of the Catholic Church in 1797, it was assumed that Fey could have obliterated Sarah Palin’s political career in 2008. The two held back from their brutal assaults for remarkably similar reasons: they understood that the resulting power vacuums would allow far worse enemies to rise to prominence.\n\n• Also in 1797, Bonaparte forced the surrender of Venice. It was the first time in 1,100 years that the city-state was so defeated. Tina Fey forced the surrender of Saturday Night Live’s oligarchy of male writers, the first female head writer of a comedy show to do so in 24 years. (Interestingly enough, there is a numerological correlation between these figures. If you add all the numbers together: 1+1+0+0=2, and 2+2=4, thus “24”).\n\n• Horatio Lord Nelson, Bonaparte’s arch nemesis, shares countless similarities with Fey’s arch nemesis Amy Poehler (in addition to the obvious psychological ones.) One caveat to this relationship, however, is the fact that Nelson died in battle in the middle of Napoleon’s career, thus depriving the Emperor of a worthy foe. Poehler, on the other hand, is alive and continues to threaten Fey’s hegemony. Indeed, it could be argued that the Fey/Poehler dynamic is giving historians a first hand look at what the Napoleon/Nelson rivalry may have looked like had the English naval master survived.\n\n• Napoleon’s difficult campaign in Russia is quite emblematic of Tina Fey’s experiences with 30 Rock. Both were prolonged, painful and controversial among experts of the time. To conflate their numbers, both Fey and Napoleon used a bit of disingenuous propaganda. Napoleon tried to connect his war with the battle for Polish independence, while Fey attempted to make 30 Rock about gay rights.\n\n• Napoleon’s death was on 5/5/1821 (5+5+1+8+2+1=22 and 2+2=4). Tina Fey’s birth was on 5/18/1970 (5+1+8+1+9+7+0=31 and 3+1 also =4!)\n\n• Despite their vast successes, both published only one book. Tina Fey wrote Bossypants and the Emperor penned Clisson et Eugénie. Both can be summarized as slightly fictionalized biographic works in which the authors attempt to portray themselves as heroic figures in tragic times. Bossypant and Clisson, eerily enough, draw their tragicomic inspirations from the same obscure 18th-century German novel, Die Leiden des jungen Werthers.\n\nThe Mutual Physiology of Two Faces\n\n• Square Heads: “They are known as the metal shape face. These people are thought to have an intelligent, analytical and decisive mind. The face shape is associated with an aggressive and dominating nature.” Certainly a key factor in the lives of these two subjects!\n\n• Straight Foreheads: Indicates a progressive thinker who is often, “misunderstood as a child and thought of as dumb, but in fact, he may be very intelligent.” Sometimes they have difficulty working under pressure and lose control of their situations (as Napoleon did in Russia, and as Fey often has with her writers).\n\n• Low Eyebrows: Common with expressive people who are quick to take action, but who have a tendency to get impatient and interrupt others. These people are initially optimistic, but become antagonistic if criticized.\n\n• Narrow, Downward Noses: While round, plump noses are associated with warmth and good natures, the type that Fey and Napoleon share is quite the opposite. Theirs are narrow and point downward, which indicate a selfish, skeptical and slightly perverted nature. In addition, their narrow nostrils are linked to adamant personalities and a strong fear of the mental power of others. (Which underscores the fact that, despite being leaders in their fields, Fey and Napoleon are both harsh and skeptical of anyone whose keen intellect could pose a threat to their own.)\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the final analysis, we must wonder at the lesson that the heavens has laid out for us. Is Fey on the cusp of a 100-day reign of power with her new television series, Tooken, that ends in flight and then exile? Will the Poehler/Lord Nelson figure live to triumph in this epic saga of historical wits? Is God himself sending us a message about the nature of evil, about the real truth of liberalism? There are far too many similarities between Napoleon’s loyal military following and his populist notions and Fey’s radical feminist army and her extremist liberal agenda. If empowered, could Fey quickly devolve into the sort of reckless dictator that Napoleon became?\n\nWhatever the grave lesson here, we need to be weary of all movements led by psychologically-tortured outcasts who redefine themselves as intellectual elitists. For in the end, we, the public, become mere corollaries to their abstract equations, or even worse, farce for their sneering amusement. The very real dilemma of living our daily lives never factors into their calculations for cerebral triumphs. Yet we, the public, are the ones who suffer most from such machinations.\n\nSelected Quotations From the Shared Psyche of Tina Napoleon Fey Bonaparte\n\n• On Bold Decisions:\n\n“Nothing is more difficult, and therefore more precious, than to be able to decide.” — Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\n“You can’t be that kid standing at the top of the waterslide, overthinking it.

  "latent_14725": "Eric Fleming, a residential real estate broker in New York City, got turned on to watch-collecting six years ago when a client gave him some timeless advice. The client, who worked for jeweler Harry Winston, told Fleming he would never be able to sell a $4m apartment wearing a cheap watch.\n\nFleming, who was wearing a $400 Tissot sports watch back then, listened — and then some. The 37-year-old has since amassed a collection of 11 watches, ranging from a $250 Luminox sports watch to an $11,000 Rolex Yacht-Master Platinum.\n\nA watch for a man “is a very personal thing, it defines our character, our taste. There are not a lot of places where we can define ourselves,” said Fleming. He said owning fine watches has helped him professionally, as his client predicted: “Many clients notice my watches, I don’t wear the same one all the time.”\n\nOne reason watch-collecting is growing: an increased interest in technically interesting, well-made consumer goods, said Benjamin Clymer, executive editor of watch-collecting website Hodinkee. Desired watches often exude craftsmanship and a proven, longstanding notion of design.\n\n“These watches are anti-fad, they are timeless,” he said. “At their core, they were designed many generations ago, and the fact that there is an increased interest in them now speaks to the desire to move away from trend and toward craftsmanship.”\n\nVintage watch-collecting — which began in earnest in the 1980’s in Italy and Germany — is now a global phenomenon, with auctions held twice a year in four cities, according to Reginald Brack, head of private sales for Christie’s Watches, one of the top auctioneers of timepieces. Each location has its own specialty. Geneva auctions, for example, specialise in vintage watches more than 25 years old, while Hong Kong features auctions of timepieces that are more modern and have more jewels, said Brack.\n\nIf you have some watches collecting dust on your dresser, read up. One of them might be a treasure.\n\nMost coveted\n\nYou don’t have to be a jet-setter to buy a watch worth collecting. Watch enthusiasts can go to a neighborhood flea market or local dealer to scoop up an early Swatch that is now highly collectible, such as limited-edition models designed by artists like Keith Haring, which can go for as much as $1,000 at auction. Other reasonably-priced models to look for are mechanical Omega and Heuer watches from the 1960s and 1970s. They could be purchased for as little as $200 only five years ago, and now go for $2,000 on eBay.\n\nHigher-end collectibles include early models of German brand A Lange & Sohne from the early to mid-1990s; complicated Patek Philippe models from the 1990s; and Rolexes from the 1960s and 1970s, said Clymer.\n\nSo called “complicated” watches, or those that display more than hours and minutes, are among the most collectible. That is because collectors, who are predominantly male and often in their mid-20s to 40s, are drawn to the watch’s mechanism. “It’s similar to car collecting, there’s a strong technical appeal, with over 400 parts put into something the size of a postage stamp,” said Joe Thompson, editor-in-chief of WatchTime, a US-based watch enthusiasts’ magazine. “Guys find it fascinating to know what’s going on under the hood.”\n\nFor those who simply want to invest in the trend, there is a watch fund, Precious Time, which buys the best vintage watches, in the rarest configurations, from top brands such as Patek Philippe, Rolex, Audemars Piguet, Cartier and Breguet. The fund — started by a Milan-based collector, Alfredo Paramico, who has amassed what some experts consider one of the finest collections in the world — holds the watches, then sells them at an appropriate time to collectors for a profit.\n\nExperts say top models are becoming harder to find for sale as the popularity of watch collecting soars.\n\nAuction records set last year by Christie’s included the $1.7 million sale of the Patek Philippe, Reference 3448, a white gold, perpetual calendar wristwatch with moon phases and leap year, made in 1981. Christie’s also set a world auction record for any Rolex wristwatch, $1.2 million for an oversized, stainless steel, split-seconds, chronograph wristwatch, Reference 4113, manufactured in 1942.\n\nHidden treasure\n\nStill, according to Clymer, deals can still be found. Good places to hunt include private and authorised dealers, and online and off-line auctions at houses such as Christie’s and Sotheby’s. Estate sales and watch-collecting groups such as Red Bar Crew in New York, to which Fleming belongs, and eBay are also good options.\n\nTo better understand what constitutes a “deal” and become more knowledgeable overall, experts suggest reading voraciously. Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Antiquorum, which specialises in watches, put their auction catalogues and sales results online. Also recommended are specialised media such as WatchTime, web sites like Hodinkee, and online discussion forums like ThePuristS and TimeZone.\n\nWhat to look for\n\nGordon Bethune, former chief executive of Continental Airlines and a watch collector whose 50 vintage watches sold for $5.7 million at Christie’s in 2012, suggests developing a network of dealers who can act as advisors. His own network “helped me learn what to look for when I bought,” Bethune said.\n\nClymer believes “rarity trumps everything. If there’s only one watch made, it will ultimately be very special.”\n\nWhat is paramount in collecting, experts agree, is the condition of the watch.\n\nOriginality of parts is vital, said Clymer. “Don’t have the dial hands replaced, you don’t want the case overpolished,” both of which greatly devalue the watch.\n\nParamico, who rarely wears his watches and relies on his mobile to tell time, does not recommend servicing vintage watches often, to preserve their original condition. Clymer suggests storing them if they are not worn frequently (they don’t need to be kept wound or working) and also insuring them.\n\nIf buying directly from a dealer, either in person or online, Matthew Bain, a Miami-based dealer, said it is important to understand the dealer’s return and warranty policies, in case you don’t like the watch once you receive it. While dealers have price markups to consider, buy at auction, Clymer said, and “you’re on your own, each watch is sold as is.” And purchasing a watch on eBay could be problematical, because it is often unclear who the seller is.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nExperts say there is potential for watches to appreciate as an investment. Certain names might be more likely to offer returns, but the most important factor is that the buyer likes what he’s considering. Consider what Christie’s advises clients looking to buy any kind of treasure:\n\n“The general rule…buy what you love,” Brack said.",
  "latent_14915": "The New York Mets haven’t had a proper leadoff hitter since Jose Reyes took his talents to Canada (by way of South Beach). Lacking faith in Angel Pagan, they traded him to San Francisco for reliever Ramon Ramirez and Andres Torres. Torres posted a respectable 11.9% walk rate last season (which is great for a leadoff hitter), but it wasn’t enough to cover a poor .230 batting average and minimal power. Torres then returned to San Francisco this past offseason.\n\nRuben Tejada has plenty of experience leading off, having started 84 games in that spot, but his lack of power (.061 isolated power) and speed (12 career stolen bases, 63%) makes him ill-suited for the role.\n\nThrough eight games this season, the Mets have had four different players penciled into their leadoff spot (Collin Cowgill, Kirk Nieuwenhuis, Jordany Valdespin, Mike Baxter). But is Collins making the right choice here? I was talking to my friend the other day (let’s call him Ed, because his parents do), and he sent me the following text:\n\n“I think Murphy should be batting leadoff”\n\nAfter putting some thought into it, it doesn’t seem that unreasonable. Murphy doesn’t walk much (6.65 career BB%), but he rarely strikes out as well (12.63 career K%). His career .340 on base percentage is certainly sufficient for the gig, NL leadoff hitters posted a .332 mark from 2008-2012. Similarly, his career .432 slugging percentage is 31 points above the NL leadoff baseline (.401).\n\nBut what about speed?\n\nAn ideal leadoff hitter has speed; he steals bases. Rickey Henderson, one might recall, was arguably the best leadoff hitter of all time, posting a career .401 OBP and averaging 74 steals per 162 games (84.1%). In today’s game, no one is going to do that (Cincinnati prospect Billy Hamilton certainly has the speed, but only has a .365 OBP in the minors.\n\nBut why do we want speed? In short, to steal bases. You steal bases to get into scoring position, to make it easier for your #2 and #3 hitters to have less trouble knocking you in.\n\nDaniel Murphy will never be that kind of player. He’s stolen as many as 14 bases as a minor leaguer, but it’s much more likely he’ll end up around the 10 he got last season. However, he ought to make up for this with his relatively superior power. So, that leads us to the question: how much will Daniel Murphy‘s speed cost the Mets relative to a “traditional” leadoff hitter?\n\nIt’s a tad rudimentary, perhaps, but we can use a few different statistics to get an idea. We know that Total Bases (SLG% is calculated as Total Bases / At Bats) tells us how many a player gets with his bat. The number doesn’t include bases earned on errors, steals, or extra bases taken (i.e. going first to third on a single). So let’s add to that. I would argue, for example, that a walk and a successful steal of second base is as meaningful as hitting a double. Similarly, getting hit by a pitch, while not a skill (unless you’re Roger Dorn) has the same end result as a single. So let’s call this collective statistic “Bases Earned” – a sum of bases earned at the plate and on the base paths by oneself.\n\nThe Leadoff Baseline has averaged 273 bases in 681 at bats over the past five seasons (with a low of 259 in 2012, and a high of 289 in 2008). Daniel Murphy, in his career, has averaged only 239 bases, but in only 554 at bats.\n\nThe Leadoff Baseline, over the past five seasons, has averaged just under 70 additional trips on base per season (HBP, BB). Murphy, likewise, has averaged 42 additional trips.\n\nThe Leadoff Baseline, over the past five seasons, has averaged a bit over 18 net steals per season (successful steals – times caught). Daniel Murphy has only averaged 2 (though if 2012 is any indication, he could improve some in this category).\n\nThe chart below puts this information together; the first two columns correspond directly to the information above. The third column, Murphy’, is Daniel Murphy’s stats above extrapolated to an identical sample size as the leadoff baseline (abbreviated TLB). Here’s what we get:\n\nMurphy TLB Murphy’ Total Bases 239 273 301 Add. Trips 42 70 54 Net Steals 2 18 3 TOTAL 283 361 358\n\nDaniel Murphy isn’t going to steal nearly as many bases as your prototypical leadoff hitter. He’s also not going to walk as often. What he will do, however, is consistently put balls in play and hit for some power. And that should be more than enough to make up for it. By all intents and purposes, it’s identical. With a slight uptick in power (which, through a week and a half, Murphy’s shown that potential) and stolen bases like last year’s (10/12), he could certainly outpace those numbers.\n\nAnd the next question, of course, is what the lineup would look like were this to happen. Fortunately, there could be some options here. While the aforementioned players above (Cowgill, Kirk, Valdespin, Baxter, Tejada) each have a flaw that inhibits them from hitting leadoff (be it strikeouts, a lack of speed, or a lack of power), but these players could benefit in the two hole. Hitting with a player on base (and with David Wright batting third), they would likely see better pitches and, potentially, be under less pressure to perform. Murphy, on the flip side, could perhaps increase his value by getting more plate appearances.\n\nIf I were building a lineup with the current 25-man roster right now, I’d consider penciling in the following:\n\nMurphy, 4\n\nCowgill/Valdespin, 8\n\nWright, 5\n\nLucas Duda, 7\n\nJohn Buck, 2\n\nIke Davis, 3\n\nMarlon Byrd/Baxter, 9\n\nTejada, 6\n\nI would also be lobbying for an increase in playing time for Mike Baxter, who could turn out to be a quality corner outfielder, but that’s for another time.\n\nSo what do you think? Should Collins continue the carousel of young outfielders until someone sticks, or write in Murphy on top and see what happens?\n\nThanks for reading!

Fusion is the term used for the process for visually merging the left-eye image and the right-eye image into a single 3-dimensional image. When using a viewer, most of the work of achieving the needed abnormal convergence for stereo viewing is done by the optics and design of the stereo viewer.\n\nFree-vision fusion requires patience and practice because your willpower and eyes must do the work of the stereo viewer.

You will notice that instead of two images, there are four images floating about.\n\nContinue bringing your finger closer to your nose- you will see the two middle images moving towards each other.\n\nWhen the two middle images are aligned, or are on top of each other, stop moving your finger. You will now see three images in the background. The middle one contains the left/right images overlapped.\n\nSlowly remove your finger from your field of vision, while keeping the middle two images aligned.\n\nGradually force your focus out to the combined left/right image in the middle.\n\nIf you have problems keeping a lock on the middle image, try leaving your finger in the image for a while, but still focusing on the center image. Use your finger to regain left/right fusion.\n\nIf at first you fail, don't worry. It took me a while. Relax, go away and rest your eyes, and try it again later.\n\nOnce you have mastered the technique on the dots above, try the more complicated image in Figure 2.

  "latent_15003": "Getty Images\n\nSlovenia’s hockey bandwagon picked up a ton of passengers during the 2014 Sochi Olympics with their play while in a group with the United States and Russia.\n\nThe star of that team was Los Angeles Kings forward Anze Kopitar, who is hoping to guide his country back to the Olympics in 2018.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWith nine teams having already qualified for the PyeongChang Games, the final three spots will be filled during games in Belarus, Latvia and Norway when final qualification takes place next month. Kopitar and Slovenia will be in Minsk to face off against Poland, Denmark and Belarus, with the winner of the group heading to Korea in two years.\n\nWe still don’t know if NHL players will be participating in PyeongChang, but along with Kopitar, several like Kristers Gudļevskis and Zemgus Girgensons (Latvia), and\n\nFrans Nielsen, Frederik Andersen, Mikkel Boedker and Jannik Hansen (Denmark) will help their respective countries attempt to qualify in early September.\n\nKopitar will head home to Slovenia next week for training camp before arriving in Belarus a few days ahead of their Sept. 1 opener against Poland. The tournament will prep him for the World Cup of Hockey beginning on Sept. 17 when he plays for Team Europe.\n\nOnce it was clear Slovenia would have this opportunity to qualify for another Olympics, Kopitar made it clear to the Kings that he wanted to play.\n\n“Yeah, we didn’t really have any disagreements or anything like that,” Kopitar told Puck Daddy on Friday. “Obviously, I approached the team and let them know. I actually did that quite early. I expressed my desire to play. I’m pretty sure right now they know that I’m very happy to represent our colors. They were very understanding and didn’t really have any arguments towards it so it was very easy.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMonths after the excitement of the Sochi Games, Kopitar won his second Stanley Cup, which meant another trip to Slovenia for the trophy and another opportunity to celebrate the game in his home country.\n\n“Yeah, that summer was pretty exciting,” he said. “It was a lot of attention going toward hockey that summer. It was very nice to see.”\n\nThe excitement of 2014 could be rekindled in Slovenia should Kopitar and his teammates manage to qualify for 2018. The Sochi appearance certainly made an impact back home.\n\n“I definitely think we did try to put Slovenia on the map a little bit and everybody will pay a little closer attention to us in the future,” he said. “I think it was a great experience and I also think something for the kids back home to look up to and thinking that dreams can come true and try to follow them as best you can.”\n\nKopitar wore the ‘A’ for Slovenia in Sochi, and will now don the ‘C’ for the Kings beginning this season, taking over for Dustin Brown. While some might view the change as awkward in the room, Kopitar doesn’t see it like that.\n\n“Yes, I guess the roles are flopped now, and as I said before, let’s definitely not forget that he was the captain that took us to two Stanley Cups,” he said. “He’s going to be my guy that I lean on when I do have a question because he has been there before. I don’t think anything’s going to change between us.”\n\nWhile there will be a different letter on Kopitar’s sweater and new responsibilities that come with it, if you look at the Kings’ roster there’s plenty of experience there and plenty of Cup rings. The emphasis of what letter is on whose jersey is sometimes a bit overblown in Kopitar’s eyes.\n\n“I think sometimes it is blown up way too much. If you look at our Cup runs I could point out at least five guys that could wear the ‘C’ just as easily as Dustin did,” he said. “Not taking anything away from Dustin, but just sometimes the hype around it, sometimes if you guys don’t have anything to write about you guys pick the spots like that. The team does not consist of one guy. We realize that we have a strong group, a strong core. Right now we’ve got four guys, I think, that could easily be captains too.\n\n“I’ll be wearing the letter ‘C’ on the jersey but we know within the locker room that it’s not just about the ‘C’, it’s about the leaders throughout the team.”\n\n– – – – – – –\n\nSean Leahy is the associate editor for Puck Daddy on Yahoo Sports.

  "latent_15010": "By Melissa Souza\n\nEverywhere I go around the homestead I have four little ones following close behind me, two of which always have their boots on the wrong feet. Folks are always asking how we get it all done with four homeschooled children. It is true that I never have a stretch of time when children are gone at school, but that only means that I have helpers all of the time. Homesteading with children is a state of mind. If you try to distract them so you can get your work done it will be a constant battle of rushing and leaving tasks unfinished.\n\nWe started this homesteading journey for our children. We wanted them to see the great value in living a simple life. It is important that our children know things, and by things I don’t mean electronics. I mean real things like how to process meat, plant a garden, save seeds, and care for the land that takes care of them. As a busy parent that needs to get many things done every day, it is tempting to tell the kids to go play, but we are learning the value in taking the extra time to include each of our children in the daily chores.\n\nEach child has a set of jobs that are only their responsibility. We speak to them about how vital that role is, and why it is so important to take that responsibility seriously. My seven year old son is in charge of feeding the chickens, dog, cats, and rabbits. We explained that they eat before he does, because they depend on him. He never forgets to feed any of them, because he sees that they wait anxiously for him every morning. My four year old daughter gathers eggs after breakfast, and she has a special egg collecting apron that is just for her. This makes her feel important, because she is literally bringing breakfast in for our entire family.\n\nMy husband and I teach our children to harvest and clean ripe produce from the garden to provide food for our family and our small CSA.\n\nOur daughter and her special egg-gathering apron, which she uses to gather eggs every day.\n\nWhen it’s time to gather firewood, my husband always makes sure to bring our oldest boy along so he can learn how to safely chop wood, and how to stack it so that it dries properly. They have built a firewood shed, rabbit hutches, nesting boxes, a storage shed, and a child-friendly chicken coop together. It would be much quicker for my husband to do these projects on his own, but each new project is an opportunity to teach our children measurements, angles, types of wood, different tools, and hard work.\n\nPlanting seeds may take longer with little kids, but the joy they gain from growing food for their family can’t be duplicated any other way.\n\nThe chicken coop was designed specifically so that our children could manage the hens without our assistance. The food and water delivery systems are designed so that they never have to enter the coop. Eggs are collected from outside, and the back is easy to open so that they can clean out the coop themselves. Our rabbit hutches are similarly designed, and the animals that feed our family have become the responsibility of the kids. This gives them ownership and respect for those animals when it comes to processing day.\n\nThey have not gotten into processing the animals for meat yet, but that will come with time. They do watch and ask questions, and we explain the anatomy and steps involved in butchering. We save hides, and they help me tan and stretch the leather. They have learned that we use every part of the animal, and that is how to respect their sacrifice.\n\nLearning to preserve the harvest is another wonderful skill my kids learn on the homestead. We often turn extra cabbage into kimchi.\n\nOur favorite time of the year is when we start planning our garden. They get to select special vegetables that they would like to grow that year, and experience success of planting the seeds they helped save from the season before. When we are preparing our garden compost, we talk with them about how our food breaks down and why compost is important to feed our gardens. The kids all get out there every spring with rakes and shovels to help prepare the gardens that will feed them year around.\n\nAll four kids help plant seeds, weed, and water through the spring. You could walk around the entire property with our four year old, and she could tell you what each seedling is. I love watching her explain to visitors that the frilly ones are carrots, and the big round leaves are cucumbers, and the tall vines are sweet peas. It takes us longer to get our garden in the ground with so many tiny fingers poking around, but it makes every extra hour worth it when we see how proud they are of the carrots that they grow.\n\nWe built our coop to make sure our kids could manage the care and feeding of the hens all by themselves. The feed and water is added from the outside, and the entire back of the coop opens to make it easy to rake out the spoiled bedding into a wheelbarrow.\n\nSummer months bring daily garden collections, and they are so excited to bring in large baskets of greens, and even more eager to eat them. We run a small CSA, and when people come to collect their baskets, all four kids take such pride in everything that goes into them. Summertime also brings abundance that we preserve for the fall and winter months. Including the children in the canning process has been one of our best homeschool learning experiences. They learn to read recipes, measure exactly, and tell temperature. We have learned about bacteria, acids, and kitchen safety together, and that is a real world skill that will stay with them.\n\nHomesteading with small children is very possible, and in many regards what keeps us going. We live this life for them, so why would we not teach them every aspect of how to live this life in the future? My grandma tells me that this season in life is long days, and short years. I remind myself of that when I am watching my two year old stirring most of the flour out of the bread bowl. At the end of the day our children have dirty feet, and smell like sunshine, and we can almost bet that they have learned something new.\n\nMelissa lives with her husband and children on a suburban homestead in the Pacific northwest. In addition to a garden and eggs, they produce meat chickens and rabbits.",

An 8.3 is very startling for “Idol,” which not so long ago had 10 or 11 million. Fox execs said not too long ago that the show was “winding down” and now it’s come to pass. Will Fox cancel it? I think it’s a strong possibility. It’s not the fault of the judges. And Jennifer Lopez performed last night! You’d think she would have brought in a few peeps.

  "latent_15256": "\"In a worst-case situation we would be asked to offload, and the community then has really got to make the decision do they want to keep people in work or do they want to keep their houses heated,\" said Brickworks managing director Lindsay Partridge, recalling just such a situation in southern California in the early 1980s.\n\n\"The reason of course the price is up is because there's a shortage, so if there was an extended cold snap or there was some minor outage it would ricochet across the entire east coast very rapidly,\"\n\nBen Eade, executive director of Manufacturing Australia, said the combined impact of the cold and the fifth LNG train starting up in Gladstone was placing \"significant pressure\" on short-term domestic gas markets, just as gas buyers had been warning.\n\n\"It's not just about the spiking prices: large gas users remain concerned about the risk to their operations of gas curtailment if sudden demand spikes exceed available supply on very cold days,\" Mr Eade said.\n\nEast Coast gas demand forecast and Brisbane Spot gas prices Jan 2014 to May 2016\n\nLast Friday saw the first cold weather-driven demand \"event\", as termed by the Australian Energy Market Operator, when the spot gas price in Victoria exceeded $20 a gigajoule for a four-hour period. Prices spiked on Wednesday in Brisbane, reaching $11.95, while prices in Adelaide recently touched $18.99.\n\nHistorically, wholesale prices were typically $3-$4 a gigajoule, although in recent years contract tariffs have risen to $6-$8 a gigajoule or higher, if they can be secured at all.\n\nMr Partridge said Brickworks had only been able to lock in gas supplies to the end of 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"No one will write you a contract beyond 2018 at any price, so that makes things very concerning,\" he said.\n\n\"If you've got a billion dollars invested in plant and equipment and all you can get is 18 months of gas then that is pretty scary.\"\n\nAs recently as October 2014, before the start-up of LNG exports from Queensland, wholesale prices were trading at near-zero, and some of the LNG ventures were selling gas at a loss or burning it off as waste.\n\nSince then, the $27 billion Queensland Curtis LNG project built by BG Group has started up both its trains, as has Santos's $25 billion GLNG project. Origin Energy has started one of the two trains at its Australia Pacific LNG project, with the second to come online later this year. The ventures are causing a tripling of gas demand in the eastern states over a two-year period.\n\nThe head of the APPEA oil and gas industry group Malcolm Roberts noted that nearly all gas traded on the east coast was under long-term contracts, giving certainty about prices and volumes. He said the spot market usually accounts for only 1-2 per cent of gas traded daily and tends to be volatile, with Sydney prices ranging from $7.61-$28.81 over the past week, while prices in Queensland have been $9-$12.\n\n\"This highlights the urgent need to develop more gas supply and suppliers,\" Dr Roberts said. \"AEMO has warned that new reserves must be developed by 2019. Conventional gas fields will begin to decline as early as 2017.\"\n\nMr Eade noted that some large manufacturers still use the short-term trading market to make up shortfalls in supplies. He said one large gas user needed to purchase a significant volume on the spot market in July, and based on the latest prices in Brisbane would need to pay over $15 a gigajoule. Manufacturing Australia's members include BlueScope Steel, Brickworks and Incitec Pivot.\n\nIn comparison, the LNG import price in Japan, a premium-price market in Asia, averaged $US7 per million British thermal units in May, or about $9.40 a gigajoule. US benchmark prices ar just $US2.87 per MMBTU, or about $3.85 a gigajoule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"All of this was largely forecast, but its impact is being keenly felt now, and it underscores the pressures and uncertainty about gas supply and price amongst large users,\" Mr Eade said.\n\nThe fears of a damaging squeeze in gas comes after Tasmanian industry was plunged into crisis earlier this year by the failure of the Basslink power cable to Victoria, which took a financial toll on Rio Tinto, paper maker Norske Skog and South32 which had to cut consumption.\n\nConsultancy EnergyQuest estimated the economic cost of the Tasmanian crisis at more than $560 million, excluding the losses by the industrial gas users.\n\n\"Similar supply interruptions in east coast gas markets would be extremely damaging,\" Mr Eade said.\n\nHe called on the Council of Australian Governments energy council to seriously consider the impact of rising gas prices on domestic industry at its upcoming meeting in July and to act quickly to implement the recommendations of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission from its east coast gas inquiry.\n\n\"We need more gas development, we need a more efficient and transparent gas market and we need to understand exactly how demand might be managed if it exceeds supply in future cold snaps,\" he said.\n\nDr Roberts pointed out that states such as Victoria and NSW that opt out of developing their reserves would be more vulnerable, leading their industrial users \"especially exposed,\" he said.",
  "latent_15414": "Animal Kingdom Dig Review\n\nTNT’s Animal Kingdom, Season 2, Episode 7, Dig saw Smurf’s (Ellen Barkin) manipulation reach new heights and end a war before it even started. The real war is still brewing within the family as we watched Baz (Scott Speedman) realize Smurf’s murderous nature.\n\nDig was full of subtext as much as it was a demonstration of how disjointed this family really is.\n\nThe Cody boys emphatically chose not to go to war for Smurf. Smurf was expecting that they would be fired up and ready to go. Maybe we all expected as much. They did not mount up like a band of brothers, instead, they deliberated the liability posed by their mother’s wrongdoing, and appropriate reactions to a breach of their security. The whole exchange between the brothers seemed like a corporate liabilities conference between shareholders rather than a family meeting about keeping their home and family safe.\n\nDeran (Jake Weary) was especially adamant that he would not get bloody on her behalf. He was the loudest voice against retaliation and everything he said made sense. Still, he sounded more like an ungrateful brat than a son concerned that his mother was being stalked by a murderer. Perhaps he is the most vocal about not killing because he was never her go-to-guy for such dirty work. When Pope (Shawn Hatosy) yelled “We don’t just kill people”, the look he shared with Smurf across Baz’s face was thick with subtext. Smurf almost looked like she was bursting to call Pope out on that one, because of course, Catherine would disagree.\n\nI have to hand it to Smurf, in Dig, she played everyone, except maybe Pope. Something about her docile reaction to the boys’ decision did not sit well with me, especially when she walked away with her phone. Smurf was expecting her boys to be livid, murderous. She must have been seriously underwhelmed by their lack of sympathy for her and for J (Finn Cole). No matter what, she got herself covered.\n\nEvidence, destroyed. Javi (Alex Meraz), eliminated. Baz back in her pocket. I got a bit of whiplash at how quickly Javi became relevant, and then obsolete. On one hand, I applaud the Cody family for being able to dispense with a threat with ease. On the other hand, Javi turned out to be exactly what he seemed like: an angry, lost, little boy on a rampage that simply needed to be shut down. How anticlimactic though. In Dig, he was literally a throwaway character.\n\nAlso, we have to wonder why J did not mention the storage unit to his uncles. His silence demonstrated a shift in his loyalty to Smurf. Deran and Craig’s (Ben Robson) callousness caused him to clam up, and rightly so. Baz must have sensed it, because his conciliatory, little pep talk in J’s room was obvious and weak. J must have felt so alone. At the same time, he witnessed Smurf’s true power, as did we all.\n\nIn Dig, Smurf handled business and duped Baz into betraying his brothers, his teammates, thus sowing the seeds of distrust in Baz’s leadership. You could see him doubting himself in her loving, bloody hands on that cliff. She made him feel alienated and appreciated all at the same time. Wow, the woman is a magician.\n\nLooking more closely, you could see all the subtle looks that Baz threw her way, showing his inner skepticism. We have seen her kill with the nonchalance of taking out the garbage. Baz just stood by and watched how easily she snuffed out a life that was threatening her. He listened to how flippantly she spoke of a man she must have killed simply because he inconvenienced her. It must have dawned on him that she cares very little for anyone who threatens her way of life. So, what about Catherine? Yes, Baz, time to wake up!\n\nPope might have been the only one who saw through all of her lies. Then again, she is his mother. So, he protected her anyway. I would say Deran was clear-headed too, but his motivations are more selfish than Pope’s. Deran’s clarity is driven by his need to be free, while Pope’s clarity comes from his unhealthy emotional attachment to a woman who abuses him. He dug furiously into the ground to save her from a prison fate, that apparently, Deran knows Smurf wished upon Pope.\n\nYet, there is an honesty that Pope and Smurf share that nobody else has, not even J. This mother-son relationship is so complicated. Every time Barkin and Hatosy have scenes together it is like alchemy with little to no words.\n\nJ and Nicky (Molly Gordon) found each other again, in Dig. Despite what they had been through, Nicky could tell that J cared for her the most. She wants to know how to defend herself. J has skills he can teach her in that regard. Craig never seemed interested in teaching her anything or caring for her well-being. Honestly, I am not clear on Nicky’s role in any of this, except as a liability. I truly hope there is more to her. Meanwhile, I am focused on Baz. I am hoping that in the coming episodes, we see Baz come into the light.\n\nLeave your thoughts on this Animal Kingdom Dig review and this episode of Animal Kingdom below in the comments section.

  "latent_15491": "Three people were injured in a shooting inside Washington Square Mall on the east side of Indianapolis Wednesday evening.\n\nThe shooting happened around 6:30 p.m. in a corridor of the mall near the Target store. Investigators say a male suspect came into the mall and had words with a man he knew, then shot him. Two other victims were wounded by ricochet fire.\n\nPolice say the suspect and his intended target knew each other and had some sort of issue, but what that was, investigators aren't saying.\n\n\"We have a pretty good idea that these two had something going on,\" said IMPD Chief Brian Mahone.\n\nWhile police aren't saying what the issue was between the suspect and victim, they will say that none of it is related to recent high-profile police takedowns of drug suspects.\n\n\"This could have been a mall, a park, the gas station,\" Mahone said. \"This could have been anywhere that these two individuals ran into each other.\"\n\nThis time, though, it was at a mall with innocent bystanders under gunfire.\n\n\"You should be able to be safe anywhere you go,\" said witness Joshua Matthews.\n\nPolice say the three victims, two men and a woman, suffered non-life-threatening injuries, though one of the male victims was taken to the hospital in serious condition. Later Wednesday, police said the victims were all stable.\n\nRELATED: Customers, workers describe chaos during mall shooting\n\nA suspect wearing dark clothing reportedly fled the scene to the west. Police say there may be a second suspect, but have not released any suspect descriptions. Police hope the victims of the shooting will be able to help them identify the shooter.\n\nOfficers say the parties involved in the shooting were all \"young adults\" and that no juveniles were involved in the incident.\n\nWitnesses described a chaotic scene inside the mall on social media.\n\n\"People screaming.

It was scary\" - witness to Washington Square Mall shooting pic.twitter.com/92cpP31qoG — Jennie Runevitch (@JennieWTHR) October 29, 2015\n\nNever going to Washington square again.. Idk how someone can just pull a gun out and shoot someone. Scariest moment of my life — Brooke Bell (@bell_brooke) October 28, 2015\n\nMatthews told Eyewitness News he was inside the mall with his three-year-old son when the suspect started shooting.\n\n\"Bullets don't have a name. So it could get anybody,\" said Joshua Mathews.\n\nMatthews says as gunfire rang out, he picked up his son and started running.\n\n\"He just started crying and I just had to get him to safety,\" explained Matthews.\n\nHe said he saw at least two of the victims fall to the ground.\n\n\"You could tell they were shot. So didn't nobody have time to go back and see if they're okay, because when you hear a gunshot, your first instinct is to run,\" said Matthews.\n\nSo that's what Matthews did, running through nearby Burlington Coat Factory and finally outside to his car.\n\nAnyone with information about the shooting or possible suspect is urged to call Crime Stoppers at 262-TIPS or text \"INDYCS\" plus tip information to 274637 (CRIMES). All tips are considered anonymous.\n\nMall statement\n\nWednesday night, Washington Square Mall property manager Adrian T. Lewis Sr. issued the following statement:\n\nWe can confirm that a shooting occurred this evening at the Washington Square mall. The mall's security staff and Indianapolis Police Department responded quickly. The mall is cooperating fully with the police's investigation.\n\nThe safety of our shoppers and employees is our top priority. As part of our commitment to promoting a safe shopping environment, we maintain a highly-trained staff that is prepared to respond to a variety of emergency situations. We take numerous proactive measures and coordinate very closely with local officials as a best practice.\n\nOur thoughts are with the victims and their families during this difficult time.",
  "latent_15514": "Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow's documentary is a vital portrait, regardless of what you think of its subject.\n\nMore rewarding for neophytes and casual fans than it is for the titular director’s hardcore devotees, Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow’s “De Palma” is nevertheless essential viewing for everyone. Part autobiography and part filmmaking master class, this chronological documentary tour through the life and work of Brian De Palma (“Carrie,” “Blow Out,” “Body Double,” etc.) might initially appear to be nothing more than a glorified DVD bonus feature — it basically consists of a comprehensive interview that’s interspersed with a clips from his movies and a smattering of choice archival footage — but it isn’t long before it begins to pick up speed and snowball into something special.\n\nREAD MORE: Why He’ll Never Work in Hollywood or on Television Again\n\nWhich isn’t to say that Baumbach and Paltrow don’t come out swinging, as “De Palma” kicks off with the opening scene of “Vertigo” and immediately confronts its subject’s notorious (and singular) obsession with all things Alfred Hitchcock. Serving as the doc’s hyper-loquacious narrator, De Palma offers himself up as the one true apprentice of suspense without hesitation, as candid about his relationship with Hitchcock as he is about the one he failed to develop with his estranged father. As you watch the 75-year-old New Jersey native lean back on his haunches and orate about his life with the comfort of someone who’s already left his will on film, it soon becomes clear that a documentary about Brian De Palma can’t succeed without answering one fundamental question: What is there to learn about him that his endlessly self-reflexive movies haven’t taught us already?\n\nPlenty, it turns out. A large part of what makes “De Palma” great is that the film’s most resonant takeaways aren’t limited to its namesake, but the biographical stuff is still a joy to hear firsthand. De Palma is a born storyteller, and you don’t have to be one of those “Mission to Mars” defenders (you know who you are) to find yourself hanging on his every word.\n\nHe talks about seeing “Vertigo” with his family at Radio City Music Hall, he talks about being asked to tape the all-girls sex-ed class during high school, and he talks about the chance meeting with a young Robert De Niro that led to the actor’s very first role (in De Palma’s 1969 “The Wedding Party”). Baumbach and Paltrow edit out the space between their subject’s thoughts, and so it often feels as though De Palma is talking about all of these things in the span of a single breath.\n\nREAD MORE: Brian De Palma on Why He’ll Never Work for Hollywood or Television Again\n\nUnsurprisingly, considering when De Palma rose to prominence, this doc is also an oral history of Hollywood’s greatest generation of brat geniuses. De Palma constantly invokes his pals like “Marty” and “Steven” and “Pauline,” packing multitudes of personal backstory within every throwaway line (“Steven and I were so close back then…” Back then! What happened??). For added flavor, Baumbach and Paltrow also throw in home video footage of Spielberg using a car phone as he drives around Los Angeles with some girls in the back seat and rings up De Palma over Thanksgiving — these 20 seconds alone are worth the price of admission.\n\nBut the film, while never dull, doesn’t achieve liftoff until De Palma starts talking about how “Dressed to Kill” was inspired by his childhood memories of following his father around as he cheated on his mother. Suddenly, after 43 minutes of listening to the auteur discuss his life and his work with unwavering gusto, it crystallizes that they’re one and the same thing.\n\nThat may seem to be self-evident, but hearing De Palma quote the budgets and box office stats of his movies like he’s telling you his blood type — or watching the utter lack of change in his face as he mentions his divorce as the true coda of “Bonfire of the Vanities” — you can feel the Hollywood machine breaking down into its individual parts (“The Hollywood system does nothing but destroy you,” De Palma sighs).\n\nTo some extent, the film is a feature-length argument for the auteur theory, albeit it one more intent on proving the concept’s validity than its merits. “De Palma” doesn’t argue that each of the director’s elaborate camera moves can be traced back to a traumatic episode from his youth, but it vividly illustrates why watching “Sisters” (or even “Snake Eyes”) might tell you more about the man through images than he ever could with words.\n\nFortunately, this movie isn’t about him. While “De Palma” is as wild, hypnotic, egocentric, and stubborn as any of the director’s films, it gathers them together and extrapolates some unrelated truths from the wide shot. “Let’s get one thing clear about directors’ careers,” De Palma declares, “We don’t plan them out.”\n\nBaumbach and Paltrow’s rigidly organized documentary makes that quite obvious. But by sprinting through 50 years of features so fast that each of them ultimately feels like a single frame rattling through a projector, they blur De Palma’s body of work into a moving truth that none of his individual films has ever crystallized with such clarity: The movies are real-life; the great filmmakers are the ones who never let you forget that.\n\nGrade: B+\n\n“De Palma” opens in theaters on Friday.\n\nGet the latest Box Office news!

  "latent_15642": "New York: The Earth is warming so fast that it’s surprising even the climate scientists who predicted this was coming.\n\nLast month was the hottest March in 137 years of record keeping, according to data released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s the 11th consecutive month to set a new record, and it puts 2016 on course to set a third straight annual record. Now, it might seem premature to talk about setting a new yearly record after just three months of data, but these months have been such an extreme departure from the norm that Gavin Schmidt, who directs Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has already made the call.\n\n“I estimate [a greater than] 99 percent chance of an annual record in 2016,\" Schmidt wrote on Twitter last week, after Nasa released its own record climate readings. A month ago—following the release of February’s data—Schmidt wrote, simply, “Wow.\"\n\nThe March data follows the hottest winter on record worldwide. Results from the world’s top monitoring agencies vary slightly, but Nasa, NOAA, and the Japan Meteorological Agency all agree that 2016 has no precedent in the modern climate record.\n\nThe map below, from Nasa, shows how the heat was distributed across the globe. The most extreme heat swept the Arctic, where winter ice levels were at the lowest on record for this time of year. In Greenland, ice melted so fast scientists initially thought their calculations might be wrong.\n\nTo be sure, some of this is the result of a monster El Niño weather pattern lingering in the Pacific Ocean. But the broader trend is clear: We live on a planet that is warming rapidly, with no end in sight. Since 1980, the world has set a new annual temperature record roughly every three years, and 15 of the hottest 16 years ever measured are in the 21st century. Now the hottest winter on record is turning into the hottest spring—the beginning of something grimly new. Bloomberg",
  "latent_15692": "LGBT Megadonor Pouring Millions Into Campaign to Punish Christians for Refusing to Participate in Gay Weddings; \"Punish the Wicked,\" Xe Advises\n\nPretty soon you'll have to give same-sex oral sex on demand or face legal punishment.\n\nOpenly gay LGBT activist Tim Gill, who has poured $422 million into the homosexual movement since the 1990s, recently told Rolling Stone why he won't allow Christians to opt out of participating in same-sex weddings. \"We're going to punish the wicked,\" Gill told Rolling Stone. After the 2015 Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges legalized same-sex marriage across the country, Gill turned his activism apparatus against religious freedom restoration acts (RFRAs) and toward a legal mentality that would penalize Christians, and anyone else in business, who refuse to participate in a same-sex wedding.\n\nHe, and Rolling Stone, frame this as a heroic battle against those who would deny gays \"public accommodations.\"\n\nBut it's a very limited sort of denial -- it's just people, Christian and otherwise, who don't want to be part of gay weddings:\n\nThe \"public accommodations\" push is exactly the line LGBT activists use to undercut Christians' freedom to opt out of serving same-sex weddings.\n\nI'm not really kidding when I say the only way Gay Activists won't be #Triggered and #Oppressed is if everyone agrees to their demands to experiment with some light homosexuality themselves.\n\nAs evidence for this: a 20 year old quote from Dumb Actor Ben Affleck resurfaced. Back then, he said the \"greatest challenge\" for a male actor was having to kiss another man.\n\nYou know -- because straight men have -- get this! -- a real psychological and biological aversion to any intimate touching of another male.\n\nBut he's being hectored about it, because their idea of sexual freedom requires your sexual subjugation.",

  "latent_16009": "News Releases from Region 08\n\nEPA and the State of Colorado release plans to protect water quality, enable land reuse at the Eagle Mine Superfund Site\n\nActions build upon prior cleanup efforts\n\nContact Information: Richard Mylott (mylott.richard@epa.gov) 303-312-6654\n\nDENVER -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) have released two final Records of Decision for environmental remediation at the Eagle Mine Superfund Site in Eagle County, Colorado, following the consideration of input received through a public comment process. Both documents, specifying measures to protect water quality and facilitate site reuse, focus on further reducing exposure to heavy metal contamination created by nearly one-hundred years of mining activity at the site.\n\n“These actions reflect both EPA’s and CDPHE’s commitment to efficiently evaluate conditions and protect human health and the environment at the Eagle Mine Superfund Site,” said EPA Assistant Regional Administrator Betsy Smidinger. “Together, we are strengthening the water quality improvements we have achieved in the Eagle River and providing opportunities to bring lands back into safe, productive reuse. EPA remains committed to improving environmental conditions and human health for Americans that live and work near Superfund sites.”\n\nThe amended Record of Decision finalized for Operable Unit 1 (OU1) at the Eagle Mine Superfund Site adopts site-specific arsenic remedial goals and modifies surface water cleanup levels for cadmium, copper and zinc to meet more recent standards established for the site by the Colorado Water Quality Control Commission in 2008. Water quality monitoring in the Eagle River indicates that these standards for cadmium, copper and zinc are not attained in March and April of most years. The OU1 Record of Decision requires institutional controls to protect existing remedial features and expands the current groundwater collection system in Belden and at the mouth of Rock Creek to further reduce metals loading to the Eagle River.\n\nEPA and CDPHE have also finalized a separate Record of Decision for Operable Unit 3 (OU3) focused on soil remediation necessary to protect human health should future residential development occur. EPA created OU3 after a developer purchased a large portion of the Eagle Mine Superfund Site in 2004 with plans to develop the property into a private, residential community. The Record of Decision for OU3 includes a combination of the following elements for areas proposed for development: excavating soil; placing a soil exposure barrier; grading the site; placing institutional controls and conducting monitoring; and/or demolishing structures.\n\nThe Eagle Mine Superfund Site is located in Eagle County, Colorado. The site is defined as the area impacted by past mining activity along and including the Eagle River between the towns of Red Cliff and Minturn. Mining activities at the Eagle Mine began in 1879 and continued until 1984. EPA listed the site on the National Priorities List (NPL), commonly known as the list of Superfund Sites, in 1986 because of the mine metals discharge, uncontrolled mine waste piles and the close proximity of the population to the mine and associated features. To better manage the site, EPA divided it into operable units.\n\nEPA and CDPHE issued a final Record of Decision for the Eagle Mine Superfund Site in 1993. Over the years, all required environmental cleanup work has occurred at the site under a number of state and federal directives. EPA declared all cleanup construction activities complete at the site in 2001. Remediation conducted to-date has resulted in significant improvement in water quality and reduction in risk to human health and the environment. Continued operation of the existing remedy, including drawdown from the mine pool and treatment at the water treatment plant, is required to maintain this condition. Contaminant concentrations in surface water and groundwater have decreased significantly, and the aquatic ecosystem continues to show signs of recovery.\n\nFor more information about the Eagle Mine Superfund Site, please contact: Ms. Wendy Naugle, On-Site Coordinator, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, 4300 Cherry Creek Drive South, Denver, CO 80246, Wendy.naugle@co.state.co.us, or Ms. Jamie Miller, Project Manager, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1595 Wynkoop Street, Denver, CO 80202, miller.jamie@epa.gov\n\nYou can also visit one of the following Websites: https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/eagle-mine, https://www.epa.gov/superfund/eagle-mine\n\nThe Records of Decision for both OU1 and OU3 and the Administrative Records containing key decisional documents leading to the decisions described in the Records of Decision can be viewed at:\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n\nRegion 8, Records Center\n\n1595 Wynkoop Street\n\nDenver, CO 80202\n\nRecords may be viewed by appointment only -\n\ncall 303-312-6601\n\nColorado Department of Public Health and the Environment Records Center\n\n4300 Cherry Creek Drive South\n\nDenver, CO 80246-1530\n\n303-692-3311\n\n1-888-569-1831, ext. 3331\n\nMinturn Town Hall\n\nP.O.

  "latent_16162": "Mr. Armstrong said that to prevent something similar from ever happening at Coinbase, the firm plans to hire independent auditors to conduct a public investigation of both its Bitcoin and dollar holdings. The site also recently published a “security audit” of its technical processes, which showed it did live up to its claim of storing most of its Bitcoin holdings in “cold storage,” meaning on machines that are not connected to the Internet.\n\nThen there are more far-reaching efforts to secure Bitcoin. Elliptic, a British Bitcoin storage site, offers optional insurance on your holdings. For a fee of about 2 percent of your coins per year, the site promises to repay you if theft or negligence results in the loss of your funds. Another firm, Inscrypto, is working on what it calls a “decentralized version of the F.D.I.C.,” a system similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which protects your checking account. The system, which is still a work in progress, is far more complex than traditional deposit insurance, using derivative trades to protect against price swings or other dangers of Bitcoin. At the moment, it’s unclear how much it will cost, or even if it will work. The company, like several others in the Bitcoin world, declined to be quoted on the topic.\n\nTo some supporters of Bitcoin, the rise of these consumer protection ideas is itself proof of the digital currency’s superiority over old-fashioned currency. One of Bitcoin’s most cherished technical tenets is openness, the idea that anyone, anywhere, can set up a trading node on the payment network. Openness lowers barriers to entry; it allows sites with newer, safer, more innovative financial ideas to easily peddle their wares, while rickety concerns like Mt. Gox die under their own incompetence. It sets up a Darwinian race toward a safer Bitcoin.\n\nIn the short run, this dynamic causes terrible consequences for users, but eventually, Bitcoin’s supporters say, the worst problems will get ironed out. One frequent analogy in the Bitcoin world is to the early days of the Internet and web. Just a decade and a half ago, the web was a rough-and-tumble network ruled by pornography and illegal file-trading, a place where fraud flourished and danger lurked around every corner. Today the web is still all that, but it is also, in its more respectable corners, the place where you post pictures of your children, where you shop for Christmas presents, where you hold secure conversations with your doctor and where companies make billions of dollars every year without worry of being defrauded.\n\n“The history of Bitcoin is going to be largely the same,” Mr. Armstrong said. It starts with a “fundamental breakthrough that lowered the cost of payments, but there will be a lot of details to get right, and like on the early Internet, it will take time for the fundamental infrastructure to get established.” Once that happens, Mr. Armstrong says he believes that digital currencies will be unstoppable. Unless, of course, the thought of a half-billion dollars disappearing without a trace makes people queasy enough to stay away from Bitcoin for good.",
  "latent_16246": "Paul Burns / Getty Images\n\nWhen Suzanne Kail, an English teacher at a public high school in Magnolia, Ohio, was told that she would be required to teach her students Latin and Greek word roots, she groaned and rolled her eyes. Kail believes in a progressive approach to education, in which active engagement in meaningful learning is paramount. In an account of her experience in the English Journal, she wrote, “asking students to do rote memorization was the antithesis of what I believed in most.” Still, her department head insisted on it, so Kail went forward with the attitude, “I’ll do it, but I won’t like it.” She was sure her students wouldn’t like it, either.\n\nKail was in for a surprise — as is anyone who takes a look at a raft of recent studies supporting the effectiveness of “old school” methods like memorizing math facts, reading aloud, practicing handwriting and teaching argumentation (activities that once went by the names drill, recitation, penmanship and rhetoric). While the education world is all abuzz about so-called 21st century skills like collaboration, problem solving and critical thinking, this research suggests that we might do well to add a strong dose of the 19th century to our children’s schooling.\n\n(MORE: Paul: Why Third Grade Is So Important: The ‘Matthew Effect’)\n\nKail’s experience is instructive. As soon as she began teaching her students the Greek and Latin origins of many English terms — that the root sta means “put in place or stand,” for example, and that cess means “to move or withdraw” — they eagerly began identifying familiar words that incorporated the roots, like statue and recess. Her three classes competed against one another to come up with the longest list of words derived from the roots they were learning. Kail’s students started using these terms in their writing, and many of them told her that their study of word roots helped them answer questions on the SAT and on Ohio’s state graduation exam. (Research confirms that instruction in word roots allows students to learn new vocabulary and figure out the meaning of words in context more easily.) For her part, Kail reports that she no longer sees rote memorization as “inherently evil.” Although committing the word roots to memory was a necessary first step, she notes, “the key was taking that old-school method and encouraging students to use their knowledge to practice higher-level thinking skills.”\n\nThat’s also true of another old-fashioned method: drilling math facts, like the multiplication table. Although many progressive educators decry what they call “drill and kill” (kill students’ love of learning, that is), rapid mental retrieval of basic facts is a prerequisite for doing more complex, and more interesting, kinds of math. The only way to achieve this “automaticity,” so far as anyone has been able to determine, is to practice. And practice. Indeed, many experts who have observed the wide gap between the math scores of American and Chinese students on international tests attribute the Asian students’ advantage to their schools’ relentless focus on memorizing math facts. Failure to do so can effectively close off the higher realms of mathematics: a study published in the journal Mathematical Cognition found that most errors made by students working on complex math problems were due to a lack of automaticity in basic math facts.\n\n(MORE: Paul: Remember More Without Trying)\n\nHere are a few other old-school skills that are still worth cultivating:\n\nHandwriting\n\nResearch shows that forming letters by hand, as opposed to typing them into a computer, not only helps young children develop their fine motor skills but also improves their ability to recognize letters — a capacity that, in turn, predicts reading ability at age 5. But many schools are now emphasizing typing over writing. Last year, for example, the Indiana Department of Education announced that the state’s public schools no longer had to teach cursive writing and they should ensure that students were “proficient in keyboard use” instead.\n\nResearch shows that forming letters by hand, as opposed to typing them into a computer, not only helps young children develop their fine motor skills but also improves their ability to recognize letters — a capacity that, in turn, predicts reading ability at age 5.

Reading Aloud\n\nMany studies have shown that when students are read to frequently by a teacher, their vocabulary and their grasp of syntax and sentence structure improves. Educator Doug Lemov, author of Teach like a Champion and a co-author of the new book Practice Perfect, explains why: “Children who are read to become familiar with the sound and rhythm and complexity of language long before they can produce it themselves. By virtue of being exposed to a wide variety of writing types and styles, they come to understand that the use of language involves intentional choices made by the author and is representative of the author’s time and place.”\n\nStories are especially powerful when narrated by a good reader, says Lemov, “someone who brings the story to life, models expressive reading and shows kids what a book ‘sounds like’ in the voice of someone who reads with passion.” But reading aloud, he adds, is a “dying art.” Maybe we adults should brush up on our old-school skills too.\n\nMORE: Paul: Born to Be Bright: Is There a Gene for Learning?",
  "latent_16263": "Republican nominee Donald Trump, shown meeting with Latino business leaders Wednesday in Las Vegas, claimed $916 million in losses in 1995, according to a report by the New York Times. (Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nThe revelation that Donald Trump claimed a $916 million loss on his personal income taxes in 1995 has touched off a scramble this week among tax law experts seeking to understand exactly how he did it.\n\nThe experts have offered an array of arcane theories about the mechanisms Trump might have used to avoid paying taxes. A leading theory is that Trump was able to “double dip” by using the tax code to avoid paying taxes on huge loans that he did not have to pay back and at the same time deduct massive losses from businesses that were financed by the loans.\n\nNo one knows for sure what provisions his accountants used because Trump — unlike every other major presidential nominee over the last four decades — has refused to release his tax returns.\n\nThe controversy has dominated the presidential campaign in recent days. After Clinton accused Trump of taking unfair advantage of the tax code, Trump said at a campaign rally on Tuesday, “She complains about how I’ve used tax laws of this country to my benefit. Then I ask a simple question: Why didn’t she ever try to change those laws so I couldn’t use them?”\n\nShe did. After the Supreme Court in an 8-to-1 vote upheld the “double dip” loophole in 2001, Congress the next year voted to disallow it. Then-Sen. Clinton was among those who voted it down.\n\nThe tax code allows real estate developers or managers to use special tax breaks and benefits that the rest of us can’t. Here’s how that works. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump also took credit for his aggressive use of the nation’s tax laws and other measures to engineer his reemergence in the mid-1990s from the near-collapse of his real estate and casino empire.\n\n“I mean, honestly, I have brilliantly — I have brilliantly used those laws,” Trump said at a campaign event on Monday in Pueblo, Colo. “I was able to use the tax laws of this country, and my business acumen, to dig out of the real estate mess — you would call it a depression — when few others were able to do what I did.”\n\nThe dispute has reinforced an image of Trump as a bold risk-taker who left a trail of wreckage while serving his own interests.\n\nVoters are being asked to reconcile two diametrically opposed views of Trump: his own narrative that he is a financial wizard who simply used the laws of the country to protect himself, and Hillary Clinton’s contention that he is a rapacious and unrestrained capitalist who “abuses his power” and “games the system.”\n\nThere is no question that Trump emerged from his financial cataclysm in 1995 through tough negotiation with dozens of creditors and the aggressive use of complex and rarefied federal tax rules, according to interviews with a dozen tax experts, company filings and regulatory documents.\n\nThe tax law experts interviewed by The Washington Post largely agree that the deductions Trump claimed were probably legal under the tax laws in effect at the time, even though the size of his claims was extraordinary.\n\nDouglas Baird, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said “there’s nothing inherently illegitimate” about using every tax break available.\n\nIn 1990, Donald Trump opened the largest and most lavish casino-hotel complex in Atlantic City. Unlike any other casino in America, the Trump Taj Mahal was expected to break every record in the books. But just several months later, it all fell apart. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)\n\n“That’s the magic that he or his lawyers worked,” Baird said. “I can guarantee you it’s a billion times more complicated than we can imagine.”\n\nJack Mitnick, the accountant who prepared Trump’s taxes, told The Post that the provisions and loopholes that Trump relied on were routinely exploited by large real estate developers at the time. He declined to provide details.\n\n“More voluminous, not more complex,” Mitnick said, describing the documents that Trump’s organization made available to him in 1995. “It was not an unusual thing.”\n\nBut Mitnick played down Trump’s role in formulating the tax strategy.\n\n“He had nothing to do with it,” Mitnick said.\n\n***\n\nFor two decades, Donald Trump has underscored 1995 as a pivotal point in his resurgence following the implosion of his real estate and gambling empire, a debacle that included four bankruptcies and left him nearly $1 billion in the hole.\n\nBack in 1987, Donald Trump was soaring. He had built the glittering Trump Tower on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, named two casinos in Atlantic City after himself and was about to achieve his first $1 billion ranking on the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. He was widely considered to be the epitome of the go-go 1980s.\n\nBut his fortunes were about to be undone — by his own bad bets.\n\nTrump wanted a third casino — his grandest yet — and he made a move on the hulking, unfinished Taj Mahal. Analysts had warned that Atlantic City’s gaming market was cooling. Too many casino owners had taken on too much debt.\n\nBut Trump charged ahead. Contrary to a stark promise he made to regulators under oath in early 1988 to win approval for the project, he financed the Taj project with $675 million in junk bonds, documents show.\n\nThe 1,250-room Taj opened in 1990 as the largest casino-hotel in the world. But by then, Trump’s real estate and gambling empire already faced ruin because of the extensive debt he was carrying — some $3.4 billion.\n\nA confidential report produced by accountants in June 1990 for the Trump Organization showed that only three of its 22 assets were profitable. The report made a startling claim about Trump’s net worth, saying it had plunged to negative $295 million.\n\n“He was hemorrhaging money,’’ said Rob McSween, a former Citibank managing director who was familiar with Trump’s finances at the time.\n\nFacing the possibility of personal bankruptcy, Trump turned his attention to a $100 million line of credit he had with Bankers Trust. That line of credit would be key to Trump’s ability to survive in the coming years.\n\nIn an interview for “Trump Revealed,’’ the biography produced by The Post this year, Trump said he drained the account while his bankers were on vacation and could not block such a large transaction.\n\n“I said, ‘Draw it down,’ ” Trump said. “I took everything out of the bank.”\n\nWhen the bankers found out what had happened, they “went absolutely berserk.”\n\nTrump viewed it as an ingenious move.\n\nLate in 1990, he failed to make the first payment on the Taj junk bonds and his corporate and personal finances went into a tailspin, as lenders demanded repayment.\n\nThe first bankruptcy came in 1991, when the Taj sought protection to reorganize. In March 1992, Trump’s Castle and Plaza casinos also filed for bankruptcy. Later that year, the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan also filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIn all four cases, Trump settled by giving up nearly half of his equity shares to lenders. Documents prepared for Trump’s organization, along with estimates of the cost of the Taj at the time, show that the casino holdings alone were worth more than $2 billion.\n\nTrump managed to persuade lenders not to hold him accountable for personal guarantees on $832 million of the loans, through at least 1995.\n\nBut Trump’s empire was in tatters. “[T]he media was, in fact, gleefully predicting my collapse,” Trump wrote in “Trump: The Art of The Comeback” in 1997.\n\n***\n\nAmid the gloom, Trump and a small group of executives were taking new steps to set the stage for his revival.\n\nIn June 1993, the Trump Organization restructured “a significant portion” of the debts relating to the casinos, according to a report by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.\n\nThat same year, Trump took out new loans and began amassing anew the accoutrements expected of a mogul.\n\nHe bought a small jet that designer Lockheed Martin described as “Luxury Among the Clouds.” He also arranged a lease-purchase agreement for the Boeing 727 airplane he had sold during his financial meltdown. He also took out a mortgage for waterfront property in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n“There was no way to deny that things were going really great.” Trump wrote.\n\n“My personal debt of $975 million had been reduced to $115 million, and I had two years to finish cleaning it up.”\n\nIn 1995, as part of his revival campaign, Trump launched Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, his first publicly traded company. He billed it as the first chance for ordinary people to buy stock in a Trump enterprise. But it was also a way to cleanse himself of lingering debts.\n\nFrom the outset, Trump planned to consolidate $1.7 billion in old casino debts inside the company, thus transferring responsibilities to his investors, documents show. Among other things, he was using it to “satisfy the indebtedness of Taj Associates under its loan agreement” with one bank and to make payments “to obtain releases of liens and guarantees” with another bank.\n\nThe new company bought all three of his casinos. It paid about $100 million more for the Castle than analysts said the casino was worth, guaranteeing Trump $880,000 in cash bonuses.\n\nDuring Trump’s 14 years as chairman, the company lost more than $1 billion. Shares plunged from $35 to a low of 17 cents.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Post, Trump defended his stewardship of the company.\n\n“All I can say is I wasn’t representing the country,” he said. “I wasn’t representing the banks. I wasn’t representing anybody but myself.”\n\nAlso in 1995, Trump claimed on tax forms filed in New York that he had lost $916 million.\n\nTrump has acknowledged the loss claim was part of his effort to minimize or erase the taxes he owed to the federal government. But no one knows the mechanisms that Mitnick, Trump’s accountant, used.\n\nTheories have been flying across the Internet among experts and appearing in news reports for days. One of them put forth on Tax Notes, a website devoted to the nuances of tax law, holds that the move made by Trump’s accountant was “likely to have to do with debt forgiveness and S corporation rules,” under the federal tax code.\n\nUnder this scenario, Trump would have received a complex cascade of tax benefits related to the cancellation of his debts and net operating losses from his businesses.\n\nTax Notes said that such a maneuver enabled entrepreneurs to make a “double dip,” because they were able to avoid paying income tax on debts that had been forgiven and at the same time claim deductions for earlier losses.\n\nAnother theory is that Trump proclaimed his insolvency at a time when he was obligated to repay loans and other debts. Theoretically, that would have made him eligible under a related federal tax provision to minimize income taxes.\n\nSome have suggested that Trump might have used the new public company to shed the tax liability.\n\nKaren Burke, a law professor at the University of Florida, said these and other possibilities are entirely legal if properly invoked. But when too many clever tricks are stacked up to avoid paying taxes, it can create ethical and legal risks.\n\n“Sometimes when you put all the perfectly normal things together, you create a real monster,” she said.\n\nMichael Kranish, Amy Goldstein, Jerry Markon and researcher Alice Crites contributed to this report.",

Unfortunately for Katrina, Abbie’s attempt to stop her led to Abbie going back into 1781 (and where she promptly landed in jail, because she didn’t have her papers which acknowledged her freedom).\n\nAnd while time travel elements were a part of SLEEPY HOLLOW’s DNA from the start (after all, Ichabod was from the past, and woke up in 2013), star Tom Mison (Ichabod) admittedly he had his hesitations initially when he heard about two characters going back in time for the season finale — until he heard what the plan was.\n\n“I’ll admit, I was worried,” Mison acknowledged. “When time travel comes into anything, there’s the possibility of it becoming very, very confusing. There’s the possibility if you start to try and pick [the story] apart, it will fall to pieces. But then I found out the way around it [with what the writers are doing], and I thought, ‘That’s brilliant. That’s a brilliant way around all the intricate difficulties of time travel’…I think they dealt with it in a very smart, simple, clean way.”\n\nOne of the fun elements the show will explore in the season finale, “Tempus Fugit,” is the relationship between a displaced Abbie and an Ichabod who has never met her.\n\n“It’s [a dynamic] of mistrust, instantly,” Mison laughed. “I’m sure he’s had lots of people in prison try and negotiate their way out of the cell. I don’t imagine that’s anything new to him. What’s new for him is there’s a woman in a very peculiar jacket with lots of zips on and wearing trousers. That’s immediately [making him realize] she’s something different, she’s something exotic. When she starts correctly predicting events, his first thought is she’s a spy. I like that finally the roles are reversed, and she has to persuade him of things, rather than him having to persuade her.”\n\n“Also, it’s a very different Ichabod,” he continued. “18th century Ichabod is very different [from] 21st century Ichabod. You can completely understand why he’s so anal in the modern day, and why he finds it so difficult [at times to adapt] — the manner in which things are worked in the modern day. He led men in battle. He was responsible for lots of lives. It’s a blow to him when lives are lost. He’s a serious man, and he has a lot of responsibility. And it’s good to find that core of him; it helps you understand his mentality in the modern-day.”\n\nAs for Mison, he relished spending (most of) the finale hour playing a version of Ichabod that has rarely been showcased in an extended way.\n\n“It was such a relief; it was such a treat,” he shared. “Normally we’ll get a scene or two in a flashback, and I’ll be sitting there with a Founding Father, and there will be a voice over of modern day Ichabod saying what’s happening. So to actually go and explore it — it’s something I thought about a lot. There’s a difference between then and now. There have been lots of talk about my hand gestures in the modern day; Ichabod is very twitchy with his hands. All of his tension and worry and fear and doubt, he can keep a very straight face, but he can’t hide the tension in his hands. Whereas in the past, he’s far more relaxed, and he’s in control, and physically, there’s a change. That was fun to play around with.”\n\n–\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW’s season finale air Monday, February 23rd at 9 PM on Fox.

Like the polio vaccine scare in Nigeria. Or Aids denial in South Africa. Or, in this particular case, detecting bombs in Iraq, where the New York Times and the magician James Randi have uncovered a nonsense of truly epic proportions.\n\nA British company called ATSC is selling a device which can detect guns, ammunition, bombs, drugs, contraband ivory – and truffles. The ADE651 uses \"electrostatic magnetic ion attraction\" and can detect these things from a kilometre away, through walls, under the ground, under water or even from an aeroplane three miles overhead.\n\nATSC's device is handheld. You simply take a piece of plastic-coated cardboard for your chosen target, which has been through \"the proprietary process of electrostatic matching of the ionic charge and structure of the substance\", pop it into a holder connected to a wand and start detecting.\n\nThere are no batteries and no power source: you hold the device to \"charge\" it with the energy of your body. Then you walk with the wand at right angles to your body.\n\nIf there is a bomb on your left, the wand will drift to the left, and point at it. Like a dowsing rod.\n\nSimilar devices have been tested repeatedly and shown to perform no better than chance. No police force or security service anywhere in the developed world uses them. But, in 2008, the Iraqi interior ministry bought 800 ADE651s for $32m (£19m) and they've ordered a further shipment at $53m. These devices are being used at hundreds of checkpoints in Iraq to look for bombs.\n\nLast week two people working for the New York Times went through nine Iraqi police checkpoints which were using the device, and none found the rifles and ammunition they were carrying (with licences).\n\nMajor General Jehad al-Jabiri, of the Iraqi interior ministry, said: \"Whether it's magic or scientific, what I care about is it detects bombs.\"\n\nHow would you know? There are no independent tests of the ADE651 that I could find. The simplest explanation is that nobody could really be bothered. The magician James Randi can.\n\nFor many years, in an admirably expensive act of passive aggression, he has offered a $1m cheque to anyone who can provide proof of supernatural phenomena.\n\nLast year he invited the manufacturers of the ADE651 to come forward to see if the device works better than chance. They have not. I guess if you've trousered $85m, you don't care about The Amazing Randi's puny cheque.\n\nGeneral Jabiri challenged a New York Times reporter to test the ADE651, placing a grenade and a machine pistol in plain view in his office. Every time a policeman used it, the wand pointed at the explosives. Every time the reporter used the device, it failed to detect anything.\n\n\"You need more training,\" said the general.",

Roberts Jr. — filed Friday, Oct. 13, in Douglas County District Court and obtained Thursday by the Journal-World, following his capture — appear to reflect that the young Shawnee woman who died in the gunfire was, in fact, a bystander.\n\nRoberts is charged with one count of first-degree murder for killing 22-year-old Leah Brown, according to the charges. Charges allege he killed Brown during the “commission of, attempt to commit, or flight from” a dangerous felony: second-degree murder.\n\nIn the same complaint, Roberts also is charged with two counts of second-degree murder — one count each for killing Colwin Lynn Henderson, 20, and Tre’Mel Dupree Dean-Rayton, 24, both of Topeka.\n\nIn a fourth count, Roberts is charged with attempted second-degree murder for allegedly shooting Tahzay Rayton, 19, of Topeka, “twice.”\n\nThe deadly incident started with a physical altercation about 1:40 a.m. near the corner of 11th and Massachusetts streets, and escalated into a flurry of gunfire.\n\nPolice have said little else about the circumstances, other than that a crowd of up to 100 people was in the area and that they believe some people were targeted and innocent bystanders were “affected.”\n\nIn addition to the three people who died, two other men — Rayton and Royelle Hunt, 28, also of Topeka — received nonlife-threatening gunshot wounds.\n\nU.S. Marshals took Roberts into custody Wednesday in Kansas City, Mo., where he remained jailed Thursday afternoon.\n\nRoberts should soon be on his way to Lawrence, though.\n\nHe appeared before a Jackson County, Mo., judge Thursday morning and waived his right to extradition, according to Valerie Hartman, public information officer for Jackson County Circuit Court.\n\nIn doing so, Roberts freely agreed to return to Kansas to face the murder charges in Douglas County, according to his signed waiver of extradition.\n\nKansas statutes define first-degree murder as the killing of a human being committed “intentionally, and with premeditation” or — in the case of Roberts’ charge — “in the commission of, attempt to commit, or flight from any inherently dangerous felony.”\n\nSecond-degree murder is defined as killing someone “intentionally,” under the section Roberts is charged with.\n\nThe Douglas County DA’s office declined on Thursday to elaborate further on the choice of charges against Roberts.\n\nLawrence police also declined to elaborate. Officer Drew Fennelly said only, “We believe that they have been accurately charged.”\n\nThat’s in reference to Roberts and two other suspects arrested Monday in Topeka.\n\nAccording to their charges, also filed Friday, Oct. 13, and made public after their arrests:\n\n• Ahmad Rayton, 22, of Topeka, is charged with one count of attempted second-degree murder for allegedly shooting Hunt in the leg. He’s also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, following a conviction of aggravated assault. Both charges are felonies.\n\n• Dominique J. McMillon, 19, is charged with one count of aggravated assault, a felony, for threatening a person named Robert Wheeler with a gun, and one count of battery, a misdemeanor, for causing physical contact with Wheeler in a “rude, insulting or angry manner.”\n\nRayton and McMillon were jailed in Douglas County, Rayton on $1 million bond and McMillon on $25,000.\n\nEven with Roberts and two other co-defendants now in custody, Lawrence police say their case still is not closed.\n\nAs police have since early in their investigation, Fennelly on Thursday declined to answer whether there are more suspects not yet arrested. He said it would be premature to make a definitive statement on suspects.\n\n“We’re going to go where the investigation leads us,” Fennelly said. “The investigation is still ongoing. We’re still actively following every lead that we get.”\n\nFennelly said the department is still taking tips and wants to hear from anyone who was in the area.\n\n“We have not identified everyone that was out there,” Fennelly said. “We do want to identify as many people as possible who were at the scene when it occurred.”\n\nAnyone with information about the incident can call Lawrence police at 832-7509 or, to remain anonymous, Crime Stoppers of Lawrence and Douglas County at 843-TIPS (8477).",

Ron Hubbard's most notorious space opera is the religion of Scientology, which is packed with aliens and space battles and waves of invaders to our solar system. Hubbard even referred to the cosmological timeline behind Scientology as \"the space opera,\" and for good reason. It reads like a pretty damn trippy science fiction novel. For your edification, we've created a handy timeline (below) that compares the scientific history of the universe with the Scientology history of the universe. Who knew all that alien stuff was going on during the middle ages? And before the Big Bang?\n\nA few notes for the uninitiated. According to Scientology, \"Thetans\" are aliens whose spirits live within humans today. So Thetans are kind of like proto-humans. Also, within the Scientology time frame, the biggest incidents usually involve the Thetans being traumatized with \"implants\" or \"brainwashing\" from other aliens. So you'll see a lot of references to various brainwashing incidents here, including the invention of the Christianity Implant, which Hubbard believed was a very corrosive form of mind-control.

  "latent_16693": "I Tried Sling TV, and It Was Terrible\n\nPatrick White Blocked Unblock Follow Following Oct 9, 2016\n\nI’d like to think I’m one of those cord cutters the media keeps talking about. Of course, Comcast is the only high speed internet in my building, so it almost feels silly to say the cord is cut, but I’m doing my best.\n\nPart of that is lots of streaming services. I pay for both Hulu and Netflix, and on occasion will rent a movie from Xbox. However, come football season, I’m suddenly desperately missing live TV. For the past couple of years, I’ve bitten the bullet and paid for NFL streaming. This year, with Sling TV going big, I thought I’d see about a return to Live TV.\n\nAfter barely a month, let’s just say I’m unimpressed.\n\nTechnical Issues\n\nWow this is a terribly built product. Ok, that’s not fair, the UI is whatever. Is it silly that a company with over 10 years of experience building TV UIs didn’t include a real TV guide? Yes. Is it a deal breaker? No. But the actual video watching experience — I’ve never seen this bad of a streaming experience. I’d blame my internet if I didn’t have 3 other streaming services that consistently work fine.\n\nTo give them a very small amount of credit, this is a hard technical problem. But, it’s also a solved technical problem. There are literally entire platform offerings from Microsoft and Azure that help with distributing streaming video. Yet, for some reason, Sling TV is unable to consistently stream without either buffering or severe jumps.\n\nActually, I’d be ok with buffering — if all that happened was every 5 minutes there was some buffering, it’d be ok. Rather, it jumps. Watching something like football is impossible. You’ll be watching someone at the 20 yard line, there’ll be a jitter, then suddenly he’s dancing in the end zone. As I sit here writing this, I see the ball snapped to Tom Brady at their 30 yard line, a stuttering loading screen, and suddenly James White is on the ground at the 10 yard line. What the hell just happened? Not to mention, when it comes back, it’s heavily pixelated for at least 30 seconds.\n\nHere’s a little taste — I recorded about 90 seconds of streaming, this just happened to come through.\n\nAs long as you don’t actually want to watch the ending to any big plays, you’re good.\n\n100% unwatchable.\n\nI’ve also had about a 10% success rate watching over mobile. It almost doesn’t matter because of how bad the streaming experience is, but given that’s one of their main feature, I thought I’d mention it.\n\nAsshole Bundling is Alive and Well\n\nIf there’s something that got me off of cable, it was the ridiculous bundling. I don’t need 13 food related channels if all I want is Redzone and ESPN.\n\nI (very incorrectly) thought Sling would be the return of rational channel bundling. The first point where this burned me was trying to watch ESPN. To get the college football networks and the Red Zone, you need to buy the “Blue” package (with an addon). Of course, I assumed all sports related channels would be in that bundle, and I didn’t spend a lot of time thinking about it. How surprised was I when I come along on Thursday night and find out ESPN is in the “Orange” bundle. Second, I made sure NBC was in the bundle I paid for, and again assumed that would mean all the basic cable channels would be there. Nope. To get ESPN + Redzone, and most basic cable, you’re looking at $45 / month.\n\nThere were very legitimate reasons Comcast did their bundling — it’s sort of a social program for the less popular channels. But, it shows a fundamental misunderstanding on Sling’s part of the cord cutting movement. I don’t care if I’m paying Comcast or Direct TV for TV — I care that I’m not paying for a bunch of shit I don’t watch. Give me a $5 / month plan with ESPN and RedZone, and you’ve got my business.\n\nLive TV Sucks\n\nApologies for the simplistic reasoning, but I’d actually forgotten how much I hate live TV. Who in the world wants to wait for a specific time to watch something? I’ve primarily mentioned sports in this post because, try as I might, I never really watched anything else. I watched the Travel channel a bit, but forgot how much I hate commercials. I tried to watch the MacGyver reboot, but got home late the day it aired and missed it. I had genuinely forgotten how shitty this was, Hulu with 1 day after viewing is not only as good as this, but significantly better.\n\nTime to Cancel\n\nSuffice it to say, when the month is over I’m cancelling Sling. I’m not happy about it. I want new business models to be successful, I want the modality of Live TV to evolve. But, it’s not Sling that’s going to do it. Maybe we just wait for Netflix to just start streaming sports. That could happen…right?",
  "latent_17089": "By Alyssa McMurtry\n\nMADRID\n\nAhead of Spain’s second general election since December, recent polls suggest a new left-wing party – United Podemos – has overtaken the traditional left, increasing the possibility of a radical-led government.\n\nUnited Podemos is the product of a recent merger in Spain’s far left. It consists of the anti-austerity Podemos [We Can] party, which skyrocketed to success after the country’s financial crisis, plus the smaller United Left party – led by a self-declared communist.\n\nA recent poll by Metroscopia poll published on Saturday by El Pais claims United Podemos has now taken second place from the establishment Socialist Party (PSOE) but is still trailing behind Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s Popular Party.\n\nSpaniards will go to the polls again on June 26, three days after the U.K. referendum on leaving the European Union.\n\nThe last time Spain voted was in Dec. 2015, but the results produced a fragmented, minority government with the parties unable to form a functioning administration.\n\nLast time around, the Socialists came second and tried, but failed, to form a government. Rajoy’s Popular Party did not even attempt the task, seeing an impossible lack of support in parliament. Now, with the merger boosting support for the new party, it could be United Podemos' leader Pablo Iglesias’ turn to try to put an end to the political deadlock.\n\nChanging face of Spain's left\n\nPodemos was founded in 2014 and since its inception has been led by Iglesias, a ponytailed political science professor from Madrid.\n\nIt was born in the aftermath of the grassroots 15-M protests in 2011, in which protesters occupied Spanish plazas for months in response to growing inequality and harsh austerity measures.\n\nSpain has not been the same since the 2008 financial crisis swept in from the United States and ravaged the country’s economy.\n\nOverall unemployment rates shot from eight per cent in 2007 to as high as 27 percent by 2013. Since then, Spain’s economy has started to recover, but the latest figures from Spain’s Labor Ministry show unemployment is still above 20 per cent – the second highest in Europe after Greece.\n\nSince the crisis, inequality has increased considerably and 72 percent of Spaniards blame harsh austerity measures for the failing economy and growing inequality, according to a June poll conducted by Metroscopia.\n\nThe crisis, combined with widespread disillusionment with Spain’s two traditional parties, gave rise to a completely new political landscape. The traditional bipartisan system that has existed since Franco’s dictatorship ended in 1975 was shattered in the last election, with four parties closely splitting the vote.\n\nMore than a third of Spanish voters chose to move away from the traditional parties and vote for either Podemos or the newly-formed Ciudadanos [Citizens] party, which is politically in the center.\n\nPodemos’ merger with the United Left, founded in 1986 amid protests against NATO, has added much-needed votes to Podemos’ project and pushed the movement farther to the left. While uncommon in Podemos rallies, communist and republican flags abounded at the first United Podemos demonstration on June 1, according to Spanish media.\n\nUnited Podemos aims to boost social programs to improve the situation of Spain’s poorest. Thirteen million are at risk of poverty in Spain, according to the National Statistics Institute. In order to do this, the new party has proposed renegotiating debt conditions with the European Union and to raise income tax on Spain’s wealthiest.\n\nPodemos has always been an ally of Syriza in Greece, but “luckily, Spain isn’t Greece,” Iglesias told Spanish daily La Razon in May, before mentioning the fact that Spain has the Eurozone’s fourth-largest economy.\n\nDemocratic ‘camouflage’\n\nThe possibility of a radical-left government, fronted by “ponytails” (a disparaging nickname for Iglesias), has caused alarm among Spain’s conservatives. Political opponents fear a situation similar to Greece and are quick to link Podemos to leftist dictatorships in Latin America.\n\n\"Podemos represents a left-wing totalitarian project whose consequences, I think, any citizen can see with what's happening at the moment in Venezuela,” said Ignacio Cosido, director of Spain’s National Police, during an interview on 13TV in May.\n\nSusana Diaz, Socialist president of Andalusia called Podemos “the biggest camouflage operation” in Spain’s recent history, pointing to the undemocratic tendencies of left-wing communists, at a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nSpanish politicians also accuse Podemos of admiring former Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez and of being financed by the oil-rich South American state.\n\nVenezuela’s situation has been deteriorating under the left, with the country suffering “brutal repression”, a lack of food and medicine and high crime rates, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nAlbert Rivera, leader of the fourth-place Ciudadanos party, went to Venezuela on the campaign trail and came back accusing Podemos of supporting the regime there and of not cooperating to help free Venezuelan political prisoners.\n\n“Some people understand that talking about Venezuela is a question that benefits them politically,” Iglesias, 37, said to the leader of Ciudadanos, Albert Rivera, 36, in a tense one-on-one debate that aired Sunday on La Sexta. Prior to December’s elections, the two fresh-faced candidates had an unexpectedly cordial conversation on the same network, but the friction of the last six months has notably embittered their relationship.\n\nLittle change since December elections\n\nBeyond the rise of United Podemos, polls suggest that little else has changed since December’s inconclusive elections. If history does come close to repeating itself, the majority of the votes will be split between four parties which were unable to form a government the last time around.\n\nNo party except the centrist Ciudadanos is currently willing to support Rajoy’s Popular Party, which polls predict will win another minority. Still, that is not likely to produce enough seats to govern.\n\nThe traditional foes of the Popular Party, the Socialists, want to form a progressive coalition between Ciudadanos and Podemos. That is what they tried to do after December’s elections but the proposal was turned down by Podemos, which rejects Ciudadanos’ neoliberal economic policies.\n\nIf United Podemos comes in second, perhaps the most tempting offer for them would be joining with the Socialists and smaller separatist parties. Still, this is a long shot for the new group.\n\nA similar agreement could have been made after December’s elections, but was not accepted by the Socialists, whose base is largely against independence movements. However, if United Podemos surges into second place, an anti-austerity government fronted by Iglesias is considerably more likely.\n\nOn Monday and for the first time in Spain´s democratic history, the four major parties will face off in a televised electoral debate. Before the last elections, Rajoy refused to debate Podemos or Ciudadanos in public and only debated his traditional Socialist rival.\n\nThis time around, even Rajoy has given into the new reality of Spanish politics—that the two traditional parties are no longer in control.",

Cryptic […]\n\nOne of the biggest jokes politics plays on itself is “secrecy” – secret internal polling that apparently makes public polling wrong, secret campaign tactics that relegate Sun Tzu to the status of mere amateur, through to other various secret and supposedly profound insights into the electorate that are beyond the comprehension of normal mortals. Cryptic snippets of these Holy Grails of political knowledge find their way into the public space through deliberate leaks to the media, generally whispered by various political folks that either seemingly enjoy the ego inflation that comes along with being “holders of the secret information”, or believe that the stories generated from them actually make a rats arse of difference with the electorate.\n\nThe actual reality of this “secret information” is usually a fairly different story altogether, with 95% of it being pretty banal and ordinary – and that’s when the stuff that makes its way to the public space isn’t completely fabricated to begin with.\n\nBut hacks with delusions of being Bruno Gianelli will continue being so, and this sort of nonsense won’t disappear any time soon.\n\nSo lets kick the door down on the secrecy and see how a modern campaign actually runs – the research involved, the technology, the analysis, the logistics of the ground game and the capabilities that get brought to the table when all of these things become integrated. Let’s look at the anatomy of a modern campaign – not just any campaign, but one of the more sophisticated campaigns ever run and one that is happening in Queensland right now.\n\nSome of the details involved here will surprise a lot of people, scare the bejesus out of others and demonstrate that there’s a lot of pontificating has-beens around the joint whose understanding of modern politics is pretty redundant and irrelevant.\n\nFirst – a brief partisan backgrounder (feel free to skip it if your conservative sensibilities are feeling particularly delicate at the moment). When the Newman Government came to power in Queensland – off the back of making a set of campaign promises to the Qld public sector and wider Qld public on public services – they quickly set about breaking them. They sacked 14,000 public servants when they promised otherwise (costing themselves around $300 million more than they needed to, while ending up with a larger public service than they would have had if they simply sat around with their thumb up their rectum and did nothing). They’ve started attacking the delivery of a wide range of public services based on similar levels of competence demonstrated with their public sector “reform”, and have generally acted like a bunch of arrogant fools defined by their gross ignorance and public policy ineptness.\n\nEnter stage far-right Peter Costello. The Newman Government, with delusions of grandeur stemming from their enormous victory, hired Costello to produce an alleged audit report that would provide a blue-print for the government’s policy direction over the next term (or five terms if you listened to some of the hubris coming out of them). Costello’s report basically recommends privatising everything the Qld government owns and outsourcing everything it doesn’t where possible – a sort of ideological wet dream that makes Kennett’s Victoria appear as a bastion of socialist endeavour..\n\nUnfortunately for the government, the people of Qld have other ideas about that.\n\nSo Newman has promised that there will be no privatisation without a mandate from the Qld people at the next election (an election at some unspecified time) in an effort to curtail the backlash. While the summary report was released a while ago, the full report is due to be unveiled publically some time during the next few weeks.\n\nWhich brings us to today. A government with little public policy experience and a (albeit brief) history of general incompetence in the area, about to receive the centrepiece of its first term policy agenda that recommends undertaking the largest privatisation and outsourcing program in Australian history, but one that can only be fully achieved with a fresh mandate from the Qld people via a new election.\n\nThen there’s us (my employer) – Qld’s public sector union – and our campaign.\n\nFrom the very beginning – and this is going back to well before the last Qld election – we discussed what may or may not happen with the next government and the resources and capabilities we may or may not need. A fair bit of what you could describe as casual wargaming was had, and various capabilities were built up or continued to be built up that could be utilised or redeployed as necessary – particularly on the non-industrial side (the community campaigning and advocacy side). We also started to devise a fairly significant research program.\n\nSo we came into this with existing capabilities and knowledge – which is a fundamentally important, but often unappreciated component of any campaigning apparatus.\n\nLet’s jump ahead to the beginning of this year. We knew what Newman was doing, we knew what he was preparing, we also knew that powerful parts of the LNP were starting to push the idea of an early election – so we flicked the switch to “on”.\n\nYou cannot manage what you do not know\n\nIt’s not 2001 anymore. It’s not 1992. It’s certainly not 1985\n\nYou simply cannot manage what you do not know.\n\nWe knew from existing research that the Qld public was opposed – vehemently opposed – to the privatisation and outsourcing of public services. More so than any other state.\n\nBut was that opposition homogenous? If not, where was it strongest and weakest by geography, by demographic cohort, by political cohort – and what were the spreads involved?\n\nWhat was the strength of that opposition? How much was passive and how much was active opposition – as in how much was it a generically passive “Nah – I don’t like it” type thing compared to how much was more akin to “I’m storming the fucking barricades if you try that one on mate!” type opposition?\n\nWhat was the relationship between privatisation and voting intention? How much was one going to drive the other? How much did it now? How much could it? What were the sensitivity thresholds involved? What was the distribution of the dynamics of those issue/voting intention relationships across the major demographic, social, cultural and electoral cohorts?\n\nWe found out.\n\nTo do so took the largest single polling and research program in Australian history.\n\nDual use Robocalling\n\nAfter the summary of the Costello report was released and the media had spread around the message of its contents for a week, we launched the first phase of a two phase research program, but one that could be harnessed for a second use – canvassing and campaign recruitment. The timing was also important, as the government was just about to start considering the contents of the report. We wanted the electorates to give some pretty solid feedback immediately before their local LNP members went into the consideration phase. Suffice to say that was successful.\n\nWe knew Megapoll was coming (more on that later) which would provide a massive amount of statistically accurate data on opinion, yet we also knew the statistics involved with ringing random Qld households i.e. if you ring 10,000 random households and someone picks up the phone, we know what percent will be men, what percent will be women and what percent of each of those will have what ages as a series of probability distributions.\n\nSo we bombarded strategic electorates (at first) with robocalls using ReachTEL (The Peoples Pollster) that were unweighted. We didn’t need the results to contain any demographic information that enables it to be weighted as all orthodox polls are, as we could deal with that at the end with some clever maths, to derive real world estimates that were within acceptable error parameters for us with this part of the research program (which saved money, increased completion rates and delivered more calls).\n\nThe dual-use robocalling was a simple message and question combination that went (with slight rewording each day to account for what day the calls were made on):\n\nThis is a message from Together. On Monday, the Queensland state government is considering a report which recommends the privatisation of public services including health and hospitals, disability services, child protection, corrective services and schools. It means these public services could be handed to large corporations to run\n\nDo you support or oppose the privatisation of these public services?\n\nPeople heard the message, which was important in and of itself, but for those that answered “Oppose”, a follow up question was asked:\n\nWould you be willing to be contacted to join a community campaign to stop the privatisation of these public services?\n\nThe people that answered “YES” to this then had their numbers recorded. We are one of the few unions with our own dedicated outbound call centre, so we then used our call centre to contact these new recruits and bring them into the community campaign we were planning.\n\nIt turned out to be so successful that we continued to run it for the next week across every LNP held electorate in Qld, hitting over 130,000 people with the full message, getting over 50,000 household responses and garnering over 10,000 contacts of which about 75% were in places and electorates that were “campaign viable”.\n\nOn the research side, we then broke those results down by electorate and used a big regression/simulation analysis (combined with Megapoll and recruit data) to find the passive/active spread of opposition to generic privatisation for each electorate.\n\nFrom this, we not only added thousands and thousands of new recruits to our community campaign from demographic cohorts and occupational backgrounds and electorates that generally never join anything, but we also know the passive/active split of opposition in each electorate – so we know what proportion of people are passively opposed (those that simply don’t like it) compared to those that are actively opposed (those that don’t like it and are willing to participate in activities in order to do something about it) in every LNP held seat in Qld. This is one of the few pieces of data (one of only three in fact) from our mountains of data that we will keep secret – such is its high value. Suffice to say that some electorates have active opposition rates well over 20% of the population – which is just extraordinary in historical terms. That means over 1 in 5 people in those electorate are so pissed off with the idea of privatising public services that they are willing to actively participate in stopping it. We also know that it never drops below 7% in any electorate, including those on the Gold Coast which are notorious for not giving a shit about politics.\n\nMegapoll\n\nPhase two of the research program was undertaking the largest proper political poll in Australian history with a sample of over 36,000. We polled Qld at the electorate level, for every electorate, with a series of questions and demographic information. You can read all about the Megapoll results here – it’s the state level results with links to the micro-regional breakdowns (groups of seats between 3 and 8 in number). I’ve also got it in a condensed version here. The seat level data as a whole is the second piece of data we’ll keep to ourselves, though we’re releasing a lot of it to various local media outlets so they can get a handle on the views of their local communities. The demographic cross-tabs contains extraordinarily valuable information not only for the campaign, but our broader analysis and continuing research.\n\nYou cannot manage what you do not know?\n\nWe now “know”.\n\nBetween the Dual-Use Robocalling program, Megapoll and our other research, we can now answer every single one of the questions under the “You cannot manage what you do not know” heading above. Every. Single. One.\n\nBefore we get onto some juicy bits about how this works in practice, it’s worth noting about now that among the lesser political commentariat – the types of dismal people that make a partial living providing the elevator music of political commentary – we were accused of push polling.\n\nThis accusation mostly comes from various drones that couldn’t comprehend why one might need such a large poll, or folks thought Megapoll was actually the dual use robocalling, but were too dim to understand either program, or too lazy to even bother asking someone to find out (we’re hard to find apparently!) before pontificating on matters they know not an ounce of shit about.\n\nWell, except for Lawrence Springborg who has made the allegation on a number of occasions, but he appears to be perpetually confused, so we’d really expect no less from him.\n\nPush polling, by the way, is a bit of a myth in Australia (as it is in most parts of the world) – and it doesn’t mean what most people think it does. What happened to John McCain in South Carolina is push polling . Seeing a poll you don’t like the wording of, or don’t understand the purpose of, isn’t.\n\nMeanwhile, this isn’t the only data we have. One of things that all Federal members have access to (which basically means every semi-advanced level political hack in the country has access to as well) – is a statistical estimate of the breakdown of the most recent election not just by booths, but booth catchments (areas around a booth that catch where people that vote in each booth live), which are then broken down further into census level blocks at the Census Collection District level (and now moving to what’s called the SA1 level that replaced them in the 2011 Census). It’s provided by the Parliamentary Library via work produced by the AEC, that they undertake primarily for reasons of electoral redistribution processes and analysis. Basically it anchors the booths people vote at to their home addresses, aggregated into CCDs. That might not sound like much, but it’s actually an extraordinarily useful piece of information.\n\nThe third piece of data that we keep secret and not for public release, is that we’ve built a very similar thing, but at the Qld state level for Qld state electoral data by combining a massive amount of AEC, ECQ, census data, polling data and about half a dozen other datasets into a large model – what separates it from the norm is that it focuses on the probabilities of vote estimates over the simple “estimated” variety . That lets us deal with uncertainty in a much more sophisticated way. As far as I know, we’re the only mob to have such a thing in Qld that is not a complete dogs breakfast .\n\nWe have two layers of this data – the original 2012 State election data at SA1 level or combinations of SA1 level data, and a second layer of the data which is dynamic and evolves according to our ongoing polling research. Because we can measure which demographics are shifting in what seats, across large inter-temporal samples, we can project estimates of the changes of this data into the SA1 level booth catchments (but more importantly, project them as probability distributions of the vote) that aggregate up across cohorts and geographies to equal the seat wide level data results – something you can’t even begin to do unless you undertake the type of programs we’ve undertaken. Which, it should be noted, no one else in the country ever has.\n\nMany people stuck in the 1980s questioned why we undertook such large samples – this is a key part of the answer.\n\nThis lets us know where the weaknesses are in every electorate for every sitting member, not only in terms of the most recent election result (telling us where swing voters actually live – because you can compare the election result before last at this level, to the most recent election result at this level – all down to areas between about 10 to 40 street blocks in resolution), but also how those swing voters are currently behaving by utilising the current dynamically projected estimates and attached probabilities to find new areas of weakness, or recognise areas that have slipped out of our cohort targeting window.\n\nIf you’re running a community based campaign ground game, an increase of just 10% or 20% efficiency in targeting the right people with the right message at the right time is a massive difference. If we increase our targeting efficiency by just 400%, it will be a disappointment.\n\nThat’s where this matters.\n\nBefore we get to some examples of how it all comes together, we also have our campaign recruitment. Currently we have about 35,000 people involved with our community campaign apparatus called Working For Queenslanders (Feel free to join!)\n\nYet having volunteers to campaign is not enough – you need organisation to make it all work. It’s all very good and well getting volunteers to go to some place to do some particular thing, but unless there’s also people on the ground to guide it, that are able to deal with the complexities that often arise and can enable the whole exercise to work – well, you’re really just a clusterfuck waiting to happen.\n\nWe already have a substantial number of people in Working For Queenslanders with training and organising capabilities, but we also have an enormous in-house training capability which we’ve developed over many years. One of our biggest strengths as a union is our campaign training capability – we often train third party groups. Our folks tell me we can easily train over 1000 people a month at the drop of a hat, more if we had to.\n\nThis is all without having pressed the button on any major recruiting program of our own 40,000 odd members for the campaign yet (many of which already have training that can be deployed instantly, are highly intelligent and, let it be said, are completely pissed off with the government).\n\nAnd this is just us *so far*. It doesn’t include the members or resources of any of the unions we regularly campaign with like, say, United Voice, let alone the wider labour movement in Qld.\n\nThat sort of gives you an idea of the numbers involved here and the information and analytical capabilities that make up a modern campaign.\n\nNow, it’s all good and well “knowing” about these things and having built up a campaign volunteer base, a structure and an organisational capability to enable it from top to bottom – but what does it mean in terms of doing? Info without action is just a spreadsheet.\n\nLet’s take a hypothetical, integrated example – but instead of using the State level booth catchment data broken down into the SA1 census level or its current projections (because that’s one of our 3 actual secret pieces of info), we’ll use the Federal equivalent. So the voting data here is 2010 Federal election data (broken down into the old SA1 equivalent called CCD level), and we’ll use some 2011 Census data too – simply to show how it all comes together.\n\nAnd we’ll use the seat of Moreton, in the southern area of Brisbane to keep it relevant.\n\nLet’s say the government launched a policy that materially affected the welfare of families with dependent children in such a way that the more dependent children a family had, the larger the overall deleterious effect on the household’s finances and general well being. To keep it visually simple, we’ll just use Moreton as an example here, but it’s infinitely scalable in real time, so this can happen across every part of every electorate we happen to want to target.\n\nHere’s just a corner of the Moreton electorate and the booth results of the 2010 election. Blue booths are where the Coalition won a two party preferred majority, red booths are where the ALP won a two party preferred majority:\n\nNow let’s say we’re only targeting swing voter areas, but with an initial focus on LNP leaning swing voter areas (where the message would be more persuasion driven) as we would have a separate program for ALP leaning swing voters (where the message would be more reinforcement driven). So let’s add the CCD level booth catchment breakdowns for these swing voter areas held by the LNP on margins of 4% or less.\n\nThe blue shaded regions are the areas where the estimated ALP two party preferred vote sits between 46% and 50%. Now let’s overlay the census data, where the proportion of the population that are dependent children is 30% or higher (showing us areas where there are large numbers of dependent children for the average family)\n\nThe hatched areas which sit on top of the blue areas would be the locations which produce the most efficient hit rate for the swing voter/dependent children target matrix. Also remember that we could widen or tighten our targeting specificity at whim here – this is just an example.\n\nSo next we’d overlay the addresses of our campaigners over the top of that map (we’d have a couple of hundred campaigners in the maps shown). We’d then use email and robocalling to contact those campaigners that live either within or next to those targeted areas to ask if they’d be willing to do mail drops into their local neighbourhoods. Those that accept would receive the material with a map of their drop target.\n\nTotal turnaround time between policy announcement and customised material hitting the homes of targeted cohorts? Between 18 and 36 hours.\n\nWith the key point being nearly all of this is automated and where the number of seats we can cover is only limited by the amount of material we can print. We have a lot of printers.\n\nNow imagine each targeted seat having a number of these neighbourhood based campaign programs happening every week, on multiple issues, in real time as they arise. And not just with previous election data like what is above, but using the current dynamic voting data. And that’s on top of our other activities.\n\n“What sort of activities” I hear you ask?\n\nWell this sort of thing doesn’t just apply to mail drops, but also to the important yet often forgotten area of face to face voter contact. We not only know where to send campaigners to door knock, but who to send, to deliver what messages (often according to who answers the door – male, female, age, with/without dependent children etc), on which particular areas of privatisation that resonate the most when it comes to voting intention of that particular person.\n\nYet our campaigners aren’t only campaigners, they’re also an enormous local intelligence network.\n\nFor example, let’s say a local LNP member in a targeted seat sets up for a community stall somewhere to meet and greet their constituents. A general Saturday morning political institution in the suburbs across Australia.\n\nWe’ll know about it within minutes.\n\nWe’ll email and robocall every campaigner within 5 km of that LNP Member’s stall and within 20 minutes of finding out, have a line of local constituents 20 deep asking them important and uncomfortable questions, pretty much all day.\n\nWithin an hour, we’ll have an anti-privatisation stall set up right next to them. Stalls that are set up in areas where local residents have high opposition rates to privatisation and exhibit (through our polling) a high coefficient for privatisation issues on their voting intention – i.e. privatisation has a high vote driving effect – then the larger those stalls will be and the more material and human resources will be put into them.\n\nYet we not only have to react, we can take the campaign to MPs. For example, let’s say an MP says something about the privatisation of aged care. They can expect to see a bus full of ladies over 70 years of age drawn from the local community, occupying the MPs office and having a rollicking good time in the process until the Member answers their questions. Unlike most campaigns, we have a large number of older Australians wanting to be politically active over this – often for the first time in their lives. They’d be pretty keen to get on TV.\n\nThese are just a few simple examples of what are really an almost infinite number of campaigning options that utilise the full spectrum of information we have – we already have a formidable list drawn up that’s being added to every day, some simple, some complex, some tactical and some strategic. Now that “we know”, the things we can and will do are not just much larger in scope, but also more efficient and focused and much more sophisticated.\n\nWe know who to target, where, why, with what message based on their demographics, their geography, using which specific areas of the privatisation of public services that are most salient and relevant to their lives, at the local community level, delivered by their neighbours, by their friends and by their families across all of Qld.\n\nBut most importantly, at the very center of it all will be local constituents, campaigning locally, defending what is a *super majority* of Queensland public opinion.\n\nOn the more strategic side, our research program has also allowed us to identify those seats where our campaign can make the difference between the seat remaining LNP or moving to anyone else.\n\nPutting large amounts of resources into seats that will fall anyway would be a waste. Instead, we’ll be hunting up the pendulum – sometimes so far up the pendulum you need to take a packed lunch – because those are the seats that the research suggests can be moved. We’re not sure how many we’ll target yet – that call will be made soon enough – but it’ll likely be somewhere between 20 and 40.\n\nThis is just the ground game aspect of the campaign. There’s also the usual advertising, focus groups, comms research, media stuff, online etc etc. The bits and pieces that every campaign has.\n\nHowever, the thing every campaign doesn’t have is a formidable, research intensive, community level ground game consisting of tens of thousands of active local participants.\n\nEssentially we’re just applying the best of the resources of the early 21st century, to early 20th century community organising. But what that actually requires under the bonnet is a level of political information and analytics that’s never really been needed by a campaign before, so that it can be transformed into the knowledge required to enable the people with the real skills – our union campaign folks and our organisers – to achieve magnitudes of order more than they ordinarily could do without it.\n\nWe might be the first organisation to do this in Australia – but we’ll only be the first.\n\nWhile that’s pretty exciting in many ways, the downside is that the political knowledge gap between the public (including political observers) and key parts of the political system will grow even further apart.\n\nAnd that is probably not a very good thing at all. So this is our contribution to prevent that very thing from happening as best we can – the anatomy of a modern campaign.\n\n(Visited 384 times, 1 visits today)",
  "latent_17167": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top Senate Democrat on Tuesday called for scrapping a tax reform model of lowering tax rates for all Americans that has been the rule since Ronald Reagan was president, and instead said the rich should pay more to help pare federal deficits.\n\nU.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) addresses the second session of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina September 5, 2012. REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nWith less than a month before presidential elections where taxes have been among the most hotly debated issues, Senator Charles Schumer, the third most senior Democrat in the Senate, sought to redouble Democrats’ stance that top rates for the wealthy should rise when they expire on December 31.\n\nIn a bit of tax policy blasphemy, Schumer said the approach to taxes that has held since last major overhaul in the 1980s was outdated and would hurt inevitably the middle-class who would lose valuable tax breaks.\n\nHe also criticized a deficit reduction plan known as Simpson-Bowles for taking the same approach.\n\nBoth President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, say the tax code is broken and needs a major overhaul. The last time that occurred was 1986, when Reagan worked with a divided Congress to lower rates for all Americans and cut loopholes and deductions.\n\n“But a 1986-style approach that promises upfront rate cuts to the wealthy is almost guaranteed to give middle-income earners the short end of the stick,” Schumer said in remarks prepared for delivery in a speech at the National Press Club.\n\nIn exchange, Schumer said, Democrats should be prepared to make hard choices about revamping so-called entitlement programs such as Medicare, the health plan for the elderly.\n\nRepublicans favor major changes to these programs, including raising the age when benefits kick in, to curb deficits. Schumer, in excerpts released before his speech, did not specify policies in this area.\n\nAcross-the-board tax increases of about $500 billion loom at the end of the year if Congress fails to take action preventing low tax rates from expiring.\n\nThat threat and about $100 billion in automatic federal spending cuts comprise the so-called “fiscal cliff” that could push the U.S. economy into a recession if Congress fails to act, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated.\n\nWith Congress out of town until the November 6 elections, actions to address these threats are on hold, giving lawmakers just about a month to deal with the major fiscal challenge.",
  "latent_17219": "Eyes Wide Open? | Peer to Peer Review\n\nAsk a librarian how many books she has in her collection, and you will usually get a pretty accurate answer. But ask where those books were printed, and you will get a confused look. Notice I said printed, not published. Our catalog records contain place of publication, but that is not the same as place of printing. Most publishers have their books printed in different places, and even in other countries, from where their offices are located. And up until now, that has not been information that libraries have needed to know. So what has changed? A court case out of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held recently that the “doctrine of first sale,” which is the part of the copyright law that allows libraries to lend the materials they purchase, applies only to works that are manufactured in the United States. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case during its next term, and the decision they make could have a profound effect on the future of libraries. First sale is a principle that says that a consumer (all of us, not just libraries) can dispose of the particular copy they buy of a copyrighted work however they see fit. Another way to say it is that the exclusive right of distributing a copyrighted work ends (or is “exhausted”) after the first authorized sale. First sale allows libraries to lend books, Netflix to rent DVDs, and all sorts of people to sell secondhand books, films, and recordings. Publishers do not like this last point, and they especially dislike the second-hand textbook market because it diminishes their sales of new textbooks. On the other hand, that market can be the only thing that makes an education possible for some students. The particular case arose from a rather clever exploitation of the textbook market by a Thai graduate student in the U.S. named Supap Kirtsaeng, who asked his relatives to purchase some of the less expensive editions of common textbooks sold overseas and ship them to him. He then resold the books in the U.S. and made enough profit to finance his education. There seems to be some disagreement about how much money he made this way, but his profit was substantial. Publisher John Wiley sued Mr. Kirtsaeng and succeeded in convincing the trial court and the Second Circuit that the U.S. first sale should not apply to any materials made overseas. Other circuit courts have held differently, so the Supreme Court took the case to reconcile the conflict. In July, the Library Copyright Alliance filed a “Friend of the Court” brief with the Supreme Court, supporting Mr. Kirtsaeng, and asking the Court to hold that the key phrase from the first sale provision, “lawfully made under this title,” should be understood to mean thatcopy made and initially sold with the authorization of the rights holder should be subject to this exhaustion of the distribution right in the U.S., regardless of where it is made or first sold. To hold otherwise would create the anomalous situation where a rights holder who manufactures their works abroad actually would have more rights under U.S. copyright than those who print in the U.S. The LCA brief is worth reading for two reasons. First, it is a salutary reminder of how important libraries have always been to the democratic system in the United States. Second, it begins to give us a glimpse of how bad the unintended consequences could be if the Supreme Court upholds the lower court ruling. As the LCA makes clear, it is virtually impossible to know where individual books were “made.” The phenomenon of off-shore printing in order to take advantage of lower labor costs has been growing for years, so simply buying a book from a U.S. publisher does not mean it was “made in the U.S.A.” If the Supreme Court finds in favor of John Wiley, it could mark a transition to “public lending licenses” or other differential pricing of books sold to libraries. It could also shut down the used-book and secondhand textbook markets. But those would just be the anticipated consequences, those expected and desired by the plaintiffs. Unintended consequences could be even more far-reaching. Museums are worried that they will not be able to display works of contemporary art from other countries. And your car, to pick just one example, probably contains copyrightable software, which could allow automobile manufacturers to take exclusive control of the used car market. Without really meaning to, it seems, the Second Circuit has raised the possibility of allowing copyright law to become the vehicle for a radical restructuring of the consumer economy in the U.S. Indeed this story is almost entirely a saga of unintended consequences. If we read the multiple sections of the copyright law that the Second Circuit interpreted in their reading of the first sale doctrine, it is clear that they can support the very restrictive interpretation given to them by that court, but also that they were never intended to interact in that way. Congress could not have imagined or intended the reading that now prevails in the Second Circuit. Why not? Because when the first sale doctrine was developed – it has its origins in another Supreme Court case, from 1908 – no one expected that copyright protection in the U.S. would extend automatically to any work created (nearly) anywhere in the world. We were copyright isolationists for much of our history; we radically restructured our law when we joined the Berne Convention in 1988, and this quirk being exploited by John Wiley is a leftover anomaly. So now we must anxiously wait to see if the Court will repair this potentially sweeping problem, or if they will focus on the specific circumstances of Kirtsaeng’s behavior and ignore the potential consequences of the ruling. When the Supreme Court ruled on the Affordable Care Act this spring, their decision had long-term consequences for how we read both the Commerce Clause and the Tax and Spending clause of the U.S. Constitution. By and large, the Court seems to have been aware of the impact of their decision and to have made their ruling with their eyes clearly fixed on the legal and political consequences of their position. With Wiley v. Kirtsaeng, however, there is a real danger that the Court could be unaware of the far-reaching consequences that might result from an imprudent decision. As we often do, the library community has cause to be grateful to the Library Copyright Alliance for pointing out to the Court that libraries are one of the foundations of a democratic society and deserve to be protected by the Court from a variety of unpleasant outcomes, both expected and unanticipated.",

Then LongNails the wanderer[1] went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said to the Blessed One, \"Master Gotama, I am of the view, of the opinion, that 'All is not pleasing to me.'\"\n\n\"But even this view of yours, Aggivessana — 'All is not pleasing to me' — is even that not pleasing to you?'\"\n\n\"Even if this view of mine were pleasing to me, Master Gotama, it would still be the same, it would still be the same.\"\n\n\"Well, Aggivessana, there are more than many in the world who say, 'It would still be the same, it would still be the same,' yet they both do not abandon that view and they cling to another view.

In one who envisions the body as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a disintegration, an emptiness, not-self, any desire for the body, attraction to the body, following after the body is abandoned.\n\n\"There are these three kinds of feeling: a pleasant feeling, a painful feeling, and neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling.

Sariputta was reflecting thus, his mind was released from fermentations through not-clinging.

Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life.\"[5]",
  "latent_17300": "My name is Matt Sommerfield and I am the owner of MTS Ventures, a product design, development, and manufacturing firm in Allentown, PA. I’d like to introduce a product we developed called the Smart Power Base to power your Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Netduino, or Beagle Bone projects.\n\nSmart Power Base\n\nThe Smart Power Base is a rechargeable lithium ion battery pack that delivers a regulated 5VDC capable of 1A of current that can be recharged hundreds of times. The pack offers higher capacity and higher current than other development board products and will work with Audrino, Netduino, Raspberry Pi, and Beagle Bone devices with connected devices. This is plenty of power to keep your projects running untethered for many hours depending on the board and load. This is a purpose designed solution with properly spaced tapped mounting holes to securely attach your development board and keep the two devices mechanically connected. Even when not powering your project, leave it attached. It has a nice weight to it and a rubber, non-slip base and is a great way to keep your project in place. The Smart Power Base also comes with a short micro USB cord for Beagle Bone, Raspberry Pi, and Netduino and a short USB B connector for Ardrino to help keep cable clutter to a minimum. To recharge the Smart Power Base, use one of the included cables with any USB power supply you already have.\n\nThe idea started after I prototyped a specialized enclosure for an Arduino driven animated toy for a client I met during a Startup Weekend event. After the assembly was completed, I needed a way to power the device to test the connections before the client arrived but lacked a proper power source. I had an idea to use a power pack for my smart phone. I hooked it up and it worked great which got me thinking that the power packs we had intended for smart phone accessories with a few smart tweaks may work great for the hobbyist market as well.\n\nMake Lehigh Valley\n\nWithin our office building, we have a hacker space with lots of impassioned individuals working on a variety of projects and asked them to test out this power pack with their projects. The idea was well received, and after testing the performance, they were even more impressed. They noted 2 to 4 times additional run time of some of their high current draw applications as compared to a minty boost with 4 high capacity rechargeable AA batteries.\n\nI came up with lots of ideas of how the battery could be better integrated to a user’s project and wanted it to be compatible whether Arduino, Beagle Bone, Netduino, or Raspberry Pi. My first thought was to use the common shield format, but quickly recognized one of the problems with using the boards is that they are quite light and slide around on vulnerable connection points. It would be preferable to have the board attached to the bottom rather than a shield. The members of Make Lehigh Valley also noted that the weight and non-slip surface of the power base gave the boards stability while affording clear access to all the connections.\n\nNon-slip Bottom Surface\n\nAt this point, the design is ready to go into production and I’m launching the power base to the Kickstarter community as I feel that many others in the maker community would find interest in this product. The project funding will be used to make some machining fixtures suitable for production and satisfy minimum material buy requirements. If successfully funded, we’d make our initial production run and ship to our supporters within 30 days of the project closing. I would love to see strong interest so we can offer the Smart Power Base long term and establish distribution.\n\nI thank you for looking at our product and would be honored for your support and belief in our idea.\n\nIncluded Cables and Hardware\n\nRaspberry Pi Mounted on Non-Slip Smart Power Base\n\nArduino Uno Mounted on Non-Slip Smart Power Base\n\nTech Specs:\n\nDimensions: 107mm x 58mm x 14 mm\n\nNet Weight: 140g\n\nCapacity: 2900 mAh\n\nBattery Type: Lithium Ion\n\nInput: DC5V/1A\n\nOutput: DC5V/1A\n\nLife: 500 full charge/discharge cycles\n\nWarranty: 1 year\n\nHole Pattern: Compatible with Raspberry Pi (Rev 1 and Rev 2), Arduino (Uno, Mega, Duo, Ethernet), Netduino (1, 1 plus, 2, 2 plus), and Beagle Bone\n\nIncluded Hardware: 4 pcs each 4-40 x 3/8\" screws and nylon spacers\n\nIncluded Cables: 1 each USB A to micro USB, 110 mm long; USB A to micro USB, 1m long; and USB A to USB B, 150mm long",

We describe significant developments in how the Act was implemented and find that despite severe criticism, the Act and institutions it created have survived almost intact since enactment. We report survey findings from informed parties that suggest that the Act has produced financial reporting benefits. While the direct costs of the Act were substantial and fell disproportionately on smaller companies, costs have fallen over time and in response to changes in its implementation. Research about indirect costs such as loss of risk taking in the U.S. is inconclusive. The evidence for and social welfare implications of claimed effects such as fewer IPOs or loss of foreign listings are unclear. Financial reporting quality appears to have gone up after SOX but research on causal attribution is weak. On balance, research on the Act's net social welfare remains inconclusive. We end by outlining challenges facing research in this area, and propose an agenda for better modeling costs and benefits of financial regulation.",

Now many people have lost their jobs or seen their pay and savings eroded by inflation. The government, too, is having a difficult time. Oil revenues have dwindled and allies around the region are wobbling. Is relief in sight?\n\nAfter nine months of nuclear talks in Geneva, the broad outlines of a possible deal with the West are becoming clear. The aim is to ensure that Iran would need about a year to build a bomb, giving the West plenty of advance warning. To achieve that, the two sides are talking about limiting Iran’s enrichment of uranium to 5% for the next decade or so, and putting the plutonium programme at Arak to irreversibly civilian use. All this would be monitored closely by international inspectors, but without forcing Iran to acknowledge past weapons tests in any detail. In return, Iran could expect a rolling (though reversible) lifting of sanctions over several years.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nAccording to one Western official involved in the negotiations, “technical issues are not the main problem.” The tough part is convincing the respective elites back home to accept the deal that is on the table. The real negotiations arguably take place in Tehran and Washington, not Geneva. A majority of American congressmen seem reluctant to approve anything negotiated by the White House, even if their own generals say it is in America’s national interest. Mr Rohani, for his part, faces pushback from conservatives, even though a deal promises to relieve economic and regional pressures.\n\nOpposition is driven by each side’s suspicion of the other. Some of that may be justified. Iran has repeatedly lied about and cheated over its nuclear programme. Equally, many of the Washington-based architects of the sanctions would like to see regime change in Tehran. Both sides have covertly and overtly harmed each other in recent years, compounding distrust.\n\nHowever, mutual suspicion is also driven by pride, ignorance, historical grievances and partisan self-interest. American suggestions in the past that the Islamic Republic might be close to collapse still rankle in Tehran. One academic close to the revolutionary guards says testily, “America keeps thinking we are about to sink, that we’ll implode. I say, just come to terms with reality. We have figured out a stable path.”\n\nIranians complain that America is being hypocritical, supporting autocratic Saudi Arabia while denouncing more democratic Iran. Americans retort that the Saudis have not tried to kill or kidnap them, and point out that Iran has its own double standards, supporting the crushing of a revolution in Syria that is similar to its own in 1979. Iranian students at Tehran University are particularly aggrieved by what they see as American hypocrisy in foreign military missions, asking why Americans supplied weapons to rebels in Soviet-occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s. The students quote from a Hollywood film on the subject, “Charlie Wilson’s War”, in which American officials intone, “Let’s go kill some Russians.” So why, they ask, were Americans so offended when Iran used similar tactics against them in Iraq?\n\nHistorical grievances lurk everywhere. Three decades ago America shot down a civilian Iranian airliner, and Iran helped to bomb America’s embassy in Beirut. Hardliners on both sides are still looking for revenge. In April Mr Rohani tried to appoint his deputy chief of staff, Hamid Aboutalebi, as head of Iran’s UN mission in New York. But the ambassador was denied a visa after an outcry in Congress because he had played a minor part in the hostage crisis in 1979. America thus deprived itself of the chance to have a trusted interlocutor on its doorstep.\n\nMany Iranian leaders have built political careers on bashing America. To a lesser degree the same in reverse is true for some congressmen with close links to Israel. Accommodation now would cause a loss of face, maybe even of factional support.\n\nYet overall, the greatest obstacle to reaching a deal is ignorance rather than self-interest. Iran’s supreme leader believes that the American government, not just its hardliners, wants to see him toppled. He misread the Ukrainian revolt earlier this year as an American plot.\n\nEnigma variations\n\nNo diplomat from either Iran or America has been posted in the other’s capital for 35 years, though some Iranians have served at the UN in New York. In a documentary called “The Fog of War”, Robert McNamara, who served as America’s defence secretary in the 1960s, said that America escaped disaster in the Cuban missile crisis because its officials knew their adversaries in Moscow and could work out what sort of deal they might accept. On the other hand, America came to grief in Vietnam because it knew nothing and nobody in Hanoi. A central premise of the war—America’s fear that North Vietnam might form a communist alliance with China—ignored the fact that the two regimes hated each other.\n\nIn the absence of knowledge, people will err on the side of caution. A politically active member of the Khomeini family forcefully makes this point:\n\nWhen I visit a new city I figure out two or three main roads and use them to go anywhere—even if it takes longer—because I fear getting lost. Eventually I will try new, shorter routes. But as soon as I’m no longer sure where I am I revert to the thoroughfares. Regime hardliners act much the same. Occasionally they try new, conciliatory routes, but as soon as they feel insecure they revert to familiar antagonism. They know they won’t get lost that way, even if it means travelling the long way round. You have to remember that most of them have spent very little time in the West and feel intimidated by it. Just listen to all the talk of past humiliations. They regard it as a hostile environment they don’t understand. It fits into the wider historical experience of the Shia as a minority sect. We have long been the victims, or at least defined ourselves as such, dressing in black. The most successful strategy in our past has been to hunker down, wait and distrust rather than act.\n\nSeen in this light, the nuclear negotiators have taken courageous steps. To get the talks going, America conceded that in principle Iran could enrich nuclear fuel for civilian use. In return, Iran froze its programme for the duration of the talks. Both sides appear committed to reaching a deal. They recognise that this is a rare moment. For the first time since 1979 the governments in Tehran and Washington both want to improve relations at the same time. Previously, one or the other was always on the warpath.\n\nMany observers believe that a deal will either be done in the next few months or not at all. Both presidents have a narrow window to sell it at home. Mr Obama is likely to face an even more hostile Congress from next January and will soon become a lame duck. Mr Rohani is struggling to hold off hardliners and cannot afford to use all his political capital on this venture. If the November 24th deadline is missed by much, the naysayers on both sides will claim that no deal can be had, making a future agreement even harder.\n\nOthers think it is possible or even likely that the two sides will formally extend the talks. They see little sign of Iranian hardliners accepting the sort of deal that is available. Yet neither they nor the Americans want to see the talks fail conclusively. Negotiations may yet drag on into next year.\n\nThe prizes to be had\n\nIf the negotiators do succeed, it will be because the potential benefits would be substantial, especially for Iran. In its foreign relations, it could breathe easier and come a step closer to fulfilling its ambition of leading other nations in the region. The partial withdrawal of American troops from the Gulf would be a strategic victory. The economy would be likely to pick up. Foreign investors are ready to return to Iran. Many have visited in recent months in anticipation of an opening. Rolling back sanctions would take a long time, and difficult economic reforms will still be needed. But there would be some quick results. Car production could soon double, and so might oil exports.\n\nThe potential benefits of a deal would be substantial, especially for Iran\n\nThe impact on Iranian domestic politics is harder to gauge. Mr Rohani could expect a boost from the lifting of sanctions and improve his longer-term chances of succeeding Mr Khamenei as supreme leader. However, if he is seen as garnering too much acclaim too quickly, hardliners may decide to take him down a peg, say, by blocking economic reforms or boosting sponsorship of foreign extremists. People close to Mr Rohani suggest that he has a longer-term plan to use the momentum he would gain from lifting sanctions into reshaping the political system. The next step would be to win more seats in parliament. But how much more sway he could gain is uncertain. Hardliners retain control of many levers of power. The totems of their ideology, from denouncing Israel to insisting on the veil for women, are unlikely to disappear. Progress will be slow.\n\nIf no nuclear deal is signed, the domestic pendulum is likely to swing in the opposite direction. Conservatives will reassert themselves. They have already talked of running a “resistance economy”, meaning one less reliant on trade. Hostility towards the West would increase. State media would resume their mantra that America is only interested in destroying Iran.\n\nThe likely American response would be to impose more sanctions. In the absence of a deal, Congress will conclude that Iran is not serious about finding a solution and tighten its grip still further. The question is whether other countries will go along with it. China may no longer be willing to curtail trade with Iran. Russia is already in talks about a $20 billion barter deal. Some of Iran’s old trading partners in Europe could peel away too, especially if they feel that America is to blame for the failure of the talks. Even so, as long as American banking sanctions remain in place, trade will continue to suffer.\n\nAnd if Iran still refuses to budge? Pressure to bomb its nuclear installations would increase, but until hope of a deal has completely evaporated America seems unlikely to attack Iran when it is also fighting Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, protecting Europe from Russia and guarding Asian allies against an increasingly aggressive China. By comparison, doing a deal with Iran may seem easy.",

  "latent_17380": "Kicking off another sure-to-be spectacular summer of science here in Glasgow, the Glasgow Science Festival opened up shop last week with gusto at the Siempre Bicycle Café in our fair city’s West End.\n\nThe sold-out event featured some Science Festival favourites, starting with everyone’s favourite ass-tacologist and boss of Bright Club Glasgow: Zara Gladman. Armed with a microphone, a keyboard and a PowerPoint presentation, we were treated to a deluge of delightful alliterations that probably aren’t repeatable on such a respectable science site but fear not! You can catch that type of filth and much, much more at Bright Club’s upcoming Glasgow Science Festival special at The Stand Comedy Club on June 8th. After Zara finished up with a twist-on-a-classic rendition of Daft Punk’s Get Lucky reminiscent of Lady Alba (come to think of it… have you ever seen them in the same room together?!), we knew we were in for a night to remember.\n\nOr not, if the chaps from The Glasgow Distillery Company got their way! A refreshing and aromatic array of botanically infused Makar Glasgow Gin samples sat dangerously close to where I did but the glasses never seemed to stay full for long; unsurprising, this being Glasgow’s Year of Food and Drink. In this vein, this year’s festival events calendar is so full of culinary curiosities and scientific swallie that it’s gone to its room and put the joggie bottoms on! Take the long journey From Creel to Meal in the city’s Stravaigin and Drygate restaurants (June 4th and 11th, respectively), discover the fascinating field of gastrophysics with The Perfect Meal (June 7th) or delve deep into the science behind gin including an extensive tasting sesh with Gin-o-mics on June 4th. Be sure not to sample too many, though, because if gin’s your thing, you’ll want to check out Gin and Botanicals: Explore the Senses the very next day on June 5th! These events and many more like them were cooked up especially for Glasgow’s Year of Food and Drink so be sure not to miss out on this smorgasbord (and bring an appetite!).\n\nThere was little time for gin sampling, however, as the launch party powered straight on with some poetry courtesy of Glasgow’s own Calum Rodger and music from Adam Ross (of Randolph’s Leap fame); invoking the sense of sound and engaging the mind. All in a day’s work for The Glasgow Science Festival team and only a flavour of what’s in store at any one of the 50+ events on this year’s calendar.\n\nAfter some cake and a quick high jump competition (which I won, despite eating way too much of the cake), the evening sadly drew to an end. As I made my way home, my mind weaved between thoughts of Glasgow’s scientific legacy and fantasies about its future. Crossing the squinty bridge always makes me wonder at our own scientific and engineering ingenuity as it surrounds me – the Scottish Hydro, the Finnieston crane, Harbour Tunnel Rotundas and, of course, the Glasgow Science Centre itself – but that night I thought less about what we had already achieved and more of what we were about to. The Glasgow Science Festival brings cutting edge science to people of all ages and backgrounds who are brave enough and willing to give it a go and shows that the future is happening now in the buildings around us. From the 4th to the 14th of June, step into the future and be ready to be amazed (and hungry).\n\ntheGIST will be reporting from events throughout the Glasgow Science Festival.

  "latent_17397": "FDA Offers Compliance Policy for Certain Vape Shop Activities in New Draft Guidance\n\nToday FDA issued Interpretation of and Compliance Policy for Certain Label Requirement; Applicability of Certain Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Requirements to Vape Shops, a draft guidance intended, among other things, to assist retailers who sell newly-regulated tobacco products such as e-cigarettes, e-liquids, vaporizers and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), as well as their component and parts. The draft guidance is available for public comment through February 16, 2017.\n\nAs explained in FDA’s final deeming rule, which went into effect on August 8, 2016, vape shops that create or modify these products are considered manufacturers under the FD&C Act and, therefore, are responsible for complying with the requirements under the law that apply to manufacturers. Five of these requirements include submitting applications for products for premarket authorization, registering their establishments and listing their products, submitting certain health documents, reporting ingredient lists, and reporting harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs). Today’s draft guidance explains certain activities for which vape shops are considered manufacturers under the FD&C Act, and includes a compliance policy for certain activities for which FDA does not intend to enforce these requirements.\n\nThe guidance explains that FDA does not consider certain activities performed by vape shops to “modify the tobacco product” and, consequently, vape shops that perform these activities are not required to obtain premarket authorization for their products. In addition, FDA does not intend to enforce the other four previously mentioned requirements for these vape shops. Examples of these activities include:\n\nDemonstrating or explaining the use of an ENDS product without assembling the product;\n\nMaintaining an ENDS product by cleaning or tightening fixtures (e.g., screws);\n\nReplacing coils in an ENDS product with identical coils (e.g., same ohm and wattage rating); and\n\nAssembling a final product from the components and parts packaged together in an ENDS kit.\n\nIn addition, FDA is providing a compliance policy for certain activities that do qualify as modifying the tobacco product. The guidance explains that FDA does not intend to enforce the five requirements listed above for these vape shops if, generally speaking, all modifications are consistent with the conditions of the FDA marketing authorization (MA) or if the original manufacturer provides specifications and all modifications made are consistent with those specifications. Examples of these scenarios include:\n\nRefilling an open system ENDS if no further modifications are made to the device or to the e-liquid before, during or after the refill that are outside the FDA marketing authorization (MA) order;\n\nRefilling an open ENDS system if no further modifications are made to the device or the e-liquid before, during or after the refill that – if there is no MA order – are inconsistent with the manufacturer’s specifications.\n\nFor all other activities that qualify as modifying a tobacco product, the vape shop would be considered a manufacturer and therefore would be required to submit applications for premarket review for its products, and would also be required to comply with the other four requirements (as well as all other applicable provisions of the FD&C Act). Examples of activities that are considered modifying a tobacco product under the FD&C Act – and would thus require compliance with all five requirements listed above – include:\n\nModifying a product outside of a FDA marketing authorization (MA) order;\n\nRefilling a closed system ENDS;\n\nRepairing and modifying a part (an atomizer head, for example) outside the conditions of an FDA marketing authorization (MA) order;\n\nReplacing a part (a coil in an ENDS product, for example) – that was on the market as of August 8, 2016 but that does not have an MA order – with a different part (for example, a coil that has a different ohm or wattage rating from that used by the original manufacturer); and\n\nAssembling a custom final product.\n\nLike all guidances, the compliance policy and examples described do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Rather the document, when finalized, will represent FDA’s current thinking as it applies to the general scenarios and examples cited.\n\nAlthough this guidance describes activities performed by vape shops, the same recommendations would apply to any establishment that performs the described activities, such as stores that sell hookah (waterpipes) or pipes.\n\nIn addition to the information provided on vape shop activities, the draft guidance also offers FDA’s interpretation of, and compliance policy for, a requirement that packaged tobacco products must include an accurate statement of the percentage of foreign and domestic-grown tobacco used in the product. With respect to this requirement, FDA believes that this only applies to tobacco products that are made or derived from tobacco. However, because FDA recognizes the current difficulty, in many circumstances, in quantifying these percentages, the Agency does not intend to enforce this requirement for any tobacco products.\n\nFor more information on these topics, please read the guidance.",
  "latent_17407": "Truthout readers like you made this story possible. Can you help sustain our work with a tax-deductible donation?\n\nAs the unrest in Ferguson, MO, grinds on, with everyone from the Revolutionary Communist Party to the Klan, to common racist fools like Samuel “Joe the Plumber” Wurzelbacher weighing in (permanent has-been/never-was Mr. “Plumber” wants to hold a jobs fair in Ferguson to make the protester “cockroaches” scatter; dog-whistles can be found in a bowl by the door), now is an opportune moment to step back and take stock.\n\nMichael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot six times by local police officer Darren Wilson. Eyewitness reports say Brown was running away and attempting to surrender after an altercation with Wilson, who ordered Brown and his friend to stop walking in the street. The police say Wilson was attacked by Brown and shot to defend himself. No one has heard from Darren Wilson himself, because he packed up his family and fled Ferguson immediately after the shooting. He is currently nowhere to be found.\n\nThe Ferguson police said Brown was the suspect in the robbery of some cigars at a store, and released a grainy security video to prove it. Then they said Officer Wilson did not know Brown was a suspect. Then they said he did know. Then they said, for reasons passing understanding, that Brown had marijuana in his system. Then it came to light that Brown, in fact, paid for his cigars. Meanwhile, with every story switch by the police, the protesters in the street got hotter and angrier and louder. The arrests began, sweeping up journalists along with protesters, along with local citizens just trying to go about their business…\n\n…and that’s when this country, and the world, finally got a long, hard look at what a hyper-weaponized military-style United States police force looks like in action. The process of selling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of surplus military hardware from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to local police forces has been ongoing for some time now, and with it has come a dramatic spike in police violence against citizens. Ferguson, however, was the first time this country has really seen it in all its armored and intimidating glory since the Occupy protests…but that was in New York City, and those protesters were dangerous radicals, or something.\n\nFerguson, on the other hand, is Everytown USA, maybe your town, maybe mine. People started wondering if their cops had MRAPs parked somewhere out of sight, sniper rifles and tear gas cannons and sonic rifles stacked and waiting for use. The Ferguson police became national poster children for police excess, and questions finally began to be asked about the wisdom of turning police officers into solders. If you have this stuff, went the thinking, you’re going to want to use it. And they did. And they do.\n\nMilitary veterans of every stripe stood aghast at what they were seeing, as this Washington Post report describes: “For veterans of the wars that the Ferguson protests so closely resemble, the police response has appeared to be not only heavy-handed but out of step with the most effective ways for both law enforcement and military personnel to respond to demonstrations. ‘You see the police are standing online with bulletproof vests and rifles pointed at peoples chests,’ said Jason Fritz, a former Army officer and an international policing operations analyst. ‘That’s not controlling the crowd, that’s intimidating them.'”\n\nThe exposure of police intimidation tactics in Ferguson reached its peak when video was released of Lt. Ray Albers, a 20-year veteran of the St. Ann’s Police Department, leveling his tactical weapon at protesters and screaming, “I will fucking kill you!” When someone in the crowd he was threatening asked his name, he replied, “Go fuck yourself.” After a complaint was filed by the ACLU, Albers was placed on indefinite suspension…but not before his police chief claimed that Albers acted as he did because people were throwing bottles of urine, and that he saw a gun in the crowd. None of this has been subsequently confirmed.\n\nThe Ferguson police, along with other local police forces in that area, have a long and ugly history of interacting poorly with the citizenry, and especially with the black community. Case in point: A woman in Ferguson was shot in the head while walking home from a rally. She miraculously survived, but the police only conducted a cursory interview with her. No report of the incident was filed, and the bullet doctors pulled from her head has disappeared into the possession of the Ferguson police. Post-incident spin tried to fob the incident off as a mere drive-by (?!), but journalist Charles P. Pierce makes the point: If it was a drive-by, wouldn’t the police be all over it as proof that they need such fearsome weaponry to defend themselves and the community? Someone shot her, and the police don’t care, and the bullet is gone. Such brazen negligence leads to questions about where that bullet actually came from, and if the local police are, perhaps, protecting one of their own.\n\nFerguson may have become the avatar for over-armed police behaving badly, but they are far from alone. Local police departments all over the country, swathed in the armor and weaponry of soldiers, are battering down doors and using SWAT tactics to deliver warrants to non-violent offenders, with predictably lethal results. Now that Ferguson has finally brought national attention, along with national reconsideration, of this phenomenon, it is time to ask why we arrived here in the first place.\n\nNational and institutional paranoia after 9/11? Certainly. Arms dealers looking to profit from the sale of leftover weapons from Iraq and Afghanistan? Sadly. Racism in the hearts of some officers? Undoubtedly. Poor training? Clearly. The preponderance of a terrifying authoritarian attitude toward citizens? You tell me.\n\nThere are, however, two more pieces to the puzzle. If you take an ordinary police officer, slap him in armor and camouflage gear, place highly lethal weapons in his hands, and then tell him his life is in mortal peril from the citizenry he is sworn to protect, even as he is practically invincible in his gear, his adrenaline will explode, and you wind up with guys like Ray Albers. Should police officers be protected? Undeniably. Does turning them into super-soldiers go too far? The evidence speaks for itself. As BuzzFlash columnist Akira Watts sagely noted in a recent commentary, “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”\n\nFinally, the elephant in the room: there are some 330 million guns loose in the United States, more guns than citizens, and every police officer knows this. They are trained to know this, trained to worry about it, and fear it. The hyper-militarization of police forces in the United States is directly proportional to the vast number of guns in the hands of citizens.\n\nIn a significant way – thanks to those who advocate for it, those who tolerate it, and those who have given up trying to fix it – the creation and expansion of our gun culture has made this happen. If I were a cop in a squad room, and was told that every person I see might have at least one gun on them, and the math bore that out, which it does, I’d want to go out on patrol dressed like an Abrams tank, as well.\n\nSo much to fix, and meanwhile, Michael Brown is dead. There must be answers, there must be justice, and there must be change.",
  "latent_17485": "Allison Jones, The Canadian Press\n\nTORONTO -- Graduates of a planned law school at a Christian university in British Columbia that forbids sexual intimacy outside heterosexual marriage cannot practise in Ontario, that province's law society decided Thursday.\n\nMany members of the Law Society of Upper Canada's board of directors condemned the policy as \"abhorrent,\" though several said they would still vote in favour of allowing graduates to practise in Ontario. Ultimately there were 28 votes against accreditation to 21 in favour.\n\nTrinity Western University, which plans to open a law school in the fall of 2016, requires students to abide by a covenant that includes requiring them to abstain from gossip, obscene language, prejudice, harassment, lying, cheating, stealing, pornography, drunkenness and sexual intimacy \"that violates the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman.\"\n\nStudents can face discipline for violating the covenant, either on or off campus, according to the school's student handbook.\n\nUniversity president Bob Kuhn appealed to the Law Society of Upper Canada to avoid penalizing his students for their beliefs as it would signal to millions of Canadians with religious views that they are \"not welcome in the public marketplace,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not an issue of discrimination against anyone except those students who may, five years from now, apply to practise law in Ontario,\" he said.\n\n\"The irony of the situation is that the assault on this small Christian community is being led by a powerful moral majority who seek to impose their views and enforce conformity and compliance on TWU as a price for entering the public arena.\"\n\nTrinity Western says it will be the first Christian university in Canada to open a law school. It plans to enrol 60 students in the first year of the three-year program.\n\nThe law school has received preliminary approval from the Federation of Law Societies of Canada and earlier this month the Law Society of B.C.'s board voted to allow the school to proceed.\n\nBut a lawyer from Victoria, B.C., has submitted a petition with 1,177 signatures requesting that the B.C. law society convene a special meeting to reconsider its approval.\n\nAny resolution passed at that meeting would not be binding, but the law society has a process to call a general referendum on it if enough members make the request.\n\nThe majority of lawyers who made submissions to Ontario's law society Thursday stood firmly against accrediting the university. Lawyer John Campion dismissed Kuhn's pitch that the issue is one of freedom of religion.\n\nAnyone is free to go to the school, he said, but its policies are discriminatory and contrary to public policy in Ontario, where gay marriage is embraced and common-law relationships are recognized.\n\n\"I don't think we should take even a millimetre step backwards,\" Campion said. \"We can't do it. All that work and all that trouble and all that pain and we're going to take one little step backwards? I say no.\"\n\nLawyer Howard Goldblatt said the law society promotes and protects equity and diversity, which is in the public interest.\n\n\"I cannot vote to accredit a law school which seeks to control students in their bedrooms, which threatens to punish those who want to be free to be themselves and to engage in loving and meaningful relationships but who must sign what I consider to be an offensive and morally diminishing agreement,\" he said.\n\nLawyer Peter Wardle, said his decision to vote against accreditation was a difficult one as a practising Catholic, but the law society \"can't turn a blind eye to the discriminatory aspects\" of Trinity Western's policy.\n\n\"This is not about TWU's religious or private status as an institution,\" Wardle said. \"This is about TWU seeking the right to have us accredit their law school and we are a public institution.\"\n\nLawyer Christopher Bredt, who voted for the school's accreditation, said the Trinity Western covenant conflicts with his personal views, but the decision must be based on the law.\n\nIf the university is not accredited, Trinity Western law graduates who wanted to practise in Ontario would have to go through a national committee on accreditation, which looks only at whether curriculum requirements are met, Bredt said.\n\n\"There's no suggestion that the curriculum of the law school would not otherwise meet our standards,\" he said. \"There is no suggestion that the graduates of TWU are any more likely to discriminate than graduates of any other Canadian law school.\"\n\nThat approach would create two tiers for licensing lawyers in Ontario -- one for those who attend a faith-based school and another for those who attend secular schools, he said, and the Supreme Court of Canada has said burdens should not be imposed on people because of their religious beliefs.\n\nKuhn touted his graduates' achievements and said they are particularly engaged members of the community. Prospective students aren't asked about their sexual orientation during the application process, he said, though indeed there are gay and lesbian students at the school.\n\nEveryone is welcome, he said, as long as they agree to abide by the community covenant.\n\n\"It's not a university of bigotry or a university of intolerance,\" he said. \"It's a university the students leave saying, 'I love this place.\"'",
  "latent_17486": "In \"'It's So Simple, It's Ridiculous'\" (May 2004), I explored the exotic world of tax rebels-Americans who believe citizens have no legal obligation to pay income tax. They describe themselves not as mere \"tax protestors\" but as a \"tax honesty\" movement, since they believe honesty about the income tax means admitting that none of us legally owe it.\n\nThe movement's prospects looked bleak. \"A sober assessment of the empirical evidence,\" I wrote, shows \"that victories for the tax honesty movement (the occasional criminal acquittal or mistrial) lead inevitably to a later defeat (further convictions or civil seizures).\"\n\nWhile tax protestors fare no better nowadays, it's the tax collectors who are today making headlines by quibbling about how to interpret various tax laws. Congress has been investigating reports that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may have aimed unusually abusive information requests, denials of status, and bureaucratic foot-dragging at nonprofit groups with a conservative bent.\n\nIn May, former IRS official Lois Lerner, who had been in charge of the efforts directed at such groups, pled the Fifth Amendment before Congress. She now insists that all possibly incriminating emails regarding abuse of power aimed at the administration's ideological enemies were lost when her hard drive crashed and was subsequently destroyed. The agency also claims to have lost records for six other employees, including another senior official whose hard drive suffered a conveniently timed crash. Like a tax honesty advocate who argues that he has no taxable income in a technical sense, the IRS is now making difficult-to-believe claims to avoid providing evidence that might prove them liable for having violated the law.\n\nIn 2004, I wrote: \"Never has any court anywhere—much less the IRS—accepted as valid any of the many arguments the movement offers for how and why there is no legal obligation for individuals to pay federal income tax. In fact, courts will fine you up to $25,000 for even raising them, insisting such arguments have been rejected so often by so many courts at so many levels that they are patently frivolous and time-wasting.\"\n\nThe IRS, however, has an advantage tax rebels do not: No matter how absurd their excuses may be for failing to obey the law, the legal powers that be continue to take them seriously.",

At airports, for instance, it's widely accepted that body searches, fingerprint impressions and x-ray scanners are the cost of safe travel. The same goes for CCTV in some public places and speed cameras on the roads. But a Scottish football ground does not immediately come to mind as a candidate for such Orwellian measures.\n\nOthers disagree. The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) has recently formed a working group to consider the proposed installation of facial recognition technology at stadiums across the country, as clubs look to combat anti-social behaviour.\n\nIn effect, this would entail the capturing and archiving of all supporters' faces at the turnstiles. Any banned fan would then be flagged to security and police at the venue, making it significantly easier for authorities to eject those who have been guilty of anti-social behaviour in the past.\n\nA lot still needs to happen before facial recognition technology is found at stadiums north of the border, but its proposal only serves to heighten a sense of criminalisation among Scottish football fans. Supporters feel they are being treated with an unjustified distrust by the country's authorities and governing bodies, and tolerance of this is starting to wear thin.\n\nIt is rare to see any agreement between Celtic and Rangers supporters, but both fanbases have staged protests over the proposals, with banners at Parkhead and Ibrox calling for police and authorities to \"recognise fans' rights.\" One sign held aloft by Celtic fans on Sunday urged them to \"end the criminalisation of football fans.\" Supporters at several other matches also staged protests.\n\nAxe the act pic.twitter.com/WstgjcNdHg\n\n— Morgan Maguire (@MorganM1886) February 20, 2016\n\nRegardless of allegiance, Scottish football's faithful feel they have been pushed to the brink, with the suggested implementation of facial recognition technology the latest move to marginalise those in the stands.\n\n\"We firmly believe it's more about posturing than anything else, whether it be from the police or the football authorities,\" says Paul Goodwin, director of the Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA). \"It was thrown out at a time when Strict Liability was under discussion, and yet facial recognition became the headline grabber.\"\n\nIndeed, the issue of Strict Liability – the standard used by UEFA for tackling offensive behaviour at football matches – and whether it should be adopted by Scottish football clubs has been the subject of perhaps even more significant debate in recent weeks and months. While it may be of little concern to fans, clubs in general are strongly opposed to something that would make them culpable for the actions of individuals.\n\nSomewhat unjustly, this debate keeps the conduct of supporters in Scotland in the spotlight. To provide some perspective, 54 arrests were made at last year's T In the Park festival, which welcomed 85,000 music fans during a three-day event. In contrast, just 238 arrests were made over the course of the entire 2014/15 Scottish Premiership season, which saw over 1.7 million fans pass through the turnstiles.\n\nREAD MORE: Behind The Scenes At Britian's Most Misunderstood Football Club\n\n\"Facial recognition at stadiums would be a sledgehammer to crack a nut,\" says Goodwin, citing similar figures to illustrate how the criminality of Scottish football fans weighs up in the context of wider society. \"I met with the police not so long ago and they didn't mention that it was something they were interested in. We just haven't seen any evidence that warrants it.\"\n\nIn recent years, Scottish football in general has struggled to understand what its fans really want. For instance, just last week over 25,000 viewers watched two Scottish Cup replay matches on Periscope streams, making a mockery of the decision to schedule the fixtures without any live television coverage. Time and again, the sport north of the border demonstrates a worrying disconnect with its key demographic.\n\nAnd at a time when Scottish football is in desperate need of grassroots development, as well as top-level investment, the installation of facial recognition technology is hardly considered a priority by the wider public. The national game should be seeking to attract new fans, not force existing ones away.\n\nPA Images\n\nNot everyone sees it this way, however. Mike Mulraney is the chairman of Alloa Athletic, who currently play in the Scottish Championship; he's also an SPFL board member and a figurehead of the working group looking into the installation of facial recognition technology. He believes the proposals have been misunderstood, calling the reaction \"froth\".\n\n\"One of the previous criticisms we had was that we didn't put forward ideas – we didn't consult people, we didn't get feedback,\" he explains. \"So what we have done is put forward an idea and we're consulting. While I understand the reaction to an extent, I hear fans saying that they're being criminalised... that's absolutely not what we're doing.\"\n\nMulraney highlights just how challenging it is for clubs – particularly of Alloa's standing – to enforce banning orders for fans guilty of acting up, be it through the singing of sectarian songs, the use of pyrotechnics, or other misdemeanours. \"We're finding it almost impossible to restrict access,\" he says.\n\n\"Our only way of doing so is to go to court and get a banning order, which is a slow, laborious, difficult thing to do. And, anecdotally, the allegation is that the people are still getting in. It's difficult to keep them out of the home end; it's almost impossible for away games. So basically what we're finding is that those with intent to cause trouble were doing it anyway, and it's incredibly difficult for us to police it.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The Weird And Wonderful Origins Of Scottish Football Club Names\n\nThis follows much debate over the maligned Offensive Behaviour and Threatening Communications at Football Act, introduced by the Scottish National Party (SNP) in January 2012. Designed to combat Scottish football's age-old problem of sectarianism on the terraces, the bill has since faced widespread criticism, with one study (conducted by the University of Stirling and ScotCen Research) claiming that the law has placed new strains on the relationship between supporters and police.\n\nFans can now face up to five years in prison or an unlimited fine should they fall foul of the legislation, with threats posted on the internet also subject to the law. Critics claim, however, that the bill gave excessive powers to the police.\n\nIn retrospect, the legislation was rushed through – or \"railroaded\" as one opposition Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) put it – by a government anxious about the issue of sectarianism, particularly in the aftermath of the 2011 Old Firm match dubbed the 'shame game'. The Herald newspaper called it \"knee-jerk legislation.\" Celtic – who, given the club's roots in Irish republicanism, feel particularly targeted – summed up the sentiment of many by officially labelling the act \"unhelpful and counter-productive.\"\n\nPA Images\n\nOpposition to the bill is so strong that politicians have taken to using it for points scoring, with many featuring it as a key component of their general election manifestos last year. A Dundee judge even called it \"mince\" after a Celtic supporter was cleared of singing sectarian songs.\n\nThe fundamental problem with the act is the way in which it fails to colour the greyest of grey areas. What constitutes a sectarian song, and what is merely cultural expressionism? Does the legislation stretch to cover political statements? John Mason, an MSP representing the SNP, believes so, telling the protest group Fans Against Criminalisation that 'Yes' badges worn in the run-up to the 2014 independence referendum should be banned. As is the case with so many aspects of the game north of the border, Scottish football fans felt misunderstood.\n\n\"Over the years football has been marginalised when compared with other sports,\" says Goodwin. \"In some respects we can understand that because of the history. But the various bills that are in place now – and the situation we have where you can get a pint at a game in England, but not in Scotland – these things just make fans feel like they're being picked on.\"\n\nThere are fans in every league across the globe who will claim they are unfairly treated by their respective footballing authorities, but perhaps nowhere do supporters feel so misunderstood and under-appreciated as in Scotland. Such malaise has become a symptom of the sport's decline – and facial recognition technology does nothing to ease this.\n\nREAD MORE: What Makes You'll Never Walk Alone Such An Enduring Anthem?\n\nThose who are pushing these proposals perhaps fail to appreciate the nuanced impact of their suggestion. The idea, in the mind of Scottish football fans, is enough to criminalise them. With CCTV cameras already watching fans at grounds, is there any real need for further surveillance?\n\n\"There is societal pressure on us to do something,\" insists Mulraney in response. \"There is no chance of us being able to afford to do this [alone], and it is reasonable for football to say back to society 'do you want to contribute to making this better?' Then it's up to people to say 'yes' or 'no' to that – that's what government is all about.\n\n\"You've also got to ask what saves society the most money? At the moment, arresting people and putting them through courts is not cheap, and that's our only option. There is a substantial cost to policing football matches, so would these plans reduce that? That's something that has to be considered as well.\"\n\nThe average cost of policing an Old Firm derby is put at around £350,000. While most fixtures require much less financing, Mulraney's point holds some weight – ensuring the safety of fans is indeed expensive. It's estimated that the implementation of facial recognition technology would cost up to £4 million, with the Scottish government slated to subsidise any installation price. Those in favour of the proposal say it would quickly pay for itself.\n\nThough they play in the same division for now, Alloa and Rangers are worlds apart in terms of size | PA Images\n\nAt Alloa Athletic's level, parliamentary assistance would be required should such proposals be pushed through. \"How could we possibly afford it?\" says Mulraney. Clubs higher up have the means to fund the plans, however, and so the question becomes one about who facial recognition technology would really benefit: Scottish football chiefs or society as a whole?\n\nMulraney rightly highlights that his proposals could still be knocked down, placing the plans at the mercy of democracy; given the anger they have prompted that seems almost inevitable. Similarly, the Offensive Behaviour and Threatening Communications at Football Act will surely not survive in its current form. The movement to permit the sale of alcohol at Scottish football stadiums – in line with almost every other sporting-sphere around Europe – is gathering momentum too.\n\nBut the damage might already have been done. Scottish football is charged with attracting a new generation to keep its stands full and its game prosperous, yet so many involved in its running seem determined to act to the contrary. Facial recognition technology might not directly drive fans away, but the ill feeling it would generate certainly could.\n\n@grahamruthven",
  "latent_17691": "The technology was used in March 2014 as part of an ongoing NASA campaign to monitor the sinking of the ground along the Louisiana Gulf Coast. Officials in Florida are hopeful that it might be useful in their state. “We’ve reached out to NASA, but no response yet,” says Jim Lamar, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. “We are hoping to learn more about the program and its capabilities and applications in Florida regarding terrain-change detection.” So, what causes these earth-swallowers in the first place?\n\nClint Kromhout, a geologist in the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, wrote the paper \"What’s Up with All the Sinkholes?\":\n\nThe bulk of Florida’s peninsula is made up carbonate rock (limestone and dolostone) overlain by variable thicknesses and mixtures of sand and clay (i.e., overburden). Carbonate rocks store and transmit groundwater. Through a slow chemical process these carbonate rocks may dissolve, resulting in karst terrain (topography). Karst terrains are characterized by sinkholes, caves (wet and dry), springs, disappearing/reappearing streams, and other land surface depressions all of which are commonly found throughout Florida.\n\nBoth natural phenomena and human activity can trigger sinkholes. Heavy rainfall, especially after a drought, and tropical storms contribute to the forming of a sinkhole, while man-made sinkholes can be prompted by heavy pumping of groundwater for agricultural protection, investigative drilling, and excavation.\n\nAs far as picking a safe non-sinkhole region, where there is no chance of getting your house sucked in—there are no guarantees. From the Florida Geological Survey:\n\nSince the entire state is underlain by carbonate rocks, sinkholes could theoretically form anywhere. However, there are definite regions where sinkhole risk is considerably higher. In general, areas of the state where limestone is close to surface, or areas with deeper limestone but with a conducive configuration of water table elevation, stratigraphy, and aquifer characteristics have increased sinkhole activity.\n\nReports of sinkholes show up in Florida newspapers so often, they deserve their own section. But Kromhout says, despite popular perception, that there does not seem to be an increase in sinkholes across the state. “I am doubtful that sinkholes are occurring any more frequently than any other time with Florida’s recent geologic past,” says Kromhout. (Then again, Kromhout says he isn't aware of any studies that have assessed sinkhole frequency over time.)\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey doesn't track the frequency of sinkholes. Quite simply, it is difficult to do, says Randall Orndoff, a supervisory geologist at the agency.\n\n“First, it must be determined that a collapse feature or event is actually geologic. Many collapse events we see in the news are related to our aging infrastructure and are caused by leaky sewers, storm drains, and water mains,” he says. “Second, sinkholes occur in about 20 percent of the conterminous US and many occur in rural areas, in farmer's fields and woodlands and never get reported. Also, many sinkholes subside over time (not a catastrophic collapse) and if it does not adversely impact a building or other property, it would probably not be reported.”\n\nEven if sinkholes aren’t happening more frequently, there is evidence that they’re affecting more people. The state’s Office of Insurance Regulation said 6,694 sinkhole-related claims were filed in 2010 compared with 2,360 claims in 2006. Even if there were an absolute way to prevent sinkholes, a whopper like the Winter Park sinkhole that swallowed 250,000 cubic yards of earth is, geologist Kromhout says, “likely impossible” to prevent.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

  "latent_17848": "A team of scientists has figured out a way for a standard silicon chip to tackle quantum entanglement — a phenomenon in which multiple particles are connected to each other and act in uniform, regardless of how far apart they are. The scientists’ findings were detailed on Monday in a research paper published in Optica, a monthly journal by The Optical Society (OSA).\n\nSo far, harnessing the power of quantum entanglement onto silicon chips has proven to be a difficult task because of the large size of the devices used to emit entangled photons; photons are essentially the particles that make up light. Creating silicon chips — which are inexpensive and prevalent compared to specialized entanglement equipment — that can handle quantum entanglement is a big deal in that it can allow for more powerful computer chips and better encryption technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers of Università degli Studi di Pavia in Italy have come up with a way to solve this problem by creating a microscopic device that can supposedly fit onto a silicon chip and produce entangled photons.\n\nThe researchers paired a silicon wafer with what’s known as a ring resonator — a closed loop that photons enter on one side via a laser beam. They emerge entangled on the other side, where they are captured.\n\nAccording to the research paper, the team of scientists was able to “demonstrate that silicon ring resonators in a silicon-on-insulator platform are an efficient source of time-energy entangled photon pairs.”\n\nFrom the research paper:\n\n[blockquote person=”” attribution=””]We can confidently expect that silicon mircoring resonators will become the dominant paradigm of correlated photon sources for quantum photonics, both for applications involving the transmission of quantum correlations over long distances, such as quantum cryptography, and for applications involving quantum information processing “on-a-chip.”[/blockquote]\n\nQuantum entanglement can be very useful to the field of security and can help with encrypting messages. GridCOM Technologies, for example, explained to Gigaom in 2013 that it uses quantum entangled photons to generate encryption keys.\n\nAny time someone tries to measure an entangled photon to learn what it may have encrypted, the GridCOM system is automatically pinged because of the way the photons are connected; each entangled particle affects the other and when one particle exists in a state where it is spinning up, its correlated particle will take on a state where it is spinning down.",

So, despite rumours of the two hamming it up years ago, it’s no surprise they’re not actually close at all and are, as of now, nemeses – at least if you ask Manson.\n\nThe world assumed the two were chummy back when Bieber was spotted wearing a Manson T-shirt at a concert, and Manson then wore a Bieber T-shirt at one of his shows. Seeing an opportunity to make some hard cold cashola, Bieber then started selling vintage Manson shirts, but with his name on top of them, and for a whopping $200 each, NME reports.\n\nIn a new interview with Consequence of Sound, Manson says that when he met Bieber, “he was [already] wearing the shirt that had his name on my shirt, and he said to me, ‘I made you relevant again.’”\n\nAnd while no lies have been detected in that statement, Manson was not having it and laid down the law (at least in his mind).\n\n“Bad mistake to say to me,” Manson said. “He was a real piece of shit in the way he had the arrogance to say that.

Researchers tracked which men developed melanoma and also tallied their use of Viagra.\n\nRisk for melanoma was higher for those using Viagra or for those who had ever used it. Erectile dysfunction (ED) itself was not linked to increased risk.\n\nThe results indicate Viagra may increase the risk of melanoma.\n\nViagra raises Melanoma Risk\n\nDermatologist Dr. Brian Horvath said, “It may be that people who take Viagra are more likely to be out in the sun or more active in some way. The problem with that idea, though, is that the other types of skin cancer risks were not increased. So if was just sun exposure, you’d expect all skin cancers would increase. In this situation, just the melanoma risk was increased.”\n\nResearchers performed the study because Viagra affects certain cell signals, similar to those which allow melanoma cells to spread.\n\nViagra blocks Phosphodiesterase\n\nHorvath said, “Viagra blocks an enzyme called phosphodiesterase and most melanomas have a mutation that also blocks that enzyme.”\n\nViagra was the only FDA approved medicine for ED when the study began ten years ago.\n\nCialis, Levitra, and Stendra have been approved since then. These ED drugs also block phosphodiesterase, so they, too, could become suspect in raising melanoma risk.\n\nHorvath said the evidence is not “firm” and cautioned men considering Viagra to have “a baseline skin check.”\n\nAnother study published in JAMA found the source of the malignant melanoma increase to be based on socioeconomic and other factors.

That measure, which applies to national air pollution standards, is also not a perfect fit for a globally dispersed gas like carbon dioxide, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet Democratic lawmakers, dozens of whom had signed a letter to Mr. Salazar urging that the rule be dropped, were largely silent on Friday. They are pushing hard for climate legislation limiting greenhouse gases and are still working out details with Mr. Obama.\n\nRepublicans in Congress and industry representatives had argued that without the rule, any proposed housing development, power plant or other project requiring a government permit could face a review of how its emissions might harm not only polar bears but eventually a list of other species that could be imperiled by climate change.\n\nJack N. Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, endorsed Friday’s move by the administration, saying it would provide “greater regulatory certainty not only to the oil and natural gas industry but also to all U.S. manufacturers.”\n\nSome environmental campaigners offered a mixed view of the situation.\n\nJohn Kostyack, executive director for wildlife conservation and global warming at the National Wildlife Federation, criticized the decision to retain the rule, which he said falsely asserted that there was no direct link between specific greenhouse gas emissions and the decline in the polar bear’s habitat.\n\nBut Mr. Kostyack said there was no way that the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Interior Department agency responsible for carrying out the Endangered Species Act, could handle the burden of trying to police emissions.\n\nIn addition to conventional threats, a vital focus for wildlife managers should be figuring out how to help vulnerable species adapt to climate stresses, he said.\n\n“The last thing we want to do,” he said, “is saddle them with solving the causes of global warming, too.”",

  "latent_18676": "The number of foreign fighters traveling to Iraq and Syria, mostly to fight alongside the Islamic State, has grown to 20,000 — up more than 5,000 from previous estimates made in October, according to the International Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence.\n\nThese new figures are alarming, inasmuch as they indicate that the conflict has attracted more foreign militants than the conflict in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The last time this many militants traveled to fight in a foreign conflict was in 1945.\n\nAnother key takeaway from the new data is that, at 4,000, a fifth of the foreign fighters come from Western nations. While estimates from countries in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, fluctuated a little, there were huge increases in fighters coming from European nations.\n\nFrance previously accounted for 412 fighters traveling to Iraq and Syria. The new data show that number has almost tripled, to 1,200. The Netherlands, Britain and Austria all accounted for about 100 additional fighters.\n\nBelgium, a much smaller nation, went from 296 to 440 and has the highest number of fighters per capita of any Western nation. The country has been \"experiencing the consequences of what critics call decades of ineffectiveness in integrating immigrants, including many Muslims.\" According to a story by my colleague Michael Birnbaum:\n\n[T]he country faces particular challenges because it has long been starkly divided itself, with bitter rivalries between a Dutch-speaking north and a French-speaking south. That has hurt the coherence of the government’s response and exacerbated the difficulties that immigrants have had fitting in.\n\nGermany, a country in the news for its anti-Islamization movement, saw the number of fighters going overseas more than double in just four months. According to a report by the ICSR:\n\nThe number of Germans immigrating to Syria has risen massively over the past two years. Islamists have tried to recruit German-speaking Muslims in the past, but now their efforts have grown in both quality and quantity.\n\nThe Middle East still accounts for the highest number of foreigners fighting in Iraq and Syria.",

Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg .\n\nSwing states that played a key role in electing Donald Trump president have posted some of the biggest declines in unemployment during the early phase of his administration.\n\nSix states voted for President Barack Obama, a Democrat, in 2012 and then Mr. Trump, a Republican, in 2016: Ohio, Michigan, Florida, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe median unemployment rate of those switchover states has fallen far faster than the national median this year, according to an analysis of data released by the Labor Department on Friday. The median rate of those states stood at 3.9% as of July, down from just under 5% in December. By comparison, the national median fell to 4.1% in July from 4.7%.\n\nCreated with Highcharts 5.0.12 In the Red Median state unemployment rates by 2012 and '16 presidential-vote preference: THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Source: Labor Department Notes: Figures are seasonally adjusted and include D.C. where appropriate. **Nov. 2016** .\n\nThe story is roughly the same after adjusting for population size.\n\nIt’s still early in Mr. Trump’s term, and he has yet to put in place any key components of his agenda, such as health-care and tax overhauls, revamped trade agreements and an infrastructure spending bill. That could make it hard for Mr. Trump to claim credit for the employment gains.\n\nAlso, other measures show the economy more broadly hasn’t picked up since he took office. U.S. output grew an average of just under 2% , at an annual rate, in the first two quarters, in line with economic growth in recent years.\n\nThat said, Mr. Trump has appointed people in key posts who have begun to roll back business regulations. And the stock market, while down sharply in recent days, has risen sharply since his election. That has boosted consumer and business confidence, which in turn is a factor behind steady hiring and economic growth.\n\nAmong the switchover states, Wisconsin and Michigan have seen unemployment fall the quickest this year. Over the past three months, the average jobless rate in Michigan fell nearly 1.2 percentage points, to 3.9%, compared with the final quarter of 2016, just before Mr. Trump took office. Only three other states in the U.S. saw a deeper drop in joblessness.\n\nThe rate fell 1 percentage point in Wisconsin to 3.1%. That drop ranked seventh in the U.S. Florida, where joblessness stood at 4.2% in July, ranked 12th with a 0.7 percentage point drop.\n\nMost switchover states are in the Midwest, where the economy has diversified in recent years but still remains big in manufacturing.\n\nGabriel Ehrlich, an economist at the University of Michigan, said one factor behind the Midwest’s strength this year is a weaker dollar, which makes American exports cheaper when sold abroad. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of other major currencies, has fallen more than 7% in 2017. Exports grew 6% in the first six months of 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe weaker dollar has also boosted the value of profits that multinational companies earn overseas in other countries. And business confidence is high. Those factors could be leading businesses broadly to expand payrolls.\n\nCreated with Highcharts 5.0.12 Change in Unemployment By State Some states that were key to President Trump's election victory have seen big declines in joblessness.

  "latent_19234": "LONDON and WASHINGTON — Satellite telecom startup OneWeb, emboldened by the oversubscribed $1.2 billion Softbank-led investment gained in December, is on the verge of adding another 2,000 satellites to its previously proposed constellation of several hundred satellites.\n\nOneWeb made a big splash in June 2015 when it went public with an impressive roster of investors pledging some $500 million to deploy more than 600 small, low-orbiting satellites to blanket the Earth in Ku-band broadband connectivity.\n\nOn Wednesday, Greg Wyler, OneWeb’s founder and executive chairman, told an audience at the Royal Aeronautical Society in London that the company has sold a considerable portion of the capacity of its initial planned constellation and is seriously considering quadrupling its size.\n\n“We are adding 2,000 satellites at different altitudes in low Earth orbit,” Wyler told SpaceNews in London. “We have priority rights to another 2,000 satellites — 1,972 satellites, to be precise. With Softbank we have reinvigorated our activities and started talking about the strong possibility that we will be adding to the constellation using our priority rights.”\n\nThe expansion plans materialized after Japanese mogul Masyoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, jumped on board with a $1 billion investment. Previous investors committed to an additional $200 million, bringing OneWeb’s total capital raised to $1.7 billion.\n\n“[Son] has really put the throttles full-forward when it comes to our mission of bridging the digital divide globally by 2027,” Wyler said in London.\n\n“We are not talking about it yet, but we will start talking about it soon. You will hear about some great launch scale step function changes to our plans and improvements,” the 47-year-old entrepreneur continued. “We are really looking at many new things. You will see some more satellites in a few places that you wouldn’t expect.”\n\nIn addition to its official focus on connecting the world’s four billion unconnected citizens to the world wide web by the end of the next decade, OneWeb is eyeing the nascent Internet of Things sector, connected cars and in-flight connectivity.\n\nAdding 1,972 satellites to OneWeb’s previously announced 648 puts the total constellation at 2,620. In a telephone interview with SpaceNews on Thursday evening, Wyler said OneWeb is very actively considering this level of expansion, but was less committal than at the London event.\n\n“We always had this as a possibility,” he said. “What we are doing is really difficult. Our team has made tremendous progress. When looking at some of the accomplishments that have become real and validated over the past several months, we’ve been strongly encouraged that this next phase should be accelerated. Our shareholders are pushing us hard to accelerate because the interest in demand and in the need to accomplish our mission is quite pressing.”\n\nThe first 10 OneWeb spacecraft are scheduled to launch about a year from now on a Europeanized Soyuz rocket from Arianespace. Those, Wyler said, will provide service as part of the full constellation.\n\nIn London, Wyler also suggested that although the company hasn’t formally announced having sold any capacity — save perhaps Gogo’s March 2016 deal with Intelsat for combined geostationary and LEO capacity — that demand from the world’s telecommunications operators is strong. When asked how much capacity he expects to have sold by the time the initial constellation launches, he replied: “all of it.”\n\nSpeaking by phone Thursday night, Wyler said the decision on whether to quadruple the size of the OneWeb constellation will be made before the end of the year.\n\n“I don’t want to say we are definitely doing it, but I can say that we are very strongly considering it, and based upon our priority rights, we have always had this as a possibility,” he said. “Our first system has 1.5 to 2 terabits of forward capacity, and we will be very substantially increasing that.”\n\nSpaceNews staff writer Caleb Henry contributed from Washington.",

  "latent_19558": "Following on the heels of the absolutely terrible article by Lindy West that all the injustice faced by men (past and present) is the result of the “patriarchy” and that only feminism can address these issues, I thought I would spend some time today looking at the idea of “patriarchy” a little more closely.\n\nhttp://judgybitch.com/2013/03/29/men-stand-up-for-yourselves-and-we-will-hate-you-the-new-feminist-war-cry/\n\nA reader named Sherlock sent me a link to an article, written by a woman named Susan Carol Rogers, called Female Forms of Power and the Myth of Male Dominance: A Model of Female/Male Interaction in Peasant Society. Here is the link:\n\nhttp://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/dcrawford/rogers.pdf\n\nIt’s a fairly long slog, at 29 pages, but I’m going to give you the quick and dirty summary.\n\nSusan starts by noting that anthropology as a discipline makes a couple of sweeping generalizations and assumptions that directly affects how they understand and investigate power and authority. Anthropologists typically assume that the only forms of power that matter are those that are codified and formalized: things like rules and laws and positions in political institutions. There is no room in their observations for informal power. The mayor has power. The mayor’s wife has none.\n\nThis focus on only formal aspects of power and authority makes it seem as if male dominance is virtually universal across human societies. To make matters even more complicated, both men and women behave as if men are dominant, when in reality, the situation is much more nuanced.\n\nSusan writes, “although peasant males monopolize positions of authority and are shown public deference by women, thus superficially appearing to be dominant, they wield relatively little real power” (p.728).\n\nIn the peasant societies Susan explores, women control a major portion of the resources and make most of the decisions regarding how those resources are used, in effect, wielding the greater power.\n\nWhy would they do that? Why act like men have all the power, when in reality, it’s women who have most of it?\n\nThis is the absolute kicker in Susan’s article. She gets this 100% right, if you ask me. She starts by defining a myth as a belief that one can see is factually untrue. Take the idea that black men have bigger penis sizes than any other racial group. It’s a myth that’s been repeated so often, even black MEN, who are most likely to have seen a black penis (their own, for starters) tend to believe it. But it’s not true. It’s part of a racist narrative to define black men as animals, and it has its roots in the history of American slavery.\n\nhttp://racehist.blogspot.ca/2010/01/oversized-penile-length-in-black-people.html\n\nWe’re going to come back to that idea, and talk about how myths can be productive, but also incredibly destructive when society no longer perceives the myth as a myth.\n\nIn the groups that Susan is looking at, neither men nor women believe the myth that men are dominant, but both men and women behave as if that is, in fact, true.\n\nWhy?\n\nBoth groups want to think of themselves as having distinct advantages, values and prestige relative to one another, and they want those attributes to be distributed fairly, and in such a way that neither group feels like they’re getting the shaft. They want to seem like “winners” to one another. Furthermore, both men and women see themselves as mutually dependent upon one another, which, when you come right down to the very basic reality of reproduction is absolutely, unequivocally true.\n\nTechnology, driven by the dominant ideology of female supremacy, is working furiously to eliminate men from the reproductive process, creating embryos that are genetically identical to the mother, by triggering a process called parthenogenesis. I’ve had fun with that one before.\n\nhttp://judgybitch.com/2013/01/14/the-moment-i-knew-feminism-was-a-crock-of-shit/\n\nThe end of genetic diversity. How clever. And how sad is it that most of the specialists working in human fertility are actually male? Working to eradicate themselves.\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-79711/We-create-babies-men-claim-scientists.html\n\nLet’s get back to Susan. She observes that men and women in peasant societies understand perfectly that they are dependent upon one another, and seek to create a social structure that makes both men and women feel valued and that they are being treated respectfully and fairly.\n\nWhat resources do women control?\n\nIn peasant societies, the key unit of economic and social production is the nuclear family. Husband, wife, children, and perhaps extended members of the family in the form of grandparents. Jill Dubisch, also trying to evaluate the power that women hold in peasant societies, came up with four criteria to evaluate how evenly power is distributed between husbands and wives:\n\nHow respectfully did the spouses treat one another, both privately and publicly? How often or much did the spouses interfere with one another’s domains? How were family resources allocated? How were decisions regarding plans for children made?\n\nHere is an example of how that works: in Greek villages, women control all the family finances, because they take principal responsibility for producing the food/goods that will be sold at the local market. The women make the bread, churn the butter, weave the cloth, collect the eggs, raise the goats, make the cheese, etc. They attend the markets, set the prices, and collect the payment.\n\nSo far, they are the primary drivers of the family’s prosperity and comfort. A man without a hard-working wife like this is well and truly fucked. This kind of scenario has been in effect since the beginning of written culture.\n\nOne of the my favorite passages from the Bible is Proverbs 31, commonly called, the Virtuous Woman. And because I am an atheist, I absolutely want scripture read at my funeral! I also want to be buried in my Star Trek uniform, but that’s another story.\n\nWho can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.\n\nThe heart of her husband safely trusts in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.\n\nShe will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.\n\nShe seeks wool, and flax, and works willingly with her hands.\n\nShe is like the merchants’ ships; she brings her food from afar.\n\nShe rises also while it is yet night, and gives meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.\n\nShe considers a field, and buys it: with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.\n\nShe girds her loins with strength, and strengthens her arms.\n\nShe perceives that her merchandise is good: her candle goes not out by night.\n\nShe lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.\n\nShe stretches out her hand to the poor; yea, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.\n\nShe is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.\n\nShe makes herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.\n\nHer husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.\n\nShe makes fine linen, and sells it; and delivers girdles unto the merchant.\n\nStrength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.\n\nShe opens her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.\n\nShe looks well to the ways of her household, and eats not the bread of idleness.\n\nHer children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her.\n\nMany daughters have done virtuously, but you excel beyond them all.\n\nFavour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that fears the Lord, she shall be praised.\n\nGive her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.\n\nProverbs 31: 10-31\n\nhttp://www.middletownbiblechurch.org/homefam/prov31.htm\n\nLet her own works praise her in the gates. So lovely.\n\nLook carefully at what our virtuous woman’s husband is doing. He praises her, basks in how her hard work improves his reputation and he sits with the elders.\n\nNow, the typical feminist response to this is wahhhhhh… look at how hard that poor woman works…wahhhhh… her husband just sits on his ass doing nothing…. wahhhhh… she’s so abused and exploited….\n\nhttp://www.marxists.org/subject/women/authors/dixon-marlene/super-exploitation.htm\n\nWhich ignore two realities completely: first of all, this woman and her family are clearly very affluent. Not everyone is. That’s life. The only thing that matters is that any family that works hard has a CHANCE to be affluent. She may consider a field and decide to plant an olive grove, but you can be damn sure she ain’t out in the fields doing the work herself.\n\nWho does the backbreaking labor in peasant society, or any society for that matter?\n\nYeah, that would be men. Generally poor men, struggling to get a foot on the ladder and pull their whole family up.\n\nSecondly, the affluent men are not sitting on their asses doing nothing: they are creating the political and social structures that make it possible for their economies to work. They set the terms of economic exchange, they mediate disputes, they enact laws and enforce them.\n\nIn other words, they formalize power and authority and create the political context that governs how the whole society works. And when ONLY the formal structures of power are examined, they appear to be completely and utterly dominant.\n\nBut they’re not. So Virtuous spends the day managing her male workforce out toiling in the olive grove, she gets the new linen ready for market, she makes sure her maidens and children are taken care of, she packs up a basket for the local poor folks, she does all the work her day requires.\n\nThen Mr. Virtuous comes home, cracks her in the face for backtalk, takes her money, decides he doesn’t like what the kids are up to, complains about her new tapestry and then demands dinner?\n\nMy fucking ass he does.\n\nBut that’s what the myth of patriarchy wants us to believe, isn’t it? That men are exploitive and abusive and violent and controlling and they hold all the reins of power and won’t hesitate to use them to harm and confine and limit the lives of women. Their wives, their sisters, their daughters, their mothers.\n\nAnd in doing so, destroy the whole society.\n\nThe only solution to this terrible problem of male abusiveness and exploitation is to take all the public, formal power away from them while still retaining all the control over family resources. That’s feminism in a nutshell. Remove men from power, while still maintaining all of women’s traditional power.\n\nAbortion laws, reproductive rights (for women only), the rise of single motherhood, divorce, custody and division of property laws are all ways to enshrine women’s absolute control over family resources. And all the while, women are exhorted to “lean in”, fight for more power and influence and control of formal power structures.\n\nMore women in corporate board rooms.\n\nMore women in government.\n\nMore women in the judiciary.\n\nMore women at the top of every formal power structure we have.\n\nTraditional peasant societies could see that women produced and controlled most of the actual, finite resources in society, including the labor of less affluent men. And they could see how that might make men feel a bit vulnerable and defensive. Who wants to be treated like a utility? Like oxen, good for labor and then the soup pot?\n\nSo both men and women agreed to allow men to control most of the formal power structures, none of which can exist without the labor of women and poor men. And to make certain that both men and women felt equally valued and appreciated, they created a myth of male dominance, all the while knowing that the true balance of power swayed heavily in favor of women.\n\nEverybody understood that the idea of male dominance was a MYTH. A story designed to engender respect and mutual prosperity. And for thousands of years, it worked perfectly.\n\nIn traditional families like my own, that myth is alive and well. Technically, Mr. JB has all the power. The formal power. He earns all the money, and he handles all the bills. He makes all the financial decisions, without input or interference from me. I am completely dependent upon him for survival. And when his Boss calls up and asks if Mr.JB can take on an extra project, the first thing he says is, “I’ll have to check with the boss”.\n\nThat would be me.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, if I’m not happy, and I don’t feel respected or valued or appreciated, his life is going to be very unpleasant. And it works both ways. Can he take on the extra project? Does he want to? How important is this to him? Will it make him happy? That’s how I make my decision.\n\nThat’s how we make decisions together.\n\nRemember the whole myth of the black male penis thing? I’m going to link to a post at The Good Men Project, although I generally don’t like that site. It’s worth a read because the writer talks about the origins of that particular myth and how it has come to harm black men in particular.\n\nhttp://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/the-good-life-average-size-for-a-black-man-penis-size-myths-racism-and-the-patriarchy/\n\nIt harms them because the myth is no longer seen as a myth, but as an incontrovertible truth.\n\nAnd that’s what happened with the myth of male dominance. At some point our culture has forgotten that this is a STORY, with a very commendable purpose: it’s a story that assures mutual respect and admiration. A group of angry women decided that shutting women out of formal power structures was a problem that needed to be fixed.\n\nAnd you know, fair enough. Okay. Let’s get more women into formal power structures, even though they show little inclination or desire to be there.\n\nBUT, in exchange for that access, women will have to give up access to traditional female power structures.\n\nAnd that isn’t happening. Women want both male and female powers. Preferably ALL the power. The right to control men by controlling the most precious resource any culture has: children, and the right to hold the reins of formal, institutionalized power that governs all our lives.\n\nThat reduces men, and poor men in particular, to mere social utilities, with little value and correspondingly little respect. And that is just what is happening. Men are belittled in the media and their concerns scoffed.\n\nhttp://jezebel.com/5967923/fuck-you-mras\n\nThe rates at which they take their own lives are ignored, or worse, they get blamed for the very real despair of knowing you are nothing but a tool, easily discarded when your usefulness has run its course.\n\nhttp://judgybitch.com/2013/02/25/of-course-you-can-blame-the-victim-who-else-are-you-going-to-blame/\n\nFeminists continually point to the fact that men continue to dominate formal power structures as evidence for patriarchy. Their suggested redress is to wrest formal power from men and give it to women, while still holding on to their own traditional advantages and informal powers.\n\nWe have a word to describe the society that will eventually evolve if such an effort is successful. It’s not patriarchy.\n\nIt’s matriarchy.\n\nIt’s quite an impressive inversion, isn’t it? When feminists use the word “patriarchy” what they are opposing is respect and the equal attribution of power and control between the sexes. When feminists identify the “patriarchy” as a problem, they are in effect saying that valuing the contributions of men and women equally, and in a way that is designed to make both men and women feel as if they are being treated fairly is a problem.\n\nThe reality is that power skews to women. That’s easy to ignore or even outright deny, because that power is informal. The balance is restored when formal power rests in the hands of men. And despite 70 years of shrieking and protesting and gnashing of teeth, formal power DOES reside mostly in the hands of men.\n\nPatriarchy has never existed in the form that feminism insists. And it has never been the problem.\n\nOn the contrary. It’s the solution.\n\nLet’s bring back patriarchy. And let our own works praise us in the gates.\n\nLots of love,\n\nJB",

From my point of view, it was a good year for St Louis. I admit I probably feel that way because I go out of my way to nerd out on local projects aimed at improving the city. But I genuinely believe St Louis is on a stable, upward trajectory as a place for all types of people to live and work.\n\nCheers to a year of progress and growth, and a better one ahead!\n\nJanuary:\n\n“Some of the poorest municipalities in the county have the highest property taxes, but you know... they don’t get anything from that, so they turn to policing for profit. Chesterfield (for example) has some of the lowest, if not non-existent property taxes. So they outsource funding their government to the rest of the region by sales tax. So when you go to Chesterfield and shop in the valley, you’re paying for their government. So they’re subsidizing their taxpayers through the purchases of other regional taxpayers. The hypocrisy of one of the council members talking about the free market is, the valley was subsidized after the flood of 93. And they’re using distorted incentives to attract other people here. Using the tools of government to distort the market in your favor. It’s a circus sometimes.”\n\nJake Hollander, St Louis Strong\n\nFebruary:\n\n“We used to see America on TV all day, through movies. It was like a dream to us. And when they told us we were going there, it felt like a dream come true. We were going to the land of opportunity! We hadn’t heard of St Louis or Missouri, but someone at the U.N. pointed to it on a physical map and through an interpreter said ‘St Louis is the heart of America’. We were very happy and excited.”\n\n“This is our place. This is our country. We love St Louis. We love America. We belong here.”\n\nNadya Kanim, Iraqi refugee & US immigrant, International Institute of St Louis\n\nMarch:\n\n“We don’t spend enough resources on human capital here in St Louis. We spend a ton of money, and a lot of focus goes to brick and mortar. We ignore the human capital. And now we have an underclass, a subculture, where gun violence is accepted and expected.”\n\n“We got a call from a concerned mother who said ‘Mr. Clark my son had a conflict with another young man in high school and he STILL rides around with a gun to this day- and he’s 25 now- because he’s expecting this guy to show up and catch him any day. I love my son. I fear for his life. I know who the other young man is.. That’s how long this has been going on.’”\n\n“We said ma’am give us information and we’re going to call the other young man’s mother. We’re not going to call your son’s adversary, but we’ll call his mother. So we brought the two mothers together.

It’s a straight route, it connects two major metropolitan areas with enough population density and demand to make money, the land cost is very low, the regulatory environment is extremely favorable. And maybe most importantly, if you’re looking at this not as a one-off build, but as the beginning of a new inftrastructute system that eventually will be continental and global in nature, this one of the absolute best places you could start.

  "latent_19825": "Everything ends badly; otherwise it wouldn’t end.\n\nIn the 1998 cinematic classic Cocktail, Tom Cruise’s character Brian fires off this heart-rending phrase when everything suddenly goes awry. He might as well have been talking about the Minnesota Vikings’ eight-game winning streak.\n\nAfter doing all the little things right and making plays when it mattered most for over two months, the Vikings couldn’t get out of their own way in a mistake-filled 31-24 loss at the hands of the Carolina Panthers. During the win streak, the Vikings had excelled in protecting the ball. On Sunday, they turned the ball over three times.\n\nPat Shurmur had turned the Minnesota offense into a well-oiled red zone machine that finished off drives with ruthless efficiency. Only one of four red zone trips on Sunday ended with a touchdown. In fact, seven of the Vikings’ 13 drives featured a snap inside Carolina’s 40; they netted a grand total of 16 points from the drives.\n\nThe Vikings had the lowest sack rate in the league heading into the game. Case Keenum was sacked six times as the Vikings finished without three of their starters on the offensive line.\n\nThe Vikings were great at stopping the run and preventing big plays for most of the season. Carolina ran for 216 yards including two runs of over 60 yards.\n\nSimply put, the Vikings did everything they didn’t do since their last loss back on October 1, and they paid the price for it. Sunday felt like one of those games during a season on Madden franchise mode where the CPU isn’t going to let you win no matter what you try. (Bill Simmons has famously called it the “No-Effing-Way Game.”)\n\nPersonally, I’m not incredibly concerned about the team going forward. Nor are my fellow Daily Norseman writers. This was the final game in a grueling road gauntlet against a very good Panthers team. Just about everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong, and the Vikings still had an excellent chance to steal the victory at the end. Throughout a 16-game season, even the best teams usually have “one of those days.” The Vikings are finally home again this Sunday and should look much better against the lowly Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThat said, I am worried about the health of the offensive linemen going forward, especially Riley Reiff. Without Reiff, Pat Elflein, and Mike Remmers in the lineup, it suddenly felt a lot like 2016 in all the worst ways. Here’s to hoping that the Vikings’ line can get healthy in time for the playoffs.\n\nAs I like to say when it comes to the Vikings, no need to panic—there will be plenty of time for that later. For now, it’s time for our weekly review of the five biggest plays that had the most impact on Sunday’s outcome.\n\n(This one will be decidedly less fun than the past eight iterations.)\n\nPlay 1: Panthers ball, 3rd &1 at the Carolina 40. First quarter, 11:06 remaining. T.Moton reported in as eligible. J.Stewart right guard for 60 yards, TOUCHDOWN.\n\nYou know what isn’t a good way to start a game on the road against an 8-4 team? Throwing an interception on your first offensive drive and then allowing this on your first defensive drive.\n\nThe Panthers went with an extra offensive lineman—a tactic they employed with a good amount of success yesterday—and Jonathan Stewart was off to the races on the Panthers’ third play from scrimmage. Both Vikings safeties went to the other side of the formation, the linebackers seemed to mix up their gap assignments, and Stewart enjoyed a leisurely 60-yard stroll to the end zone.\n\nBut hey, the Vikings have already spotted a 7-0 lead to their opponents only to shut them down for the rest of the game a handful of times this season. No big deal, right?\n\nPlay 2: Vikings ball, 3rd & Goal at the Carolina 4. Second quarter, 0:20 remaining. (Shotgun) C.Keenum pass short right to A.Thielen for 4 yards, TOUCHDOWN. The Replay Official reviewed the pass completion ruling, and the play was REVERSED. (Shotgun) C.Keenum pass incomplete short right to A.Thielen.\n\nAdam Thielen had a very uncharacteristic drop on first and goal that should have been an easy touchdown.\n\nTwo plays later, it looked like Thielen had made up for his mistake with a nice catch in the back corner of the end zone.\n\nSecure the catch, land on your knee and elbow in the end zone. The ball never even comes close to touching the ground. That’s a catch. Easy enough, right?\n\nOh no. This is the NFL. In order for it to be called a catch, you must catch it, get no fewer than four limbs and five internal organs in bounds, seal the ball in Lucite, get your cleats notarized, and recite the alphabet backwards.\n\nThielen’s tiny bobble after he had already landed in the end zone with the ball cost him another touchdown and cost the Vikings the lead right before halftime. It was the correct call by the letter of the rule. It’s just unfortunate that the letter of the law is incredibly stupid.\n\nBut still, even after 30 minutes of bad bounces and poor play, the Vikings went into the locker room down by a single point. Everything’s fine!\n\nPlay 3: Vikings ball, 1st & 10 at the Minnesota 25. Third quarter, 8:42 remaining. (Shotgun) C.Keenum sacked at MIN 17 for -8 yards (M.Addison). FUMBLES (M.Addison), RECOVERED by CAR-M.Adams at MIN 35. M.Adams to MIN 31 for 4 yards. The Replay Official reviewed the fumble ruling, and the play was Upheld. The ruling on the field was confirmed.\n\nAfter the Panthers marched down the field for a touchdown to open the second half, the Vikings had their chance to answer. Their answer was the strangest sack-fumble I have ever seen.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I have never witnessed a fumble that spiraled forward for 16 yards. Once again, this might have been another case of “correct interpretation of a stupid rule.” It could be argued that Keenum’s hand was “empty” when his arm moved forward, which is technically a fumble. Even though, again, IT WAS A SPIRAL THAT WENT FORWARD SIXTEEN YARDS.\n\nThe Vikings defense held firm and Carolina was forced to settle for a Graham Gano field goal, but the Panthers were up by two scores midway through the third quarter. After this one, perhaps it really wasn’t the Vikings day after all.\n\nPlay 4: Vikings ball, 2nd & 7 at the Carolina 26. Fourth quarter, 8:54 remaining. (No Huddle, Shotgun) C.Keenum pass short right intended for S.Diggs INTERCEPTED by J.Bradberry at CAR 25. J.Bradberry to CAR 28 for 3 yards (S.Diggs).\n\nEven after all the odd plays that didn’t go in Minnesota’s favor, they were still hanging around in the fourth quarter. With under ten minutes into the game, they were moving the ball well and getting close to making it a one-score game.\n\nOr not.\n\nKeenum air mailed a quick throw to the flat, which Stefon Diggs couldn’t bring in, and Daryl Worley pounced on the interception.\n\nSigh. Drive over, game over. Right?\n\nTo quote the late great Billy Mays: BUT WAIT THERE’S MORE!\n\nPlay 5: Panthers ball, 2nd & 5 at the Carolina 30. Fourth quarter, 2:33 remaining. (Shotgun) C.Newton up the middle to MIN 8 for 62 yards (T.Waynes).\n\nEven after all of that, the game was tied with under three minutes remaining! The Vikings scored on their next drive following the Worley interception and Andrew Sendejo picked off a poor pass from Cam Newton to set up the game-tying field goal.\n\nIn my preview for this game, I explained how there had been a lot of “Good Cam” and “Bad Cam” in 2017. The interception was definitely “Bad Cam.” But unfortunately for the Vikings, “Good Cam” showed up in a big way at the end.\n\nYou could make a coffee table book of iconic quarterback runs against the Vikings over the years. Steve Young, Michael Vick, Robert Griffin III, and now this. If you ignore the pretty obvious hold Matt Kalil had on Anthony Barr, this was simply an incredible play by an incredible player. Three plays later, Stewart barely broke the plane for his third touchdown of the day, and that was it. Despite overcoming a bevy of mistakes and taking the Panthers to the wire on the road, the Vikings ultimately came up short.\n\nWith a game this wild, there were a handful of plays that had to end up on the cutting room floor. For instance, the play Riley Reiff was injured, the facemask penalties that kept an early Carolina scoring drive alive, and the Sendejo interception were all huge. But we must keep our integrity and maintain the completely arbitrary number I came up with at the beginning of the season. As always, we welcome your input on which of these plays had the most impact in the poll below. If you think we missed a few others that should have been included, please add them in the comments.",
  "latent_20000": "Follow me on Twitter at @AnthonyCody\n\nThe big headline from the recent Gates/Scholastic survey of teachers is that only 28% of teachers see standardized tests as an essential or important gauge of student assessment, and only 26% say they are accurate as a reflection of student knowledge. Another question reveals part of the reason this may be so - only 45% of teachers think their students take these tests seriously, or perform to the best of their ability.\n\nWe have been stuck in an accountability rut for the past decade, with most reform initiatives revolving around test scores of one sort or another. Even the concept of student learning has been subtly redefined to mean \"achievement on end of year tests.\"\n\nThere are several assumptions that have driven this.\n\nOne. Standardized tests are an adequate, if imperfect means of measuring learning.\n\nTwo. Teacher performance can be captured by the growth of their students on these tests.\n\nThree. There is a significant number of ineffective teachers who are evading detection by current evaluation practices, who will be accurately identified when we begin using test scores or VAM systems as part of our evaluation systems.\n\nThese assumptions are fundamentally challenged by what this survey reveals.\n\nFirst of all, if fewer than half of the teachers believe their students take standardized tests seriously, then how can these tests be used as the basis for any important judgments at all?\n\nBut there is another dimension to the survey that is even more important, because it reveals a doorway to what we all might agree is our common goal, helping our students learn more.\n\nA total of 92% of the teachers surveyed reported that formative, ongoing assessments were absolutely essential or important in measuring student achievement. Furthermore, more than 90% of teachers actively use student performance data of this sort to differentiate instruction, target interventions for students in need of help, and otherwise improve their teaching.\n\nClearly teachers are keeping track of learning, and using this information to guide their instruction. What is more, we are doing it far more effectively than the state is, through its annual tests.\n\nAnother piece of the reform storyline is that teacher opposition to performance pay and VAM-based evaluation systems is based in a fear of accountability. But the survey showed some interesting results here as well. Fully 85% of teachers agree that student growth over the school year should be a part of a teachers' evaluation! However only 36% agree that we should rely on standardized tests for this data.\n\nIs it possible that teachers do not fear accountability, but rather the misapplication of clumsy and unreliable measurements like standardized tests, that their students do not even care about?\n\nAs I wrote recently, it is possible to incorporate student learning into teacher evaluations through a variety of indicators, which do not have the terrible effects we have seen come from attaching ever-higher stakes to standardized tests.\n\nWe need to be careful that we do not simply trade one set of tests for another. Many districts are implementing frequent \"benchmark\" tests, and calling this \"formative assessment.\" This is a sleight-of-hand trick. If we attach high stakes, such as teacher evaluations and student grades to these tests, they could become even more crippling to good teaching than the annual standardized tests. Formative assessment is, as Dr. Myron Atkin explained here a while back,\n\n...working with a student, or a group of students, to develop a course of action that helps bridge the gap between current student knowledge and the desired educational goal. Providing feedback that is usable, detailed, and often individualized is at the heart of this kind of assessment. Formative assessment, so defined, is a pivotal element of everyday classroom teaching. It occurs throughout the school day. It requires collaborative involvement of both teacher and student. And it isn't something purchased from a vendor that can be used in an identical fashion anywhere, like an instruction book or a cooking recipe.\n\nStrengthening this sort of assessment ought to be at the heart of professional development, and the information we gather about how our students are learning should be brought to bear in our evaluations as well.\n\nHow about a different set of assumptions to drive improvement:\n\nOne. Teacher-created, classroom-based assessments are the richest source of data about student learning available.\n\nTwo. Teacher performance can be captured by an evaluation system that looks at how teachers are assessing learning, as well as what those assessments reveal students have learned.\n\nThree. Teachers are seeking to be more effective, and embrace real accountability, when it comes with responsibility, autonomy and support.\n\nThe reforms we would see flow from these assumptions would look very different from the ones we have been struggling over for the past decade.\n\nWhat do you think? Should teacher-driven formative assessment data be honored? Would a shift in our assumptions create a new direction for reform?",

  "latent_20202": "Chernobyl’s New Safe Confinement (NSC) is a design and construction project unprecedented in the history of engineering. Never before has such a huge structure been constructed at a heavily contaminated site.\n\nOvercoming the risks and difficulties inherent in the project required years of groundwork and preparation, as laid down in the Shelter Implementation Plan (SIP). Work on the New Safe Confinement at the site started in late 2010 and construction is scheduled to be completed in 2018. The structure was moved into position in November 2016.\n\nTimelapse video of a unique engineering project. Chernobyl’s giant New Safe Confinement (NSC) is now in position, having been moved 327 metres from its assembly point to its final resting place, enclosing the shelter assembled immediately after the 1986 accident. More videos\n\nThe New Safe Confinement will prevent the release of contaminated material from the present shelter and at the same time protect the structure from external impacts such as extreme weather.\n\nThe new structure is an extraordinary landmark, tall enough to house London’s St Paul’s or Paris’ Notre Dame cathedrals. To minimise the risk of workers’ exposure to radiation, it was assembled in the vicinity of the site and is now being slid into position.\n\nThe New Safe Confinement is 108 metres high and 162 metres long, and has a span of 257 metres and a lifetime of a minimum of 100 years.\n\nThe arch-shaped structure weighs some 36,000 tonnes. Its frame is a huge lattice construction of tubular steel members, supported by two longitudinal concrete beams.\n\nIt provides a safe working environment equipped with heavy duty cranes for the future dismantling of the shelter and waste management after the completion of the NSC.\n\nIt is strong enough to withstand a tornado and its sophisticated ventilation system eliminates the risk of corrosion, ensuring that there is no need to replace the coating and expose workers to radiation during the structure’s lifetime.\n\nThe contract for this unprecedented design and construction project was awarded to the Novarka consortium led by the French construction companies Bouygues and Vinci in 2007.\n\nThe consortium worked with local sub-contractors and others from across the world. For instance, the arch was made of structural elements designed and built in Italy. The cranes were manufactured in the US. The arch cladding contractor was from Turkey, and lifting and sliding operations were carried out by a Dutch company.\n\nContracts were awarded in accordance with the EBRD’s procurement policies and rules and implemented in line with the Bank’s Environmental and Social Policy.\n\nThe New Safe Confinement is a key part of the Shelter Implementation Plan. Its construction was financed via the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, managed by the EBRD on behalf of the contributors to the Fund.",
  "latent_20269": "November 23, 2015\n\nUnfortunately, Bowers, a Democrat, undermined the position by drawing the poor analogy with fellow Democrat Franklin Roosevelt’s interning of Americans of Japanese descent during WWII (note: some Americans of German and Italian descent were also interned). George Takei, famous for playing Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu in the original Star Trek series and for, more recently, boldly going where no space traveler had gone before, was quick to chime in. As he wrote on Facebook, \"The internment (not a ‘sequester’) was not of Japanese ‘foreign nationals,’ but of Japanese Americans, two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens.” Most of Takei’s other commentary is nonsense, mostly because he equates a low-crime, mostly American-citizen population with unknown-quantity individuals of the demographic responsible for virtually all the world’s terrorism.\n\nRoanoke, Virginia, mayor David Bowers has just created a stir by suggesting that Syrian migrants be placed in internment camps. I found his comments interesting because, if we are going to have the Muslim so-called “refugees,” I also consider placement in camps a must.\n\nIt’s also nonsense because we have no legal obligation to accept foreigners of any kind if it’s contrary to our national interests. And I oppose — completely and without reservation — accepting any Muslim migrants whatsoever. I do believe we should help the persecuted Mideast Christians, although, even in their case, the aid should meet certain criteria. If we are going to accept migrants, however, it is imperative they be placed in some of the many FEMA camps our government has been spending good tax money building in recent years. Note that camp placement is precisely what Turkey does with the migrants.\n\nBefore elaborating further on this, the migrant issue must be properly defined. Reports tell us that 75 or 80 percent of the migrants are military-age males in generally good health; this relative absence of women and children belies the notion that these are desperate people fleeing for their lives. Moreover, there’s much reason to fear that these migrants are, as Donald Trump has put it, a “Trojan horse” for terrorist infiltration.\n\nFirst consider that Syria’s ambassador to India, Riad Abbas, has warned that more than 20 percent of Muslim migrants entering Europe may have ties to ISIS-linked groups. As he put it, reports Sputnik, \"Among the refugees, who went to Europe, maybe more than 20 percent belong to ISIL groups. Now Europe has received bad element[s] into their ground. They will face further problem[s] in future.”\n\nThen consider Dr. Mudar Zahran, a Muslim asylum seeker and leader of the Jordanian opposition residing in the U.K. On an October segment of “The Glazov Gang” he warned that Europe should not accept the Muslim migrants, as they were ushering in the “Islamic conquest of the West.” Furthermore, he stated that 75 percent of the migrants were not even Syrian and then said that:\n\n75 percent of those arriving from Syria come from safe area[s]; actually, the ones in disaster areas cannot … leave. So, actually, as much as there’s a disaster in Syria, most of those people arriving do in fact do not need the protection; they arrive from Turkey, they arrive from Jordan, they arrive from other places which are safe. In addition, those people are … bypassing poor European countries; they’re going to Turkey, Hungary, and other places like Bulgaria and settling in Germany, where there is a rich nation with a generous welfare system.\n\nHe also characterizes the migration as the fulfillment of “the Islamic … dreams of fascism of some” and says that what Muslims “couldn’t do in the last 20 years, now the West is doing for us for free — and even paying for it.” In addition, Zahran delivered this shocking news about the “invasion”: “I have to be honest,” he said, “you read Arab magazines and Arab newspapers; they are talking about, ‘Good job! Now we’re going to conquest [sic] Europe.’ So it’s not even a secret.”\n\nThere’s still more. According to American Thinker’s Sierra Rayne , a Pew Research Center poll indicates there may be three-hundred million ISIS supporters in the Muslim world. What this means is that if we accept unvetted Muslim migrants, one out of six could be supporters of a group that that crucifies Christians, kills children, drowns people in cages and sets them on fire.\n\nAnd unvetted they will be. Despite Obama administration assurances that our authorities have cracker-jack screening procedures, the thorough databases necessary for vetting simply do not exist, as this article well illustrates.\n\nEven if they did, though, vetting has a fundamental flaw: It only tells you about people’s past.\n\nNot their future.\n\n(Vetting can’t read minds, and people can change, as I explained here .)\n\nAnd terrorist acts of concern occur in the future.\n\nOf course, people could disagree with the aforementioned numbers; they may even believe Obama’s claims about vetting. Yet there’s a more basic problem, one almost universally ignored and whose solution is irrefutable within reason’s realm. Let’s assume that the migrants in question truly are refugees.\n\nWell, they belong in refugee camps.\n\nWhy on Earth are we giving them the “keys to the city” and dispersing these unknown quantities in towns around the nation? This is at best criminal negligence.\n\nNote that providing camps is what most nations do. Our camps would be humane; the refugees would have quality food and drink and adequate shelter. But remember that granting safe haven is a favor, and there’s a difference between charitable saviors and schlemiels on wheels.\n\nA reason we depart from this sane solution brings us to a second universally ignored problem. As I pointed out recently, if a desperate person came through your area, you might feed him, provide some clothing and even house him for a while.\n\nYou don’t generally make him part of your family and let him share in decisions influencing your family’s fortunes and future. The point?\n\nWe have conflated refugee status with citizenship, when the two should have nothing whatsoever do to with each other. Providing safe haven is one thing, but when the threat in the stranger’s native land recedes, he should return.\n\nWhy have we departed from this sanity? Obviously, people today don’t like the sound of “camps” (so call them “ObamaCare Refugee Exchanges”). But there’s another reason:\n\nObama and his co-conspirators don’t care about these migrants. Oh, they very much want them to live…in America. Because only then can they become part of a growing demographic that votes 70 to 90 percent for socialistic Democrats. Only then can they be used to further balkanize our nation. Only then can the “fundamental transformation” of our country be accelerated.\n\nAs to this, I reported in March on an alleged Obama administration plan to use foreigners as “seedlings” who will “navigate, not assimilate” as they “take over the host,” create a “country within a country” and start “pushing the citizens into the shadows” (more details here ). And, of course, you can’t seed communities throughout the nation if you keep your seed in camps.\n\nBut if you want to diminish the sense of nationhood and thus the desire to maintain sovereignty, and dilute traditionalist, red-state will and thus negate nullification movements and turn sanity blue, “seeding” via amnesty and “refugee resettlement” is the way to do it. Once the ice is broken and a foreign population is established in an area, family members and others come — and all of them will outbreed the natives.",
  "latent_20428": "Aubrey Drake Graham did this to the universe of oxygen-inhaling humans with Internet connections last night.\n\nThis is the artwork for his highly anticipated upcoming album, Nothing Was the Same, set to be released on September 24.\n\nIf you’re seeing this image for the first time, I envy you. Cherish this moment, because the thoughts you’re having can never be replicated.\n\nLast night, driving through Montana, I received a text from a friend that simply said “Aubz.” Since this is my equivalent of a Bat-Signal, I pulled over in a Motel 6 parking lot to see what was up.\n\nUpon seeing it, my initial reaction (and probably yours) was to make fun of Drake for thinking this was a cool idea. For signing off on this as the art for his album, a musical project that one assumes he cares about.\n\nRight after that, 10 minutes of laughing at Drake for his clear inspiration.\n\nYou know, the Michael Jackson–Eddie Murphy tour-de-force-in-the-clouds that was “Whatzupwitu.”\n\nThe thought of Drake up late one night, writing a verse about the pain he feels finding out that the girl he loves has been sending Snapchats to multiple guys and not just him, and then turning on MTV Jams, seeing this video, and suddenly knowing what his cover art would be, is a thought I enjoy having.\n\nFollowing this, a bout of confusion. Because there are so many questions.\n\nWhy is that little boy looking at Drake, but Drake’s refusing to look at the little boy? He’s all like, Hey Drake, it’s me and Drake’s all like I want that hair pick. Also, has Drake always looked so much like Nala?\n\nThe final stage of this initial reaction is to wonder why Drake would do this to himself. Why would he open himself up to so much predictable mockery?\n\nWhy would he give us the pleasure of laughing at his expense?\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Drake is a humanitarian. He’s not doing anything “to himself.” He’s doing things “for us.”\n\nHe wants us to laugh. At his expense.\n\nI’m convinced of it.\n\nHe knows he’s pulled a fast one on the world, making the transition from The N to claiming that he’s going to give Halle Berry a baby and that no one can stop him. So, because of that, things like this album cover are his way of saying thank you for letting him live out his dreams.\n\nSo laugh away, people with eyes.\n\nDrake wants us to.",
  "latent_20552": "The Bermuda Triangle, that decades-old center of odd aeronautical and oceanic lore, is now the focus of multiple films at different studios. The Caribbean area that has been said to be a mysterious danger zone for planes and ships is a great location for a thriller, especially because factors as varied as alien influence and Atlantis are used to explain the supposed disappearance of various craft.\n\nEarlier this year, Universal set a team to work rewriting a Bermuda Triangle movie pitch that had been sitting at the studio since 2012. Now the Triangle has snared Skydance, the company behind Paramount efforts such as Terminator: Genisys and the recent Mission: Impossible films, as well.\n\nTHR reports that Skydance has set Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard (the team which wrote the Nic Cage action/fantasy The Sorcerer’s Apprentice) to rewrite an original script by Friday the 13th reboot writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift.\n\nThat mirrors the Universal development, where screenwriters Juliet Snowden and Stiles White (Ouija) are scripting an untitled Bermuda Triangle movie based on a 2012 pitch by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.\n\nThe Bermuda Triangle, unfortunately, isn’t really a thing. It’s a conceptual relic based in ’50s and ’60s pulp magazine lore, popularized in the ’70s by the “non-fiction” book The Bermuda Triangle.\n\nThe Triangle has very loosely-defined boundaries, depending on what source is discussing it. Its “mysteries” are lore that was built out of embellished and, in some cases, totally fabricated stories. The region said to include the Triangle is actually very heavily trafficked by both planes and ships, and poses no unusual danger to anyone.\n\nThe fact that the truth of the Bermuda Triangle is nothing more than rumor, however, means writers can do whatever they want. And we still love tales of mysterious happenings at sea, so there’s probably a real audience for at least one of these films.\n\nEdit: There’s also a third Bermuda Triangle movie in development, at Warner Bros., based on a Daniel Kunka script that WB picked up in 2013 and has been working up as an action project.\n\n[Header image via LiveScience]",
  "latent_20557": "White House Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway waits for the arrival of Trump in the Roosevelt Room at the White House on Jan. 31 in Washington. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn the catalog of horror and national humiliation that constitutes the first 20 days of Donald Trump’s presidency, Kellyanne Conway’s squalid shilling for Ivanka Trump merchandise is a fairly small thing. It pales beside the stories of families torn apart by Trump’s executive order on immigration; the botched raid in Yemen; Trump’s refusal to extricate himself from his labyrinthine conflicts of interests; his ostensibly “lighthearted” threat to invade Mexico; his idiotic feud with the prime minister of Australia; his elevation of conspiracy-obsessed white-nationalist cranks to the highest levels of government power; and the numbing fusillade of lies about matters both grave and petty that issue from his administration every day. Nevertheless, it is rare—even, so far, under Trump—for a high official to unambiguously violate the law on national television. Conway’s transgression may not be terribly serious, but the urgency of holding her to account is.\n\nLet’s recap. This is day two of the Trump administration’s dispute with Nordstrom, the department-store chain that has stopped carrying Ivanka Trump’s clothing line because of poor sales. On Wednesday, Trump tweeted an attack on Nordstrom from his personal Twitter account, then retweeted it from his @POTUS account. His hapless press secretary, Sean Spicer, defended Trump’s conduct, saying that Nordstrom’s refusal to sell the president’s daughter’s fashion line was “a direct attack on his policies and her name.” Thursday morning, Kellyanne Conway appeared on Fox and Friends and urged viewers: “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff … I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody; you can find it online.”\n\nAll of this was a shameful farce, but only Conway’s comments appear to be illegal. Federal ethics law for administrative employees says this:\n\nAn employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member, and persons with whom the employee has or seeks employment or business relations.\n\nThere is simply no question that Conway was endorsing Ivanka Trump’s product.\n\nUsually, demonstrating official misconduct is more complicated than this. There are paper trails to examine and explain, or narrative ambiguities that allow sufficiently motivated partisans to at least argue that nothing untoward happened. Conway’s statement was so clearly and frankly egregious that it even earned a rebuke from Peter Schweizer, author of Clinton Cash and a close associate of Trump aide Steve Bannon. “To encourage Americans to buy goods from companies owned by the first family is totally out of bounds and needs to stop,” he told the Washington Post. Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, tells me: “This reminds me a little bit of Donald Trump’s statement during the campaign that he could shoot somebody, and nobody could do anything about it. It’s pretty blatant.”\n\nIt’s so blatant, in fact, that House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, told the Associated Press on Thursday afternoon that Conway’s behavior was “wrong, wrong, wrong, clearly over the line, unacceptable.” He said that he and Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings were sending a letter to the White House and the Office of Government Ethics asking for an investigation.\n\nUltimately, though, unless Congress wants to open an investigation itself, disciplinary action against Conway would have to come from the White House or the Department of Justice, and it’s not clear that either would put the law above loyalty to the Trump family. The Office of Government Ethics can write a letter recommending some sort of sanction, but according to Noble, it doesn’t see itself as an enforcement agency. “The system is based on the assumption that people are going to want to follow the law or enforce it,” he says. In 20 days, this administration has exploded that assumption. “They are stress-testing our democracy,” says Noble. “What happens if the administration just refuses to follow the laws and Congress doesn’t want to do anything about it?” We might be about to find out.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 9, 6:40 p.m.: Chaffetz and Cummings have sent a letter to the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter M. Shaub Jr., requesting a review of Conway’s “unacceptable” statements.",

  "latent_20590": "Alexandria, Va. – In the American Geosciences Institute’s newest Status of the Geoscience Workforce Report, released May 2014, jobs requiring training in the geosciences continue to be lucrative and in-demand. Even with increased enrollment and graduation from geoscience programs, the data still project a shortage of around 135,000 geoscientists by the end of the decade.\n\n“Industry has recognized, and is mitigating the upcoming shortage of skilled geoscientists in their employ, but the federal geoscience workforce is still demonstrably shrinking” report author Carolyn Wilson said, noting that the federal geoscience workforce decreased in all sectors except meteorology; this includes geoscientists skilled in the energy, mining/minerals and hydrology fields. Combined with continued unevenness is the workforce readiness of many geoscience graduates and a regionally hot job market, the geosciences are a dynamic component of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe 2014 report not only covers the state of geoscience workforce and education in the K-12, universities, and major employers, but the role of 2-Year Colleges in the development of the future geoscience workforce is closely examined. The number of graduating geoscience majors who started their degrees at a two-year colleges has increased. This pool of talent represents a major area of potential growth in the geosciences as the discipline seeks to narrow the human capital deficits.\n\n“Most importantly there is incredible potential for institutions to recruit from the diverse talent pools arising at two year institutions, and many career opportunities available to students enrolled in geoscience programs, and early-career geoscientists entering the workforce,” Wilson said. Plus, this is the first time we have seen a major shift in employment patterns in over a generation, with increasing number of bachelor recipients securing geoscience positions, and newly minted Master’s finding themselves in high demand.\n\nMore information on the report and links to purchasing the digital or print versions is available from the AGI website: http://www.americangeosciences.org/workforce/reports/status-report-2014\n\n###\n\nThe American Geosciences Institute is a nonprofit federation of 49 geoscientific and professional associations that represents more than 250,000 geologists, geophysicists and other earth scientists. Founded in 1948, AGI provides information services to geoscientists, serves as a voice of shared interests in the profession, plays a major role in strengthening geoscience education, and strives to increase public awareness of the vital role the geosciences play in society’s use of resources, resiliency to natural hazards, and interaction with the environment.",

  "latent_20673": "news, latest-news, barnaby joyce, citizenship, new zealand, tamworth, larissa waters, scott ludlum, malcolm roberts, deputy prime minister\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce referred himself to the High Court after it was revealed he inherited dual citizenship through his father, who was born in New Zealand. But he’s not the first politician to get caught up in a citizenship drama in recent months. Since July, four other politicians have been caught out – Greens senators Scott Ludlum (New Zealand) and Larissa Waters (Canada), Nationals MP Matt Canavan (Italy) and One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts (United Kingdom). The Greens senators stepped down and Mr Canavan stood aside from as Minister for Resources and Northern Australia while the matter goes before the High Court. Mr Robert’s case will also go before the High Court. As the Deputy Prime Minister and a man who is always good for a colourful quote, it’s only natural that Mr Joyce was asked for his thoughts on the matter. Here’s what he said. “You’ve got to be really careful, if you start throwing stones when something was an honest oversight because you bet your life the stone will come back and hit you. “Unfortunately that’s the law. It’s like if you’re driving down the road without a licence and you get pulled over, well you’re in a spot of bother. “They were members of parliament, but it’s quiet clear on Section 44, you can’t be a member of parliament and have dual citizenship - it's black and white. “I don’t think it is [time to have a look at Section 44 of the constitution], I think you've just got to do your homework and make sure you're not a citizen of two countries when you stand for parliament. “Now Larissa said she believed that was not the case, and I’m sure that would be the outcome for Scott Ludlum, but unfortunately, ignorance is not an excuse. “There is nothing malicious about it, I don’t think they were being sneaky, but they were outside what Section 44 explicitly says.” “It was without a shadow of a doubt that we never believed that this would be the chain of events because this has happened without his consent “And he was 25 years old at the time. And without his knowledge. He never signed a form. And, of course, one would presume that if something happens without your knowledge, and without your consent, then it's probably an invalid process. “This was something that, two days ago, took us all by surprise when we found out that he was registered as an Italian citizen. That's not saying that the registration is valid. “That's still got to be checked, that it's actually valid, because the premise being can you be signed up for something you never signed up for? “The premise being, how can you be signed up for something you never signed up for? That you never actually knew about?” “You can use the hypothetical that if Libya decided they were going to sign me up as a Libyan without my knowledge, that I would be Libyan. It's an absurdity. “My grandmother is English. I'm working on the presumption I'm not English. I've never been to England.” “Obviously if we have a suspicion (about Senator Roberts), we’ll check it up.”\n\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/n8uGJwMg95DiH9D4L9ShGa/5374c04d-eb36-408f-956a-c7cbc2f4c6eb.jpg/r0_1040_11339_7447_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg",
  "latent_20720": "This week, Tesla invited journalists to an announcement at the company's base in Hawthorne, California, in which Elon Musk is expected to give details about a new product unrelated to his line of electric cars. Tesla’s next big thing is widely believed to be a stationary battery, which will power homes, offices, and industrial spaces with stored energy.\n\nReports from The Wall Street Journal suggest that Tesla will devote as much as 25 percent of the capacity of its new $5 billion gigafactory, currently being built in Reno, Nevada, to the production of large battery packs for homes and businesses.\n\nOne of the most difficult things about energy distribution is that demand fluctuates dramatically during the day as households use more electricity in the morning and evening and hardly use any during the day while most people are at work. That problem can be multiplied with renewable energy sources, which suffer from supply fluctuations as well—energy is in abundant supply when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, but production drops off as the weather changes. Cost-effective heavy-duty batteries could help store excess energy and smooth out the issues caused by resource inefficiency.\n\nStill, just because Tesla has had success building car batteries doesn't guarantee it will have success in the stationary battery industry. Venkat Viswanathan, an assistant professor for mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, told Ars over the phone today that cost effectiveness has to be at the forefront for a company trying to sell energy storage units.\n\n\"A car battery needs to be compact, it has to be light, so it can be more expensive than a battery for a stationary market, [where] space is not a constraint and weight is not a constraint,\" Viswanathan said. Especially for businesses looking for economies of scale, alternatives like compressed air energy storage will compete with stationary batteries in cost.\n\nFor individual homes, however, it might make more sense to invest in a battery, but again, cost will be a major issue when space isn't a factor. Tesla's lithium-ion batteries, which will be produced in partnership with Panasonic at its gigafactory, will have to compete intensely with products using cheaper electrodes and electrolytes. (Lead-acid batteries are one example, but several companies and research centers are also experimenting with materials that have advantages over the tried-and-true).\n\nTesla has already built stationary batteries for homes in partnership with SolarCity, a solar panel company that has Tesla CEO Elon Musk as a chairman. SolarCity says it has installed 300 Tesla-branded energy storage units in homes so far. Traditionally, people with solar panels on their roofs sell the excess electricity made during the day back to power companies and then buy power from power companies at night. With a battery pack, a house equipped with solar panels can be more self-sufficient.\n\n\"Tesla's long history of research and development has enabled a cost-effective, wall-mounted storage appliance that is small, powerful and covered by a long lasting full 10 year warranty,” SolarCity’s website says of the Tesla battery unit being used in the pilot program. \"The actual battery unit is about the size of a solar power inverter, and will be mounted on the wall in your garage or near your electrical panel.”\n\nViswanathan told Ars that buying a battery for energy storage won't make sense in all markets, but in some places, like Hawaii or Scandinavia, where solar and wind energy penetration is high, it could make economic sense for a household to buy a stationary battery. \"There’s lots of people who are far removed from the grid, and the stability of the grid is not guaranteed,\" Viswanathan told Ars. \"I would imagine even places like Japan and South Korea might benefit from something like this. In those places such a product makes perfect sense, especially if you’ve already gone halfway there by installing solar panels.\"\n\nThe WSJ says that SolarCity told California regulators last year that it cost $23,429 to install a stationary battery in a home. The solar power company is letting its pilot participants pay the battery off in monthly installations over 10 years. In leveraging the economies of scale that come with operating its gigafactory, Tesla may be able to reduce the cost of stationary batteries.\n\nStill, stationary batteries haven't become widespread yet, in part because there's been little demand for them from households, and in part because developing deploying units to store energy is expensive. Thus far, governments have largely stepped in to spur further research. In March, the Los Angeles Times reported that the California Public Utilities Commission will require three of the state’s largest electricity providers to install 1,300 megawatts of storage capacity by 2024. It also noted that PG&E has received several million dollars in grants from the state to conduct experiments to further energy storage.\n\nThe stationary battery market is also not a sector that Tesla will go into unchallenged—LG Chem, Samsung SMI, and AES Corp all make stationary batteries too, according to Bloomberg.\n\nDespite what we know about what Tesla may announce tomorrow at 8pm PST, there are still many unknowns. What will this next run of batteries cost? How much energy will they be able to store? Will Tesla announce any partnerships that will help sell stationary batteries to homeowners satisfied with their service on the traditional power grid?\n\nViswanathan told Ars he'll be watching to see what Musk announces regarding the battery's warranty—\"If I'm a homeowner... I would expect a much bigger warranty\" than Tesla gives on its vehicle batteries, he said. Also, he said, he'll be curious about the battery's projected cost: \"the costs are going to come down substantially year after year,\" Viswanathan told Ars. \"The number I would be interested in is what the target number is three years down.\"\n\nArs will look for answers to all these questions and more tomorrow night at Tesla’s event, so stay tuned!",

The second draft of the order removed Iraq from this list, and both are currently held up in court.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the countries in attendance. Saudi Arabia has invited Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who the International Criminal Court has a warrant for regarding war crimes in Darfur, to the summit with Trump, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMcMaster said the speech would be given at a lunch with leaders of more than 50 Muslim countries, although he did not specify what leaders would be in attendance and from what countries.\n\nMcMaster did say that Trump would be holding bilateral meeting with members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, but none of those countries are part of that group.\n\nThe speech will likely draw increased attention to what is already supposed to be a high profile trip, given his rhetoric about Muslims in the United States, which many pundits and Democrats have deemed discriminatory. Trump’s attempt to implement a travel ban followed his call on the campaign trail for a “complete and total shutdown” of Muslims entering the United States.\n\n“The common thread linking the major Islamic terrorist attacks that have occurred on our soil — 9/11, the Ft.

My main task is to develop code (as a PMC committer for Apache Tika) for the unique needs of the polar science community, specifically, expanding text and metadata extraction for scientific data formats.\n\nYour bio says \"evangelist for the involvement of women in ASF.\" What efforts are you and the Apache Software Foundation making to get more women involved?\n\nFor starters, I’ll talk to anyone who will listen about getting more women involved in tech! At ApacheCon this year, I’m organizing the first Women of ASF luncheon. While this is a small step, it will provide a forum for us to come together and address, as a community, how to get more women involved in ASF.\n\nYour talk at ApacheCon is about cool insights into polar data. Without giving too much away, what do you plan to cover?\n\nWith so many data portals and repositories available, it is often difficult for polar scientists to find the data they need. I am going to show some of the new features we have added to Apache Tika to make polar data more searchable. I’ll also show some examples of how these new features can help polar scientists pose new types of search queries. Have no fear—I’ll also show some photos of cold, icy places and the “cool” data that we collect there.\n\nYou'll be discussing Apache Tika in your talk. What other open source technology do you use to gather polar data?\n\nApache Nutch and Apache Solr!\n\nApacheCon North America 2015 will be held April 13-16 in Austin, Texas. You can catch Annie's talk on Monday, April 13.\n\nApacheCon 2015\n\nSpeaker Interview\n\nThis article is part of the Speaker Interview Series for ApacheCon 2015. ApacheCon North America brings together the open source community to learn about the technologies and projects driving the future of open source and more. The conference takes place in Austin, TX from April 13-16, 2015.",

Sadly the distance it can see is very limited but it feels good to drop bombs on a target and seeing the explosion instead of just flying over.\n\nWe plan to add support for \"local versions\" (Czech Republic, Hungary, Thailand, South Africa and even a Brazil version even if it doesn't exists today) by use of a module.\n\nThis isn't done and waiting for this would had meant the Gripen would be released a month later or more. There are a few other issues and bugs are only seen close up in the arsenal.\n\nPlan is to fix them and add additional details in the cockpit but I think for 99% of all missions, the Gripen is good enough. Let us know what you think!\n\nTask Force Radio\n\nThis makes me really happy, if you don't use TFR or if you use ACRE2, nothing will happen and you mission will run as normal when you launch SFP.\n\nIf you start SFP with TFR however the Swedish soldiers will instead of an default TFR radio they will get a Swedish Radio 180 developed by Ericsson.\n\nRb 17, Hellfire Launcher\n\nIn Sweden a Rb17 system (not sure if developed elsewhere) is used by small group of soldiers that carry a launcher + the hellfire missile. They got out to a small Island and set it up.\n\nAnother group goes to an Island further out and use laser designators to call in a hellfire strike on a enemy ship. This is part of the Swedish costal defence, very mobile and tricky to find group with heavy firepower.\n\nSkyddsmask 90, Gas mask\n\nLastly I would like to mention our Gas mask, very simple but perfect for zombie missions or NBC scenarios.\n\nOther fixes\n\nMinor things includes fixing a shadow on the AK 5 from a grip that didn't exists.\n\nThe anti tank helicopter (hkp 9) now got gyrostablized sight.\n\nIkv 91 had a glitch that been fixed and a few minor more techincal fixes.\n\nv0.5.3\n\nAdded the Hkp 4, (Ch 46 Sea Knight), a very iconic helicopter in Sweden.\n\nAdded the UAV 01, the first UAV Sweden had. It was bought 1999 from France. Launches from a ramp.\n\nAdded \"random vest\" for some of the modern soldier.\n\nAdded AK 5 alternative with the new plastic transparent mags.\n\nDesert and woodland units are now in two different factions to better support Alive.\n\nFixed several vehicles that had \"wood\" instead of metal as armor.\n\nHkp 9 can now switch textures in the virtual arsenal.\n\nBlue Convoy mission fixed, broken before due to classname changes.\n\nDesert helmet no longer have an woodland icon.\n\nIts now possible to place Swedish anti tank mines in the editor.\n\nFixed incorrect classname on the Desert machinegunner.\n\nAnd a few more technical fixes and improvements.\n\n- Community Base addons A3\n\nForum topic:\n\n- BI forums\n\n- Armaholic forums\n\nSteam Workshop:\n\n- Subscribe\n\nYou are using our website as a guest.

  "latent_21654": "Alex Nogales of the National Latino Media Council discusses the major television networks' \"report card\" on diversity in hiring, at a news conference in Los Angeles Thursday, Dec. 7, 2006. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon)\n\nThe NAACP and several other major civil rights groups have emerged as flashpoints in the debate over net neutrality, the idea that all Internet traffic should be treated equally.\n\nMore than 40 civil rights groups are supporting broadband providers that oppose strict net neutrality rules. The civil rights groups say they're siding with the Internet giants because it's in the best interest of minority communities.\n\nYet critics say many of those groups are against stronger net neutrality rules because they've received substantial funding from Internet providers. Many of the civil rights groups currently siding with the broadband giants also supported the controversial Comcast-NBC Universal merger, came out in favor of AT&T's failed takeover of T-Mobile in 2011, and supported broadband providers the last time the Federal Communications Commission ruled on net neutrality back in 2010.\n\nWhile all the civil rights groups say that net neutrality is a good idea, they disagree on how to enforce it. Some groups, including Color of Change and the Center for Media Justice, want the FCC to have more authority over Internet providers to ensure those providers don't discriminate against certain content. They also say that if net neutrality is weakened and Internet providers are allowed to charge companies to speed up their traffic, it will lead to higher costs being passed on to consumers -- which could have a disproportionate effect on minorities, many of whom already struggle to afford basic broadband connections.\n\nOther groups, including the NAACP and the National Urban League, side with Internet providers and oppose subjecting those companies to greater oversight. They claim strict net neutrality rules would deter broadband companies from expanding service in their communities, preventing more minorities from adopting the Internet.\n\nBut some civil rights leaders say the different opinions are more than just an honest policy dispute. Alex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, a media watchdog group, claims that many minority groups side with Internet providers on net neutrality because they fear they will lose funding otherwise.\n\n\"If you have programs with any of these companies, you feel beholden to go along with what they believe,\" said Nogales, whose group supports strict net neutrality rules.\n\nCivil rights groups tend to play an influential role when the government makes policy decisions that affect communities of color, so their stance on net neutrality is significant. The FCC has made it a top priority to ensure that minorities have equal access to the Internet and aren't left behind in the digital age.\n\nEarlier this month, the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council, a nonprofit that aims to promote civil rights, filed comments with the FCC on behalf of more than 40 minority groups. The letter sided with Internet providers in opposing strict net neutrality rules that subject those companies to more oversight.\n\nThe Minority Media and Telecommunications Council received at least $725,000 in donations and sponsorships between 2009 and 2011 from net neutrality opponents, including Verizon, Time Warner and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, according to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nIn an interview, David Honig, the group's president, said the funding it receives from the telecom industry was not essential to its operations and did not influence its position on net neutrality. He said the council receives support from companies on both sides of the debate and that it opposes Internet providers on other policy issues.\n\nHonig told HuffPost he found it \"saddening\" that because his group received funding from Internet providers, critics are saying \"somehow we must have been bought.\"\n\nAnother organization that has sided with Internet providers on net neutrality is the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC. On its website, the group lists Comcast, AT&T and Verizon among the members of its \"corporate alliance,\" an advisory board. In 2006, AT&T gave LULAC $1.5 million to build technology centers in low-income Hispanic communities. In 2008, Verizon gave the group $1 million to improve literacy among Hispanic children.\n\nIn an interview, Brent Wilkes, national executive director of LULAC, said that accepting contributions from Internet providers should not prevent minority groups from taking sides on the issue. He also denied that his group's position had been influenced by industry donations.\n\n\"We take our stance based on what we believe are the best interests of the Latino community, and we have not been pressured by these companies,\" Wilkes said.\n\nIn 2009, AT&T gave at least $1 million to the NAACP. The NAACP did not return a request for comment from The Huffington Post, but William Barber, president of the group's North Carolina chapter, told Politico in 2011 that the NAACP's endorsement of AT&T's acquisition bid for T-Mobile was unrelated to AT&T's financial contributions to the group.\n\nIt's not uncommon for civil rights groups to receive support from companies on both sides of the issue, given that net neutrality affects everyone who uses the Internet and nonprofits often rely on corporate money to support their work in the community.\n\nNogales, of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, for example, serves on the diversity advisory council for Comcast, which opposes strict net neutrality rules. Nogales' relationship with Comcast has survived despite their opposing views, he said.\n\nBut after his group began calling in 2010 for stronger net neutrality rules, Verizon officials stopped returning Nogales' calls and donating money to his organization, he said. Over the course of previous years, Verizon had donated a total of $15,000 to the coalition.

  "latent_21702": "I spend a lot of time thinking and writing about climbing performance, movement analysis, and program design for climbing, etc; but none of it means a dam thing if we don’t tie in properly; or if the pads aren’t placed correctly.\n\nI’ve been thinking about safety because a friend had a terrible accident in a gym two weeks ago. It appears that the cause of the accident is that he did not tie in.\n\nAs a climber of over 30 years, accidents are not new to me, and I have lost a few friends along the way. When I was 16 an older friend and mentor died soloing Ice on Mt. Washington. A few years later Kevin Bein the great Gunkie climbing died when a rappel anchor pulled on him. When I was about 21 in a short period of time I saw or heard about a number of accidents that occurred due to tie-in errors. I counted ten people I knew, all with more than 10 years climbing experience that did not tie in at all, or who did not tie in properly. In response, a friend suggested that everyone check their knot three times prior to climbing, in this order:\n\n1- Tie in, then check your knot.\n\n2- Put on climbing shoes, then check your knot.\n\n3- Step up to the route, then check your knot.\n\n(being a bit of a chicken I also tend to check my knot before taking, or lowering off.)\n\nWhen discussing these accidents and near accidents it became clear that in many cases the climber was distracted by something while tying in. Someone asked them a question, or handed them something. So its important to not hand a climber anything, or do anything that can drawn their attention away from tying their knot.\n\nAlso, we are all in it together, it is the belayer’s job to check the climber’s knot and the climber’s job to check the device. No matter how much experience we have, no matter how many climbs we do per year, we need to always do this one simple and mundane thing that can prevent life changing horrors from occurring. The closest I ever came to a horrible accident was when I took a lead fall, and my belayer’s beiner was not locked. The gate opened, the device slipped out, but was caught on the notch in the nose of the beiner. I missed a 40 foot ground fall onto talus by millimeters. It was just dumb luck that I didn’t die that day.\n\nIn the gym sprains, dislocations and broken bones happen on a regular basis. The main factor? Missing or hitting the very edge of a bouldering pad. It only takes a few second to check the pads and make adjustments. Yet it’s so easy to just climb and not deal with it.\n\nWhatever it takes find a way to remind yourself to do a proper safety check. Among a certain set of climbers I used to hear the phrase “Smoke pot? Check your knot!”\n\nTalking to my friend Drew on the phone the other day he mentioned that he and his daughter Mason came up with this new one:\n\n“Check your knot twice, then the device.” (TM Mason Bedford)\n\nDrew had another more colorful one:\n\n“Check yer F***’n knot or I’ll kick your A**!”\n\nWhat ever works, please, please, please just do it.\n\nWhat would be a good phrase to use to remind boulderers to check pad placement prior to climbing?",

  "latent_22236": "Vote for me to stop Donald Trump. That is Sen. Marco Rubio's message to Florida voters this week as the Republican establishment desperately tries to prevent the billionaire from winning the Republican nomination for president and completing a hostile takeover of the party. It's a weak argument from a weak candidate who is not prepared to be president.\n\nThroughout his political career, Rubio has focused on promoting himself and preparing for his next move rather than providing leadership to effectively address the challenges of the moment. Relying on a charming personality and a smooth speaking style, he has been more talk than action, more gimmick than substance, more opportunist than committed public servant. The result is a thin resume, a reputation for failing to pay attention to detail and a tendency to bend when the political winds shift.\n\nLet's remember that as the second-youngest speaker of the Florida House, Rubio's big gimmick was a blank book that he filled with 100 ideas that ranged from education reforms to promoting alternative energy. Yet during his speakership between 2006 and 2008, less than a quarter of those ideas became law. He gave up on his boldest idea, a regressive proposal to eliminate property taxes on primary homes in exchange for a gradual 2.5-cent sales tax increase, when the Senate wisely refused to go along.\n\nLet's remember the other highlights of Rubio's time in Tallahassee. It was while he was House speaker that Rep. Ray Sansom inserted $6 million into the state budget for a community college building that was really an airport hangar sought by a friend. It was Rubio who made it a priority for his friends on the state appellate court to get the $48 million \"Taj Mahal\" courthouse in Tallahassee. It was Rubio who charged thousands of dollars to his Republican Party credit card for personal expenses such as repairs to the family minivan that he says he repaid. So much for the fiscal responsibility Rubio likes to preach.\n\nLet's remember that Rubio's single term in the U.S. Senate has been devoid of a single significant accomplishment, unless we count a successful sneak attack on a small portion of the Affordable Care Act. He rose to national prominence as a key member of a bipartisan group of senators who passed sweeping immigration reform. True to form, Rubio abandoned it when the heat was turned up by opponents, and he has spent much of this campaign trying to explain himself without satisfying anyone.\n\nRubio is a leader in Washington in one respect: He has missed more votes than any other senator in the past 12 months. To be fair, that is only slightly worse than Barack Obama's Senate voting record for the same period in the run-up to the 2008 election, PolitiFact reports. But the fact-checkers also show that Rubio's voting record is worse than Obama's in nine of the 12 previous quarters before the presidential election. The best argument for a promotion is a stellar performance in the current job, and Rubio fails that test.\n\nOne of this year's ironies is that the antiestablishment Republican voters whom Rubio relied upon to win the U.S. Senate race in 2010 have abandoned him. The 2016 version of the tea party wave is angrier, more disillusioned and wider. Rubio, who has spent his career plotting his next move and exploiting opportunities rather than building a strong record and a natural constituency, has no viable way forward absent a Florida miracle. He also has damaged his personal brand with robotic debate performances and foolish attempts to match Trump's crudeness.\n\nEven Rubio's argument that Florida Republicans should vote for him Tuesday as the best way to stop Trump rings hollow. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has more convention delegates than Rubio. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has broader appeal and a better shot of winning his home state. A vote for Rubio may be a protest vote — but it won't be a vote for someone who is prepared to be president.",

Its central offices are located in an unmarked building near the Zhongnanhai at 5 West Chang'an Avenue, although the department has offices throughout the country at the provincial, municipal, and county level.[3]\n\nThe editors-in-chief of China's major media outlets must attend the department's central office weekly to receive instructions on which stories should be emphasized, downplayed, or not reported at all.[3] These instructions are not normally known to the public, but are communicated to media workers at the weekly meeting or via secret bulletins.[3] However, since the rise of social networking tools, Publicity Department instructions have been leaked to the internet. Examples include \"All websites need to use bright red color to promote a celebratory atmosphere [of the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic]\" and \"negative reports... not exceed 30 per cent\".[3]\n\nSuch directives are considered imperative, and are enforced by disciplines within the Party, as all media in China are required to be loyal to the Party, and are to serve as propaganda organs for the Party in principle. Operational and reporting freedom has significantly increased in the Chinese media in the recent decade. However, open defiance against the Publicity Department directives is rare, as dissenting media organizations risk severe punishment, including restructuring or closure. In 2000, a system of warnings was introduced for individual journalists, whereby repeat offenses can lead to dismissal.[3] Chinese journalists disclosing Publicity Department directives to foreign media may be charged with \"divulging state secrets.\"\n\nOne important way the Publicity Department ensures that the media system remains well controlled is by ensuring that the boundaries of acceptable reporting are kept \"deliberately fuzzy\" in an effort to ensure that \"news workers self-censor to a critical degree.\"[12]\n\nRole in monitoring media personnel [ edit ]\n\nAccording by a report from the U.S. government-backed Freedom House, the Central Publicity Department is the most important institution for monitoring media personnel and controlling the content of print and visual media.[13]\n\nThe Central Publicity Department was reported as playing a key role in monitoring editors and journalists through a national registration system. In 2003, the CPD, along with the GAPP and the SARFT, required Chinese journalists to attend nearly 50 hours of training on Marxism, the role of CCP leadership in the media, copyright law, libel law, national security law, regulations governing news content, and journalistic ethics prior to renewing press identification passes in 2003.[13] The report states that media personnel are required to participate in \"ideological training sessions\", where they are evaluated for their \"loyalty to the party.\" Further \"political indoctrination\" courses are said to occur at meetings and training retreats to study party political ideology, and the role of the media in \"thought work\" (sīxiǎng gōngzuò 思想工作).[13]\n\nIt has been noted the CPD's monitoring system largely applies to news regarding politics and current affairs. 90 percent of China's newspapers consists of light stories regarding sport and entertainment, which are rarely regulated.[3]\n\nStructure [ edit ]\n\nA 1977 directive on the re-establishment of the Central Publicity Department reveals the structure and organization of the \"extremely secretive\" body, according to Brady.[1] The directive states that the Department will be set up with one Director and several deputies, and the organizational structure will be set up with one office and five bureaus. The office is in charge of political, secretarial and administrative work, and the five bureaus are: the Bureau of Theory, Bureau of Propaganda and Education, Bureau of Arts and Culture, Bureau of News, and Bureau of Publishing. The directive states that the staff will be fixed at around 200 personnel, selected from propaganda apparatchiks across the country in consultation with the Central Organization Department.[1]\n\nThe leadership of the Publicity Department is selected with guidance from General Secretary Hu Jintao and the Politburo Standing Committee member responsible for the media, Li Changchun,[13] while local branches of the Publicity Department work with lower levels of the party-state hierarchy to transmit content priorities to the media.[13]\n\nNew departments and offices were set up in 2004 to deal with the growing demands of information control in the modern era. One, the Bureau of Public Opinion, is in charge of commissioning public opinion surveys and other relevant research.[1]\n\nHeads of the Department [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

According to authorities, a man pretended to be the manager of the Price Chopper in the village until he came face-to-face with the actual supervisor of the store. He came back the next day and continued to be a menace, until he was banned from the store. Then he went to a woman's home the following day to terrorize her - claiming he had a gun.\n\nPolice say on Friday February 19 just after 2:00 a.m. 24-year-old David Pollack of Saugerties was taken into custody after responding to the Price Chopper on Ulster Avenue in the Village of Saugerties for a reported unwanted subject.\n\nWhen police arrived, they say the overnight store manager claimed Pollack was walking around the store displaying what appeared to be Price Chopper employee identification. Pollack allegedly approached the store manager while he was stocking shelves. When the manager asked the man who he was and what he was doing, Pollack said that he himself was the store manager and was working.\n\nAccording to the real manager, Pollack was acting bizarre. He says Pollack then barricaded himself in the employee break room and refused to permit officers entry to the room. Pollack locked the door and insisted he was the store manager, demanding that police leave the store.\n\nMembers of the Saugerties Police Emergency Response Team and K9 Unit eventually gained entry to the break room, taking Pollack into custody. When they opened up the door, Pollack jumped onto a table and then executed a back flip, landing on his back. Pollack then began screaming at the officers, yelling that they had hurt him and demanded to know why they flipped him over the table.\n\nAll the officers on the scene were wearing body cameras, capturing the entire incident which clearly showed Pollack doing the back flip and landing on the floor, never being touched by any of the officers until after he landed on the floor and was taking into custody.\n\nPollack was transported to the Kingston Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. The investigation is continuing and misdemeanor criminal charges are pending against Pollack for Criminal Trespass and Criminal Impersonation.\n\nThe next day Saugerties Police received another report of a man causing a disturbance at the same Price Chopper just after 10 a.m.\n\nWhen they got there, officers located the same man within the store. According to store personnel, Pollack was acting bizarre and causing a safety concern for other customers. He refused to leave when asked from store management. Pollack was taken into custody and charged with trespassing. he was arraigned in the Village of Saugerties Court, where an order of protection was issued by the court preventing him from returning to Price Chopper. He was then released on his own recognizance and is scheduled to reappear in the Village Court on a later date to answer his charges.\n\nCopyright by WTEN - All rights reserved\n\nThe following day, at approximately 1:38 a.m., the Saugerties Police Department responded to 110 Partition Street for a report of a male subject who displayed what appeared to be a handgun.\n\nInvestigation revealed that Pollack unlawfully entered another person's apartment and when the resident asked him to leave, he simulated that he had a firearm by grabbing his waistband and telling the resident he was armed with a handgun. Police were called, and Pollack was taken into custody without incident. He was not armed with any firearm.\n\nPollack was arraigned in the Village of Saugerties Justice Court on the charges of Criminal Trespass in the Second Degree and Menacing in the Third Degree. He was remanded to the Ulster County Jail in lieu of $1,000 cash bail, and is scheduled appear in court on later date. An order of protection was issued on behalf of the victim and witness to the incident.",

Here's how candidates keep using Carrier Corp. to show why trade policies need to change to protect American workers. (Dwight Adams/ Wochit\n\nBuy Photo Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the Indiana State Fairgrounds on April 27. (Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar)Buy Photo\n\nDonald Trump profited from an investment in the parent company of a business he has slammed for laying off 2,100 workers in Indiana and moving production to Mexico.\n\nTrump earned interest income of $2,501 to $5,000 from an investment in a United Technologies Corp. bond, according to a new financial disclosure form he filed Wednesday with federal election officials.\n\nThe company owns two affiliates — Carrier Corp. and UTEC — that announced in February they were laying off workers at plants in Indianapolis and Huntington and moving manufacturing operations to Mexico. The companies make heating and air conditioning products.\n\nTrump made Carrier's decision to eliminate about 1,400 jobs at its factory on the west side of Indianapolis a centerpiece of his campaign during the runup to Indiana's primary earlier this month. His victory in that contest sealed his status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\n\nDuring an April 20 rally in Indianapolis, Trump called the company \"ruthless\" and told the audience — which included several Carrier workers — that he would \"tax the hell\" out of its air conditioners. He promised things would be different if he was president.\n\n\"You’re going to bring it across the border, and we’re going to charge you a 35 percent tax,\" he said. \"Now within 24 hours they’re going to call back. 'Mr. President, we’ve decided to stay. We’re coming back to Indianapolis.'\"\n\nHe did not mention his investment in United Technologies during his campaign appearances.\n\nTrump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChuck Jones, president of the union that represents Carrier employees, said he wasn't surprised by the disclosure.\n\n\"He wraps himself in the American flag,\" he said. \"But he doesn't practice what he preaches.\"\n\nThe union, United Steelworkers Local 1999, has endorsed Democrat Bernie Sanders.\n\nIt's not the first time that Trump, a billionaire businessman and reality TV star, reported interest income from United Technologies. He also made $2,501 to $5,000 from a $100,001 to $250,000 investment in the company, according to his July 2015 disclosure form.\n\nThe Associated Press is reporting that he no longer owns stock in the company, but it's unclear from the documents whether he still has an interest in the company. On the disclosure form he filed Wednesday, he listed the value of the bond investment as \"None (or less than $1,001).\"\n\nThe investment is one of hundreds that Trump listed. The 104-page disclosure also included investments in several other companies Trump has criticized, including Ford Motor Credit Co. and the parent company of cookies and snacks manufacturer Nabisco.\n\nTrump called Ford’s plans to open a $1.6 billion assembly plant in Mexico “an absolute disgrace,” and threatened to impose a 35 percent tax on imported Ford vehicles.\n\nHe also said last year that he was \"never eating Oreos again\" because of Nabisco's decision to close a bakery plant in Chicago and move production to Mexico.\n\n“Carrier and Ford and Nabisco need to know that there are consequences to leaving and firing people,” Trump said during a rally in Evansville last month that drew an estimated 12,000 people. “You can’t just go to another country and make products to sell across our weak borders.”\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Breaking News newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Urgent developments you should know now, not later.

He also made $5,001 to $15,000 from an investment in Mondelez International Inc., Nabisco's parent company.\n\nTrump has also invested in two other well-known companies that he has criticized on the campaign trail.\n\nHe bashed The Walt Disney Co. over a lawsuit that accused the company of replacing American workers with foreigners using H1-B visas — and then requiring them to train their replacements. And in February he encouraged a boycott of Apple Inc. for the company's refusal to unlock the phones of the shooters in the San Bernardino massacre.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped him from investing in those companies. He owns $15,001 to $50,000 in Disney stock and holds multiple investments in Apple, which combined are worth between $1.1 million and $2.25 million, according to his disclosure filings.\n\nCLOSE Donald Trump covers topics from Carrier to Hillary Clinton while speaking at a rally at the Indiana State Fairgrounds on Wednesday, April 20, 2016.

  "latent_23283": "The howls, pitched high into the morning air, carried several possible meanings normally lost on human ears.\n\nBut two-legged listeners at the Wildlife Science Center near Forest Lake lucked out Friday, with wolf expert Peggy Callahan nearby to interpret.\n\nThe howling in this context, she said, probably meant something like: Halt, for this is my territory and you are in it.\n\n“When you hear a wolf howl, you know that they’re comfortable and feel like they’re home,” said Callahan, the center’s executive director.\n\nThe challenge now facing Callahan is transporting the center’s diverse pack of animals to a new home before the nonprofit’s long-standing lease ends next month.\n\nThe scene on Friday was all bushy tails and spunky wails as Callahan and her team worked to corral, vaccinate and anesthetize 14 wolf pups for their journey to broader pastures.\n\nMegan Callahan-Beckel, 17, daughter of the center’s director, helped the wolves explore their new habitat accompanied by Oliver, left, a German shepherd who helped raise 14 wolf pups. The center’s lease ran out after more than 25 years at Carlos Avery Wildlife Management Area.\n\nThe pups were among the first batch of animals moved to a new 165-acre property in Linwood Township in Anoka County’s northeastern corner, which the nonprofit acquired years ago but waited to fully develop owing to the Great Recession.\n\nThe center is home to the largest population of captive wolves in North America, Callahan said. It provides science education programs each year for thousands of students from preschool to 12th grade. Wildlife professionals frequent the center for training and research, and wildlife there have been featured on Animal Planet, the History Channel and National Geographic.\n\nThe nonprofit has been based at the Carlos Avery Wildlife Management Area in Anoka County near Forest Lake since 1991, leasing the site from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR).\n\nBut last year, the center and its creatures received an eviction notice from the state over various lease-related disputes. A main complaint raised safety concerns about an aging office and storage building where a staff member from the center regularly stayed overnight for security purposes.\n\nThe center resolved the problems raised by the eviction notice and has since been allowed to stay through the end of its lease, which expires March 31. The safety of the animals was never in question, DNR officials said.\n\n“The DNR supports the mission of the science center. We think they do great work,” said Paul Telander, the DNR’s wildlife section manager.\n\nThe center was originally a state-owned and federally run wolf research facility. Callahan eventually took it over and turned it into an educational nonprofit.\n\nThe move, she said, comes thanks to donations and a dedicated cadre of staff and volunteers.\n\nEnclosures at the new site will house about 70 wolves and the center’s other animals, which include bears, cougars, bobcats, lynx, birds of prey, foxes, raccoons, skunks and a porcupine. The goal is to raise enough money to one day build a classroom, she said.\n\nSchools including Northwest Passage High School in Coon Rapids have also chipped in. In January, students constructed a wolf den box to donate to the new facility.\n\nBiology teacher Peter Wieczorek said he has been bringing science students to the center for 13 years. They’ve participated in wolf research projects including reproductive studies related to endangered species.\n\n“Our students are welcomed to join right in and learn by doing instead of just watching,” said Wieczorek, also the director of Northwest Passage.\n\nThis is home\n\nTo get ready for the wolf pups, Northwest Passage students ventured to the new facility and installed a fresh wolf den on a recent afternoon.\n\nThe hum and whirs of electric drills filled the snowy pen as students including Virjle Wells, a junior, assembled the wooden structure.\n\n“I’m helping out my favorite animal — wolves,” Wells said.\n\nA wolf pup keeps on eye on volunteers before being moved.\n\nOn Friday, the first paws touched down on the slushy ground near the den box as the pups began padding around their new digs.\n\nThe pups’ enclosure, Callahan said, is more than twice as big as the one at the old facility. That means more room to run and socialize — as pups are apt to do.\n\nCallahan’s 17-year-old daughter, Megan Callahan-Beckel, walked the enclosure and chirped greetings to the pups, whom she helped name and bottle feed.\n\n“This is crazy,” Callahan-Beckel said, sitting in the enclosure. “My babies are actually here.”\n\nHours after the move, Callahan and her team watched the wolves zigzag around their new space and heard a welcome sound. The pups had started howling.\n\nIn the days and weeks to come, she said, they will be listening for more howls — those aroooos that declare, “This is home.”",

Mr. Tomlinson was responsible for the messaging service.

The @ not only had a similar meaning, but was so seldom used that it was open to reinterpretation.

The @ became a supernova of the digital age and part of our daily lives, although that still doesn’t explain why it has been elevated to MoMA’s design collection.\n\nThere are some 175,000 pieces in MoMA’s entire collection, and roughly 28,000 in the architecture and design section, which includes everything from some of the 20th century’s most famous cars and chairs to the archive of the modernist grandee Mies van der Rohe. New pieces can only be added after winning the approval of an acquisitions committee composed of 25 architecture and design specialists, who meet every three or four months.\n\nThe committee must be convinced that each addition meets the entry criteria. Does it excel in terms of form and function? Does it embody the values of clarity, honesty and simplicity that MoMA considers essential to good design? Has it has made an impact on our lives? Is it innovative? Then there’s the clincher. “If this object had never been designed or manufactured, would the world miss out?” said Paola Antonelli, senior curator of architecture and design at MoMA. “Even just a bit?”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

By giving that once obscure accountancy symbol a new application without distorting its original meaning, Mr. Tomlinson was deemed to have checked all of MoMA’s boxes in terms of form, function, values, cultural impact and innovation. She sees “snail,” “pig’s tail” and its other nicknames as proof of its importance, because we care so much about the @ that we’ve started to mythologize it.\n\nFair enough, you might say, but what does its transformation have to do with design? After all, the new @ looks exactly the same as the old symbol, and isn’t a physical object like the chairs, cars or architectural drawings that you’d expect to find in a design museum.\n\nThat’s exactly why MoMA admires it. First, both the old and new @ fulfill the same function of simplifying and clarifying something that’s fiendishly complicated to make and interpret: handwritten script and computer code respectively. Ms. Antonelli describes that as “an act of design of extraordinary elegance and economy.” Both qualities are prized by MoMA, especially “economy” in a time of recession and environmental crisis, when reinventing something that’s under-used seems much smarter than designing something new.\n\nTimeliness matters to MoMA too, and the new @ is timely not only in its economy but also precisely because it is not physical (just like equally dynamic areas of contemporary design such as software and social design). “MoMA’s collection has always been in touch with its time,” Ms. Antonelli said, “and design these days is often an act with aesthetic and ethical consequences, not necessarily a physical object.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat’s why MoMA decided against adding a specific version of the @ to the collection in favor of using it in different typographic styles and sizes. Ms. Antonelli likens it to the museum’s acquisition of “The Kiss,” a performance art piece by Tino Sehgal, in which a couple embrace for several hours. Just like the @, each performance can take a different form with new protagonists — though there is a difference. MoMA reportedly paid $70,000 for “The Kiss,” while the @ is joining the collection free.",
  "latent_23526": "Editor’s note: Tadhg Kelly is a veteran game designer and the creator of leading game design blog What Games Are. You can follow him on Twitter here.\n\nSince microconsoles first surfaced, I’ve always been a big advocate. Why? Some of my reasons are to do with finally seeing digital-native distribution come to the TV, which is long overdue. Others are to do with watching how the world of apps has transformed the pricing structure of games, resulting in more games for more players. Some are to do with interesting game design challenges that they present, the possibilities of the new and the strange.\n\nMy primary reason, however, is the sense of developer democracy.\n\nHistory\n\nI am old enough to remember how designing and developing games used to be. I remember just how awkward working for consoles was, how there were endless hoops to jump through, and how it was universally accepted at the time that you had to personally deal with platforms to get your game to the public. You needed a publisher who knew a guy at SCEE and that was that.\n\nAt that time games had become a messy business of concept approvals, publisher milestones and licensed properties. Each platform used its own custom tech, which meant getting them to work properly was an exercise in dealing with provided tools that were often tortuous. More importantly there was the sense of lock-in and shut-out. It was impossible to get development kits unless you already knew people, and they cost $30,000 each. Even on the PC you still needed a lot of publisher help because there just weren’t many options for selling directly to the public.\n\nIt was a closed, complex and pretty corrupt business back in those days largely because of all the gatekeeping. It left many would-be indies out in the cold and discouraged innovation while breeding terrible working practises. “You should consider yourself lucky to work in games” was the overriding mantra while you worked 90 hour weeks on tatty versions of games that supported equally tatty movies. It was just how life was.\n\nHowever cracks started to emerge. Many studios who were simply unable to function in the console business shut down, and this led to greater startup climates. Starting with venues like Steam and certain Flash sites, some on-the-ground momentum started to build. Then Facebook happened. iPhone happened. Steam got good, then great. And in the process a lot of power transferred over to developers.\n\nGaming became more chaotic and democratic, more innovative and far more investable. Where it had been the case for a generation that venture capital would never invest in games, suddenly it would. As the gatekeeping fell by the wayside we saw large studios emerge and excitement in the air. It was the age of Zynga and Mojang. And while there are certain signs that the cost of doing business in new channels is becoming more challenging, that sense of can-do still prevails. We’ve seen how changing the power relationship over to developers results in great companies, great innovation and the expansion of games as an art form.\n\nEverywhere except in TV gaming, that is.\n\nConsole games largely remain a closed shop of mega-studios and expensive ambitions. Talking with people who work in that AAA world often feels a bit like stepping back in time. They’re still having the fight to be the biggest and the baddest, and spending $265 million on a single game to get there. The sense of you-should-be-so-lucky is alive and well. The reward for working on such mass teams is usually a pink slip, or failing that a small raise.\n\nTV gaming is yet to be disrupted, to empower developers to run their own businesses direct with their customers as has happened everywhere else. So you would think that, for the legions of indies who want to make the next Canabalt but feel shut out by The Man, there would be overwhelming positivity for projects like the OUYA.\n\nNot so much.\n\nWhere Microconsoles Fit\n\nConsider the recent brouhaha over OUYA’s “Free The Games” project. It’s a fund that the company has established to match any Kickstarter game projects that opt to publish exclusively on OUYA for a time. If you raise $50k then OUYA will give you another $50k in exchange for a temporary lock-in. OUYA wins by gaining some cool exclusives and developers win by obtaining funding and making a game that will easily port to other formats over time. Implicitly the OUYA team would also probably talk up the game as a part of their platform story, which is essentially free marketing. Free money, high-profile marketing, a non-proprietary platform to develop for that could launch your business. Win-win right?\n\nWell in fact the reaction to the FTG fund has been very negative in both the gaming press and developer community. The words “scam” and “controversial” appear in many headlines or copy covering it. The reaction has been so huge in fact that it caught up several developers, some of who had applied to the fund, others who had worked with OUYA directly. Most especially the story of Ryan Green’s game That Dragon, Cancer. He had to take to the pages of Gamasutra to patiently explain that, no, his game is not a cynical exploitation. It’s actually about his son who is dying of the big C.\n\nMy point is that there is a tendency to overreact when it comes to microconsoles. OUYA most especially because it tends to be at the forefront, trying a lot of experiments etc, but also in general. The world is falling down in people who want to believe the worst of these tiny little machines, and their reasons perplexing. Of course there are mistakes. And yes, it seems a couple of developers tried to massage their Kickstarters a bit to get access to the FTG fund. But still. Several mid-to-high profile indie devs have taken to Twitter demanding that public apologies and whatnot for amounts to an excellent way for indie projects to get funded. The horror.\n\nMove Fast And Break Things\n\nWhen people ask me about how microconsoles are doing so far, or declare them as dead, or how they feel betrayed, I always give the same answer: “You try funding, launching and building out a platform in 12 months with a tiny team, and see how perfectly you do it.” Set against watching vastly better funded companies like Microsoft with its campuses and its giant facilities, any new platform has to be scrappy. Or as Zuck said it, moving fast and breaking things.\n\nTake one look at Facebook today and Facebook back when and you see exactly what it means. Microconsoles are young, weird and trying to figure out what they want to be when they grow up. They’ve moved very quickly to latch onto an opportunity enabled by affordable low-powered hardware. This means that some parts of that program will come out half-baked at first and then iterate, as happens with all new technology businesses.\n\nBut the gaming world doesn’t seem to understand that, and it’s a key difference between tech and gaming communities. Tech journalists are used to the new idea that shows promise, the device or service that might one day become something. They tend to be very forgiving of things being a bit broken as long as they have optimistic ambitions for the future. Sometimes perhaps they are too wide-eyed, but still.\n\nThe gaming community, on the other hand, operates by a totally different set of criteria. Certain influential sites that lead tribes of players and build a community of fans (like Giant Bomb, Penny Arcade, Rock Paper Shotgun) in a way that is fundamentally different to the tech model. It’s mostly extended fandom, media critique, sometimes gossip and cheerleading. Games journalism is often obsessed with legitimacy and trying to establish a narrative of the medium. The community tends to look backward fondly and forward skeptically. It takes a lot to wow them, and it’s not just a matter of features.\n\nWhile working on PS2 was very painful, for players it was arguably the greatest console ever. It had a huge catalog of diverse games and established many modern classics, such as Ico. The sense of polish, production values and a premium experience has long been the secret to the console industry (as compared to the PC, which has often been rougher) and it’s treasured. Gamers still rankle heavily about the need for patches in modern games, for example, remembering a better time when cartridges just worked.\n\nWith some exceptions, most of the gaming community is not used to “move fast and break things”. It remembers the platforms that failed, of which there were many. Systems like the Saturn, the 3DO, the CDi, the CD32 and many more only ever managed a handful games before dying. Failures have tended to fall into either the “principled end” model or the “shady bastard” model. In the former we see projects like the Dreamcast or the Indrema. In the latter it’s slapped-together formats like the Gizmondo (complete with links to the Swedish Mafia). There are many examples of both.\n\nThe memory of platform failures is strong, enough to make the gaming community wary of any newcomers. It doesn’t give its loyalty easily because it has been disappointed many times. Nobody wants to buy into a platform that will end up as a Dreamcast or a Gizmondo. So a key part of the reason why any platform gets short shrift unless it comes from a Sony or an Apple is that sense of reliability. And this (to me at least) explains why indie game developers in particular have reacted so curiously to microconsoles.\n\nIndies Gamed\n\nBoth Sony and Microsoft have mixed histories when it comes to dealing with independent developers. That version of Xbox Live as seen in Indie Game: The Movie (for example) hasn’t been around for quite some time and the Xbox 360 felt like an indie ghost town for everyone bar Minecraft. Meanwhile Nintendo has almost no history with indies at all.\n\nAll three have recently started to change their tunes. They’ve worked to bring indie developers into their folds and – for Sony especially – this seems to be working. Between execs like Shahid Ahmad saying things will be better and indie heroes like Jonathan Blow bigging up the PS4, the mood for console is positive. Indies now consider platforms like the PS Vita to be desirable venues even though Sony has sold very few actual units.\n\nAn informal system has sprung up where console platforms look at what’s hot on Steam and then tap successful developers from there to publish with them. Platforms now offer increased support to these developers and are removing many of the old roadblocks, such as lowering the prices of dev kits. Consoles have become cool once more and the community has responded in kind. But I ‘m dubious.\n\nA lot of the new generation of game makers are too young to know what a full console cycle feels like. The hype may be exciting but, historically at least, the troughs of disillusionment have been very deep. Young guns often don’t understand that the point of having a few Journeys is not to effect a big change in the platform, but to just have a few arty games that win awards. Also mobile is scary and full of people who want to talk monetization. Tablet is scary. Facebook is scary. Microconsole is scary. But everybody thinks Nintendo is cool, so it must be good to be on Wii U yeah? It’s like that.\n\nAhead of new console launches the industry tends to become exuberant even though the financial argument rarely makes sense. Consoles don’t sell a giant number of units (in their 8 years of operation Microsoft and Sony combined sold less consoles than Android phones now sell per quarter) and so their games tend to experience a lot of short-head downward pressure.\n\nWhile the early phase may seem like virgin territory and breed a few key successes it’s usually only 2-3 years after that when conditions flip. Execs in charge feel they have enough arty games to tick that box and seem legitimate to journalists. They back away from support, refocusing their digital divisions to become profitable. They steward. They constrain. It doesn’t make sense to run an Apple-sized curation operation when they don’t sell Apple-sized numbers of units, so they rationalize.\n\nIt’s a similar story on Steam. Greenlight is flooded with wannabe games trying to get onto the Steam platform, and PC gaming has become such that if you’re not on Steam you’re probably screwed. Developers rarely have the power to chop and change their distribution to other PC stores (and Microsoft’s failure to make the Windows 8 Store work is a big problem here). Yet developers remain emotionally attached to those older paradigms, as do many players.\n\nOvercoming The Skepticism\n\nSome people can’t see past the fact that most microconsoles are built on Android and may in some former life have had similar guts to some mobile phones. It’s been a weird couple of years for the gaming community between tablets and Zynga and gestural controllers and TV TV TV. The community wants gaming to make sense again, like it used to. Microconsoles seem to be just one more thing that’s piling on some unspecified destruction of gaming as they know it.\n\nThe microconsole idea is fundamentally different to many of the failed platforms of yesteryear, but much of the gaming community does not yet see that. It’s seeing the past, the Gizmondos and the Dreamcasts, and assuming that the new is the same as the old. That kind of skepticism can be overcome but it takes time. I mean, sure, the first generation OUYA is a beachhead product (I say again, you see how well you’d do in that timeframe), but it was supposed to be. “Move fast and break things” means built to mess around with, to find the fun and help steer. So is the fund and the idea that the hardware will update every year so rather than every seven years. In a sense the whole platform is currently a big project between many companies trying to figure out this big new idea.\n\nThe community’s reaction is valid. It can’t be wished away, but it can be addressed. Yes there are some snafus to be resolved. But trust is earned over the long term by watching games like That Dragon, Cancer come out and more and more like them. With continued demonstration of good intent and ambition the gaming community will eventually be won around. As Valve showed with Steam, skepticism can be beaten by continuing to push and adapt, to listen and respond, game after game.\n\nOver time the community will shift from saying “not as bad as I thought” to “quite good” to “actually pretty cool” if microconsoles’ course holds true. It may take a couple of years, but eventually the people will come around.",
  "latent_23700": "Kelly Brown stands in the corner of a crowded banquet room, her camera rolling. Around the single mother of three, more than a hundred of Atlanta’s business and civic elite — a billionaire, a Fortune 500 CEO, a U.S. Attorney — file in for a summit on efforts to revive the neighborhoods around the rising Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n\nPlans are underway to build six homes for police officers in Vine City, an effort to drive out crime and work with at-risk kids. A jobs training center is getting a new building. The future Beltline segment and cleanup plans for the long polluted Proctor Creek have gained the attention of developers in this historic part of the city.\n\nWhen Brown rises to speak, the English Avenue resident and small business owner says she came to film the meeting for her neighbors who have questions about the changes that could come to their communities. She nods to the assembled power in the room, but also to what was missing — more residents like her.\n\n“There is a lot of money in the room and there’s a lot of talent on the corners,” she said.\n\nThe $1.5 billion stadium is the most visible symbol of redevelopment on Atlanta’s Westside, and in truth it was always the easiest part. Rebuilding historic but blighted communities such as Vine City and English Avenue — where the Georgia Dome, the Olympics and more than $100 million in grants failed to make much difference — has always been a daunting task.\n\nHow daunting? Those communities and others in the shadow of the stadium have lost half their population or more since the peak of the late 1950s and 1960s. Poverty, unemployment and crime are high, and the implosion of the housing market last decade — after a run up of real estate speculation — set back the communities even further.\n\nSome residents dread a repeat of the 1990s when little came of the big promises tied to the Georgia Dome. Others fear change will come at the expense of longtime residents who have stuck it out through decades of community decay.\n\nAtlanta Mayor Kasim Reed,whose term finishes at the end of 2017, and other leaders say they won’t fail.\n\nBetween the future Beltline segment, new parks, efforts to reform schools and a community policing model that will put cops in the neighborhood and create a new security force backed by a network of cameras and license plate readers, the activity on the Westside is unprecedented, city leaders say.\n\nIn the year ahead, signs of commitments by Falcons owner Arthur Blank, the city, the Chick-fil-A Foundation, and numerous other charities and churches are expected to come to the fore. But whether the willpower of billionaires like Blank and Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy, Reed and other heavyweights can sustain and coordinate an effort that will likely stretch for years is perhaps the biggest question of all.\n\nIn a recent interview, Reed said the might and capabilities coming forward dwarf anything seen when a lack of coordination, incompetence and some mismanagement squandered efforts after the Georgia Dome opened.\n\nReed points to examples such as the successful redevelopment of East Lake over the past two decades, spearheaded by developer Tom Cousins and Purpose Built Communities, and the influence of the Beltline in neighborhoods such as the Old Fourth Ward.\n\n“That is why this story will have a different outcome,” Reed said.\n\n‘We don’t trust you!’\n\nStadiums have not had a record in Atlanta, or really in the majority of American cities, of fostering community development. Entire neighborhoods were wiped out in the 1960s for the original Atlanta Stadium. The Olympic Stadium and Georgia Dome also paved over parts of in-town neighborhoods that were predominantly black and poor.\n\nTwo historic black churches were acquired and razed to make room for the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which will open next year.\n\nAfter the Atlanta City Council approved a deal in 2013 to help finance the construction of the Falcons stadium with $200 million in bonds backed by hotel-motel taxes — plus likely hundreds of millions more tax dollars to help pay upkeep costs — city officials met with residents to discuss what they’d receive in exchange for more disruption in their backyards. A key piece of that negotiation was a community benefits agreement and commitments of $15 million each from the city and Blank’s family foundation for neighborhood redevelopment.\n\nResidents often clashed with leaders over wording of the plan and how the funds would be spent. The process ended on a bitter note after city leaders fast-tracked the benefits agreement for approval before the residents signed off.\n\nIn a fiery November 2013 meeting, a resident blasted officials.\n\n“You wonder why we wanted an agreement?” said Howard Beckham, who represented the Vine City and English Avenue Ministerial Alliance then. “Because we don’t trust you! And you have proved it!”\n\nBut in a sign of how bridges can be built, Beckham now works in intake services for Westside Works, a jobs training program set up by the Blank foundation.\n\nLeaders — from Blank to Reed and others who pushed for the stadium — know their legacies are on the line.\n\nAtlanta can’t build another stadium and ignore the vulnerable communities around it, Cathy said, calling the community recovery “a moral imperative.”\n\n“We’re going to have limousines pulling in there where people are going to be eating caviar and shrimp cocktail, but across the street we got people digging through a trash can trying to find something for lunch,” Cathy said. “That’s an issue for me. That’s an issue for Arthur Blank as well.”\n\nEnglish Avenue and Vine City, two of the city’s toughest neighborhoods, are victims of de-population and neglect. Poverty, unemployment, drugs and gang violence are rampant.\n\nBut the area has a rich history. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lived in Vine City before his assassination. The area is home to the original Paschal’s restaurant, a headquarters of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nCathy, a devout Southern Baptist, equates the rebuilding of the Westside to that of Jerusalem in the Old Testament Book of Nehemiah. Nehemiah, a cup-bearer for a Persian king, returned to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls around the devastated city and repopulate the capital while restoring the laws of Moses. Cathy said like Jerusalem, the Westside needs both a physical and spiritual rebirth.\n\n“[Nehemiah] rebuilt that wall in 52 days, but it took far longer to bring about the renaissance of the entire community,” Cathy said.\n\nEarning respect\n\nThe Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation has, until now, been the center of the latest major revitalization effort on the Westside. But now it is being joined by the Westside Future Fund, an organization created by the mayor and a committee of powerful CEOs known as the Atlanta Committee for Progress in December 2014. The still-developing group aims to serve as the quarterback coordinating literally dozens of disparate aid efforts in an area covering more than 1,000 in-town acres stretching from the Atlanta University Center area north to Donald E. Hollowell Parkway.\n\nIt will both create aid programs and fund established charities on the Westside, said board chairman Richard Dugas. Dugas, CEO of homebuilder PulteGroup, recently named longtime Atlanta political and civic operative John Ahmann the fund’s executive director.\n\nAhmann, a former Metro Atlanta Chamber executive who ran the Atlanta Committee for Progress, has been a behind the scenes player the turnaround of Grady Memorial Hospital and the acquisition of the King Papers. He has a Rolodex of top CEOs to draw upon for help, Dugas said.\n\nThe fund is tasked with repopulating neighborhoods without pricing out longtime residents. More than eight in 10 residents are renters – the easiest group to displace.\n\nSome in the neighborhoods have asked if the fund was looking to replace the efforts of churches and nonprofits working in the community for decades.\n\n“My goal is to make sure you have a seat at the table,” Dugas said.\n\nThe Westside Future Fund meets with community, nonprofit, public safety and business leaders two Fridays a month at the City of Refuge, largely in coordination with Cathy and the Chick-fil-A Foundation, which spearheaded the meetings last year.\n\nEarly gatherings have mushroomed from a few dozen attendees to about 200, a small sign of success, Dugas said.\n\nCathy challenged the group at a recent meeting about why they were here.\n\n“Is this a humanitarian effort on your part?” Cathy asked, or a prime place to network. “…Could you be here because you feel called to be here?”\n\nHe, like others, know that the skeptical community’s buy-in is critical.\n\nAt a February Westside meeting, the Rev. Leroy Wright of First Thessalonian Missionary Baptist Church, said the dozens of churches near the rising stadium hold sway with congregants, “but we don’t see authentic participation.”\n\nResidents like Brown, church leaders and the directors of nonprofits who have labored in the stadium neighborhoods for decades are the forces the future fund needs to marshal, Dugas said.\n\n“We have to earn respect so that people come to us,” Dugas said.\n\nThe group must grow into its role, he said, while delivering short-term wins in public safety, education and jobs to buy the time needed with residents to plan for longer term programs.\n\nFrank Fernandez, vice president of community development with the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation, said part of his mission, will be to supplement and support groups already doing work here. The Blank foundation has committed nearly $7 million of the $15 million Blank earmarked as part of a community benefits agreement.\n\nWestside Works, one of the foundation’s largest investments, has helped train 306 community residents. Nearly 200 are in construction, with 87 finding work at the stadium site. Other investments have been made in long-term health services, public safety and education.\n\nBeckham, the English Avenue pastor who decried the lack of trust in city officials, now works in partnership with Westside Works to help recruit job applicants through the nonprofit, Integrity Community Development Corporation.\n\nHe said he’s “pleasantly surprised” that the community is already seeing positive changes — the types of things residents asked for during the stadium deal.\n\n“There are still some people that have some doubts, because they aren’t as involved as I am and can’t see it from the inside,” he said this week. “But if you look around at what’s going on, there are so many different initiatives.”\n\nMore to be done\n\nAtlanta City Councilman Ivory Young, the representative for District 3 who lives in Vine City, said he once was one of the biggest skeptics of the future fund. But, he said, the attention focused on the Westside is unprecedented.\n\nHe notes a plan by Atlanta Public Schools to turn the closed Kennedy Middle School into k-8 school focused on science, technology, engineering and math. Major developers specializing in quality low income housing are scouting the Westside, he said.\n\nThe Beltline’s western extension — a $43 million extension of the planned 22-mile loop of trails, parks and transit — will run from University Avenue in Adair Park north to Lena Avenue at Washington Park. The new Lindsay Street Park, an oasis in a corridor of boarded up homes, features a playground and is designed to control thorny stormwater issues.\n\nAtlanta Police Chief George Turner said homes for 20 to 25 for officers and their families will be built in the Westside by 2020. The first five will be built by PulteGroup on a stretch of James P. Brawley Drive and another by Habitat for Humanity will come this year.\n\nA new youth diversion center, designed to keep kids out of jail, is also in the police department’s plans.\n\nIn the months ahead, Westside Future Fund will unveil a “land use action plan” — an amalgamation of some 18 planning exercises done by groups such as churches, the Atlanta University Center and Georgia Tech over the past decade or so.\n\nThe plan will cover a broader 24 square miles and feature parks, mixed-income housing, future zoning needs and offer guidance for connecting the area’s disjointed network of streets for neighborhoods largely cut off from jobs centers like downtown and Midtown.\n\nBeyond the Beltline, the city has some 200 acres of property over which it can influence development, including the Morris Brown College campus, Mayor Reed said. Those properties could serve as anchors to encourage private investment, he said.\n\nSpeculators already are making bets in the area, buying up land and boarded up homes. But many remain in disrepair. The city, though attempting to crack down on code violations, hasn’t held enough accountable for junky properties, many neighbors said.\n\nThe speculation also has another side-effect: rising real estate values and landlords overcharging of rents for substandard housing.\n\n“I’ve not heard concretely how you have this level of development without displacement,” said Sheri Davis-Faulkner, director of the Westside Communities Alliance, which operates a community newsletter, computer lab and an online dashboard of community demographics data.\n\nThe goal of attracting investment and development without displacement is “easier said than done,” said Fernandez, with the Blank foundation.\n\nThe Blank foundation is working with the Home Depot Foundation and Invest Atlanta on a program to help longtime owners fix up homes, he said. Land banking — that is putting land ownership into a trust to keep the cost of purchasing a home low — is another tactic that could follow.\n\nLast year, the city won a $30 million federal grant to redevelop aging public housing as mixed income communities.\n\n“We don’t have a gentrification problem right now,” Fernandez said. “We might have it — and if you doing revitalization you probably should have it — but you have to be able to address it.”\n\nTo de-concentrate poverty, that effort will require a mixed-income approach, said Ahmann, adding a plan to protect longtime residents is in the works.\n\nStill, Brown, the owner of a video production business who has been welcomed by Ahmann to tape each future fund meeting, said she is hopeful, but remains skeptical.\n\nBrown said she needs to hear more about how the groups plan to confront problems like addiction and helping people with criminal records get jobs. She’s also at-risk of being displaced.\n\nBrown fixed up a home in English Avenue that was donated to her by a nonprofit she volunteered for for three years. She slept in the driveway during renovations to keep it from being vandalized.\n\nBrown said at a meeting Friday that unbeknownst to her, the property had some $16,000 in tax liens against it before she took it over. She could be evicted by an investor who bought the liens.\n\nBrown said her plight is a common one in a place where title issues and limited incomes can mean few options. Ahmann said the fund is working to keep Brown in her home.\n\n“We hope to have an answer in two weeks,” he said.\n\nReporter Angela Tuck contributed to this article.",
  "latent_23723": "Bristol Ice Rink opened as part of a huge Mecca entertainment complex in the 60’s known as the ‘New Bristol Centre’. At the time it was the biggest entertainment complex in Europe boasting a dozen licensed bars, an ice rink, bowling lanes, a casino, a night club, a grand cinema, a sumptuous ballroom and a multi story to accommodate all the visitors. At a cost of £2m pounds to build no expense was spared. By the turn of the 21st century the glam and glitz of the 60’s were long gone. A large part of the building had been knocked down to make way for student flats, the cinema had closed and while still profitable the ice rink itself was in a desperately run down state. In 2012 despite public dismay the owners of the building decided to serve notice on the ice rink and it closed for the final time to make way for more student flats. Above the ice rink the remains of some of the bars and clubs are still apparent amongst the mess of years of neglect.",
  "latent_23788": "GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations is considering using other ports in Yemen or land convoys to deliver food for 17 million hungry people in case the main port of Hodeida is attacked, the chief U.N. humanitarian official there said on Tuesday.\n\nA girl receives a rice ration at a food distribution center in Sanaa, Yemen March 21, 2017. REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah\n\nYemen has been divided by two years of civil war that pits the Iran-allied Houthi group against a Western-backed Sunni Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia that is carrying out air strikes. At least 10,000 people have been killed in the fighting.\n\nJamie McGoldrick, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, said the aid effort was on a “knife edge” due to insufficient funding, despite the threat of famine. The U.N. has received only 7 percent of its $2.1 billion appeal for 2017.\n\nYemen’s main port at Hodeida is badly damaged and has been short of cranes. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has already switched to using Aden port in the south.\n\n“We face an enormous difficulty bringing material into the country because of the coalition’s activities on the open seas and the delays in bringing vessels into Hodeida, which is the main port for us to supply humanitarian and commercial goods in to the country,” McGoldrick told a Geneva news briefing, speaking by telephone from Sana’a.\n\n“However, because we find there is a possibility of the attack on the Hodeida area because of the current west coast military activity, that port may become inoperable or inaccessible in the near future,” he said.\n\nArmy forces and a group of militias launched an offensive on the Red Sea coast in January to deprive the Houthis of ports and to isolate them. Nearly 50,000 people have already fled, joining 2 million displaced, McGoldrick said.\n\nThe United Nations is looking at “contingency planning of using alternative ports such as Aden” and land convoys from Saudi Arabia and other neighboring countries, he said.\n\nAden port will be insufficient due to its size and congestion. Salif port is used for dry goods and Ras Isa for oil.\n\nThe ICRC said last week that the world has three to four months to save millions of people in Yemen from starvation.\n\n“I think ICRC is right. We have estimated that our food stocks in the country are around a three-months supply, both from a humanitarian and a commercial point of view,” McGoldrick said.",

  "latent_23897": "I grew up around serial dieters filled with rage, at themselves and their predicament. I can hardly remember a meal at which someone didn’t blow up about something, leaving the rest of us to tackle our brisket in silence. I flashed back to those depth-charged dinners when I read Lionel Shriver’s new novel, Big Brother, in which a man who has grown suddenly obese visits his younger sister. He shovels in the Cinnabons while her family watches with increasing disgust. Finally, her husband lets loose a zinger: “It’s not my fault that to snap a family photo I have to take three steps back to fit you in the frame.\"\n\nThe impulse to castigate the plus-sized—even when, especially when, they are us—runs very deep. And that’s sad for two reasons. First, by 2010, more than 40 percent of American adults and 17 percent of youths were obese or morbidly obese. By 2030, more than half of America’s adults and a third of its young people may fit that description. Second, we’re learning ever more reasons not to regard the corpulent as pathetic losers. Obesity clearly amounts to more than a failure of willpower. Even the staid American Medical Association agrees; it just upgraded obesity from a “condition” to a “disease.” Our knee-jerk irritation at the overweight, it turns out, may be the twenty-first-century equivalent of the nineteenth-century sniff at the tubercular (too neurasthenic to live) and the 1980s view of the HIV-positive (obviously depraved). “This is one of the larger trends in the history of medicine,” said Rudolph Leibel, a pioneer in obesity research at Columbia University. “First we blame it on the patient.”\n\nIf you’re the reformer type, you’ve stopped blaming patients and started blaming society—the food industry, the chemicals industry, globalism. But what if even this enlightened analysis of the obesity epidemic distracts us from a more pressing question? What if Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move!” campaign and Michael Bloomberg’s sugary-drink ban divert attention from the problem that most needs solving?\n\nThe biggest mystery when it comes to obesity is not how to prevent it. It’s how to treat it. Don’t get me wrong. We need to know what expands our girth so that millions more don’t suffer the type 2 diabetes and heart disease that follow. But millions are obese, right now, and the medical establishment doesn’t really know how to help them. I learned that to my dismay when I tried to find a program for a relative who seemed too young for stomach bands and gastric bypasses. The problem is simple and well known. It’s hard but not impossible to lose weight. But it’s nearly impossible to keep it off.",
  "latent_23909": "CLOSE A GOP-backed overtime bill that would give employees the choice between more time off or time-and-a-half pay has made its way through the House. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nWal-Mart has plans to expand in the U.S. in 2017. (Photo11: Wal-Mart)\n\nCash or time off?\n\nIf Republicans have their way, it’s a choice more companies will be able to offer their hourly-wage employees working overtime.\n\nVoting along party lines, the House of Representatives passed a bill Tuesday that would allow private-sector employers to compensate their overtime-working employees with paid time off instead of paying them time-and-a-half as currently required.\n\nThe bill, H.R. 1180, would tweak the Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandates employers that require hourly-paid employees to work more than 40 hours a week to pay time-and-a-half, or 1.5 times their usual hourly rate. The bill also prohibits employers from coercing or intimidating employees to choose time off instead of overtime pay.\n\nHouse Republicans passed the bill, sponsored by Rep. Martha Roby (R-Ala.), with no Democrats voting in favor. The bill will now go to the Senate, where it will require 60 votes to avoid a filibuster by Democrats.\n\nBusinesses, including many retailers, hospitals, factory operators, general contractors, franchise owners and small businesses, have lobbied for the measure for years, asserting that it would give them more flexibility and some employees would actually prefer to have time off to attend to personal matters.\n\nWorker advocates criticized the bill and say it’s a move by businesses to avoid paying overtime pay. “This is a lousy bargain for the employees,” wrote Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, in a blog.\n\nAfter multiple veto threats from the Obama Administration, I appreciate that the White House is now working with us to advance this bill. — Rep. Martha Roby (@RepMarthaRoby) May 2, 2017\n\nEisenbrey says the bill empowers employers to dictate when employees can take time off. \"There’s no guarantee that (employees) will get to take the leave when they need it,\" he wrote. \"If the employer thinks the requested time off would be unduly disruptive to its operations it can refuse the request.\"\n\n\"Simply put, HR 1180 is a scam. It pretends to offer a benefit to employees, but in reality it’s a benefit to employers who get to schedule overtime work but delay paying for it for up to 13 months,\" he said.\n\nGetting time off under the bill would also amount to the employee making a zero-interest loan of overtime pay to the employer, Eisenbrey said. “Employees who have no paid vacation or paid sick leave will feel pressured into giving up their right to receive overtime pay in order to have some hope of getting time off in the future.”\n\n“Today, @HouseGOP are voting to make it legal for employers to cheat workers out of overtime.

Khan, Ahmed Mengli and Alexander Smith\n\nPESHAWAR, Pakistan — The Taliban had called for special prayers in the hope President Donald Trump would call for a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan, members of the group told NBC News.\n\nTrump ended up taking the opposite path on Monday and backed a continued military presence that centered around empowering his generals and squeezing neighboring Pakistan, a U.S. ally that has often been accused of harboring and enabling terror groups.\n\nThis angered many in Pakistan, with several lawmakers publicly denouncing Trump for calling them out on the world stage.\n\nBut the Taliban, which has regained control of swaths of the country since being toppled in 2001, claimed that despite Trump going against their wishes they were happy to keep fighting in America's longest war.\n\n\"We know how to defend our motherland,\" said one of the commanders, who, like many of the militants, spoke on condition of anonymity. \"If we could fight this war for 16 years with limited resources against the world's well-equipped armies, we are happy to continue this fight against the enemy.\"\n\nThe senior Taliban figures interviewed by NBC News said they were surprised and disappointed by Trump's decision to stick with a conflict that has shown no signs of ending across three U.S. administrations. They had expected him to follow through on his erstwhile viewpoint that the U.S. should pull out.\n\n\"President Trump also failed to understand Afghanistan and the problems there,\" said another senior Taliban commander.\n\n\"I am grateful to President Trump and the American people for this affirmation of support\"\n\n\"We thought him different from his predecessors, but like other U.S. presidents, he too succumbed to the pressure and misinformation of his military commanders and succeeded in wasting their human lives and resources in Afghanistan,\" the commander added, after watching Trump's announcement in a remote village in Afghanistan's Helmand province — a militant stronghold.\n\nLater, the Taliban issued an official statement warning that if the U.S. did not pull out the group would \"make this country the 21st century graveyard for the American empire.\"\n\nMore than a decade-and-a-half since the U.S. toppled the Taliban government after it sheltered the authors of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S., the American military has shown little sign of driving out the militant group.\n\nDuring its time in power, the Taliban imposed its harsh interpretation of Islam on the country, forcing women to wear head-to-toe burkas, discouraging girls from going to school, and jailing men who did not grow beards. They also introduced public executions and amputations for crimes such as adultery, and banned music, television and the movies.\n\nWhile the war ousted them from power, it has seen the deaths of more than 2,200 American military personnel, tens of thousands of civilians, and has cost the American taxpayers an estimated $714 billion. Even today, the U.S.-backed Afghan government controls less than 60 percent of its own country — and militant groups such as the Taliban control much of the rest.\n\nA U.S. soldier points his rifle at a doorway after coming under fire from the Taliban while on patrol in Zharay district in Kandahar province, southern Afghanistan, in 2012. Baz Ratner / Reuters file\n\n'Tried, tested and failed'\n\nAnother pillar of Trump's strategy that he announced Monday was his pledge to squeeze neighboring Pakistan, which has long since been accused of harboring militant groups.\n\n\"We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,\" he said. \"Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbor terrorists.\"\n\nThis line provoked an angry reaction in the country.\n\n\"President Trump is banking on a tried, tested and failed strategy,\" said Mushahid Hussain, a senator in the Pakistani legislature and chairman of the country's Senate Defence Committee.\n\nHussain asked, if President Barack Obama's \"surge\" of 100,000 troops didn't work in 2009, why would a bolstered force from Trump be effective?\n\n\"For the first time since he became President, Mr. Trump seems to have embraced the traditional Washington/American establishment playbook on Afghanistan,\" he added. \"I was hoping he'd make new mistakes, rather than repeat old ones!\"\n\nSherry Rehman, Pakistan's former ambassador in Washington and a serving senator, said that while Trump's decision \"doesn't sound new,\" his explicit blaming of her country would only \"amplify old dogma to new levels.\"\n\nIt also prompted a strongly worded string of tweets from opposition firebrand Imran Khan.\n\n\"Vilifying Pakistan appears to be a convenient pillar in the new U.S. policy for Afghanistan,\" said Maj. Gen. Isfandiyar Pataudi, the former deputy-director general of Pakistan's intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI.\n\n\"Pakistan’s sacrifices, and the cost paid in blood and treasure, have been trivialized by the repetitive 'havens and sanctuaries' mantra that is the excuse of choice for failure to bring peace to Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\nThe ISI has long been accused of supporting militants fighting in Afghanistan, a claim Pakistan vehemently denies.\n\n'Very happy'\n\nIn Afghanistan itself, however, some people welcomed Trump's renewed commitment.\n\n\"I am very happy by Trump’s new strategy,\" said Abo Zar, a member of the Hazara ethnicity, many of whom are bitter foes of the Taliban which persecuted the group while in power.\n\n\"It clearly says that American troops will not leave and will not allow the Taliban to gain power again,\" said the 24-year-old.\n\nThe U.S.-backed Afghan government also embraced Trump's announcement.\n\n\"I am grateful to President Trump and the American people for this affirmation of support for our efforts to achieve self-reliance and for our joint struggle to rid the region from the threat of terrorism,\" said Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. \"The U.S.-Afghan partnership is stronger than ever in overcoming the threat of terrorism that threatens us all.\"\n\nIn Kunduz province, which has seen heavy fighting involving the Taliban, 21-year-old student Haji Mohammad Omar said he too was pleased.\n\n\"We are happy about this new strategy of U.S.\" he said. \"We are the people who have suffered bloodshed, war and murder for long time.\"\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that the U.S. war had so far been unsuccessful.\n\n\"We are agree with Trump's strategy for war against terrorism by killing the terrorist and extremist groups. But we have witnessed 16 years of war, of U.S. in Afghanistan, and we haven't seen a positive impact for the life of Afghans ... However we are still optimistic for this strategy.\"\n\nMushtaq Yusufzai reported from Peshawar, Pakistan, Wajahat S.

  "latent_24472": "A former University of Oregon student could face the death penalty in North Korea if he is convicted on charges that he planned to overthrow the North Korean government.\n\nKenneth Bae, a U.S. tour operator, has been detained by North Korea since early November. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in South Korea but most recently lived in Washington state.\n\nThe United States on Monday called on North Korea to release Bae immediately on humanitarian grounds. A State Department spokesman said at a news conference that the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang was able to visit with Bae on Friday.\n\nBae spent seven terms as a full-time student at the UO between 1988 and 1990, UO spokeswoman Julie Brown said Monday. A psychology major, he earned 75 credits, but not a degree. Brown did not know why Bae left the university.\n\nHe registered for classes using his Korean name, Bae Jun-ho.\n\nUO alum Bobby Lee, 44, said he and Bae were �practically roommates� during their years at UO. Lee, now a policy adviser for Gov. John Kitzhaber, said he learned about Bae�s detainment after running in the Eugene Marathon on Sunday. �I couldn�t believe it,� he said.\n\nThe two met as freshmen while volunteering for a UO tutoring program for disadvantaged students in 1988.\n\n�He was excited,� Lee said of Bae. �He wanted to make friends. He was a very social guy.�\n\nThe two traveled the Oregon Coast frequently, Lee said. Bae also loved to cook.\n\n�He�d invite everyone to come over,� he said. �He�d make us a Korean meal.�\n\nDennis Kwon, 44, also met Bae as a freshman at the UO through the Korean Student Association. The two would set up tables at the Erb Memorial Union at the university�s International Night to educate students about South Korean culture. They cooked together and practiced marital arts.\n\n�He was very compassionate about helping others,� Kwon said. �I remember he�d help Korean exchange students adjust to campus life.�\n\nKwon, who graduated from the UO in 1991, was Bae�s best man at his wedding in 1990. Bae left the UO soon after to work in California to support his wife, Kwon said.\n\nAlthough neither Kwon nor Lee kept in touch with Bae after college, they are trying to spread the word about his detainment.\n\n�He�s not well-known,� Lee said. �He deserves the same level of attention that previous North Korean detainees received. We want people to care.�\n\nLee said he has contacted U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden and Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who in January tried to see Bae during a private trip to North Korea but was rebuffed by the government there.\n\nBae operated a travel company that took tourists and prospective investors to North Korea. He led a group of five European tourists into the country in November, a North Korean human rights activist told The Associated Press, when he was arrested in Rason, a northeastern region of North Korea near the China-Russia border.\n\nThe state-run Korean Central News Agency reported on Saturday that Bae was being tried in the country�s Supreme Court on charges that he plotted to overthrow the North Korean government.\n\nAlthough the exact details of his arrest are unknown, the Korean news agency asserted that Bae admitted his guilt and that the charges are backed by evidence � a crime punishable by death in North Korea.\n\nSouth Korean human rights advocates have described Bae as a devout Christian who not only ran tours to North Korea but was interested in helping orphans in the communist country. They said security officials in the North may have been offended by pictures of orphans that Bae had taken and stored in his computer.\n\nNorth Korea, a police state, has often used the plight of detained Americans as a bargaining chip in its dealings with Washington. Some were freed only after former U.S. presidents traveled to the North. Bae is the sixth American detained by North Korea since 2009, but he is facing the gravest charges.\n\nThe North has been locked in a standoff with the United States and South Korea since it detonated a nuclear bomb in February.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",
  "latent_24504": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla., and TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- If you have to ask the question regarding Florida State-Alabama, then you probably don't deserve a straight answer from its season-opening participants.\n\nYou know, the offseason question circling the powerhouse programs in these two cities? It goes something like this depending which campus you're on.\n\n(Just to make sure, I visited both teams recently to ask it.)\n\nHave you thought yet about playing the Tide/Noles?\n\n\"You can't help but think about it,\" said FSU defensive back Trey Marshall.\n\n\"They have to be No. 1 in my opinion,\" Nick Saban said of the Noles.\n\nMore than history will be made on Sept. 2 when the teams meet in Atlanta's new Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Consider that teams ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the 81-year-old AP Top 25 have never met in a season opener.\n\nIf the rankings cooperate with such a matchup -- and they should -- it would be the earliest such 1-2 game in history.\n\nIn the AP Top 25, that history goes back to 1943 when No. 1 Notre Dame beat No. 2 Michigan, 35-12.\n\nIf Florida State-Alabama isn't one of the biggest season openers ever, it's in the red zone of the discussion.\n\n\"This is probably going to be -- if not the biggest -- one of the biggest games for us besides the playoffs and championships,\" said Alabama All-American defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick.\n\n\"Of course it's different, man,\" FSU safety Derwin James said. \"When you say, 'Alabama,' you know what kind of team you're going to play. They come with it.\"\n\nThere's that history and the distinct possibility -- likelihood even -- the loser is not out of the College Football Playoff chase. The programs are so powerful at the moment -- ear muffs, Nick -- either one could \"afford\" to lose the epic matchup.\n\nC'mon, it's easy to envision a 12-1 Florida State or Alabama in the CFP. The Crimson Tide, by the way, enter as an early 4.5-point favorite.\n\nIsn't that sort of where we were last December when No. 1 Alabama had built such a cushion it supposedly could have lost the SEC Championship Game to Florida and still remained in the top four?\n\nWhen that was suggested to Saban the week of the game, he famously ranted, \"It's never OK to lose a game.\"\n\nSmack dab in the lull of the offseason, Saban was more introspective, actually contemplating the implications of a loss while relaxed in a Tide meeting room.\n\n\"The consequence of the game is you really find out where your team is,\" he said. \"Even if you lose, I think it really helps your prepare for the difficult games you have in the conference down the road.\"\n\nSaban began playing such nationally-relevant nonconference games the moment he arrived at Alabama in 2007. That year, Florida State -- still coached by Bobby Bowden -- beat the Tide 21-14 in Jacksonville, Florida. Alabama hasn't lost its traditional marquee nonconference game since.\n\nSeven of the nine contests have been against ranked teams -- three of them against top 10 opponents. All but a home-and-home with Penn State (2010-11) have been at neutral sites.\n\n\"I guess you have to look at it from a historical perspective,\" Saban continued. \"I viewed it, when we first came here, it was much-needed exposure for the program to play in some high- profile games.\n\n\"Probably the thing that ignited this program more than anything else was that second year we were here. Clemson was ranked ninth [when we played]. Nobody even knows who we are.\"\n\nMuch-needed exposure? Nobody knows who we are? Poor-mouthing never sounded so, well, poor.\n\nYou can look it up. No. 24 Alabama did win that 2008 matchup over No. 9 Clemson, 34-10 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. Sixteen months later, the Crimson Tide were national champions.\n\nThe Run had begun.\n\n\"I think the players in the offseason are more focused,\" Saban said of preparing for such games. \"Whether it's winter conditioning, spring practice, in the summer, it's almost like the season is over and you're looking forward to playing a really good team in the Sugar Bowl.\"\n\nThe storylines are juicy. This is Saban's first meeting against his old LSU offensive coordinator in Jimbo Fisher. The friends won a national championship together in 2003. Fisher would be the first former Saban assistant to beat the Alabama coach.\n\nSaban's accomplishments are well-documented. Fisher (78-17 at FSU) has taken the Bowden legacy and shined it up to make it even more gilded. Saban and Fisher have combined to win five of the last nine national championships.\n\nThe ACC race long ago boiled down to the annual Florida State-Clemson game. Fisher has won four of those seven head-to-head matchups. The Seminoles have won three ACC titles under Fisher, including the last BCS Championship Game after the 2013 season.\n\n\"I never had any doubt Jimbo would do very well,\" Saban said. \"He's really smart, bright, good recruiter, related well with the kids, good teacher, tough.\"\n\nSomeone call the Hosanna Abuse Hotline.\n\nSmall-town West Virginia blood courses through both coaches. A couple of weeks ago, Fisher was hunting bears in Idaho with his son Ethan. Saban fondly recalls taking backgrounds from his native Fairmont, West Virginia, 3 ½ hours to watch Roberto Clemente play in Pittsburgh.\n\nBoth coaches have accomplished sophomore quarterbacks (Jalen Hurts at Bama, Deondre Francois at FSU). Both have monster secondaries. Both have loaded backfields. Both may debut freshman studs at tailback -- Najee Harris and Cam Akers, respectively.\n\nThe Tide are expected to start as the preseason No. 1. The Noles State might have their best team since those 2013 national champions led by Jameis Winston.\n\nIf they don't both start in the top four, there needs to be a Congressional investigation of a different kind.\n\n\"We're ready to show the world what they've been waiting for,\" James said. \"What better way to do it than against the top-notch [team] in the country?\"\n\nOh, and there is the small matter of conference pride. In the only league where it matters this much, the SEC is looking up at the ACC -- for the moment -- as the best conference in the country.\n\nThe game could literally set the tone for the entire season. Is there any doubt the teams could rematch in the CFP? Shoot, Alabama has played Clemson in back-to-back natties.\n\nThe Tide continues to carry the mental burden of blowing a two-touchdown lead against the Tigers in last season's CFP National Championship losing with a second to go.\n\n\"Looking back to Clemson, it was the smallest things is why we lost,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"They had a whole lot of talent at Clemson, but it wasn't more than us.\"\n\nThis is a program that beats itself up after the end of a 26-game winning streak and a 14-win season.\n\n\"I'm a quiet person. I always keep to myself. Lay low,\" Fitzpatrick added. \"I had to get loud, cuss some people out in offseason conditioning.\"\n\nSo much for the lull of the offseason.\n\nFlorida State's sixth (at least) 10-win season under Fisher will be remembered as much for the losses -- three of them on the field, but also James tearing his left meniscus while on his way to an All-American season.\n\nJames was considered so valuable as a leader he was included on the travel squad the rest of the season. Being active for the season opener is a benediction of his health -- and the Alabama game.\n\nIn the offseason, James trained with Alabama tailback Bo Scarbrough and defensive back Ronnie Harrison. James says assorted Crimson Tide have even been to his Tallahassee home to play video games.\n\n\"Bo told me he's going to bring it every play. I told him I was going to bring it every play,\" James said. \"At the end of the day, that's all we can hope for.\"\n\nFSU redshirt senior defensive back Nate Andrews played only four games last season, getting a medical redshirt after tearing a pectoral muscle, dislocating a shoulder and injuring a calf.\n\nFor the native of Fairhope, Alabama, who was recruited by the Crimson Tide, this is definitely a big deal.\n\n\"This game actually popped up in conversation last summer,\" Andrews said. \"I was messing with the guys on the team, 'Ya'll gotta play Alabama next year.' Then I ended up getting hurt. Then I got a redshirt.\n\n\"Oh snap, now I have to play Alabama now.\"\n\nMarshall will miss the first half after being flagged for targeting against Michigan in the Orange Bowl. The senior's fearsome hitting style has become a YouTube compilation.\n\n\"I've got to have a TV or something [in the first half],\" Marshall said.\n\nThe rest of the country has likely thought ahead. Alabama-Florida State is big-screen eye candy, a blockbuster before Labor Day, a barometer on the national climate.\n\nPerhaps the question is not whether it matter … but how?",

  "latent_24867": "Financial Services Commission chairman Yim Jong-yong (Yonhap)\n\nKorea will cut red tape related to “robo advisers,” allowing intelligent machines to advise retail investors where to put their money from later this year, the nation’s top financial regulator said Thursday.In addition, a new class of human advisors who work independently for clients and do not represent any bank, securities or insurance firm, will be allowed to debut, the Financial Services Commission said.“The plans are intended at advancing Korea’s financial advisory industry and enhancing wealth enhancement opportunities for financial consumers living in this era of low interest rates and a longer life after retirement,” Kim Tae-hyun, a FSC director, told reporters in Seoul.Currently, “robo advisers,” which refer to services that provide automated, algorithm-based portfolio management tips, are available in Korea only in a hybrid form that involves humans – professional investment advisers – as a conduit between the new investment tool and clients.The FSC will push to revise related laws to allow the launch of entirely automated services. It expects to see beta services starting from July.Robo advice, with its low-cost service and mass-market use, is a hot new trend in the financial advisory world. It is projected to grow into a market of $450 billion by 2020 from $20 billion at the end of June 2015.Korean authorities see it as having the potential to augment investment services for the underserved population of financial customers who do not meet traditional standards for private banking services.According to the FSC, four Korean commercial banks and 10 securities companies have started, or have plans to offer robo advice this year.The envisioned independent financial advisers will be prohibited from earning commissions from financial companies with respect to their product recommendations or sales. Instead, they can charge clients for their investment tips, the FSC said.To open the door to the new group of advisers, the regulator plans to ease the minimum capital requirements for financial advisory service providers to 100 million won ($85,709) from the current 500 million won.By Lee Sun-young (milaya@heraldcorp.com)",
  "latent_24898": "The National Labor Relations Act forbids employers from interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of rights relating to organizing, forming, joining or assisting a labor organization for collective bargaining purposes, or from working together to improve terms and conditions of employment, or refraining from any such activity. Similarly, labor organizations may not restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of these rights.\n\nExamples of employer conduct that violates the law:\n\nThreatening employees with loss of jobs or benefits if they join or vote for a union or engage in protected concerted activity.\n\nThreatening to close the plant if employees select a union to represent them.\n\nQuestioning employees about their union sympathies or activities in circumstances that tend to interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights under the Act.\n\nPromising benefits to employees to discourage their union support.\n\nTransferring, laying off, terminating, assigning employees more difficult work tasks, or otherwise punishing employees because they engaged in union or protected concerted activity.\n\nTransferring, laying off, terminating, assigning employees more difficult work tasks, or otherwise punishing employees because they filed unfair labor practice charges or participated in an investigation conducted by NLRB.\n\nExamples of labor organization conduct that violates the law:\n\nThreats to employees that they will lose their jobs unless they support the union.\n\nSeeking the suspension, discharge or other punishment of an employee for not being a union member even if the employee has paid or offered to pay a lawful initiation fee and periodic fees thereafter.\n\nRefusing to process a grievance because an employee has criticized union officials or because an employee is not a member of the union in states where union security clauses are not permitted.\n\nFining employees who have validly resigned from the union for engaging in protected concerted activities following their resignation or for crossing an unlawful picket line.\n\nEngaging in picket line misconduct, such as threatening, assaulting, or barring non-strikers from the employer's premises.\n\nStriking over issues unrelated to employment terms and conditions or coercively enmeshing neutrals into a labor dispute.\n\nWhat rules govern collective bargaining for a contract?\n\nAfter employees choose a union as a bargaining representative, the employer and union are required to meet at reasonable times to bargain in good faith about wages, hours, vacation time, insurance, safety practices and other mandatory subjects. Some managerial decisions such as subcontracting, relocation, and other operational changes may not be mandatory subjects of bargaining, but the employer must bargain about the decision's effects on unit employees.\n\nIt is an unfair labor practice for either party to refuse to bargain collectively with the other, but parties are not compelled to reach agreement or make concessions.\n\nIf after sufficient good faith efforts, no agreement can be reached, the employer may declare impasse, and then implement the last offer presented to the union. However, the union may disagree that true impasse has been reached and file a charge of an unfair labor practice for failure to bargain in good faith. The NLRB will determine whether true impasse was reached based on the history of negotiations and the understandings of both parties.\n\nIf the Agency finds that impasse was not reached, the employer will be asked to return to the bargaining table. In an extreme case, the NLRB may seek a federal court order to force the employer to bargain.\n\nThe parties' obligations do not end when the contract expires. They must bargain in good faith for a successor contract, or for the termination of the agreement, while terms of the expired contract continue.\n\nA party wishing to end the contract must notify the other party in writing 60 days before the expiration date, or 60 days before the proposed termination. The party must offer to meet and confer with the other party and notify the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service of the existence of a dispute if no agreement has been reached by that time.\n\nHow is \"good faith\" bargaining determined?\n\nThere are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of NLRB cases dealing with the issue of the duty to bargain in good faith. In determining whether a party is bargaining in good faith, the Board will look at the totality of the circumstances. The duty to bargain in good faith is an obligation to participate actively in the deliberations so as to indicate a present intention to find a basis for agreement. This implies both an open mind and a sincere desire to reach an agreement as well as a sincere effort to reach a common ground.\n\nThe additional requirement to bargain in \"good faith\" was incorporated to ensure that a party did not come to the bargaining table and simply go through the motions. There are objective criteria that the NLRB will review to determine if the parties are honoring their obligation to bargain in good faith, such as whether the party is willing to meet at reasonable times and intervals and whether the party is represented by someone who has the authority to make decisions at the table.\n\nConduct away from the bargaining table may also be relevant. For instance if an Employer were to make a unilateral change in the terms and conditions of employees employment without bargaining, that would be an indication of bad faith.\n\nWhat are the rules about union dues?\n\nThe amount of dues collected from employees represented by unions is subject to federal and state laws and court rulings.\n\nThe NLRA allows employers and unions to enter into union-security agreements, which require all employees in a bargaining unit to become union members and begin paying union dues and fees within 30 days of being hired.\n\nEven under a security agreement, employees who object to full union membership may continue as 'core' members and pay only that share of dues used directly for representation, such as collective bargaining and contract administration. Known as objectors, they are no longer full members but are still protected by the union contract. Unions are obligated to tell all covered employees about this option, which was created by a Supreme Court ruling and is known as the Beck right.\n\nAn employee may object to union membership on religious grounds, but in that case, must pay an amount equal to dues to a nonreligious charitable organization.\n\nWhat about Right to Work states?\n\n27 states have banned union-security agreements by passing so-called \"right to work\" laws. In these states, it is up to each employee at a workplace to decide whether or not to join the union and pay dues, even though all workers are protected by the collective bargaining agreement negotiated by the union.",
  "latent_24911": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia urged South Korea on Friday to halt plans for an artillery drill that North Korea had said hours earlier would prompt a new strike at the South.\n\nStepping up diplomatic efforts, Russia’s Foreign Ministry summoned the South Korean and U.S. ambassadors to express “extreme concern” over plans for a live-firing drill set to begin on Saturday on an island near a disputed maritime border.\n\n“The Russian Federation insistently calls on the Republic of Korea to refrain from holding the planned firing of artillery in order to prevent the further escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula,” the Foreign Ministry said.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Alexei Borodavkin repeated the message in a meeting with the South Korean and American ambassadors in Moscow, the ministry said in a statement. It said U.S. military officers were to observe the Dec 18-21 drill.\n\nRussia said a similar drill on Nov 23 had “provoked an exchange of fire ... that caused casualties,” echoing Pyongyang’s assertion that its shelling of Yeonpyeong island was a response to what Seoul said was a routine artillery drill.\n\nNorth Korea said earlier on Friday that it would strike again, with an even stronger response than the shelling that killed four people last month, if Seoul goes ahead with its planned live-firing drill on the island.\n\nThe Russian statement marked a shift to a tougher line on South Korea’s military drills.\n\nWhen Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met his North Korean counterpart on Monday, Lavrov said military exercises had added to tension but also that the North’s shelling of the island deserved condemnation, according to the ministry.\n\nOn Friday, the Russian ministry expressed “deep concern” about South Korea’s planned drill and said it was “extremely important” to ease tension between the two Koreas, restore dialogue and resolve all disputes without using force.\n\nRussia, which shares a short border with North Korea, has put its forces in the nation’s far east on alert because of the Korean tension, the Interfax news agency cited the chief of the military General Staff as saying on Tuesday.\n\nRussia was one of the participants in long-suspended six-nation talks over North Korea’s nuclear program. North Korea was a beneficiary of Moscow’s largesse during the Cold War, but China now has more influence with Pyongyang.",
  "latent_25009": "This is quite possibly the best and most thoughtful gift exchange I have ever received!\n\nGot the scare of my life when I opened the box to find cobwebs with spiders all over it, splattered blood and cackling laughs and then a bit of thriller playing. I knew straight away that the contents were going to be amazing.\n\nI saw a card and opened that first. It was a card with a lovely picture of tower bridge on it. I opened it and was greeted by more evil cackling laughter (and I'd just gotten over the first shock!) I'm starting to like these noise makers now though. The card let me know the flavour of my cake pops and let me know that once I'm past the spiders it's treats all the way. What more could I ask for!\n\nOnce I got past cobwebs and spiders I got to the contents. A massive bag of amazing vanilla, chocolate and coconut cake pops which I must say look incredibly professional and taste DELICIOUS! I massively approve of the new recipe :)\n\nThen there were two bags, one that was for my inner child and one for my inner adult. I opened the inner adult bag first and saw a beautiful ted baker bag which I loved. I thought that this was generous enough but then realised that there was something else inside! Inside was a lovely smelling candle (love nice smelly candles!) and a matching body spray and hand cream. Incredible.\n\nThen I opened the bag for my inner child which was filled with my favourite childhood sweets. Can't wait to start eating these and share them all with my housemates (or maybe not....).\n\nThis was such an amazing gift and it arrived at the perfect time. I've had a really tough few weeks and this week that was made worse but a few financial troubles so to then arrive home to this put the biggest smile on my face (and made my stomach very happy as well!). I can't thank you enough LittleBitOdd, it really was a spectacular present and you put so much thought and effort into it - I really appreciate it.\n\nThanks again, deubydeux",
  "latent_25070": "IRVING, Texas -- Cornerback Morris Claiborne played poorly last season, missed the entire preseason due to injuries and has said he will need a pain-killing shot to his right shoulder before playing in Sunday’s season opener.\n\nWhat gives the Dallas Cowboys confidence in Claiborne?\n\n“Well, he’s there,” defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli said. “He’s our starting corner. That’s the confidence. He’s gotta go do it.”\n\nQuite a ringing endorsement for the sixth overall pick in the 2012 draft, right?\n\nMarinelli isn’t the kind of coach who massages a player’s ego just for the sake of being polite. The fact is that Claiborne hasn’t done anything to merit much confidence since the Cowboys traded their top two picks for the right to move up eight spots to select him.\n\nA sprained AC joint in his left shoulder impacted Claiborne’s performance all last season, forcing him to wear a harness and undergo offseason surgery. He’s recovering from the same injury to his right shoulder, although this isn’t as serious and won’t require Claiborne to wear a harness.\n\nClaiborne, who essentially regained his starting job when Orlando Scandrick was suspended for four games, still must play through pain with a lot to prove.\n\n“The challenge for him [is] to simply come back and be consistent, playing his position and all aspects of it,” coach Jason Garrett said. “Did a really good job recovering from an injury at the end of last season, and he had to deal with another one during training camp. He’s really worked hard to get himself healthy and ready to go.\n\n“He has a chance to be a really good player for us and a complete player for us. Part of being a complete corner is being able to cover, play man, play zone, but also be a physical player at the line of scrimmage and as a tackler. We feel like he’s improved in that area, and hopefully this injury that he’s been dealing with doesn’t prevent him from being able to do that.”\n\nAs was the case last summer, Claiborne has downplayed concern about missing the entire preseason. He returned to practice last week and promised he’d be ready for Sunday’s season opener against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n“I’m not frustrated at all,” Claiborne said. “Where I’m at right now, I’m happy. I’m not upset at missing time or anything. I’m in a good place.”\n\nThat place is the starting lineup. It remains to be seen whether that’s good for the Cowboys.",
  "latent_25216": "There are many factors that affect what the health insurance company will charge you. Perhaps it would be helpful to you to learn about those factors, so that you can understand the quotes you are getting. Whatever you do, please work with an experienced agent. He can explain how this works and help you to understand the different terms and how the factors affect your quote. There is no cost to you to use a good agent and he can make the shopping experience less stressful.\n\nLet’s go through the different factors now:\n\nAge: As you might guess, the younger you are, the less you have to pay for health insurance. Why? Because generally speaking, younger people are healthier than older people. As we age, different and various illnesses show up. Perhaps you are eating too well and you develop type 2 diabetes. Maybe you don’t get the exercise you should. Certainly, you will agree, that younger people are usually healthier than older people.\n\nGender: Males are much less complicated than women. This is said, tongue in cheek, but you might also agree. Just take the annual physical for example. A woman needs an OBGYN exam, a mamagram, pap smear along with all the other blood tests to determine if she is well. Men usually will have blood tests and a cancer screening PSA test.\n\nPsychologically, women tend to use medical services much more than men, also. A typical man feels invulnerable and won’t go to the doctor unless he is really sick. I know, this is generalization, but it is generally true!\n\nHealth history: How healthy have you been? Are you the right weight for your height and gender? Have you developed a condition such as elevated blood pressure or elevated cholesterol? Our human body is extremely complex and so many things can go wrong. Healthy individuals will get a lower premium quote because the health insurance company in NC extrapolates your health into the future. That means, a healthy person will likely remain healthy. A person with many health challenges, will have those challenges or more in the future.\n\nExercise: People who exercise typically have fewer problems with their weight. They have less susceptibility to insulin resistance – type 2 diabetes. They have fewer health problems of any kind. The recommended minimum amount of exercise for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina is twenty minutes of exercise for three times per week. Obviously, you can exercise more than this, but if you do at leas this amount, it will be beneficial.\n\nWhether already insured: If you have been covered by a health plan for years, the new insurance company interested in insuring you is less worried. Certainly, if you have been under a doctor’s care, it is less likely that you will develop an undiagnosed condition that the new insurance company would be responsible for.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult person to insure is one who has never had a family doctor. He may think that he is very healthy because he has not needed to see a medical person. However, there may be some condition that has been developing over the years that he is unaware of. That is why health insurance companies are happier if they need to insure someone who has had continual health coverage.\n\nType of plan chosen: If you choose a relatively new type of plan called a high deductible health plan, and use it in conjunction with a health savings account, you will definitely save money. The HSA type plan costs you less each month in premium amount. It costs about $60 for a doctor sick visit, but you are likely to save thousands of dollars each year on premiums.\n\nIn addition, if you have a high deductible health plan, you can open up a health savings account at your local bank. Money that you deposit into your health savings account can be used for any medical expense…and importantly, that money is not taxed! Money that isn’t taxed means that you save about 40% in taxes.\n\nBy the way, if you don’t spend all your savings in any year, it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t go away like in a flexible spending account. This savings money is yours, like an IRA, and it will be there to help you pay your medical expenses. At the age 65, you can take the money out of your account and use it for anything you’d like…finally though, you will have to pay taxes on the money. However, if you spend it on medical expenses, you will never pay the income tax. Great sound to that eh?\n\nDeductible chosen: If you choose a high deductible plan, the insurance provider will not charge you as much of a penalty, called a “rate up”. A rate up is extra premium that that require because you may be on high blood pressure medicine, for example. That rate up takes into consideration that you will need medication for the rest of your life, most likely.\n\nIf you choose a high deductible plan, they calculate that you are willing to take on more risk. Therefore, the insurance company doesn’t have to charge you as much per month. If you are looking to save money, choose a higher deductible plan.\n\nInsurance company: The insurance company that you choose is very important in how you will be charged. Some insurance providers have many subscribers in the state and consequently, they can spread the risk over many, many people. As an example, BCBSNC, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina insures about 90% of the people in NC. Consequently, their rates are more stable and they aren’t affected by pockets of the state that my turn up to be less healthy.\n\nThe insurance company is important in being able to see the doctor of your choice and go to whichever hospital you need to go to. Because an insurance company has great penetration in a state, means that virtually all the doctors and all the hospitals will participate as a health provider. That’s good for you because you have better choices.\n\nHealth Insurance Agent: A good agent who specializes in health insurance can provide you with a depth of knowledge about the plans that might fit you best. Another way the agent can help is interpreting how to answer the questions. Many times, people read something into the question that isn’t there, and answer it improperly. You don’t want to answer a question that wasn’t asked. Read it carefully and then ask your agent his opinion about what it means. The agent is paid a commission by the insurance company – not the insured. So use an agent who is a specialist.\n\nWhat other factors can you think of that I haven’t listed here? Have you had an experience that would tend to disagree with what I have written? Let me know if you think this article was helpful.",
  "latent_25244": "The full Shadows over Innistrad spoiler has finally arrived. Like so many other players, I’ve spent the past few days poring over the card list and trying to figure out how to make these new cards work. While there are many words written during this time with regards to Pauper, most of them are manifestations of hope. Pauper has a massive card pool, and for a new card to supplant something that already exists is a fairly big ask. Trying to find a new element that breathes life into an archetype is a rare occurrence. Shadows over Innistrad may not give rise to entirely new decks, but it has an abundance of tools to aid decks that have been operating on the outskirts of the format. On balance, I believe Shadows tilts toward a set that could seriously impact Pauper.\n\nThe mechanics present all in the set play into existing archetypes and also align with current lines of play. There are decks that want to discard for value, decks that want to fill the graveyard, and decks that benefit from incidental artifacts. The foundation exists for Shadows over Innistrad to shine its gloomy light.\n\nAngelic Purge represents a more permanent Oblivion Ring for Pauper. The lack of Planeswalkers hardly hurts the card in a format in which they do not exist. Purge is on par with Terminate and Journey to Nowhere for its ability to handle any creature (including the omnipresent Gurmag Angler) while also being able to take out Oubliette, Rancor, Curse of the Bloody Tome, or Prophetic Prism just to name a few. That it exiles and prevents Unearth or Haunted Fengraf from doing their job cannot be discounted. The cost of sacrificing a permanent is not negligible and requires a deck that can afford to send something to the bin for a benefit.\n\nThe various Kuldotha decks are perfect for Angelic Purge. They already feature a full complement of Ichor Wellspring and other cards that have versions of a death trigger. While not currently the most popular, the ability to add an on-color Vindicate may be enough to get players to give the deck another shot. It is also likely to see this paired with the wide array of creatures that do not currently see play but have no problem hitting the bin—Sultai Emissary, Viridian Emissary, and Jeskai Sage to name a few.\n\nDauntless Cathar and Ghoulcaller’s Apprentice are both cards that meet a vital criteria: They are resilient to Chainer's Edict–style effects. While neither of these creatures creates a body upon entering or leaving the battlefield, their afterlives can be saved for a turn that would otherwise be empty. Neither token is generated at above rate, but the fact that neither Spirit nor Zombie costs an actual card is huge. Extra creatures are incredibly valuable in certain matchups, and the ability to store reasonable ones on decent bodies is a surefire way to be considered for a spot in a Pauper deck. Out of these, Dauntless Cathar is more likely to be played, as the 1/1 flyer for is more attractive in the midgame than a 2/2 for .\n\nStern Constable is out first madness outlet. A free Spellshaper, it can tap any creature that can prove useful against 5/5 Zombie Fish and 8/8 Eldrazi with annihilator. In the past, Gideon's Lawkeeper and Goldmeadow Harrier saw play in White Weenie as a repeatable answer to large threats. The metagame has gone wider—even Tron resolves more than one creature these days. The Constable, however, can put cards like Battle Screech and Cenn's Enlistment into the graveyard for value and is one of the few new discard outlets without a mana cost attached. While it’s not high on my list, I could absolutely see running some in the right situation.\n\nThere is an abundance of non-pump spells in Shadows over Innistrad. Strength of Arms, Grotesque Mutation, and Rush of Adrenaline all reward other colors for attempting to play like a Stompy deck. Black, white, and red all have strong suites of creatures that are easily enhanced. Out of all of these, Rush is the most interesting due to the fact that it can turn any 2-power creature into a candidate for Temur Battle Rage. Rush also has the advantage of being in a color with prowess, and casting it on a Mage-Ring Bully or Sanguinary Mage could mean quite a bit of damage. With Titan's Strength, red potentially has enough combat tricks to attempt a non-Goblins aggressive strategy.\n\nStrength of Arms is the least likely to see play, as the rider of creating a token is hardest to achieve. Mutation is another in a long line of cards that make me yearn for an aggressive black deck and leave me with the understanding that now is not the right time.\n\nThraben Inspector provides a small body with the opportunity to draw a card later. On turn four, it is a chump-blocker with a draw-a-card kicker. Where things get interesting is in the same Kuldotha decks as mentioned for Angelic Purge. Kor Skyfisher and Thraben Inspector comprise a decent combo, as it means more cards in the future or the ability to present two threats without resetting a board state. The fact that Clues are artifacts means that cards like Galvanic Blast become that much easier to cast.\n\nRiffing on Kuldotha Boros and Jeskai, this deck is more concerned with advancing its board position than recasting Ichor Wellspring for value. Angelic Purge is an upgrade on Kuldotha Rebirth in its ability to affect the board. The above list is screaming for a Bonesplitter, but for an initial run, I’d want to push in this direction before finding which card to cut for the Equipment.\n\nDeny Existence is an interesting card. When playing against black decks as a blue mage, I am loath to see Liliana's Specter on turn four. Losing a card in these matchups is horrible, but countering it is a fool’s errand, as Unearth is a real possibility. Deny Existence helps fight on that axis. Against decks with Unearth it turns off the opponent’s ability to eke out additional value. Haunted Fengraf has become a key part of the Tron deck, but Deny Existence can turn off the opponent’s ability to recur Ulamog's Crusher or Fangren Marauder. While it is often going to compete with Essence Scatter and Exclude, Deny Existence has a home in sideboards for decks that want to stop a creature from ever, ever coming back around.\n\nOur first madness card is Just the Wind, and it is anything but air. For Just the Wind and others to see play, Pauper is going to have to lean harder old discard standbys like Wild Mongrel, Gathan Raiders, Merfolk Looter, Putrid Imp, Faithless Looting, and others. Shadows over Innistrad does not provide anything quite on this level, so we will have to make do. Just the Wind is better in the aggressive strategies that want to press their advantage. Using it in conjunction with Waterfront Bouncer to build an Undo or Kris Mage to pastiche a Jilt are fine. Pitching it to Wild Mongrel to clear a path initially seems to be the best use. Just the Wind is going to be an often-attempted card, and I hope it finds a home.\n\nIf it does, it may be alongside Nagging Thoughts. While not the best card-selection spell available to blue, it does have the advantage of having madness. The ability to add a card to the graveyard for something like Gurmag Angler or Werebear also matters. Nagging Thoughts is not flashy, but it may just be an important piece of glue for decks that want to discard for value.\n\nMurderous Compulsion is one of those obviously good cards. For 2 mana, it can kill anything that has attacked. At sorcery speed, this is unexciting, while at instant speed, it can shut down any attacker. As one of the few black spells that can handle a Gurmag Angler, it is a reason to attempt an aggressive madness deck. We will need enough discard outlets to make it consistent, and Vampire Hounds only lets you fuel it with creatures.\n\nUndertaker is another low-cost madness outlet that does a decent Tortured Existence impression. I like it here since it can be easily retrieved with Font of Return or Grave Scrabbler. Murderous Compulsion has a great fail case—same cost, just different speed—making it an ideal card to try out in Pauper. Even at its worst, it is pretty good. Twins of Mauer Estate earns the nod here as well, as the Vampire has decent stats. Outside of a dedicated madness deck, I’m not sure they see play.\n\nSanitarium Skeleton is everything I love. A small creature with the ability to come back, it is endless fuel for Tortured Existence. The enchantment is among the better engines available in Pauper, and it has been a fringe strategy for years. One of the things holding the deck back was that it did not always have creatures to use on demand. Versions without access to green mana would often run Golgari Brownscale in an effort to have enough naturally recurring creatures to use for the Existence. Sanitarium Skeleton solves that while being in the same color. Now for , the Tortured Existence player can draw any creature in his or her graveyard. Bojuka Bog is no longer the absolute dagger it once was if there is 3 mana available.\n\nThe goal will be staying alive long enough to make it to a point where everything is fair game. Innocent Blood and other removal spells should help in that scenario. Cards like Qarsi Sadist may see play as a way to put the Skeleton into the bin while padding a life total. I am not sure what the rest of the deck is going to look like—Tortured Existence decks are among the hardest to build for a wide metagame—but I do not doubt it will be a popular presence in the Pauper league in a few weeks.\n\nDual Shot is quite the card. While it cannot hit players and cannot play the role of Shock, it does a great job of keeping a board clear early. Delver, Goblins, and Stompy are all heavily played and have vulnerability to this style of card. It is hard to get better than 1 mana for this effect, and it is a much more reasonable main-deck inclusion than Electrickery for its ability to hit creatures while on the draw. If I had to guess which card made it into a 5–0 deck first, it would be this one.\n\nThe Werewolves are not easy to use effectively. As “just creatures,” they need to actively reward you for not casting spells. Out of all the Werewolves available, Hinterland Logger comes the closest. A 4/2 with trample is a very fast clock, and it happens to be the right size for Temur Battle Rage. I am not sure that Logger is good enough to stop casting spells, but it is certainly the closest.\n\nMoldgraf Scavenger was the card that generated the most discussion in Pauper circles upon its release. On its surface, it looks to be an efficient beater that can survive Lightning Bolt. However, the outside of the best-case scenario, this is an 0/4. Delirium was going to require a pretty hefty payoff to see play, and the Scavenger barely toes that line. The problem is that the setup cost is high in deck-building, and all the work can be undone by a single Bojuka Bog. Think about a hypothetical R/G deck. In order to have the best possible Scavenger, you would have to vary your burn suite with cards like Seal of Fire, Pyrite Spellbomb, and Pillar of Flame. These cards are fine, but running all of them, the payoff becomes a 3-power creature. Running Lightning Bolt and friends makes it possible to cast a Hooting Mandrills, which has 4 power naturally and is not randomly weakened by a Bojuka Bog. For now, Scavenger is the epitome of almost.\n\nVessel of Nascency is the last card I want to look at in depth. It will almost certainly find a home in Tortured Existence decks running green, but I want to discuss its applications in Hexproof. Some versions of the deck have taken to running Commune with the Gods as a way to dig for bodies or Auras. Vessel can do that while also hanging around to make Ethereal Armor or Ancestral Mask better. It can also be activated an instant speed, so whatever is drawn can be used on the next attack. To me, this is a pretty significant upgrade for the deck.\n\nHere are a few other cards that caught my eye:\n\nVessel of Ephemera — It’s another token-producer, but it’s probably too expensive\n\nShamble Back — There are enough abilities on this card that it might be good, but I am not sure it is better than Vile Rebirth or Beckon Apparition.\n\nVessel of Malignity — This is a card I would not mind in the Mono-Black Control mirror, as it can help boost devotion while acting like a Wrench Mind. As a bonus, its victims cannot be used to feed Gurmag Angler.\n\nBloodmad Vampire — If an aggressive red madness deck exists, this will be a key part. Senseless Rage might fit there as well.\n\nPyre Hound — A slower Kiln Fiend with natural evasion, this could see play in the Kiln Fiend decks that take a more controlling route as another finisher.\n\nStoic Builder — Cartographer is back, and now it can block Chittering Rats.\n\nWarped Landscape — Unless I am running a wedge deck, I am almost always going to pick a Panorama over this new land. The only reason I would consider this over that cycle is if I desperately needed to run Wastes for access to colorless mana.\n\nThere are over two dozen commons worthy of discussion. Shadows over Innistrad has certainly given Pauper some interesting options, and I cannot wait to see which ones make the cut. My top five Pauper cards for the set are:\n\nJust the Wind Vessel of Nascency Murderous Compulsion Sanitarium Skeleton Dual Shot\n\nWhat are yours?",
  "latent_25586": "The next few weeks will go a long way into shaping not just the next Columbus Blue Jackets team but what fans will see down the road as well.\n\nOne player will leave via the expansion draft. Others will join the organization after being picked in the amateur draft. Surely a player or two will be inked in free agency once that begins shortly thereafter, and you never know when a trade will happen as well.\n\nSo where might the Columbus Blue Jackets look to be adding (or facing subtraction) over the next few weeks of rapid roster realignment? To answer that question, we decided to look at the players under team control – as well as those drafted and whose rights are retained by the team – for answers.\n\nThink of it as an organizational depth chart with an eye on the future.\n\nCENTERMEN\n\nNAME 2016-17 Alexander Wennberg (RFA) NHL Brandon Dubinsky NHL William Karlsson NHL Lukas Sedlak NHL Pierre-Luc Dubois CHL Kevin Stenlund Sweden Jordan Maletta AHL Zac Dalpe AHL Sam Vigneault NCAA/AHL Dante Salituro CHL/AHL/ECHL Alex Broadhurst (RFA) AHL\n\nOne of the big priorities of the offseason for the Blue Jackets will be signing Wennberg to a long-term deal, which seems all but assured of happening. That will leave the centers at the NHL level relatively stable as the top two are largely written in ink. From there, there are some question marks. Karlsson could be a target of Vegas during the expansion draft, though last year's emergence of Sedlak gives the Jackets another solid option for the bottom two lines. And Boone Jenner has played both center and wing during his career and could always be an option.\n\nFrom there, the next question to answer: What of Dubois? The first-round pick last year got off to a slow start in the QMJHL, was traded at midseason and was strong at the end while leading his team to the league final. He has played both wing and center in the junior ranks, but the thought was this year was to develop his game in the middle; of course, transitioning to the NHL might require a start on the wing as he gets used to the speed and intricacies of the game.\n\nAfter that, Dalpe is a veteran who helped the Cleveland Monsters quite a bit this year and could fill a bottom-six role in a pinch. Everything past that is young depth and expected to continue to develop over the next few years. This is a spot you could see the Jackets trying to bolster going forward, especially as team brass speaks of adding firepower up front.\n\nWINGERS\n\nLEFT WING 2016-17 RIGHT WING 2016-17 Nick Foligno NHL Cam Atkinson NHL Boone Jenner NHL Brandon Saad NHL Josh Anderson (RFA) NHL Oliver Bjorkstrand NHL Scott Hartnell NHL Matt Calvert NHL Sonny Milano AHL/NHL Vitaly Abramov CHL/AHL Markus Hannikainen AHL/NHL Keegan Kolesar CHL Paul Bittner AHL Nick Moutrey AHL Calvin Thurkauf CHL Justin Scott AHL Kole Sherwood CHL David Clarkson N/A Tyler Bird (unsigned) NCAA\n\nObviously, Columbus has a solid group at the NHL level, though what we just said about adding firepower up front remains a point here as well. The team's ability to go four lines deep was pretty strong this year, and such players as Foligno, Atkinson and Saad were dependable goal scorers while Bjorkstrand showed off his sniping skills as the year went on. Anderson also showed he has the speed and goal-scoring skills to go with his good size to make him into an intriguing NHL player, and Jenner was still a solid player despite a downturn in scoring. And of course, Calvert was Calvert.\n\nBeyond that, there are questions to be answered. Hartnell appears likely to be on his way out the door given his nearly $5 million cap hit and declining production at age 35. On the other side of that, Milano poses an interesting question; he's coming off a year in which he led AHL Cleveland in points at age 20, but the chorus of those who wonder if the skilled winger truly has what it takes to play a full game at the NHL level seems to be getting louder.\n\nHannikainen is a solid fill-in at the NHL level when need be, and beyond that, many of the top young prospects on the team are wingers. Kolesar, Abramov, Sherwood and Thurkauf each had excellent years when it came to putting the puck in the net at the CHL level, and you have to think one or two of those guys will have the ability to be legitimate NHL threats at some point; from here, it's a matter of development. But you have to feel pretty good about that combination of players.\n\nColumbus doesn't so much need to restock the cabinet here as it does cement the roster at the NHL level. Again, the stated goal to add firepower could remake the Blue Jackets' forward lines, while it remains a possibility someone like Anderson or Calvert could be on the way out the door to Vegas. What Columbus does up front is the biggest question facing the team this offseason.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nDEFEnse 2016-17 defense 2016-17 Zach Werenski NHL Seth Jones NHL Jack Johnson NHL David Savard NHL Ryan Murray NHL Markus Nutivaara NHL Gabriel Carlsson Sweden/NHL Scott Harrington NHL Dean Kukan AHL Vladislav Gavrikov KHL Ryan Collins NCAA/AHL Blake Siebenaler AHL John Ramage AHL Jacob Graves AHL Oleg Yevenko (RFA) AHL Andrew Peeke (unsigned) NCAA Veeti Vainio (unsigned) Finland\n\nAbout 20 months ago, the team's defense was thought to be the real weak link on the squad as the Blue Jackets pretty much wasted the 2015-16 campaign.\n\nFast-forward less than two years and you have to love what you see here. The development of Werenski and Nutivaara combined with the acquisition of Seth Jones immediately remade the defense at the NHL level and was one of the big reasons Columbus put together the best campaign in franchise history. Add in the dependable David Savard and Jack Johnson duo and the young and talented Ryan Murray and you had one of the steadier and more versatile blue lines in the NHL.\n\nThere's also things to like in the depth. Carlsson jumped over from Sweden at the end of his season and was so impressive to the coaching staff he jumped right into the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Gavrikov is so impressive you get the sense team brass believes he's NHL ready right now, though whether he'll come to America this year remains to be seen.\n\nHarrington proved to be a steady bottom pair or seventh D, as well, so the NHL crew next year seems pretty set unless Johnson disappears in the expansion draft. There is also depth and some young players to like, including some recent draft picks. The Jackets will likely look to add here in the draft just to keep the pipeline flowing, but this seems like a pretty strong spot for Columbus going forward.\n\nGOALTENDERS\n\nname 2016-17 Sergei Bobrovsky NHL Joonas Korpisalo NHL/AHL Anton Forsberg (RFA) AHL/NHL Oscar Dansk (RFA) Sweden Elvis Merzlikins (unsigned) Switzerland Matiss Kivlenieks USHL Peter Thome (unsigned) USHL\n\nI've said it before and will say it again – this is kind of a precarious spot for Columbus.\n\nAt the top, things are obviously good with Sergei Bobrovsky, who is T-minus one week away from adding a second Vezina Trophy to his cabinet. You do have to worry about his health, though, as injuries have been a part of his story, and there are questions after that as well.\n\nKorpisalo looked like an NHL starter two years ago and a fringe NHL backup last year, but he recently re-signed and looks ticketed to be the team's No. 2 this year barring expansion draft shenanigans out of Vegas. Forsberg is thought by some to be more consistent of the two young goalies, but his NHL trials have been disasters thus far. After that, there's no one with NHL experience, though the offseason signing of Kivlenieks is expected to fortify things going forward. Dansk's future is murky at best, though Merzlikins also appears to be a big talent in the pipeline and is a potential starter after a few more years of development in Europe.\n\nIt's hard to think the Jackets will do anything here this offseason other than maybe draft a project, but this is an interesting spot to watch going forward.",

  "latent_25938": "The most direct (and arguably only) way to reduce metro area traffic is by charging a price for congestion. Drivers may not initially like it—although surveys show they come around—but they do immediately respond to it. Jonas Eliasson illustrated that point during a TED-x talk on the Stockholm pricing program he co-designed: on the left is a rush-hour traffic jam the day before its implementation; on the right are empty roads the day it took effect:\n\nThe reverse scenario is also true, as a new study of Milan’s road pricing program reveals. In late July 2012, an Italian court called an abrupt and unexpected halt to the city’s congestion cordon, known as Area C, which cost 5 euros to enter from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. The ruling caught people by surprise, since similar lawsuits had failed, so when the charge was suspended the next day you might have expected a lag before drivers rushed back to the rush-hour roads.\n\nLag, denied. In the Journal of Urban Economics, Matthew Gibson of Williams College and Maria Carnovale of Duke chart Area C traffic by date and found “the full magnitude of driver responses emerges immediately.” Take a look for yourself below: the segment on the left shows traffic before the ruling, and the one in the center shows traffic after the ruling. It’s as if drivers have a sixth sense for highway space—an effect transport scholars call “induced demand.”\n\nAnd don’t bother wondering whether the shift just reflects a seasonal change in driving habits. Gibson and Carnovale looked at traffic patterns from prior years, when an earlier pricing scheme was in effect. The summer months look the same as all the others—drivers stay away from the priced zone:\n\nBy analyzing the accidental social experiment, Gibson and Carnovale offer some key insights on the benefits of the Milan pricing program:\n\nTraffic . The pricing scheme results in 27,000 fewer cars entering Area C per day—a 14.5 percent decline in traffic. That includes cars exempted from the charge; the decline in those subject to it is even greater, at 19 percent. The researchers find that most drivers respond to the charge by traveling at different times or taking different routes, as expected.\n\n.

Milan’s program reduced air pollution (as measured by carbon emissions and PM10 particulate matter) from 6 to 17 percent. That’s a huge figure when you consider that Area C is just 5 percent of metro Milan—and that the city already has a pretty clean vehicle fleet, owing to a previous congestion fee that exempted cleaner cars. The researchers estimate the value of that environmental benefit at $3 billion a year.\n\n.

Commuter routes adjacent to public transportation saw smaller traffic changes than those without similar access. In other words, many of the people who took public transit to work continued to do so even once the cordon price was suspended. This finding suggests that people are more than happy shifting out of cars if they can find homes with good transit access to work.\n\nThe pricing program was reinstated on September 17, and as another recent study shows, Milan experienced plenty of benefits for the whole of 2012 despite the eight-week halt. Paolo Beria of the Polytechnic University of Milan reports that traffic was down 31 percent on the year before, particulate matter was down 18 percent, and carbon emissions fell 35 percent. The program generated 13 million euros for the year—money reinvested in public transit and bike-share.",

  "latent_26193": "In many ways, 2013 was the year of the spectacular network outage.\n\nThe inability to keep gamers connected online hampered everything from the launch of major video games like SimCity, GTA Online and Battlefield 4, to console services like the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live and, just this week, Nintendo's online network.\n\nServer issues were even among the problems that thwarted a successful rollout of HealthCare.gov.\n\nAs Electronic Arts' recently promoted CEO, Andrew Wilson, told Polygon in a November interview, all of mankind is transitioning to a digital world, and that transition brings with it some major issues.\n\n\"As all of mankind right now transitions to a digital-type world and a digital-type experience, and you think about the scale and the load that comes from all of mankind transitioning and getting access to information through digital channels, I think what we learned from SimCity was you need a very robust test system — it's very different to the one we used before,\" Wilson told Polygon. \"You need a very robust launch system — very different from anything we've ever had before. You need a very robust follow-up process that ensures that you can remedy issues very, very quickly, and certainly that was on a much more escalated level than we've ever had before.\"\n\nIn many ways, 2013 was the year of the spectacular network outage\n\nAs online games continued to crash at launch, and networks stumbled, the more interesting news of the year started to be more about which major online games didn't falter on day one. Somehow, at the top of that list was one of the year's most purchased games: Call of Duty: Ghosts.\n\nDespite the huge numbers and heavy reliance on quick, seamless online play, Activision seems to have a history of shipping Call of Duty titles without the same level of online bumps that other similar games face.\n\nIt turns out, that's largely due to two things: an acquisition Activision made more than six years ago as online console games began to come into their own, and the near-complete failure of the Call of Duty franchise's first step toward gaming ubiquity.\n\nDemonWare\n\nIn 2007, Activision purchased a small Dublin-based middleware company that specialized in the emerging art of getting both console and PC games online. At the time, Activision's then-CEO, Mike Griffith, said that the company expected online gaming to grow significantly in the next two to four years and that DemonWare would be the group that would help them \"eliminate many of the challenges associated with online multiplayer game development.\"\n\nThe idea was that DemonWare would work with Activision's in-house engineers, the same sort of teams most other developers and publishers have, to help smooth out online launches.\n\nDemonWare started off as an independent company in 2003.\n\n\"In 2005, when we were still a pretty small group of people, 12 to 14,\" John Kirk, chief technology officer at DemonWare, told Polygon in a recent interview, \"I moved to Vancouver, Canada, to set up a presence. Most of our customers were up and down the West Coast and it was much easier to support them on their own time zones.\"\n\nAt the time, DemonWare had already helped with a slew of games including Call of Duty 2: Big Red One and Call of Duty 3 and a variety of titles from Namco, Sega, THQ and Ubisoft. Once the purchase went through, DemonWare finished out their existing contracts and began refocusing their efforts entirely on Activision games.\n\nPat Griffith, Activision's vice president of online technology, said that they began working with the company initially to support matchmaking and storage systems needs on the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3. But it was their work on Call of Duty: Big Red One and Call of Duty 3 that won the publisher over.\n\n\"DemonWare's level of collaboration with Treyarch on Call of Duty: Big Red One and Call of Duty 3 surpassed anything we'd ever seen before,\" Griffith said. \"We found the crew at DemonWare to be highly capable. DemonWare quickly demonstrated an exceptional level of knowledge and experience with our game engine and practices in addition to their domain-specific expertise.\"\n\nIn absorbing the company, Griffith said Activision hoped that DemonWare could help improve Activision's online gaming for all platforms.\n\nWhile that acquisition may have been the most important purchase the company made in a history fueled by pop-culture-defining games and billion-dollar franchises, it certainly must not have looked that way to everyone involved just months after the deal was announced.\n\nModern Warfare's Perfect Storm of Failure\n\nMuch of what DemonWare learned, much of why Call of Duty games tend to have smooth online launches, came from one disastrous online launch: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.\n\n\"The launch of Modern Warfare came at a point where there was a lot more adoption of broadband internet connections,\" Griffith said. \"We had, and the industry as a whole probably had, some issues across the board.\"\n\nModern Warfare became, as Griffith put it, a victim of its own success.\n\n\"We became more successful than we had prepared for,\" he said. \"That's not just in the online world. Our sales of Modern Warfare were above our expectations.\"\n\nThe PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game sold about 2 million copies by December 2007. By January 2008, 7 million copies were sold worldwide. By May, Activision had sold 13 million copies of the game.\n\nBut the publisher, the developers and DemonWare weren't prepared for those kind of sales, and the online projections they use to figure out what level of server support they need is based on game sales projections. To make matters worse, everyone seemed to have underestimated how widely adopted broadband internet would be by mid-2008.\n\n\"After the Christmas of that launch we had a very rough time\"\n\n\"Not only were more people buying Modern Warfare than we expected, but more people were connected that were buying Modern Warfare than we expected,\" Griffith said. \"After the Christmas of that launch we had a very rough time.\"\n\nThings were breaking faster than DemonWare could fix them, and often, downed systems would have a domino effect on other parts of the game.\n\nBut out of that trial by fire came a number of DemonWare and Activision's core tenets.\n\n\"Many of our lessons about measuring and everything else, they come from that,\" Griffith said. \"It provided a foundation that we build on.\n\n\"I think that the nascence of our philosophy begins in that Modern Warfare game and what happened in that title.\"\n\nLessons Learned\n\nDemonWare has several key rules about how to make an online game that stays online, but the most important, it seems, is communication.\n\nInstead of just sitting on the sidelines while a title is being developed, DemonWare's team of more than 150 people stays in close communication with game developers, and helps shape how a game will launch and what online features it will include.\n\n\"Before a title is greenlit by Activision we get involved,\" DemonWare's Kirk said. \"What are their online plans? Are they feasible? Are they being overly ambitious for the technology and the size of the title, etc. And that all just rolls in, keeps rolling on through development.\"\n\nOver the years, DemonWare has compiled a set of online tools and services like stat tracking or leaderboard services that any Activision game can tap into, and the engineers at the company make sure to use them across games whenever possible.\n\nSometimes they take those tools and customize them. And finally, if neither of those approaches work, they set about designing new online tools.\n\nAll of this comes through weekly, daily, even \"minutely\" calls and in-person meetings, Kirk said.\n\nTheir key goal is to make sure that whatever the game includes won't break the online experience.\n\nOnce the services are integrated, DemonWare launches into testing, trying to do whatever it can to break what it just helped create.\n\nAnother core lesson DemonWare learned from the Modern Warfare launch was to make sure that when something breaks, it doesn't take anything else down with it. Instead, DemonWare has the ability to turn off many online features on the fly.\n\n\"One of the things that can happen in any online system is if one bit of the system goes down it can take the whole system down,\" Griffith said. \"I don't think it's magic, I don't think it's anything that nobody knows, it's just very hard to try and decouple and almost isolate a group of systems so that one will not have a knock-on effect on others.\"\n\nTake Ghosts, for instance, Kirk said.\n\n\"Only a small subset of those are required to play a game,\" he said. \"If player counts or the service that creates the global heatmap, if those systems are down, they're down but they're not affecting gameplay. People can still get their profiles, matchmake and join a game. That's what we focus on, making sure those core systems get a lot more attention and a lot more love then the ancillary systems.\"\n\nA case study Here’s what typically happens when you launch into an online game of Call of Duty, according to DemonWare's John Kirk. As you boot up the game on the PlayStation 3, for example, Activision does a console authentication for your identity against Sony to allow you to seamlessly log into their systems. Once logged in, the game hits DemonWare's storage system to pull down your profile, loadouts and such. \"You're probably going to want to see if your friends are online, so you go and you hit that up and see what the presence of your friends are.\" Next the game pulls down the message of the day and, depending on what you do next, it accesses different systems like the heatmap or the leaderboards or matchmaking. \"All of those are back-end services that we create,\" Kirk said. \"There is a lot of them right now as we've built them up over the years so everything from matchmaking, to leaderboards to user profiles to the recording of matches that we had, the theater mode we had on the Black Ops titles.\"\n\nNot every online bell and whistle that a developer might want to add will always go into an online game. DemonWare can, if needed, cut online features, Kirk said.\n\nThat cooperative decision is based almost entirely on what sort of impact the engineers think the feature will have on online stability.\n\n\"We have a lot of smart people who will basically boil the feature down,\" Kirk said. \"We look at what data needs to be stored. We look at how often it needs to be accessed and how frequently it's going to be used. And then depending on what kind of back-end system we select, is there a database we can scale? Is it actually a tractable problem or are there things in here which are just going to cause us problems down the line?\"\n\nIf it's an easy, scalable feature to solve for, then it more than likely goes in. If not, then they set to work solving the problem.\n\n\"Then we start to worry a little bit and maybe start to help the studio to redesign things,\" Kirk said. \"We work together to throw out some different ideas about how we can make it safer and more likely to succeed when the title actually launches.\"\n\nAnd it's those problems that the engineers — the technologists, as Kirk calls them — live for.\n\n\"We don't just want to spend the rest of our lives doing matchmaking,\" he said. \"Whatever those new features may be, be they dedicated servers or branching out into data warehousing or things like that, then we're always up for the challenge.\"\n\nCutting a feature, while possible, is very rare, Kirk said.\n\n\"We sit down with studios and there's lots of whiteboards and they'll basically spell out the idea,\" Kirk said of the process used to avoid feature cuts. \"If we look back at the past Black Ops titles, the idea of recording every single game that was played seemed like absolute craziness to us. But we work it through and we work out systems that allow it to happen. One way or another it generally happens, maybe not in the way it was initially conceived by the studio, but a lot of time those things will move forward.\"\n\nEssentially, when creating a game with an online component, DemonWare and the Activision developers treat bandwidth like any other resource.\n\n\"There are CPU budgets for rendering and for AI and for sound and so we're careful how we apportion that out too,\" Kirk said.\n\nGriffith calls the process \"nudging\" rather than pure editorial cutting.\n\n\"With that collaboration there are a lot of times where something may be a little bit dangerous or using too much of a connection or have the potential to run out of control if it's heavily used or abused, possibly by a player or the software developers themselves,\" he said. \"The game clients can be written in a way where they may do things that can cause runaway failure.\n\n\"Keeping the game running is of the utmost importance, so we may make determinations about how we use that very valuable connection to the consumer's console in his home. Which may mean we may not 100 percent do every pie-in-the-sky thing that we want to do because we may want that traffic, that bandwidth reserved for that core game feature. Doing something totally ludicrous that would totally bite into that connection we would probably rule it out.\"\n\nBut that big, ludicrous, game-breaking idea has yet to happen, Griffith said. The team has always found a solution.\n\nMore service than game\n\nIn many ways, perhaps more than most games, Call of Duty seems to be becoming more of a service than a series of standalone titles. It is, to many, like television, a form of entertainment that you expect to always work and always be ready to entertain you.\n\nActivision and DemonWare don't have to support just a single Call of Duty game either. Currently five of the top 20 Xbox Live titles are Call of Duty games; that's tens of millions of players beating on DemonWare's technology at the same time, said Daniel Suarez, vice president of production on Call of Duty.\n\n\"It is for us more than just a game, it impacts pop culture,\" Suarez said. \"People see this as an outlet to relax, to socialize. So for us it is more than that. To us, it is our business, it is our livelihood and we owe that to our fans. We owe that it be up and running and delivering at the highest possible level of operation and that's what these guys do. That's what our developers do. That's what Infinity Ward does. It's what Treyarch does.\n\n\"It's not launching the game; it's a live operation 24/7 and we're constantly doing updates on these titles to make that experience better. That's what it's all about for us.\"\n\nGriffith sees it as both a game and a service. There is at Call of Duty's core the twitch gameplay and adrenaline of running and gunning, but if you can't get into the game, if you can't start the game online, then none of that matters.\n\n\"If you can't talk about, share about or see what's going on with the rudimentary game, the other stuff is superfluous,\" he said.\n\nThat so many companies seem to have problems getting players online and keeping them there, is more about Activision and DemonWare's past failures than anything else. Call of Duty failed spectacularly first, so these future iterations are now more stable. That other games, like Battlefield 4, are now going through their trial by fire, is more about timing than anything else.\n\n\"I think there is probably a lot of experiences that they're going to gain,\" Griffith said. \"Our online games have been maturing with the online community and expanding with the online community. So we've learned some hard lessons. Other people are learning some hard lessons now. We don't want to repeat mistakes, we want to make new mistakes, I guess. But we try really hard not to make new mistakes either. Every lesson we've learned is baked into everything DemonWare does and everything DemonWare does to collaborate with the game teams. I think that there are growing pains for everyone, it's hard to jump into the deep end of any pool. We do see things we would have done differently but they came at the cost of experience.\"\n\nAnd Suarez points out that Activision and DemonWare are still learning.\n\n\"We still make mistakes,\" he said. \"There are still things that break. It may not be as transparent to the end user, but those things happen. We consider ourselves fortunate that we're doing the planning and have the right people to do that, but we are far from perfect and far from mastering this. We're still learning as these new platforms come out. It's all constantly changing as we go.\"\n\nA sense of dread\n\nFor DemonWare, the sense of dread that comes with the launch of an online game never really goes away, it just subsides a little.\n\n\"No matter how much preparation that we do there is always a nervousness and a tension around launch day,\" DemonWare's Kirk said. \"Even though we test as much as we can, different behaviors will just emerge when real people start playing the game. We just have to be ready to react for that. We have solutions for a lot of the common problems, thankfully, because we employ [situational monitoring] systems on the backend. We know we can scale things up pretty easily. If we need a new database or more read capacity or more write capacity, we know how to do it and it's a well-practiced drill.\"\n\nThose launch day jitters make way for DLC launch concerns and then worries about the initial flurry of title updates. Throughout it all, DemonWare engineers are watching graphs and charting behavior 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Eventually, those once-new patterns start to normalize and the folks behind the endless sessions of online Call of Duty can relax, if just for awhile, until the next Call of Duty hits.\n\nAll of that nervousness and effort is driven by the knowledge that gamers expect their online games to be as reliable as buying something on Amazon or watching a movie on Netflix, Suarez said.\n\n\"I think the Call of Duty consumer, when they put the game in and have an hour of time to play, they want to have a great time,\" he said. \"That's what we offer our customers back and that's what we work so hard on. We know at the end of the day that's what they expect. We make that investment in infrastructure because it's critical to our business.\"\n\nAnd investing early on in DemonWare, Griffith said, is a crucial piece of how Activision is able to launch games online with less hiccups.\n\n\"I believe that DemonWare is crucial to the success of our online games for all of the reasons mentioned previously,\" he said. \"They give us a stable platform on which to build. They provide us with valuable data about how our games are played. And their collaboration with the game development studios like Infinity Ward and Treyarch has allowed our game teams to focus on making great games.\"",

Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee for president of the United States, is the highest-profile figure associated with the \"birther\" movement: people who believe that Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States. [ Vox / Andrew Prokop ]\n\n] Trump's embrace of birtherism is the reason he is the GOP's nominee today. Not only did it make him a national political figure, but the mockery it incurred from DC elites motivated him to launch his 2016 bid. [ NYT / Maggie Haberman and Alexander Burns ]\n\n] Birtherism is racist. Racity-race-racist. It is part of a long American tradition of changing the rules of the game once black people show up to it. [ The Blanks Slate ]\n\n] Nor was this the only racially inflected conspiracy theory Trump engaged in (even after Obama presented his birth certificate to the public): He's also fed speculation that Obama was a poor student and an affirmative-action beneficiary. [ NBC News / Benjy Sarlin ]\n\n] Apparently, in the last couple of weeks, someone in the Trump campaign has finally realized that this is a real sticking point with African-American voters. [ Joshua Green via Twitter ]\n\n] So on Friday, after hours of hype, Donald Trump made a statement saying that he believes Obama was born in the US. Only that statement was about three sentences. And the event was more of a commercial for Trump's new hotel. And, oh yeah, he was introduced by a birther. [ Vox / Jeff Stein ]\n\n] (Trump has also taken to blaming Hillary Clinton for starting the birther conspiracy theory, which is, you will be shocked to learn, a lie.) [ Washington Post / David Weigel ]\n\n] Trump played the media like a fiddle. And a lot of journalists are pissed about it. This New York Times \"news analysis\" is as blunt a take as you can imagine from a staid newspaper. [ NYT / Michael Barbaro ]\n\n] The question is whether, going forward, the media will get more skeptical of Trump when he tries to sucker them into covering his every move, or whether they'll keep letting him let them down.

[ Vox / Zack Beauchamp ]\n\n] The government filed the civil suit against Deutsche Bank, arguing that it sold mortgage-backed loan packages without warning investors how risky they were. [ Reuters / Arno Schuetze ]\n\n] Banks (including Deutsche Bank, in an earlier case) have already paid some $110 billion in settlements of this sort (some of which has ended up funding projects like state fairs). [ WSJ / Christina Rexrode and Emily Glazer ]\n\n] Deutsche Bank is planning to negotiate a smaller settlement with the government. And they hope they'll succeed, because they don't have anywhere near $14 billion on hand. [ WSJ / Jenny Strasburg ]\n\n] In fact, Deutsche Bank has less available cash than any other major global bank — financial journalist Simon Jack called it \"the most dangerous bank in the world\" this summer, because of its lack of ability to absorb a serious hit. [ BBC / Simon Jack ]\n\n] Unsurprisingly, the idea of Deutsche Bank being forced to pay anywhere near $14 billion freaked out the rest of the European banking industry, and the continent's stock market with it. [ Bloomberg / Roxana Zega ]\n\n] That sort of effect would be totally worth it if the settlement accomplished its intended goal: deterring banks from doing risky things like this in the future. But there isn't evidence that it actually will. [Vox / Zack Beauchamp]\n\nThat happened fast\n\nThe UN estimates that 1 million South Sudanese are now living as refugees outside the country — putting the world's newest country in the less-than-august company of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia. [Al Jazeera]\n\nMost of the refugees from South Sudan left during the bitter civil war that started in 2013, which theoretically ended in a peace deal earlier this year. But 185,000 have fled since fighting erupted in July in the capital of Juba. [BBC]\n\nThe renewed refugee crisis is causing a crunch in already-strained African refugee camps — especially because Kenya, which is trying to close the 300,000-person refugee camp of Dadaab, may be forcing refugees there to return to their war-torn homes. (Kenya and the UN deny that anyone's being forced out; Human Rights Watch disagrees.) [The Guardian / Patrick Kingsley]\n\n(The millions of dollars that South Sudan's president and former vice president have invested in foreign real estate as the war raged, however, don't appear to be coming back to the country anytime soon.) [WSJ / Matina Stevis]\n\nThe South Sudanese and central African crisis is just one of the things that countries will get to discuss next week during the UN's first refugee summit — and a parallel \"leaders' summit\" at which Barack Obama (whose moral standing on this point is dubious) will try to shame countries into accepting more refugees. [IRIN News / Kristy Siegfried]\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThat time when \"that time when\" became a headline cliché. [ Washington Post / Britt Peterson ]\n\n] There's never really a bad time to remember the moment that George H.W. Bush puked on the Japanese prime minister's lap. [ Slate / Osita Nwanevu ]\n\n] Boise, Idaho, has one of the proportionally largest refugee populations in the United States, and despite coming from a wide variety of countries — Somalia, DR Congo, Zimbabwe, Iraq, and more — refugee high schoolers had come to stick together and form their own community. [ NYT / Sara Mosle ]\n\n] It's easy to be cynical about cease-fires like the recent one in Syria — but political scientists have found that even failed cease-fires can improve prospects for peace. [ NYT / Max Fisher ]\n\n] If you pose moral trolley problems (\"would you throw someone on train tracks to save five others?\") in a foreign language, people are likelier to arrive at the utilitarian conclusion. [The Economist]\n\nVerbatim\n\n\"Emma Livry (right), before her corset melted into her ribs.\" [ Ozy / Fiona Zublin ]\n\n] \"There was something very disturbingly wrong with the kindle version of the book I received.

  "latent_26371": "\"Sidhe\" redirects here. For other uses, see Sidhe (disambiguation)\n\nRiders of the Sidhe (1911), painting by (1911), painting by John Duncan\n\nThe aos sí ( pronounced [eːsˠ ˈʃiː]; older form aes sídhe [eːsˠ ˈʃiːə]) is the Irish term for a supernatural race in Irish mythology and Scottish mythology (where it is usually spelled Sìth, but pronounced the same), comparable to the fairies or elves. They are said to live underground in fairy mounds, across the western sea, or in an invisible world that coexists with the world of humans. This world is described in the Lebor Gabála Érenn as a parallel universe in which the aos sí walk amongst the living. In the Irish language, aos sí means \"people of the mounds\" (the mounds are known in Irish as \"the sídhe\"). In modern Irish the people of the mounds are also called daoine sídhe [ˈdʲiːnʲə ˈʃiːə]; in Scottish mythology they are daoine sìth.[1] They are variously said to be the ancestors, the spirits of nature, or goddesses and gods.[2]\n\nSome secondary and tertiary sources, including well-known and influential authors such as W. B. Yeats, refer to aos sí simply as \"the sídhe\" (lit. \"mounds\").[3]\n\nIn Gaelic folklore [ edit ]\n\nIn many Gaelic tales, the aos sí are later, literary versions of the Tuatha Dé Danann (\"People of the Goddess Danu\")—the deities and deified ancestors of Irish mythology. Some sources describe them as the survivors of the Tuatha Dé Danann who retreated into the Otherworld—the mortal Sons of Míl Espáine who, like many other early invaders of Ireland, came from Iberia. As part of the terms of their surrender to the Milesians, the Tuatha Dé Danann agreed to retreat and dwell underground. (In later interpretations, each tribe of the Tuatha Dé Danann was given its own mound.) Geoffrey Keating, an Irish historian of the late 17th century, equates Iberia with the Land of the Dead, providing a possible connection to the aos sí.\n\nIn folk belief and practice, the aos sí are often appeased with offerings, and care is taken to avoid angering or insulting them. Often they are not named directly, but rather spoken of as \"The Good Neighbors\", \"The Fair Folk\", or simply \"The Folk\". The most common names for them, aos sí, aes sídhe, daoine sídhe (singular duine sídhe) and daoine sìth mean, literally, \"people of the mounds\" (referring to the sídhe). The aos sí are generally described as stunningly beautiful, though they can also be terrible and hideous.\n\nAos sí are seen as fierce guardians of their abodes—whether a fairy hill, a fairy ring, a special tree (often a hawthorn) or a particular loch or wood. It is believed that infringing on these spaces will cause the aos sí to retaliate in an effort to remove the people or objects that invaded their homes. Many of these tales contribute to the changeling myth in west European folklore, with the aos sí kidnapping trespassers or replacing their children with changelings as a punishment for transgressing. The aos sí are often connected to certain times of year and hours; as the Gaelic Otherworld is believed to come closer to the mortal world at the times of dusk and dawn, the aos sí correspondingly become easier to encounter. Some festivals such as Samhain, Beltane and Midsummer are also associated with the aos sí.\n\nThe sídhe [ edit ]\n\nSídhe are the hills or tumuli that dot the Irish landscape. In modern Irish the word is sí; in Scottish Gaelic, sìth; in Old Irish síde and the singular is síd.[4] In a number of later, English-language texts, the word sídhe is incorrectly used both for the mounds and the people of the mounds. However sidh in older texts refers specifically to \"the palaces, courts, halls or residences\" of the otherworldly beings that supposedly inhabit them.[5] The fact that many of these sídhe have been found to be ancient burial mounds has contributed to the theory that the aos sí were the pre-Celtic occupants of Ireland.\n\nOthers present these stories as mythology deriving from Greek cultural influence, deriving arguments mainly from Hesiod's Works and Days, which portrays the basic moral foundation and plantation techniques of the citizens of Greece and describes the races of men, created by the Greek deities. However, many of these views have been deemed unlikely, and the influence can be explained by the similar moral foundations stemming from the two cultures' Indo-European background.\n\nTypes [ edit ]\n\nThe banshee or bean sídhe (from Old Irish: ban síde), which means \"woman of the sídhe\",[6] has come to indicate any supernatural woman of Ireland who announces a coming death by wailing and keening. Her counterpart in Scottish mythology is the bean sìth (sometimes spelled bean-sìdh). Other varieties of aos sí and daoine sìth include the Scottish bean nighe: the washerwoman who is seen washing the bloody clothing or armour of the person who is doomed to die; the leanan sídhe: the \"fairy lover\"; the cat sìth: a fairy cat; and the Cù Sìth: fairy dog.\n\nThe sluagh sídhe—\"the fairy host\"—is sometimes depicted in Irish and Scottish lore as a crowd of airborne spirits, perhaps the cursed, evil or restless dead. The siabhra (anglicised as \"sheevra\"), may be a type of these lesser spirits, prone to evil and mischief.[7][8] However, an Ulster folk song also uses \"sheevra\" simply to mean \"spirit\" or \"fairy\".[9]\n\nList [ edit ]\n\nCreideamh Sí [ edit ]\n\nCreideamh Sí is Irish for the \"Fairy Faith\", a collection of beliefs and practices observed by those who wish to keep good relationships with the aos sí and avoid angering them.[2] The custom of offering milk and traditional foods—such as baked goods, apples or berries—to the aos sí have survived through the Christian era into the present day in parts of Ireland, Scotland and the diaspora.[2] Those who maintain some degree of belief in the aos sí also are aware to leave their sacred places alone and protect them from damage through road or housing construction.[2][10]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nPrimary sources [ edit ]\n\nSecondary sources [ edit ]\n\nTertiary Sources [ edit ]",
  "latent_26386": "This November, the FBI released its annual report of hate crimes for 2016, showing that in Trump’s America, Muslims experience a greater risk of violence.\n\nThe FBI defines hate crimes as “a traditional offense like murder, arson or vandalism with an added element of bias.” Overall, the FBI data show that the rates of reported hate crimes in the US have gone up slightly. But other evidence suggests that the actual number of hate crime incidents is likely even higher.\n\nAs a researcher who has studied the white nationalist movement for over a decade, I’m not surprised to see that hate crimes are up. But there’s still far too much we don’t know about hate crimes in the US — and that affects how we study and enforce these crimes.\n\nIncreased Rates\n\nSo what do the new FBI crime stats tell us? Rates of reported hate crimes based on sexual orientation have remained fairly stable, while rates of race-based crimes have gone up slightly.\n\nThe most significant increases in reported hate crimes targeted individuals based on their religion. Religiously biased hate crimes increased by almost 20 percent since 2012.\n\nSince 2013, there has been more than a 10 percent increase in anti-Jewish hate crimes, and the rates of reported hate crimes against Muslims has more than doubled.\n\nOther studies point to an increasingly hostile climate for religious and racial minorities. The Anti-Defamation League’s annual Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents found a significant spike in anti-Jewish incidents in 2016, a 34 percent increase since 2015. Almost a third of all incidents occurred in November and December. The audit found an 86 percent surge in anti-Jewish incidents in the first quarter of 2017.\n\nSimilarly, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and ProPublica documented 1,372 incidents of bias in the first three months after the presidential election.\n\nWhat’s Behind the Data\n\nA variety of white supremacist groups saw a membership and readership surge during the 12 months preceding the election, with a significant number of white nationalists linking themselves to the Trump campaign on social media. It’s not possible to link a rise in hate crimes directly to any particular candidate or policy issue, but the rise in white supremacist activity during the presidential campaign indicated that hate crimes would also likely go up after the election.\n\nWhite supremacist activity online is often associated with offline violence. A Southern Poverty Law Center report traced 100 murders to one white nationalist website alone.\n\nA report published in 2012 by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point found that, since 2001, the US has seen an average of 300 murders per year by members of the far right.\n\nHoles in the Data\n\nHowever, we also need to ask what these statistics fail to tell us.\n\nThe Department of Justice found that between 2004 and 2015, there were closer to 250,000 hate crime incidents per year, far more incidents annually than reported by the FBI data.\n\nUnlike the FBI, the DOJ includes hate crimes that were not reported to police and defines hate crimes based on victim perception, not on what law enforcement agencies determine. According to the DOJ report, only 41 percent of hate crimes are reported. Of those reported, only 10 percent are then confirmed by law enforcement investigators as hate crimes.\n\nWhat’s more, this year’s FBI report states that 15,254 law enforcement agencies out of an estimated 18,000 participated in the Hate Crime Statistics Program. Almost nine out of 10 of these agencies failed to report a single hate crime instance in their jurisdiction.\n\nIn fact, the percentage of agencies reporting no hate crimes has actually gone up slightly since 2012.\n\nThis tells us how much remains unknown about the actual extent of hate crimes in the US. The fact that only 12 percent of law enforcement agencies report any hate crimes shows a need for increased dedication to actually documenting these incidents. Fewer agencies reporting hate crimes may sound on the surface like a good thing — but the evidence from the DOJ report suggests that these agencies are likely just failing to report the hate crimes that do occur.\n\nThe FBI needs to ask why the majority of law enforcement agencies are failing to report hate crime data. Is this an issue of lack of collection, lack of reporting, lack of interest or something else? Even many federal agencies, which are legally required to report hate crimes data to the FBI, fail to do so.\n\nThe Problem With Not Documenting Hate\n\nLack of reporting leads to incomplete data on the extent of the problem of hate crimes. Lack of reporting is also linked to lack of enforcement. The DOJ study found that violent hate crimes reported to police were “nearly three times less likely” to result in an arrest than violent nonhate crimes reported to police. This indicates a much larger problem with enforcement.\n\nGiven what I see as a the lack of federal attention to hate crimes, it is thus important that other entities work to document hate crimes, such as the SPLC/ProPublica project.\n\nAlthough the FBI’s data are likely inconclusive on the actual number of hate crimes, they do point to a troubling trend that hate crimes appear to be on the rise and remain vastly undocumented and unenforced.\n\nWithout accurate federal data on hate crimes, we cannot know if federal and local law enforcement agencies are addressing the needs of all of their constituents. This is crucial, particularly given that the DOJ study shows that law enforcement agencies often fail to adequately prosecute perpetrators of hate crimes.\n\nFailure to record hate crimes leaves us guessing at the causes of the rise in anti-Muslim violence we’ve seen in the past year.",

Samaras’ 176-member conservative-liberal coalition needs to gather 151 votes out of 300 in Parliament for passage.\n\nThe second day of the nationwide strike, which is expected to last for the rest of the week, has seen most of the country brought to a standstill. Hospitals are working with skeleton crews, while media broadcasts and publications were halted until further notice after journalists joined the strikers.\n\nBrussels demands a new draft of budget cuts in order for Greece to qualify for another loan – totaling more than €31 billion ($39.63 billion) – from the ‘Troika,' which consists of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe new bailout was put on hold after Greece failed to reach earlier fiscal commitments. The Greek Parliament remains divided over the issue, with the Democratic Left Party, which comprises one third of the governing coalition refusing to back the measures, pledging to vote ‘present’ instead of ‘no.’\n\nThe measures stipulate a two-year increase in the Greek retirement age to 67, and several tax hikes. The new package also includes provisions making it easier to fire civil servants, which has provoked the ire of public workers amid a current unemployment rate of over 25 per cent.\n\nThe vote represents a crucial test for Samaras’ government, as a ‘yes’ vote would ensure more cash for Athens to pay off its debts later this month, despite the multibillion-euro new debt taken on. A ‘no’ vote could shatter Samaras’ fragile coalition.\n\nA protestor throws a molotov cocktail at riot police during a 48-hour strike by the two major Greek workers unions in central Athens.(Reuters / Stringer)\n\nMore cuts, more protests\n\nAnti-austerity demonstrations in Greece have frequently turned violent, leading to clashes between police and disgruntled youths.\n\nOn Tuesday, crowds numbered as high as 35,000 in Athens as Greeks marched to condemn the government for sparing the nation’s wealthy while saddling the poor with austerity.\n\nEarlier, Samaras said that this round of budget cuts would be the last to affect wages and pensions. However, Panagiotis Sotiris, a lecturer at the University of the Aegean, thinks there's more budgetary pain ahead.\n\n“Every austerity package in the last two and a half years was supposed to be the last one. So it won’t be the last one this time. We are going to see more of this,” Sotiris told RT. “In just two days of discussion, the Parliament is going to pass a huge law. We are very far from democratic procedure. This is a set of measures, which are actually dictated by the Troika.”\n\nThe government also needs to clear another hurdle on Sunday: The passage of the 2013 budget, which will require gaining the support of the Democratic Left.\n\nProtestors gesture in front of a riot police water cannon during a 48-hour strike by the two major Greek workers unions in central Athens.(Reuters / Stringer)\n\n­\n\nA protestor throws a molotov cocktail at riot police during a 48-hour strike by the two major Greek workers unions in central Athens.(Reuters / Stringer)\n\n­\n\nA protestor throws a molotov cocktail at riot police during a 48-hour strike by the two major Greek workers unions in central Athens.(Reuters / John Kolesidis)\n\nA protestor kicks away a gas canister during clashes with riot police during a 48-hour strike by the two major Greek workers unions in central Athens.(Reuters / John Kolesidis)\n\nProtestors gather in front of the parliament in Syntagma square during a 48-hour strike by the two major Greek workers unions in central Athens.(Reuters / John Kolesidis)\n\nProtestors carry flags of Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain as they gather in front of the parliament in Syntagma square during a 48-hour strike by the two major Greek workers unions in central Athens.(Reuters / Yannis Behrakis)",

  "latent_26941": "— After a golf event at a country club in Hunterdon County last summer, a Branchburg Township man claims in a recent lawsuit that he was tricked by club members into eating a brownie laced with marijuana and later became ill. Barry Russo is suing members James Kavanagh, Jr. and Gregg Chaplin for allegedly offering him the brownie on June 1 in the locker room at the Copper Hill Country Club in Raritan Township, according to a complaint filed Dec. 31 in state Superior Court. Also named as defendants in the lawsuit are the country club and James MacDonald, identified in the complaint as the club president at the time of the alleged incident. MacDonald allegedly failed to get medical assistance for Russo, the complaint states. MacDonald, a Raritan Township resident, said today he was unaware of the lawsuit and declined further comment. \"If there’s one filed, I guess we’ll get served eventually and we’ll have to take a look at it,\" MacDonald said in a phone interview. \"I don’t want to comment on anything.\" Chaplin, also a township resident, said by phone today that Russo’s allegations were \"the farthest thing from the truth.\" \"That’s totally untrue. There’s no truth whatsover in that,\" Chaplin said. \"That’s the most bizarre thing I ever heard.\" Kavanagh, a Westampton Township resident, also said by phone that the allegations were false, but declined further comment. \"I’m caught off guard with this,\" he said. A message left with the club’s business office was not returned today. Christian McOmber, the attorney representing Russo, declined to comment. Russo is described in the lawsuit as a \"68 year old diabetic with high blood pressure and a previous history of a lacunar infarct stroke.\" According to the lawsuit, Russo was in the locker room after a golf event at the club when Kavanagh and Chaplin offered him the brownie. Kavanagh and Chaplin insisted the brownies were delicious and that Kavanagh, who baked them, had received \"special culinary training,\" according to the complaint. Russo initially declined, but then \"politely accepted\" and ate a brownie, according to the complaint. Russo didn’t know the brownie was laced with marijuana, the complaint states. The lawsuit alleges that Kavanagh and Chaplin \"were fully aware that brownie was laced with marijuana and intentionally deceived Plaintiff in order to poison him.\" Kavanagh later admitted to Russo that the brownie contained marijuana, according to the complaint. Afterward, Russo felt like he was having another stroke, the complaint states. He began to feel light-headed, anxious and dizzy, according to the lawsuit. He also felt his blood pressure begin to rise, and numbness and tingling in certain parts of his body, according to the lawsuit. Russo told MacDonald about his symptoms and asked him to get medical help, according to the lawsuit. MacDonald agreed to summon medical assistance, but failed to do so, according to the complaint. Instead, MacDonald walked Russo to the front porch of the club to \"intentionally conceal\" the alleged incident from club members and guests, and thus deprived Russo of timely medical care, the complaint states. As Russo was being escorted to the front entrance, he called out to a club member with emergency medical experience, who determined Russo was in serious medical distress and immediately summoned an ambulance, the complaint states. At the hospital, Russo’s urine tested positive for Tetrahydrocannabinol, which is the active chemical in marijuana, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMORE SOMERSET COUNTY NEWS",

Democrats stymie vote on anti-union bill\n\nAn estimated 25,000 teachers and others flooded the Wisconsin Capitol on Thursday as Democratic lawmakers left the state to stymie a vote on the governor's proposal to reduce collective bargaining rights and benefits for public workers.\n\nLabor leaders accused Republican Gov. Scott Walker of using a budget shortfall to bust unions representing teachers and other public workers.\n\nAs Republicans tried to begin Senate business, observers screamed, \"Freedom! Democracy! Unions!\"\n\nMany schools across the state were closed because teachers had called in sick. Walker said he was prepared to call in the National Guard.\n\nWith GOP legislative majorities making approval likely, the 14 Democrats in the state Senate blocked a vote by disappearing. Republicans, who support the bill, have a 19-14 majority, but at least one Democratic senator is needed to hold a vote.\n\n\"This really isn't about the money, and it isn't about a budget fix,\" said Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, who was in Madison to lend support from the national teachers union.\n\n\"All of the public employees unions have offered concessions,\" Van Roekel said. \"This is politically motivated. He's just attacking workers' rights. ... They want to silence the public employees.\"\n\nWalker, who took office last month, urged Democrats to return.\n\n\"Their actions, by leaving the state and hiding from voting, are disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of public employees who showed up to work today and the millions of taxpayers they represent,\" Walker said.\n\nDemocrats didn't say where they went, but the Associated Press reported that Democratic Sen. Jon Erpenbach said by phone that the group had left the state.\n\nIf passed, Walker's plan would bring a dramatic turnabout in labor issues in Wisconsin, which has allowed collective bargaining by public employees since 1959.\n\nHis proposal would raise state employees' share of pension and health costs by an average 8% and block unions from negotiating pay increases above the inflation rate unless voters approved. Unions would have to hold annual elections to remain organized and could no longer compel employees to pay dues. In exchange, workers would be promised no furloughs or layoffs.\n\nRepublican leaders said the moves would save $300 million over the next two years.\n\n\"I think the taxpayers will support this idea,\" said Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nCopyright 2011 The Associated Press.

  "latent_27493": "Dr. Warren Hern, the Colorado doctor who performs later abortions and is under attack by a Congressional subcommittee, published a full-page newspaper ad in the Denver Post recently. In it, he accuses the committee of harassment and reminds them of murders committed by “anti-abortion fanatics,” as he put it. One person who really didn’t like that characterization: Cheryl Sullenger of Operation Rescue, who was once convicted of trying to bomb a clinic.\n\nHern is being “investigated” by the anti-abortion Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, chaired by Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn. The panel is dedicated to finding proof of the entirely fictitious claim that abortion clinics are selling fetal tissue, and they’ve set their sights on Hern. In turn, Hern warned that such targeting could lead to his assassination by an anti-abortion terrorist, as happened to his friend Dr. George Tiller in 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHern’s Denver Post ad is in fact a scalding open letter, addressed to Blackburn. He scolds her for using the word “abortionist” to refer to him, calling it “a vicious, despicable, anti-abortion propaganda term intended to slander the person to whom it is applied.” (That’s true: the term is intended to be disparaging and isn’t used by unbiased organizations or media outlets.) He calls the panel a “callous, delusional witch hunt” and tells Blackburn she is allying herself with what he calls a “terrorist movement:”\n\nYou and your Republican Party are vigorously allied with a violent terrorist movement that threatens the lives of women, their families and healthcare workers. As part of this sham “investigation,” your letter to me and letters to other physicians constitute a program of target identification for anti-abortion assassins. You can deny this, but it is a fact. Your “investigation” is legislative harassment that endangers our lives. The blood of any of us who are assassinated is on your hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s a fact that the FBI classifies some anti-abortion organizations as violent extremist groups. Nonetheless, Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group, reprinted Hern’s Denver Post ad in full because they’re so furious about it. Cheryl Sullenger, the group’s senior policy advisor, wrote in a blog post that the ad is full of “wild conspiracy theories” and called it “crazy talk.” And she’s very excised about calling any anti-abortion activist a “terrorist:”\n\nHern’s warped perception of the work of a peaceful pro-life movement that sacrifices to aid pregnant women and provide loving alternatives to abortion – acts that he considers “terrorism” — reveals how much Hern is deceived by his own fears and prejudices.\n\nThis is all sort of ironic—not necessarily funny, per se, but ironic—given that Sullenger was convicted in 1988 with her husband of plotting to bomb an abortion clinic. Sullenger has said she “regrets” trying to bomb said clinic, but Operation Rescue still engages in the targeted harassment of abortion providers and clinic employees. Operation Rescue head Troy Newman was denied a visa to travel in Australia last year because of governmental fears that his extreme rhetoric could prevent women from accessing healthcare or even stoke violence against providers. And George Tiller was assassinated by a man who claimed to have met with Sullenger, and said she helped him track Tiller’s earlier court dates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s clear that Operation Rescue now plans to try to depict Hern as mentally unstable: Sullenger writes that his ad “provoke[s] troubling questions about his loose tether to reality.” Her show of indignation is really quite something, overall, and serves as a reminder that no matter what terrible things they’ve been convicted of doing and served prison time for, don’t you dare call an anti-abortion activist names. It hurts their feelings.",
  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nSpurs-Heat Preview\n\nBy BRIAN MAHONEY\n\nPosted Jun 11 2014 7:59PM MIAMI (AP) LeBron James has learned an important lesson during his journey from 19-year-old rookie to two-time NBA champion: Never talk back to the coach during a film session. \"Let him make his point, whether he's right or wrong, and you live with it and move on,\" James said. Especially when the coach has as much to show his players as Erik Spoelstra did to James and the Miami Heat on Wednesday. Miami's defense didn't offer much resistance early in Game 3 of the NBA Finals; the San Antonio Spurs played like they were on the court by themselves. San Antonio made 19 of its first 21 shots and shot a finals-record 75.8 percent in the first half of a 111-92 victory. Just like last year, Game 3 was a blowout that left the Heat facing a 2-1 deficit. Miami came back to win the series, so nobody was overreacting to what happened Tuesday, especially since the Spurs themselves don't expect to shoot that way again. But the Heat have things to clean up before Game 4 on Thursday, or they risk going back to San Antonio facing the end of their title reign. \"You're always on edge in the postseason, but I don't want to be concerned at this point,\" James said. \"For us, we have to make the adjustments.\" The Spurs had the same lead last year after a 113-77 victory in Game 3, a start-to-finish beating that was even more thorough than Tuesday's win. So they were taking no satisfaction in their position, and certainly not comparing it. \"I don't think about last year at all at this point,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \"I don't think about last year Game 3, Game 4, at all. This is a different animal and I'm just concerned about the game tomorrow night.\" The bigger concerns belong to the Heat, whose defense was also sliced up by the Spurs in the fourth quarter of Game 1. So Spoelstra gathered his team to look at the painful tape of Tuesday's performance, which featured among its problems: -Chris Bosh getting only four shot attempts after scoring 18 points in Games 1 and 2. -James trying to do too much to rally the Heat and ending up with seven of their 20 turnovers. -Mario Chalmers missing all five shots and falling to 3 for 12 in the finals. \"We did not play a good basketball game,\" Spoelstra said. \"All of us have owned that. It doesn't matter ultimately how many you lose by or what the game is like. You have to learn from it, move on.\" Spoelstra said watching themselves get clobbered on tape was \"painful\" and \"frustrating,\" but necessary. He wouldn't reveal what he told his players, but whatever it was, James wouldn't have argued. That's a lesson he said he learned \"quite a few years ago, when you realize that it wouldn't change anything.\" \"You know, the coach is always right,\" James added. \"It's like a teacher. They're always right, and that's fine. That's fair. They make the rules and we've got to live by them.\" Spoelstra's process suits the Heat, who have won 13 straight postseason games following a loss. They followed last year's Game 3 no-show with a rout of their own to swing the series back in their favor, and are confident they can make corrections before Thursday. But the Spurs, who didn't think they played that well in the first two games, have shown that not even the respected Miami defense can stop them when they execute the way they did Tuesday. \"We finally put a game together for not the full 48, but for as long as we could, where we did exactly what we planned to do and executed in that respect,\" Tim Duncan said, \"and that's what we're going to need again.\" No team has overcome a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals, and a victory Thursday would guarantee the Spurs two chances to win the series on their home floor, starting with Game 5 on Sunday. Dwyane Wade said the Heat aren't thinking that far ahead. \"We're an in-the-moment team,\" he said. \"And right now in the moment is the day after a loss, getting better mentally, physically and then coming into tomorrow and playing the game of basketball here on our home floor and trying to win Game 4. That is all we focus on.\" --- Follow Brian Mahoney on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Briancmahoney\n\nCopyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

It slipped away from the San Antonio Spurs last year, but it would take something special - historic, actually - to stop them now. The Miami Heat would have to make the biggest comeback in NBA Finals history. \"They're the two-time champs, they're a great team, and there is still one more game,\" Spurs guard Tony Parker said. \"We have to win one more game.\" Kawhi Leonard had 20 points and 14 rebounds, and the Spurs routed the Heat again, winning 107-86 on Thursday night to open a commanding 3-1 lead. The Spurs can win their fifth NBA championship with a victory at home in Game 5 on Sunday and avenge their seven-game loss to Miami last year. They have three chances, and the way they're dominating the Heat, they might need just one. \"I'm pleased that they performed as well as they did while we've been in Miami, and that's about as far as it goes,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \"Now we've got to go back home and play as well or better.\" LeBron James had 28 points and eight rebounds, but Dwyane Wade was just 1 of 10 through three quarters and finished with 10 points. \"They smashed us,\" James said. \"Two straight home games got off to awful starts. They came in and were much better than us in these last two games. It's just that simple.\" No team has overcome a 3-1 deficit in the finals, and the way the Heat were outclassed twice on their home floor makes it hard to imagine the two-time champions being the first. \"We put ourselves in a position where it is about making history,\" James added. Parker added 19 points, and Tim Duncan had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Spurs, who shot 57 percent from the field and are hitting 54 percent in the series. The Spurs lost twice in Miami to end last year's finals, their only defeat in the championship round. They won their two games in South Florida this time by a combined 40 points. San Antonio's surprising dominance has Miami on its heels, and unless Miami can figure things out quickly, the Heat's two-year championship reign will come to an abrupt end. If this was the last home game of the season in Miami, it looked and sounded nothing like the ones to end the last two years, which featured confetti falling and trophies raised. This one had the unfamiliar sound of boos late in the first half and a chant of \"Go Spurs Go!\" with under 3 minutes left from the San Antonio fans who remained long after many of Miami's had bolted. A Heat win Sunday would force a Game 6 in Miami Tuesday. The Heat had followed their last 13 postseason losses with a victory, but now at the end of a fourth straight season that has gone the distance, they might be out of gas. Miami seemed to lack the energy - or maybe effort - to defend San Antonio's precision ball movement for the full 24 seconds, and time after time the Spurs ended up with a shot from somebody who didn't have a defender nearby. Not quite as sharp as when they shot a finals-record 75.8 percent in the first half Tuesday night, the Spurs were still plenty good enough to open another huge lead by halftime, and they withstood every attempt Miami made to make a run. \"We were expecting a reaction from them but we were ready for it, so we just did the same thing,\" Spurs forward Boris Diaw said. The Spurs knew their defense had to be better, realizing their once-in-a-lifetime, 19-for-21 start in Tuesday's 111-92 Game 3 victory covered the fact that they allowed Miami to make more than 50 percent in the game. They held Miami to 35 percent in the first half. \"They played great and I can honestly say I don't think any of us were expecting this type of performance,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. San Antonio blew the game open late in the second quarter with seven straight points, capped by Leonard's soaring follow dunk that made it 55-33. James, who battled cramps in Game 1, left the court and briefly returned to the locker room midway through the first quarter Thursday. But he had 10 quick points in the third quarter to bring Miami within 13, but San Antonio pushed it to 81-57 after three and never looked back. Notes: Under Popovich, the Spurs have won 15 of the 18 best-of-seven series in which they led 2-1. ... The Heat hadn't lost back-to-back games in the playoffs since dropping three straight against the Boston Celtics in the 2012 Eastern Conference finals. --- Follow Brian Mahoney on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Briancmahoney\n\nCopyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

Shugarts (SR), Marcus Hall (RS SO), and Andrew Norwell (SO).\n\nBeyond those four, the Buckeyes will have to get a little creative to fill the depth chart.\n\nBased on the spring game, it looks like freshman Tommy Brown will be playing tackle this season, although his more natural position seems to be guard. In a pinch, Jack Mewhort can probably play tackle if the need arrises.\n\nSo, where does that leave the Buckeyes?\n\nWell, things aren’t that bad in 2011, although the five game suspension of Mike Adams makes depth a concern early in the year.\n\nWhen he returns, things should be grand. I have said before that I think the 2011 line could be one of the best we have seen in recent memory, and I stand by that.\n\nWith the graduation of Adams and Shugarts at the end of the season, however, 2012 will be a different story.\n\nObviously, Marcus Hall or Andrew Norwell could both be used at LT in 2012 (with the other playing RT).\n\nIn my opinion, Hall will be the starting LT during Adams’ suspension, and that experience could prove valuable in the future.\n\nEven with Hall at LT, depth will still be a major concern and something that needs to be addressed on the recruiting trail.\n\nThat brings us back around to tackles being such an urgent need in the next two recruiting classes. The Buckeyes won’t be looking for just any tackle either; finding the next great left tackle to protect Braxton Miller’s blind side will be a top priority.\n\nThat is why the recent defections of Kyle Kalis and Kyle Dodson sting a little extra.\n\nAll is not lost, however, and a new offer has apparently gone out to 2012 OL Nick Davidson (although we may not know for sure for a few days). If true, it would be an exciting development.\n\nAdditionally, the 2013 in-state offensive tackle class is already looking strong, which could end up being a huge haul for the Buckeyes.\n\nHere is a look at the newest offers and some of the 2013 linemen that are already on the radar.\n\nNew Offers\n\n2012\n\nNick Davidson (OL)\n\n6’6″ 270 lbs.\n\nEden Prairie (MN) HS\n\nHighlights: Video #1\n\nOffers: Ohio State, Michigan, Virginia Tech, Stanford, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Clemson, Duke, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina State\n\nNick Davidson is the son of former Ohio State football captain Jeff Davidson, making him a legacy and long time fan of the Buckeyes. He has the size and frame that you look for in a future tackle.\n\nIf he does have an offer, it seems like the Buckeyes have a great chance at signing him, which would go a long way in helping to address the OT depth in 2012.\n\nGeorge “Bam” Bradley (DB)\n\n6’2″ 200 lbs.\n\nTrotwood (OH) Madison HS\n\nHighlights: Video #1\n\nOffers: Ohio State, Michigan State, Penn State, Pittsburgh, Stanford, Tennessee, West Virginia, Arizona, Cincinnati, Northwestern, Syracuse, Vanderbilt\n\nThis offer bucks the offensive line trend that I was going with for this update, but Bam Bradley visited Columbus over the weekend and was offered in person by Coach Fickell.\n\nBradley has long been considered one of the best players in Ohio, and many fans have been hoping he would get an offer for months now. The wait is obviously over.\n\nOhio State joins Michigan and Pittsburgh as Bam’s favorites, and he would like to decide before the season, which means in the next month or two.\n\nThis is an exciting offer for the Buckeyes, but it probably isn’t a good sign for the Florida DBs that the Buckeyes have been focusing their recruiting efforts on up to this point.\n\n2013 Offensive Linemen\n\nThese players won’t be on campus in time to help the 2012 offensive line, but signing a big tackle class in 2013 will be very important. Luckily, the in-state class is already looking very strong.\n\nKyle Meadows (OL)\n\n6’6″ 290 lbs.\n\nLakota (OH) West HS\n\nHighlights: Video #1\n\nOffers: none\n\nMeadows started at LT as a sophomore and looks destined to play there at the next level. He has the size and footwork for the position, and a frame perfect for excelling in a college strength and conditioning program.\n\nLakota West has sent players like Steve Rehring and Solomon Thomas to Ohio State in the past, so you have to imagine that if offered, the Buckeyes would have an above average shot, particularly since any left tackle that comes to OSU in 2013 would immediately have a spot on the depth chart.\n\nSteve Mathie (OL)\n\n6’5″ 270 lbs.\n\nCanton (OH) GlenOak HS\n\nHighlights: Video #1\n\nOffers: UCLA\n\nBill Greene is very high on Steve Mathie, calling him a future left tackle for sure and comparing him favorably to Kyle Dodson and Taylor Decker from the 2012 class.\n\nMathie has camped in Columbus and comes from a very Buckeye friendly high school. He has also expressed early interest in Ohio State and the Buckeyes clearly would have a great shot if they decide to offer.\n\nEvan Lisle (OL)\n\n6’5″ 255 lbs.\n\nCenterville (OH) HS\n\nHighlights: Video #1\n\nOffers: none\n\nLike the other two linemen, Evan Lisle is already being talked about as one of the top Ohio linemen in the 2013 class. He comes from OSU friendly Centerville, and is receiving interest from several programs.\n\nLisle has a mean streak on the field that can’t be taught.\n\n____________________\n\nAll together, that is three tackle prospects receiving plenty of early hype from three very Buckeye friendly high schools.\n\nThere is still a million recruiting years between now and signing day for the 2013 class, but it looks like a strong year for offensive tackles, and that is obviously a good thing for the Buckeyes.\n\nDropped\n\nOH DL LaTroy Lewis committed to Tennessee.\n\nTags: Evan Lisle, George \"Bam\" Bradley, Kyle Meadows, LaTroy Lewis, Nick Davidson, Steve Mathie\n\nCategories: Ohio State Football, Recruiting",

  "latent_27722": "Review – William Shakespeare’s Star Wars: Verily, A New Hope by Ian Doescher\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s Star Wars\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s Star Wars: Verily, A New Hope by Ian Doescher. July 2013. Quirk Books, 174p. $14.95 ISBN:1594746370.\n\n“Inspired by one of the greatest creative minds in the English language—and William Shakespeare—here is an officially licensed retelling of George Lucas’s epic Star Wars in the style of the immortal Bard of Avon. The saga of a wise (Jedi) knight and an evil (Sith) lord, of a beautiful princess held captive and a young hero coming of age, Star Wars abounds with all the valor and villainy of Shakespeare’s greatest plays. ’Tis a tale told by fretful droids, full of faithful Wookiees and fearsome Stormtroopers, signifying…pretty much everything.\n\nReimagined in glorious iambic pentameter—and complete with twenty gorgeous Elizabethan illustrations—William Shakespeare’s Star Wars will astound and edify Rebels and Imperials alike. Zounds! This is the book you’re looking for.” — Publisher’s Description\n\nFor starters, I was almost literally born and raised on Star Wars — I’m only one year older than the franchise. That brings with it certain biases, including the fact that I hold the original trilogy in my heart with a special reverence for all the happy memories, both as a child, and as an adult, that it brings me. I also know all three movies in their original forms by heart (and yes, Han will always have shot first!). Seeing that this unique take on the series had me very excited, and I was far from disappointed.\n\nI admit, that when I first got the book, I was skeptical at how it would play out. It was either going to be a truly groundbreaking new approach to popular literature and film, or it was going to be an absolute joke. Fortunately, I think Shakespeare himself would be proud of the results. Staying true to the original script, Doescher places a very bard-like spin to it that allows anyone even remotely familiar with the film and the story to follow along with no difficulty. When you have lines like: “But unto Tosche Station would I go, And there obtain some pow’r converters. Fie!“, I think you know where we are in the film! And I agree, Luke sounds whiny here too!\n\nThe writing style is exactly as you would expect from a William Shakespeare five act play. In fact, it is written as a script, only lacking some stage direction, but containing all the description and scene setting you would expect from any script. Inner dialogues are spoken aloud, and actions explained in the same way. While we can see these on screen, simple gestures and actions are either written in as direction, or described by the players. As it reads, there would be no doubt that any acting company could easily put on a production of this work.\n\nGranted, there is a little bit of cheek, and some subtle nods to both Shakespeare and Star Wars fans alike, but they are hidden almost like Easter eggs throughout the text. For example, this couplet, a favorite tool of the Bard’s, gives a tip of the hat to the “Han shot first” fans: “I pray thee, sir, forgive me for the mess/And whether I shot first, I’ll not confess.- Han Solo”. There are even points in the book where we see action or have a look at some inner dialogues that we don’t see in the film, for instance a Hamlet-like soliloquy by Luke, lamenting the death of the Stormtrooper whose uniform he has stolen on the Death Star: “[Luke, holding stormtrooper helmet.] Alas, poor stormtrooper, I knew ye not, Yet have I ta’en both uniform and life From thee. What manner of a man wert thou?” Even something as simple as “Once more unto the trench, dear friends, once more!” during the penultimate battle gives a little grin when you get both references.\n\nI simply cannot sing the praises of William Shakespeare’s Star Wars enough. Perfect for fans of both Star Wars and Shakespeare, it will have you coming back again and again, just like the original. I personally have recommended this to patrons who enjoy the films, but have poo-pooed plays and Shakespeare both. Everyone has loved it so far! I just can’t wait to see the stage production!\n\nIf you enjoy William Shakespeare’s Star Wars, fear not, the rest of the trilogy has also been given a similar treatment and you will want to find William Shakespeare’s The Empire Striketh Back, and William Shakespeare’s The Jedi Doth Return\n\nFive of Five Stars\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s Star Wars: Verily, A New Hope on Amazon\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s Star Wars: Verily, A New Hopeon Barnes and Noble\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s Star Wars: Verily, A New Hope on Goodreads\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s Star Wars: Verily, A New Hope on LibraryThing\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s Star Wars: Verily, A New Hope on Shelfari\n\nAdvertisements",

  "latent_27759": "The Sheffield Outrages were a series of explosions and murders by a small group of trade unionist militants carried out in Sheffield, England in the 1860s.\n\nSheffield's early success in steel production had involved long working hours, in desperately unpleasant conditions which offered little or no safety protection. In The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, Friedrich Engels quotes[1] a local doctor, Dr. Knight, regarding the so-called \"Grinder's Asthma\" suffered by the Sheffield cutlery workers in the mid 19th century:\n\nThey usually begin their work in the fourteenth year, and if they have good constitutions, rarely notice any symptoms before the twentieth year. Then the symptoms of their peculiar disease appear. They suffer from shortness of breath at the slightest effort in going up hill or up stairs, they habitually raise the shoulders to relieve the permanent and increasing want of breath; they bend forward, and seem, in general, to feel most comfortable in the crouching position in which they work. Their complexion becomes dirty yellow, their features express anxiety, they complain of pressure on the chest. Their voices become rough and hoarse, they cough loudly, and the sound is as if air were driven through a wooden tube.\n\nIt was, perhaps, no coincidence, therefore, that the city became one of the main centres for trade union organisation and agitation in the United Kingdom.\n\nBy the mid-late 1860s the majority of the objectives of the Chartist movement had been frustrated. These social and political reformers had not accomplished all they had hoped to, although they had succeeded in lobbying for the establishment of the first town council in 1843. (Eventually, the great majority of the items of their 'charter' did, in fact, become law).\n\nSocial and working conditions in industrial England were not showing any significant improvement and the - as yet unrecognised - trade unions struggled to protect the interests of their members. These conditions provoked great discontent and eventually militant action. In some isolated incidents, workmen even began to use violence to punish employers and also those fellow-workers who would not become union members: the so-called \"Sheffield Outrages\".\n\nThe trade unions themselves sought a formal inquiry to establish the facts of the matter, largely as a result of accusations in the newspapers of complicity in these outrages resulting from investigations by W. C. Leng of the Sheffield Daily Telegraph.[2] On 17 November 1866 a delegation, which included members of the Sheffield Trades Council and the London Trades Council, requested that the Home Secretary take the necessary measures to investigate.\n\nThis led to a Special Commission of Enquiry into these occurrences in May 1867.[3] Immunity was offered to all who gave evidence and, as a result a number of people were encouraged to testify. Among these was William Broadhead, the Secretary of the Sawgrinders' Union at that time, who described how he had paid two workmen £5 to murder a man called Linley who had taken on too many apprentices, which was, in practice, a method of acquiring cheap labour.",
  "latent_28028": "Some of you may remember our current \"governator\" Arnold Schwarzaneggar.\n\nAhnold was swept into office back in 2003 in a wave of adulation. The \"girly men\" in the Democratic controlled legislature groveled at his feet. There was talk of changing the constitution so he could be president. He was on top of the political world. In late 2004, with his approval ratings running around 70%, he announced that he was rolling back the staffing ratio law that thousands of CNA nurses had fought for 12 years to achieve. Bad idea. Over the next year, nurses staged over 100 demonstrations at every public appearance he made. We followed him all over California and to Texas, New York, Ohio and Boston. Instead of strolling in the front door like a conquering hero, he was forced to sneak in back doors, protected by a horde of bodyguards from the (mostly) women in scrubs. A year later, his approval sat at 30%. A massively inept Democratic campaign allowed him to win re-election, but he's never been the same since.\n\nNow, Meg Whitman has decided to pick a fight with those same nurses. Some people are too dumb to be let out in public. Perhaps we get a clue why she's so anxious to avoid unscripted events.\n\nHere's the history:\n\nEver since last fall, Whitman has been carpet bombing the California airwaves with the most expensive television campaign in state history, financed largely with her own massive wealth.\n\nWith her anti-union, anti-regulation, anti-worker rhetoric, nurses saw her as a huge threat to the quality of care we give, and ultimately to our patients. As a fairly small union, the amount of money we can spend on politics is a drop in the ocean compared to NutMeg's wealth. But we do have some creative minds. With the help of a fine actress, we created Queen Meg, a parody character representative of Whitman's wealth, sense of entitlement and disconnect from the lives of everyday Californians.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nSo the Queen has been touring California, we've been having fun with this and so have the press. ( http://www.kcra.com/... ) The real Meg however is not amused. Having disposed of her GOP primary opponent, her campaign has decided to declare war on us.\n\nThe themes of her attack are tiredly familiar. We've heard them all before from other politicians we've upset:\n\nNurses really love her, it's just the nasty union that doesn't like her.\n\nThe union has brainwashed the nurses\n\nWe shouldn't be wasting money on politics\n\nOur Executive Director is paid too much (A salary that probably equals the daily interest on Meg's fortune.)\n\nHer campaign wrote us a letter damanding that we give her our membership list so that she could communicate directly with the nurses.\n\nHere's a\n\nreport:\n\nGubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman's campaign asked the California Nurses Association this morning for its mailing list, the Republican billionaire lambasting the union's leadership for \"partisan theatrics\" and asking for direct access to its members.\n\nRead more: http://blogs.sacbee.com/...\n\nIn the corporate world, I'm sure that what Meg wanted, Meg got, but nurses are not so easily pushed around. So, our leadership sent back a nice, polite letter in which we declined to share our members' private information with her, but offered to sponsor one or more public forums in which she and her opponent could appear before large audiences of real nurses and take unscripted questions directly from them. Whitman, who has based her campaign so far on avoiding unscripted events and open questioning, was not interested.\n\nSo, we said, \"OK, you don't want to appear with your opponent, how about all alone?\" We offered to sponsor a forum where she alone could take questions from nurses. We even told her we'd set up video links to statewide venues so nurses all over could hear from her directly. No dice on that one either. Something about unscripted questions she just does not like.\n\nNow Meg and her surrogates are making the rounds of the far-right, union hating talk radio ranters to attack us. All the themes I mentioned above, repeated ad nauseum. They're even issuing statements telling nurses what we believe:\n\n\"The nurses do believe that the union leadership has gone too far,\" said Pompei. \"They don’t agree that the money that they’re spending, you know, $50,000 on a wrapped bus to follow Meg around. They don’t think that’s a good use of union dues.\"\n\nSo here's the matchup:\n\nIn one corner: the richest woman in politics, and surely one of the most arrogant, armed with more money that anyone can reasonably imagine.\n\nIn the other corner: the 85,000 working nurses of the California Nurses Assn., armed with our honesty, our knowledge, our credibility and our creativity.\n\nAnybody want to make a bet on this one?\n\nA final note: While Meg Whitman as Governor may seem like a joke, she's a joke with a whole lotta money. And the reality of Meg Whitman as Governor of our largest state would be no joke at all. Please support\n\nJerry Brown.\n\nAnd for those of you on Facebook, please friend our Queen Meg:\n\nhttp://www.queenmeg2010.com/\n\nUpdate Here's a good one: Geri Jenkins, one of our co-presidents, was set to go on Fox Business News this evening to talk about all this, with someone from the Whitman campaign there too. We just got word that the Whitman campaign had backed out of doing it - think they might be starting to regret starting this fight?",

I sautéed my zucchini on the stove after I tossed it with some pesto. The pesto you can make yourself by blending together some basil, garlic, olive oil, and pine nuts. Or you can also buy it pre-made – just make sure that it doesn’t contain Parmesan.\n\nHow does a zucchini become noodles, you might ask. You simply use a julienne peeler to strip the zucchini squash down to the seeds, breaking apart any pieces that stick together. I don’t know if making a vegetable into noodles tricks your mind somehow, but I wolfed down two medium zucchini this way. This is not something I normally do. But once the zucchini noodles were mixed with a little pesto and tossed with roasted tomatoes, there was no stopping me.

  "latent_28479": "The NBA does the offseason better than any sports league, and each summer session is usually defined by some type of drama.\n\nLast year, it was which teams would throw the most money at the least deserving players. This year, it's been the superstar carousel spinning uncontrollably and reshaping the basketball landscape.\n\nDrama makes for great discussion and no shortage of fan interest. It also opens the door for less heralded dealings to slide under the radar, and they inevitably surface down the road when everyone realizes the importance of moves they never knew they were supposed to care about.\n\nBut you don't need a crystal ball to see these better-than-expected impacts coming. Discerning eyes can sleuth out undervalued acquisitions long before casual fans take notice, like when dollar amounts lag behind talent levels or critical supporting skills are slept on.\n\nWe have dived deeper than the headlines and found the most underrated moves of the 2017 offseason. Rookies are excluded, since there's no NBA evidence about what they'll become. Everyone else is fair game and has been evaluated by economic value, talent, potential and impact (both on his team and around the league).\n\nGet the latest on the NBA from those who know the league best: Install the free B/R app .\n\n7. Tyreke Evans Returns to Memphis\n\nRocky Widner/Getty Images\n\nTyreke Evans—who once joined Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Oscar Robertson in the uber-exclusive 20-point, five-assist, five-rebound rookie club—settled on a one-year, $3.3 million pact with the Memphis Grizzlies this summer.\n\nAge isn't the issue, as he'll celebrate his 28th birthday in September. Production isn't a major problem either, since he holds career averages of 16.1 points, 5.1 assists and 4.8 rebounds per game.\n\nHis cool reception on the open market can be traced to recurring knee issues, which have cost him 99 contests over the last two seasons. The fact he's neither a lockdown defender nor a lights-out sniper (career 29.5 percent) didn't help either.\n\nBut his talent level is head, shoulders and at least a torso above his new pay rate. And the University of Memphis product's skills are the kind that could spark an attack that finished last season 19th in efficiency (104.7 points per 100 possessions) and 28th in pace.\n\n\"Tyreke is one of the most aggressive and potent perimeter players in the league,\" Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace said Tuesday, per Ronald Tillery of the Commercial Appeal. \"He can play both backcourt spots as well as small forward, and his shooting has improved significantly since he was starting with the Memphis Tigers in FedExForum.\"\n\nThe Grizzlies need more off-the-dribble verve. In 2016-17, they were 28th in drives per game (22.4), 28th in isolation scoring (0.79 points per possession) and 24th in paint points (40.5 per game). A healthy Chandler Parsons could have helped those numbers, but that could be a thing of the past.\n\nGranted, Evans has his own health woes, the main reason he isn't ranked any higher. But at least they're reflected in his salary. When he's right, he's a lethal shot-creator. In 2014-15—his most recent healthy season—he averaged the second-most drives per game (11.8). And only 26.4 percent of his career two-point field goals have been off assists.\n\n6. The Orlando Magic Sign a Needed Stopper\n\nFernando Medina/Getty Images\n\nRestricted free agents with defensive versatility, loads of athleticism and offensive upside don't often come cheaply. But credit the Orlando Magic for luring Jonathon Simmons out of the Alamo City with only a three-year, $20 million deal (which—icing on the cake—is only guaranteed for $1 million in the final season).\n\nAnd thank the San Antonio Spurs, who renounced his restricted rights but not until mid-July, when many shoppers had already invested free-agency funds elsewhere.\n\nSuddenly, Orlando found an intriguing path to improve its 24th-ranked defense (108.0 points allowed per 100 possessions). Simmons can defend anywhere along the perimeter, and last season, he finished eighth among shooting guards in ESPN's defensive real plus-minus.\n\nOffense is a wild card. He suffered precipitous drops in field-goal percent (50.4 to 42.0) and three-point shooting (38.3 to 29.4) last season, which could prove problematic to an offense already squeezed for spacing. But when his opportunities increased—which should happen more often with the Magic—his numbers usually did too. He averaged 14.0 points per game on 44.4 percent shooting over his final two playoff rounds.\n\n\"Jonathon's such a good defender, he's such an aggressive player that that kind of captures your attention,\" Magic president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman said in July, per Josh Robbins of the Orlando Sentinel. \"But Jonathon gets to the rim. He's a capable passer, and I think his shooting has shown improvement. ... If he can kind of continue to stair-step progress with his perimeter abilities, there's a whole other level in store for him.\"\n\nSimmons could capitalize on his increased chances in Orlando and prove the Magic got him at tremendous bargain. If his offense stagnates, his defense could justify his cost. And if he somehow regresses on both ends, the Magic can make this contract disappear pretty easily.\n\nHe isn't young (28 in September), so his offensive question marks are more concerning than a typical third-year player's would be. Orlando also is far from guaranteed a playoff spot, meaning there's too much uncertainty for Simmons to rank higher.\n\n5. Utah's Elite Defense Gets Stingier\n\nMelissa Majchrzak/Getty Images\n\nLast season, the Utah Jazz boasted a ridiculous defense. They were third in efficiency (102.7 points allowed per 100 possessions), second in field-goal percentage allowed and maybe first in intimidation with Rudy Gobert manning the middle and suffocating length around him.\n\nLooking through that lens, Thabo Sefolosha's two-year, $10.5 million commitment to Salt Lake City is almost unfair. The 6'7\" swingman—who boasts an oppressive 7'2\" wingspan—ranked ninth among all perimeter players with a 2.27 defensive real plus-minus last season on ESPN.com.\n\n\"... Defensively, he was as versatile as they come as far as who he could guard,\" Atlanta Hawks assistant coach Charles Lee said following Sefolosha's departure in free agency, per Jody Genessy of the Deseret News. \"He can guard a point guard. He can guard a power forward.\"\n\nSefolosha's malleability will be his key to earning playing time in a wing rotation that's somehow crowded even without Gordon Hayward. He probably won't fill more than a supporting role, but he'll put opposing scorers in straightjackets when he steps inside the lines and help Utah maintain its tenacious identity.\n\nAnd there are ways the 33-year-old could make this contract become a theft. Like, if he rebounds from a few down shooting years and strokes the way he did from 2011-12 to 2012-13 (1.1 threes per game at a 42.2 percent clip). Or if his cuts increase the potency of Utah's passing and his comfort on the ball gives the Jazz another complementary playmaker.\n\nUtah's depth works against him here. Between the 3 and 4 spots, he'll be fighting for playing time with at least four others (Joe Ingles, Joe Johnson, Derrick Favors, Jonas Jerebko). If Sefolosha is hurting for minutes with his team on the fringes of the playoff race, he'd have a difficult time justifying a higher ranking than this.\n\n4. Dubs Steal a Sniper\n\nNoah Graham/Getty Images\n\nIf you want to argue that the Golden State Warriors get so much media coverage it's impossible to construe any transaction as underrated, that might be fair.\n\nBut if any signing qualifies as overlooked, it's their minimum investment in Omri Casspi. Especially since it happened during the same summer when Stephen Curry inked the then-largest deal ever, Kevin Durant sacrificed millions, Nick Young arrived, Andre Iguodala won his negotiation, rookie Jordan Bell showed out in Las Vegas Summer League and even JaVale McGee found his way back to Golden State.\n\nTo be fair, Casspi is off the radar for a reason. He played for three different teams last season, totaling only 36 appearances. He has averaged more than 24 minutes per game twice in his eight-year career—on teams that went 58-106.\n\nStill, Casspi at the veteran's minimum of $2.1 million is \"criminal,\" as ESPN's Zach Lowe put it. Travel back just one season to 2015-16, and Casspi was averaging a career-best 15.6 points per 36 minutes on 48.1 percent shooting (40.9 outside) while displaying a slew of coveted contemporary strengths.\n\n\"His sharpshooting habits made him a valuable offensive force, and he held his own defensively by constantly maintaining the right positions and rarely making mental mistakes,\" Bleacher Report's Adam Fromal wrote. \"In many ways, he'd become one of the league's most underrated commodities.\"\n\nCasspi's three-and-D skills should be enhanced in the Bay. Between the ball movement of the Warriors offense and the gravitational All-Stars around him, he'll gorge on open shots. And his ability to switch defensive assignments plays right in line with Golden State's style.\n\nHe might get the fewest minutes of these seven players, but he'll take the floor for the best team. His individual impact isn't great enough to climb into the top three, but the Dubs' relevance moved him up to the middle.\n\n3. Indiana Pacers Find Proven Point Guard with Upside\n\nVaughn Ridley/Getty Images\n\nCory Joseph was more than a footnote in the Indiana Pacers' offseason. With 364 regular-season outings and another 71 postseason tussles under his belt, he's a proven commodity for a franchise that doesn't have nearly as many of those as it did in recent years.\n\nBut his trade from the Toronto Raptors wasn't exactly a headline-grabber, even in the Circle City. Not in an offseason when the Pacers traded Paul George to the Oklahoma City Thunder, Indiana University product Victor Oladipo returned to the Hoosier State and Indy pumped $41 million into Darren Collison and Bojan Bogdanovic.\n\nJoseph, though, could be the most important non-Oladipo acquisition. The feisty floor general has long been a pest to opposing point guards, and last season, he set personal bests in points (9.3), assists (3.3) and rebounds (2.9) per game. He's been a playoff participant each of the last five seasons, averaging more than 22 minutes per contest during his past two trips with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nHis floor is solid as a relentless defender and transition attacker. And his ceiling might have more room to rise than people think. At 26 years old, he's less than a year older than Oladipo, and Joseph's three-ball—while still not where he'd like it—is trending the right way.\n\n\"Joseph in many ways fits within [Pacers president of basketball operations Kevin] Pritchard's desire to build a team of young, talented players who can develop, build chemistry and win together for sustained success in the future,\" Nate Taylor of the Indianapolis Star wrote. \"The Pacers were intrigued by Joseph because they believe he has yet to reach his full potential.\"\n\nThe Pacers could be the worst team represented on our rankings, which highlights how many other boxes Joseph checks in order to claim the No. 3 spot. He doesn't have Evans' injury woes, Simmons' uncertainties, Sefolosha's age/decline or Casspi's compact role.\n\n2. OKC Stretches Out Its Frontcourt\n\nLayne Murdoch/Getty Images\n\nDon't be fooled by last season's historic production from reigning NBA MVP Russell Westbrook. The Oklahoma City Thunder offense struggled to function because of one of the Association's worst cases of congestion.\n\nThe team as a whole couldn't shoot. It had the NBA's lowest conversion rate from three (32.7 percent) and made the fifth-fewest triples per game (8.4). And the Thunder were particularly putrid up front, plagued by bigs who either didn't launch threes (Steven Adams, Enes Kanter, Taj Gibson) or shouldn't have (Domantas Sabonis).\n\nOKC is breathing much easier now, and that's not entirely due to the Paul George addition. Patrick Patterson, who came in on an economic three-year, $16.4 million deal in July, stands to modernize this group's frontcourt and flesh out what was the league's best one-man show, as Rob Mahoney of Sports Illustrated explained:\n\n\"Patterson is a rangy forward/small-ball center who can guard multiple positions, and he should slot nicely into the Thunder's frontcourt. Patterson will provide what the Thunder so desperately lacked last season: spacing. He can sit in the corner while Russell Westbrook and Paul George work offensively, launching threes when the defense is sucked in.\"\n\nPatterson battled left knee pain last season and underwent arthroscopic surgery in early August, though OKC expects him back in time for training camp.\n\nThe 28-year-old might be a specialist—65.9 percent of his shots were threes in 2016-17—but his specialty addresses a glaring need (shot 37.2 percent from beyond the arc).\n\nIf he can stay healthy, he'll provide a boost to one of the Western Conference's most intriguing teams. He just won't make as much of a difference as our No. 1 choice, who also suits up for a superior squad.\n\n1. Houston Rockets Modernize Defense\n\nVaughn Ridley/Getty Images\n\nThe Houston Rockets won 55 games last season without a winning formula.\n\nTrust me, it's possible. The James Harden-led offense orchestrated by head coach Mike D'Antoni was as explosive as expected, but the defense was disastrous—at least as it pertained to the team's hopes of becoming elite. Houston's 109.0 defensive rating tied for the fourth-highest ever recorded by a 55-plus-game winner (a 173-team sample size) and the worst by such a club in more than 20 years.\n\nThe Rockets had to address their shortcomings this summer and did so in spectacular—yet understated—fashion. P.J. Tucker \"headlined\" the subtle, savvy pickups while arriving via a four-year, $31.9 million deal. Veteran's minimum money was all Houston needed to land another piece of defensive silly putty in Luc Mbah a Moute.\n\nAnd just like that, the Rockets possessed a modern—maybe dominant at times—defense, as Bleacher Report's Dan Favale wrote:\n\n\"Adding Luc Mbah a Moute and P.J. Tucker helps unlock lineups oozing matchup nightmares. Either one of them can defend power forwards, and Trevor Ariza lets them switch every wing combination while stashing James Harden on more palatable assignments.\n\n... Mbah a Moute is a sneaky post defender, and Tucker has the vinegary vim to tussle with certain bigs. Between the two of them, the Rockets can have the 4 and 5 on relative lock within baby Death Squad combinations.\"\n\nIs it fair that the most underrated move is a combination of moves? Probably not, but we make the rules. Besides, the fact the Rockets made these signings in tandem was what made them special. One player alone wasn't going to cover Houston's defensive holes.\n\nWith Tucker, Mbah a Moute, Ariza and Chris Paul working together, the Rockets can ratchet up their defensive intensity to ludicrous levels. And with Harden, Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson still around, Houston can lean just as much on the offensive end. Start intertwining these two groups, and the Western Conference's second seed becomes Space City's to lose.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all stats from Basketball Reference or NBA.com.\n\nZach Buckley covers the NBA for Bleacher Report.

  "latent_28492": "Stem cell research has generated countless waves of enthusiasm and controversy throughout the decades. Now and then news emerges of promising new stem cell techniques, only to be followed by negative or mediocre clinical results. Potential applications have included treating heart disease, eye lesions, diabetes, stroke, spinal cord injury, dementia, neurological degeneration and cancer, but to this day only bone marrow transplants have proved feasible.\n\nThe technical problems are manifold, ranging from extraction, culturing and implantation challenges, to safety issues and donor rejection. Perhaps the most prohibitive aspect of all is the deep lack of understanding of how stem cells are actually regulated.\n\nThis problem is well illustrated by the surprising finding that endocannabinoids could very well play a decisive role in cell maturation and differentiation.\n\nTwo recent preclinical studies (2014, 2016) concluded that cannabidiol (CBD) strongly regulates the proliferation, migration and neurogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MCSs). These adult stem cells are able to differentiate into the main types of precursor cells and have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, immune, metabolic and self-renewal properties. As of now, there are over 500 ongoing or concluded clinical trials based on MSCs.\n\nAt the turn of the century, researchers found MSCs present in the mouth cavity. Besides being easier to collect, these cells also showed some stronger properties compared to MSCs from other tissues. In light of this knowledge, Dr. Emanuela Mazzon and colleagues became interested in finding out whether oral MCSs were also responsive to CBD.\n\nMCSs were collected from the gums of five healthy patients and incubated with CBD for 24 hours. Analysis of cell proliferation and viability revealed that an optimal concentration of CBD was set at 5 μM, with higher dosages being increasingly toxic.\n\nThe researchers then analyzed changes in the genetic expression of cells treated with 5 μM CBD, compared to controls. The analysis showed that almost 6000 genes had been modulated by CBD, with a near 50/50 split in terms of being over-activated or inhibited.\n\nInterestingly, several of the genes with altered expression are known to be involved in neurodevelopmental processes, including the proliferation of cells that precede new neurons, neurogenesis itself, and more coarse regulation of the nervous system. On the other hand, several of the inhibited genes are associated with the formation of other types of cells such as glial cells, bone tissues and blood vessels.\n\nTo test the ability of CBD to promote the differentiation of MSCs into neuronal precursor cells, the authors labeled the latter with a colorful marker and proceeded to quantify them. As can be observed in the figure below, CBD was strongly associated with an increase in neural precursor cells after 2 and 4 days of incubation, compared to the control (DMSO). The relative decrease from the 4th day is explained by the further differentiation of those cells into fully fledged neurons.\n\nIn sum, these results suggest a strong regulatory role of CBD in the differentiation of stem cells into neurons. Further in vivo studies are required to assess the therapeutic potential of combining MSCs with CBD in animal models of neuronal diseases.\n\nThe original study by Dr. Mazzon and colleagues can be found in the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry.\n\nFeatured image via Виталий Смолыгин.",
  "latent_28577": "Australia 16-41 British & Irish Lions, 3rd Test, Sydney, July 6\n\nRobbie Deans resigned to fate\n\nRobbie Deans spoke like a man who had coached his last Test for Australia after the Wallabies suffered a big-stage thrashing on Saturday night. Beaten up and dominated by the British & Irish Lions in a demoralising third Test ambush, the Wallabies are set for a new coach before The Rugby Championship commences in August.\n\nWith the Australian Rugby Union sounding out the Brumbies and Queensland to potentially release Jake White and Ewen McKenzie, respectively, Deans was forced to acknowledge his coaching future was out of his hands. \"Those decisions will be made by others,\" the New Zealander said. \"You don't presume anything in this industry and that decision is made by others, and who knows?\"\n\nDeans seemed resigned to his fate when he detached himself from the team he's led for six seasons on being asked how they would regroup from the four-tries-to-one thumping. \"I've got no doubt the boys will regroup,\" he said. [The Rugby Championship] is a different competition and a different circumstance ... a completely different tournament. There's no doubt these blokes will respond. They're too good a side not to.\"\n\nAsked if he was excited by a tough challenge ahead, he said: \"I'm not excited, in terms of what I've just been through, but that doesn't change the possibilities and potential of the group. They're a better side than what they put in there tonight and that's the disappointing thing.\"\n\nSee ya Robbie!!! — Lote Tuqiri (@LoteTuqiri) July 6, 2013\n\nRobbie Deans on his future - \"it's for other people to decide\" #AusvLio pic.twitter.com/hXbKqkfhIB — ESPN Scrum.com (@espnscrum) July 6, 2013\n\nThe Wallabies were not helped by an early head clash for flanker George Smith as well as a torn hamstring by Israel Folau, not to mention a demolition job by the Lions scrum.\n\nDeans lamented a \"horrific start\" and a poor scrum display. \"They used their set piece with great advantage and then fed off it,\" he said. \"It worked for them, they were turning the scoreboard over and you saw the rest. We gave them a leg-up which really allowed them to thrive.\"\n\nWallabies captain James Horwill said he was devastated but still stood by Deans. \"Robbie's the coach, he's contracted and he's the coach,\" he said. \"He's a great coach (but) now's not the time, five minutes after a game, to talk about coaching positions.\"\n\nHorwill said the loss was incredibly disappointing, especially starting \"opposite\" to the way they had intended. The second-rower said his pack failed to recover from the first scrum in the first minute.\n\n\"We got penalised early and then got a bit gun shy,\" he said. \"We sat on the back foot and allowed them to dictate terms. We just weren't good enough tonight. In the end, we dug deep and we tried as hard as we could. You'd have to say the better team on the night won.\"\n\nHorwill added: \"It's been a big two weeks. That's what Lions tours are about, it's up there with the pinnacle of Test rugby. Ultimately it's the team that deals with the peaks and troughs best that ends up winning. They dealt with that better than we did today. You can't sugar coat it or anything like that, we weren't good enough today and they were. As I said out on the field, the better team won.\"\n\nIn his six seasons in charge, Deans has led the Wallabies to one Tri-Nations title, third place in the 2011 IRB World Cup, and has yet to attain Bledisloe Cup success.\n\nIt is Australia's poor 3-15 record in 18 trans-Tasman Tests against the All Blacks which had him under pressure before this year and a backlash against discipline issues may also help seal his fate.\n\nSenior players and influential ARU figures were reportedly particularly unhappy with how star backs James O'Connor and Kurtley Beale have continued to misbehave off the field.\n\nThe Lions overpowered the Wallabies in Sydney (video available in Australia only)\n\n© AAP",
  "latent_28599": "Rally against the CCBR's anti-abortion caravan at the Vancouver Art Gallery [Flickr Creative Commons]\n\nA federal judge on Friday struck down an Alabama law that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.\n\nThe ruling comes amid a wave of new abortion laws in states where conservatives are aiming to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion.\n\nU.S. District Judge Myron Thompson in Alabama issued the 53-page ruling, saying the provision in the state’s so-called Women’s Health and Safety Act would effectively close the only abortion clinics in Alabama’s three largest cities: Montgomery, Mobile and Birmingham.\n\n“The staff-privileges requirement would make it impossible for a woman to obtain an abortion in much of the state,” Thompson wrote. “It is certain that thousands of women per year – approximately 40 percent of those seeking abortions in the state – would be unduly burdened.”\n\nRepresentatives for the Alabama Attorney General’s Office could not be immediately reached on Friday.\n\nSusan Watson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, applauded Friday’s order.\n\n“This ruling protects Alabama women and ensures access to safe and legal abortion,” she said in an interview. She added that similar laws being pushed in other states appeared to be a “a concerted effort nationwide,” to scale back abortion rights.\n\nA comparable provision to Alabama’s was part of a law signed in Florida by Republican Governor Rick Scott on Friday, and the U.S. Supreme Court is considering a challenge to an abortion law in Texas, where several clinics have closed due to new restrictions.\n\n(Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",

Lastly, we'll be looking to tone down a few builds that increase damage exponentially against larger targets.\n\nSkills Polaric Slash: The casting time and aftercast of this skill have been reduced by 0.24 seconds. Crystalline Strike: The casting time and aftercast of this skill have been reduced by 0.24 seconds. Fire Swipe: The casting time and aftercast of this skill have been reduced by 0.24 seconds.

Fiery Greatsword—Flame Wave: This skill now allows other skills to be cast during its animation. Fiery Greatsword—Lesser Fiery Eruption: The cooldown of this passively activated skill has been increased from 3 seconds to 6 seconds. Conjure Earth Shield: This conjured weapon now utilizes a new enhancement, Tectonic Shift, which grants barrier every second it is active. Conjure Earth Shield—Stone Sheath: This skill now applies 2 seconds of Tectonic Shift in addition to its current effects when successfully blocking an attack. The physical damage of this skill has been increased by 100%. Conjure Earth Shield—Magnetic Surge: The physical damage of this skill has been increased by 100%. In addition to its current effects, the beginning of this skill now grants Magnetic Aura to the user for 4 seconds. Conjure Earth Shield—Magnetic Shield: This skill now applies 2 seconds of Tectonic Shift in addition to its current effects for each enemy struck by the attack. The casting time of this skill has been reduced by 0.4 seconds. Conjure Earth Shield—Crippling Shield: This skill now deals double damage and inflicts 2 stacks of bleeding for 10 seconds (per target) if the user is under the effects of barrier. Conjure Earth Shield—Shield Smash: Increased the physical damage of this skill by 17%. Conjure Frost Bow—Ice Storm: Against nonplayer enemies, this skill now has a 0.25-second cooldown on each enemy, during which the enemy cannot be struck again by the skill. Arcane Power: Reduced the number of stacks applied to allies from 4 to 2. The user of this skill retains 4 stacks on casting.\n\nTraits Final Shielding: The skill fired by this trait has been renamed to Lesser Arcane Shield.\n\nEngineer:\n\nEngineer updates are focused around the holosmith and improving the synergy of the Photon Forge mode with other skills. To that end, the sword is seeing some improvements to smooth out rotations and to make heat stocking more valuable. Additionally, several holosmith skills are gaining combo finishers to synergize with core engineers' variety of fields.\n\nHolosmith Rewards: Updated available stat combinations to use Berserker, Marauder, and Marshal options. This change will reset your current shoulder pieces and weapons and will require you to reselect your stat preference.\n\nSkills Sun Edge/Sun Ripper/Gleam Saber: Removed heat bonuses that increased critical-hit chance. Added a new heat bonus that increases damage by 10% while above 50 heat and 20% while above 100 heat. Gleam Saber: Increased damage by 10%.

Radiant Arc: Reduced casting time by 0.1 second. Reduced aftercast by 0.1 second. Holo Leap: The swiftness or superspeed applied by this skill is now applied at the end of the leap rather than at the start. Photon Blitz: This skill is now a 20% chance projectile finisher. Holographic Shockwave: This skill is now a blast finisher. This skill will now go on interrupt cooldown instead of full cooldown if it is interrupted before the shock wave is created. Coolant Blast: This skill is now a blast finisher. Chill duration increased from 2 seconds to 4 seconds. Cauterize: Increased number of conditions removed from 2 to 3.

Vent Exhaust: Increased damage by 120%. Lowered burning stacks from 3 to 1. Increased burning duration from 3 seconds to 6 seconds.\n\nGuardian:\n\nFor this update, we are focusing on the usability of firebrand mantras, which we feel are currently underperforming. By increasing the radius of these skills, we hope that they will be easier to use to support parties in conjunction with the existing tome skills. A few firebrand traits are also having their internal cooldowns adjusted to better synchronize with each other.\n\nFirebrand Rewards: Updated available stat combinations to use Viper, Trailblazer, and Marshal options. This change will reset your current helm pieces and weapons and will require you to reselect your stat preference.\n\nSkills Firebrand tome skills now set each other on a 0.5-second cooldown upon\n\nequip. Mantras: Fixed a bug that prevented proper resetting of mantra charges\n\nwhile mounted. Mantra of Flame: Increased the range of this skill from 300 to 450. Increased the radius of this skill from 120 to 180. Mantra of Lore: Increased the range of this skill from 300 to 450. Increased the radius of this skill from 120 to 180. Mantra of Liberation: Increased the range of this skill from 300 to 450. Increased the radius of this skill from 120 to 180. Mantra of Potence: Increased the range of this skill from 300 to 450. Increased the radius of this skill from 120 to 180. Mantra of Solace: Increased the range of this skill from 300 to 450. Increased the radius of this skill from 120 to 180. Mantra of Truth: Increased the range of this skill from 300 to 450. Increased the radius of this skill from 120 to 180.\n\nTraits Healer's Retribution: Fixed a bug that prevented this trait from granting retaliation when using Mantra of Solace's active skills: Restoring Reprieve and Rejuvenating Respite. Liberator's Vow: Reduced the internal cooldown on this trait from 12 seconds to 8 seconds. Stalwart Speed: Increased the internal cooldown on this trait from 5 seconds to 8 seconds. Quickfire: Reduced the stacks of Ashes of the Just granted by this trait from 2 to 1. Reduced the internal cooldown on this trait from 10 seconds to 8 seconds. Retribution: Fixed a bug that was erroneously displaying increased damage on sword and spear attacks.\n\nMesmer:\n\nToday's mesmer update is focused around the Mirage's Axe. We've cleaned up several bugs and animation hang-ups that could cause the weapon to feel less smooth than intended. Additionally, we are adding camera refocusing to skills that shadowstep you to points around your target. These skills will attempt to face your camera behind your character after the shadowstep occurs so that it's easier to keep focus on your target.\n\nMirage: Added new UI effects to indicate when Mirage Cloak is active.\n\nSkills Axe Autoattack: Fixed a bug that could cause skills used in the middle of the attack sequence to have a noticeable delay before activating. Lingering Thoughts: Lowered aftercast by 0.1 second. Fixed a bug that caused this skill to show an incorrect casting time. Added a 0.25-second recharge between uses of this skill to prevent accidental double use. Axes of Symmetry: This skill will now rotate the camera to face your target after the shadowstep. This skill now performs a range check before casting. Shortened maximum distance to target after shadowstep by 20%. Illusionary Ambush: Increased Mirage Cloak duration to 1 second to be consistent with other skills. This skill now takes into account your currently wielded weapon when determining maximum shadowstep distance from the target. Updated minimum and maximum distances from target for random shadowstep calculations. This skill will now rotate the camera to face your target after the shadowstep. Imaginary Axes: Increased seek distance for the follow-up attack by 20%. Increased stacks of confusion for the player version of this skill from 1 to 2 (clones still apply 1 stack). Increased damage by 20%. This skill no longer requires you to face your target. Phantasmal Berserker: Reduced casting time from 1 second to 0.75 seconds. Chaos Vortex: Increased projectile speed by 25%. Increased projectile damage by 20%. Removed confusion and torment conditions. This skill now inflicts bleeding (2 stacks for 6 seconds), burning (1 stack for 3 seconds), and vulnerability (3 stacks for 5 seconds). Jaunt: Fixed a bug that prevented this skill from being recognized as an elite skill for the purposes of some rune effects.\n\nTraits Mirrored Axes: Fixed a bug that prevented clones from generating the bonus axe.

Desert Distortion: Fixed a bug that prevented mirrors from spawning if Distortion was activated while jumping.\n\nNecromancer:\n\nThe reaper specialization from Heart of Thorns™ is seeing a few significant changes in this update, primarily centered around Reaper's Shroud. We drastically increased the damage of all shroud attacks while simultaneously increasing the rate at which life force is lost while in shroud. These changes are aimed at allowing the reaper to output more damage at the cost of some defense. In conjunction with these changes, we are also revisiting some underperforming shroud-based traits to focus their power into specific high points centered around entering or leaving shroud.\n\nSkills Blood Is Power (World vs. World): This skill's PvP split has been extended to WvW and will now use the lower 20-second cooldown. Deathly Chill (World vs. World): This skill's PvP split has been extended to WvW and will now apply 1 stack of bleeding for 8 seconds upon chill application. Manifest Sand Shade: Fixed a bug that could cause this skill's targets to be lost due to proximity between shades or the casting scourge. Made back-end changes to increase the priority of shade visibility. Nefarious Favor: Fixed a bug that could cause this skill's targets to be lost due to proximity between shades or the casting scourge. Sand Cascade: Fixed a bug that could cause this skill's targets to be lost due to proximity between shades or the casting scourge. Garish Pillar: Fixed a bug that could cause this skill's targets to be lost due to proximity between shades or the casting scourge. Desert Shroud: Fixed a bug that could cause this skill's targets to be lost due to proximity between shades or the casting scourge. Increased the damage inflicted per strike of this skill by 25%. Increased the duration of torment inflicted on each pulse of this skill from 2 seconds to 4 seconds in PvE. Reaper Shroud: Increased life-force consumption rate from 3% per second to 5% per second. Life Rend: Increased damage by 25%. Life Slash: Increased damage by 30%. Life Reap: Increased damage by 25%. Reduced life-force gain per hit from 2% to 1.5%. Death's Charge: Increased damage by 25%.

Fading Twilight: Increased damage by 8%. Sand Swell: This skill can no longer be canceled by other skills before the portal is created.

Chilling Scythe: Increased damage by 21%.\n\nTraits Reaper's Onslaught: Recharge reduction on shroud skills is now calculated per target hit by Life Reap. Rending Shroud: This trait has been renamed to Awaken the Pain. This trait grants 5 might for 5 seconds when entering shroud and causes might on you to grant 40 power and 20 condition damage per stack at level 80. Reaper's Might: Fixed a bug that was preventing this trait from properly granting might on use of scourge shroud skills. Dhuumfire: Fixed a bug that was preventing this trait from properly inflicting burning on use of scourge shroud skills. Unyielding Blast: Fixed a bug that was preventing this trait from properly inflicting vulnerability on use of scourge shroud skills. Spiteful Spirit: The attack caused by this trait now converts 2 additional boons on targets below 50% health. Unholy Martyr: This trait's functionality has changed. It now causes the necromancer to draw up to 5 conditions from 5 allies within a range of 600 to themselves when entering shroud. When exiting shroud, the necromancer consumes up to 3 conditions, converting each condition into 7% life force. Signets of Suffering: This trait now grants the passives for all equipped signets while in shroud, regardless of whether those signets were on recharge prior to entering shroud. Removed 20% recharge reduction. This trait now causes all signets to recharge by 4% each second that shroud is active. Plague Sending: This trait has had its functionality changed. It now causes your first strike after entering shroud to transfer two conditions to your target.\n\nRanger:\n\nIn addition to improving the reliability of some of the new Path of Fire pet attacks, we also did a pass on the soulbeast stances, which we felt needed a bit more tuning. Core ranger is also seeing an increase in the number of targets affected by spirits, which we hope will help ease the burden for raid groups feeling they need to always take two rangers in every group for full coverage. Finally, we are making a big change to Grace of the Land and moving its unique enhancement to be a standardized might gain instead. This trait has been too dominant even after earlier reductions and is providing too much bonus damage to a group from a specialization that is otherwise focused around healing and support. Coupled with changes to the warrior's Phalanx Strength and the deadeye's Fire for Effect traits, we'd like to see more professions that are capable of providing significant amounts of might in group settings.\n\nSoulbeast Rewards: Updated available stat combinations to use Marshal, Viper, and Marauder options. This change will reset your current glove pieces and weapons and will require you to reselect your stat preference.\n\nSkills Beastmode: Mounting while merged will now preserve your state as having been merged so that when you dismount you will instantly reenter Beastmode. Fixed a bug that would temporarily stow a ranger's pet if downed when in the middle of merging. Call of the Wild: This skill now grants its unblockable enhancement to a ranger in Beastmode. Bonfire: Reduced the duration of burning from 2.5 seconds to 2 seconds. Whirling Defense: Increased damage by 15%. \"Guard!\": This skill now grants its enhancements to a ranger in Beastmode. \"Search & Rescue!\": Fixed a bug that prevented this skill from pulling an ally to you and reviving them while in Beastmode. Sharpening Stone: Decreased the duration of bleeding applied from stacks of this skill from 10 seconds to 8 seconds. Water Spirit: Increased the number of targets affected by the Water Spirit from 5 to 10 targets. Frost Spirit: Increased the number of targets affected by the Spirit of Frost from 5 to 10 targets. Sun Spirit: Increased the number of targets affected by the Sun Spirit from 5 to 10 targets. Stone Spirit: Increased the number of targets affected by the Stone Spirit from 5 to 10 targets. Storm Spirit: Increased the number of targets affected by the Storm Spirit from 5 to 10 targets. Spirit of Nature: Increased the number of targets healed each interval from 5 to 10 targets. Seed of Life: Decreased the base heal value of this skill by 18.5%. Increased the healing scaling of this skill by 21.5%. Griffon Stance: Reduced the cooldown of this skill from 45 seconds to 40 seconds. Increased the might granted from evading a strike from 1 stack to 2 stacks. Vulture Stance: Increased the rate your strikes can trigger the hit effects from this skill by 100%. Reduced the duration of might and poison from 6 seconds to 4 seconds. Removed the health threshold component of this skill; this skill now grants might and inflicts poison each strike. Moa Stance: Added regeneration for 8 seconds to the boons granted by this skill. Increased the duration of Moa Stance's effect from 8 seconds to 10 seconds. One Wolf Pack: Increased the rate at which you could cause additional strikes by 100%. Reduced the delay before the additional strike lands from 1 second to 0.5 seconds. Reduced the damage of strikes from this skill by 10%.\n\nPets Rock Gazelle—Headbutt: This skill now moves toward the target during the attack, allowing the pet to track the target better. Rock Gazelle—Charge: Reduced the activation period of this skill by 0.5 seconds and increased the movement speed so that it more frequently travels the indicated range of 900. The gazelle will now move through targets and may hit up to 3 in one charge. Rock Gazelle—Kick: This skill has been sped up considerably and will now start its attacks beginning at 0.5 seconds. Iboga—Consuming Bite: This skill now moves the iboga toward its target and recovers considerably faster between attacks. Wilting Strike: Fixed a bug that prevented this trait from affecting the F2 skills of the rock gazelle, iboga, and jacaranda.\n\nTraits Pack Alpha: Fixed a bug that prevented this trait from affecting the F2 skills of pets from the Path of Fire region. Unstoppable Union: Fixed a bug that prevented this trait from stun breaking when activating Beastmode. Oppressive Superiority: Clarified the description of this trait to explicitly call out the percentile comparison for its bonuses. Leader of the Pack: This trait now increases the duration of stance enhancements applied to the ranger using a stance skill by 50% in addition to its previous effects. Verdant Etching: Decreased the base heal value of the skill activated by this trait by 18.5%. Increased the healing scaling of the skill by 21.5%. Grace of the Land: This trait no longer grants a unique enhancement. It now grants 4 stacks of might for 8 seconds to up to 10 allies in the area of your Celestial Avatar skills.\n\nRevenant:\n\nThe off-hand sword weapon for the revenant had a bit of an identity crisis. While the main-hand sword is primarily an offensive weapon, the off-hand feels like it's trying to be both a defensive and utility weapon at the same time. We're reworking both skills on this weapon to be more accurately positioned as an offensive power option for the off-hand slot. We also took a hard look at the Invocation trait line and removed several of the harder-to-use traits based on energy thresholds. We've replaced them with new traits that reinforce the themes of energy management and legend swapping to strengthen the themes of this line.\n\nRenegade Rewards: Updated available stat combinations to use Celestial, Viper, and Grieving options. This change will reset your current helm pieces and weapons and will require you to reselect your stat preference.\n\nSkills Duelist's Preparation: This skill is no longer available on the revenant's off-hand sword. Shackling Wave: This skill has been reworked and will now deliver up to 5 strikes to random enemies in the area in addition to its initial impact. Immobilize duration has been reduced to 1 second and is increased by 1 second to all targets per target struck. Base damage of this skill has been reduced by 20%. Bonus strikes are equal to 25% of the initial impact each. The cooldown of this skill has been set at 15 seconds, while the energy cost is set at 10. Grasping Shadow: This skill has been renamed to Deathstrike and has a reworked functionality. Activating this skill will now shadowstep the revenant toward their target, up to a range of 600 away, and deliver a strike that chills and slows the foe for 3 seconds while gaining fury. If this attack successfully lands, the revenant will immediately deliver a second attack that deals large damage. The cooldown of this skill is 20 seconds, with the energy cost being 20 as well. Bloodbane Path: Increased the duration of bleeding per strike inflicted by this skill from 7 seconds to 8 seconds. Sevenshot: Increased the duration of torment inflicted per arrow from 4 seconds to 7 seconds. Spiritcrush: Increased the duration of burning inflicted per interval from 2 seconds to 3 seconds. Increased the duration of slow inflicted per interval from 1 second to 1.5 seconds. Heroic Command: Increased the base might granted by this skill per stack of Kalla's Fervor from 1 to 2 stacks. Orders from Above: Increased the duration of alacrity granted by this skill per interval from 1 seconds to 1.5 seconds. Echoing Eruption: Decreased the amount of torment inflicted by this skill from 5 stacks for 10 seconds to 4 stacks for 8 seconds. Fixed a bug that was causing inconsistency with moving toward your target. Fixed a bug that could cause attacks from multiple revenants using this skill to miss a target.\n\nTraits Lasting Legacy: This trait no longer increases your maximum potential stacks of Kalla's Fervor. It now increases the effect of Kalla's Fervor from 30 ferocity and 2% condition damage to 50 ferocity and 3% condition damage, and increases the might granted from Heroic Command per stack of Kalla's Fervor from 2 to 3. Radiant Revival: Fixed a bug that caused the effect applied by this skill to use the wrong icon. Charged Mists: This trait has been reworked. It now grants 25 extra energy to your new legend when you invoke while at or below 10 energy. Shrouded Mists: This trait has been reworked and renamed Song of the Mists, and it causes invoking a legend to cast a skill based on the legend you are invoking. This trait has swapped positions with Roiling Mists. Equilibrium: This trait has been reworked and renamed Spirit Boon and grants a legend-specific boon to yourself and nearby allies when you invoke a new legend. Cruel Repercussion: This trait has been reworked and renamed to Forceful Persistence, and it causes you to deal 7% increased damage while maintaining an upkeep skill. Herald upkeep skills grant a 2% bonus but can be stacked. This trait has swapped positions with Cleansing Channel. Incensed Response: Increased might stacks from 2 to 5. This trait now requires you to be the source of fury in order to gain might.\n\nThief:\n\nThis update for the thief is focused mostly around the deadeye specialization and fixing bugs that were hindering them from reaching their full potential. Fire for Effect has also been simplified slightly, as we felt the range restriction on the second set of might and short radius on might application made this trait difficult to use. This improvement, along with the changes to the warrior's Phalanx Strength and the druid's Grace of the Land, should offer multiple professions the opportunity to grant group might. One important balance change in this update is the change to Unhindered Combatant. While thieves, and by extension daredevils, are intended to be slippery combatants, the escape potential for this trait was a little too high.\n\nSkills Deadeye Stolen Skills: These skills can now be used while jumping or during skills that jump into the air. Fixed a bug that allowed stolen skills to be wasted by casting them on targets other than your mark. Stolen skills will now always be cast on your mark even if your mark is not your current target. Rifle: All rifle skills that fire projectiles will now attempt to face the target before determining if they should activate. Death's Retreat: Updated the description to indicate that this skill shadowsteps away from your current target. Improved the reliability of shadowstep in areas with complex terrain. Death's Judgment: This skill now only deals its bonus damage to your marked target. Updated skill description. Free Action: This skill can now be used to cancel Kneel if the player is sent airborne by an enemy skill. Fixed a bug that could cause this skill to not remove all instances of the listed conditions. Cursed Bullet: Fixed a bug that prevented this skill from working with the Rending Shade trait. Boon steal from Rending Shade occurs before boon corruption. Bandit's Defense: The recharge of this skill has been increased from 15 seconds to 20 seconds. Binding Shadow: This skill now performs a range check before activating. Removed range and line-of-sight restrictions from the delayed attack. Shadow Meld: Fixed a bug that prevented this skill from being recognized as an elite skill for the purposes of some rune effects.\n\nTraits Expeditious Dodger: Swiftness granted by this trait will now occur at the end of the dodge. Unhindered Combatant: Breaking inhibiting conditions with this trait now causes the thief to lose all endurance regeneration for 4 seconds. Direct endurance gains will still apply the full amount. Swiftness granted by this trait will now occur at the end of the dodge. Improvisation: Fixed a bug that prevented this trait from working with ammo skills. It now restores 1 use to affected skills. Renewing Gaze: Updated the text description for clarity. Don't Stop: Removed the erroneous cooldown skill fact. Perfectionist: Updated the description to clarify that boons are only gained when reaching full malice stacks. Gaining malice while at full malice stacks will not trigger this trait. Removed internal cooldown. Fire for Effect: Added a 1-second internal cooldown to this trait. This trait now grants might around the player and the marked target regardless of distance, but it can only grant might to the same target once per activation of the trait. Might applied has been reduced from 10 stacks for 15 seconds to 8 stacks for 12 seconds. Increased might application radius from 240 to 360.\n\nWarrior:\n\nAxe is a warrior weapon that is perhaps more damage focused than any other weapon in the game. However, in some cases it was actually a damage loss to use certain skills. The axe enhancements in this update are intended to make sure that every skill can be a damage increase over autoattacking to properly position the axe as a damage weapon for warriors. We are also normalizing the functionality of Berserker's Stance and Balanced Stance to be shorter with stronger effects, in order to prevent long stretches of stability and resistance chaining. Finally, we are making a reduction to the might duration of Phalanx Strength. This trait is a core component of many raid groups, but we feel that with the increased prevalence of other might sources, the power of this trait needed to come down a little bit in order to allow other options to be considered. We'll be monitoring them all closely and tweaking where necessary.\n\nSkills Cyclone Axe: The physical damage of this skill has been increased by 33%. Throw Axe: This skill now deals 50% more damage if the target is below 50% health, or 100% more damage if the target is below 25% health. Whirling Axe: The physical damage of this skill has been increased by 33%. Throw Bolas: Reduced the ammunition recharge of this skill from 25 seconds to 20 seconds. Balanced Stance: Reduced duration from 8 seconds to 4 seconds. Reduced stability duration from 3 seconds to 1 second. Reduced effect application interval from 3 seconds to 1 second. This skill now makes you immune to critical hits. Berserker's Stance: Reduced duration from 9 seconds to 4 seconds. Increased adrenaline gain per pulse from 3 to 7. Resistance per pulse has been reduced from 3 seconds to 1 second. Reduced recharge from 60 seconds to 30 seconds. Fixed a consistency issue where effect application would sometimes be delayed. Natural Healing: Fixed a bug that caused this skill to remove an incorrect number of boons. Also fixed an issue in which this gave fewer stacks of Attacker's Insight than intended when removing multiple boons. Decapitate: Fixed a bug that caused the shock wave from this skill to fail if the initial attack killed the target. Fixed a bug that caused the shock wave to deal less damage than listed. Fixed a bug that caused the shock wave from this skill to hit fewer than 5 targets. Throw Axe: Fixed a bug that caused this skill to not update its ammo recharge skill fact when equipped with the Axe Mastery trait. Winds of Disenchantment: This skill now has an alternate effect when used by enemies. Full Counter: Increased recharge from 8 seconds to 12 seconds in PvP and WvW only.\n\nTraits Peak Performance: This trait no longer increases the damage of physical skills, but instead increases the warrior's strike damage by 33% (10% in PvP) for 5 seconds whenever a physical skill is used. Phalanx Strength: Might duration granted by this trait has been reduced from 6 seconds to 4 seconds. Revenge Counter: Reduced the number of conditions transferred from 5 to 3 in PvP and WvW only.\n\nStructured Player vs. Player\n\nSeason 9 starts today!\n\nPlayers ranked Platinum 2 (1,600) and above can no longer duo-queue in Ranked matches while seasons are active.\n\nThe following amulets have been added:\n\nAvatar Power, Precision: 1050 Healing, Vitality: 560\n\nGrieving Power, Condition Damage: 1050 Precision, Ferocity: 560\n\nHarrier Power: 1200 Healing, Concentration: 900\n\nMarshal Power, Healing: 1050 Precision, Condition Damage: 560\n\nSwashbuckler Power, Precision: 1050 Condition Damage, Vitality: 560\n\nWizard Power, Condition Damage: 1050 Vitality, Precision: 560\n\nThe following runes have been added:\n\nWeaver\n\nHolosmith\n\nFirebrand\n\nMirage\n\nSoulbeast\n\nDeadeye\n\nRenegade\n\nSpellbreaker\n\nWorld vs. World\n\nGeneral\n\nProofs of Heroics and Testimonies of Heroics can now be used in the PvP lobby.\n\nOil pot range is now 800.\n\nEternal Battlegrounds\n\nOgrewatch Cut has had a large revision.\n\nBLACK LION TRADING COMPANY GEM STORE\n\nNew Items and Promotions\n\nFor a limited time, a new set of Shifting Sands weapon skins are available from the Black Lion Weapons Specialist for 1 Black Lion Claim Ticket.

  "latent_28716": "CLOSE Anthony Mackie discusses his appearance as the winged Avenger named Falcon in this exclusive behind-the-scenes clip from \"Ant-Man.\" Marvel Studios\n\nScott Lang (Paul Rudd) gets to see a new microscopic side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in \"Ant-Man.\" (Photo: Film Frame)\n\nAnt-Man has turned into the little movie that could.\n\nStarring Paul Rudd as shrinking superhero Scott Lang, the Marvel Studios film opened with a $57.2 million debut weekend — pretty good for the cinematic solo debut of a guy not as widely known as Iron Man or Captain America. But it's been a box-office force ever since, finally opening big in China late last month and now holding a worldwide haul of more than $517 million — bigger than both Cap and Thor's first films.\n\n\"Obviously I didn’t want to be the first Marvel movie that tanked, but it was nice,\" says Ant-Man director Peyton Reed. \"I feel like audiences responded to what we were trying to do, which was to do a little bit more of an intimate superhero movie about fathers and daughters.\"\n\nThere's a lot more Ant-Man to come, too. In addition to the movie's release on digital HD platforms and the Disney Movies Anywhere app Nov. 17 and Blu-ray/DVD Dec. 8, Rudd has a supporting role in the next Marvel project Captain America: Civil War (in theaters May 6) and the sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp already has a release date of July 6, 2018. The follow-up would assumably get the band back together with Reed (who's still officially in talks to return), Rudd, Michael Douglas as Scott's mentor/original Ant-Man Hank Pym, and Evangeline Lilly as Hank's daughter Hope van Dyne, who was shown her new Wasp costume during the end-credits scene of Ant-Man.\n\nReed talks with USA TODAY about what fans can look forward to with the in-home release, Ant-Man's meeting with an Avenger and what he has in store for the sequel. (WARNING: Minor spoilers ahead.)\n\nPaul Rudd and Michael Douglas in a scene from \"Ant-Man.\" (Photo: Zade Rosenthal)\n\nYou have a series of deleted and extended scenes on the upcoming digital/Blu-ray release. Were there any that you particularly hated to lose?\n\nThere’s a lot of experimentation that goes on in the cutting room on a movie like this, and one of the things that I said from the beginning was I wanted an Ant-Man that’s under two hours. I wanted it to be really tight. One, because it's a comedy and two, because it’s essentially a heist movie and it had to really move.\n\nThere’s one extended sequence where Scott Lang is pretending to be a cable repair guy and he comes into Hank Pym’s house. It was originally him casing the house before they went in there (to steal the Ant-Man suit) and got into the safe. It was a fun thing because there was a little cat-and-mouse going on with each guy sizing the other one up and it was really fun as a scene. But it started to be a pace killer and we decided there was a much more efficient and fun way for those characters to meet for the first time.\n\nFalcon (Anthony Mackie) makes an appearance in \"Ant-Man.\" (Photo: Zade Rosenthal)\n\nYou have both an Antony — as in Ant-Man’s loyal insect friend — and an Anthony — as in Mackie who plays the winged Avenger Falcon — in the film.\n\nBringing Falcon into the movie really was when Paul Rudd and Adam McKay were starting the rewrites and we were talking about elements that we wanted to add. We were doing a heist movie and one of the tropes is that trial by fire where everything is organized with the heist but, oh, there’s this one piece of technology we don’t have and we have to send our hero into this situation to get it and he might not be fully prepared. It made sense to pit Scott Lang against something or somebody before he was really ready.\n\nWe talked a lot about who it could be and Falcon just felt like the right thing. We all loved Anthony Mackie in (the Captain America sequel) Winter Soldier, and we all loved the idea of Mackie and Rudd squaring off. What would the combination of their two powers be like? It started to feel organic to our movie. Marvel never ever came and said, \"You’ve gotta work Thor into the movie!\" There was none of that stuff. We came to them saying, \"This feels like it could be very very cool.\" And as a kid who grew up reading those comic books, that's the stuff I love.\n\nAlso, Anthony Mackie is very funny in our movie, and I like the idea that Scott Lang is tasked with getting this piece of equipment, he’s got to come up against the Falcon but he’s also a fanboy so he’s kind of apologizing when he’s fighting him.\n\nAnt-Man (Paul Rudd) rides his loyal insect steed Antony. (Photo: Film Frame)\n\nIn terms of Antony, the ants were an ever-evolving thing in the move. In any Ant-Man comic, the ants are really important and it was a huge challenge to visualize the ants and make them all very dictinct. As we were working on the script, we really liked the idea of focusing on one specific ant that maybe Pym had just sort of numbered and was just like all the other ants but that Scott had a Lone Ranger/Trigger relationship with, like it was his trusty steed.\n\nAnd then the further we got into it, the more we liked the idea of this sacrifice – could we get an emotional reaction from an audience in a movie called Ant-Man from an ant dying? It started to intrigue us. Everybody steps on ants everyday, but this really appealed to us, me particularly, and we were really able to pull it off. It’s a weird little tragic moment.\n\nThere’s a couple of moms who have written and said, \"My son is distraught about Antony dying. Can you please just tell me, did he really die?\" And I could have said, \"Well, he did die. Maybe now’s a good time to explain to your child that sometimes there are casualties. \"But what I actually said was the average lifespan of an ant is something like 12 weeks, so he was probably going to die pretty soon anyway.\n\nPaul Rudd and Michael Douglas in a scene from \"Ant-Man.\" (Photo: Zade Rosenthal)\n\nWas it in your wildest imagination while filming that there might be a sequel, or were you not even going there?\n\nBoth actually. It was in my wildest imagination but you can’t ever do a movie going into it thinking, \"Oh, we’re going to have two or three more of these movies to finish telling the story!\" This movie had to have a beginning, middle and end, and with or without the costume, Ant-Man is also very much Hope van Dyne’s origin story because she has to learn to make peace with her father and she’s an incredibly powerful character in that movie – way more qualified than even Scott Lang is to take that job.\n\nWe knew it would be incredibly satisfying to introduce her getting the costume because she so deserves it. Part of the arc between Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne is Hank realizing, I’ve got this incredibly capable person right here and I’m finally realizing what I thought was protecting her has really been holding her back. And he rewards her with this suit. It felt satisfying in the moment but of course everybody wants to see Evangeline in the outfit — me being one of them — and a kickass hero.\n\nCLOSE An exclusive trailer for the in-home release of the superhero film \"Ant-Man.\" Disney/Marvel\n\nWas “It’s about damn time” always her last line in the end-credits scene or did you consider others?\n\nIt was always the last line in that scene, yeah. We had some slightly different positioning for that scene at one point in the edit, but it said it all, about her character and about the larger context of female heroes.\n\nHope van Dyne's new Wasp suit will play a key role in the upcoming sequel \"Ant-Man and the Wasp.\" (Photo: Film Frame)\n\nAre you starting work on the sequel soon?\n\nThere are a couple of things I'm developing before then. I doubt I will shoot a movie before we start developing the sequel, but I think in the next month or two we’ll start hashing out the outline for Ant-Man and the Wasp, which is really, really exciting.\n\nYou were excited to sign on to do the first one back at 2014's Comic-Con. Are you just bonkers to get to do another one?\n\nI’m doubly excited. We’re going to do some very, very different things in the next movie and we’ve set up stuff in the first movie that we can have a lot of fun with in the second movie and go both bigger and smaller at the same time.\n\nI’m sure people want to see Giant-Man run across the screen at some point. Maybe just show his feet.\n\n(Laughs) That’s the thing about Hank Pym and Scott Lang in the comics. There’s so much stuff — there’s like 50 years of source material to choose from, so we’re being smart about what we’re going to do with the movie. But there’s some very weird stuff in store for these characters.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1NO8hBo",
  "latent_28956": "Croatian citizen Tomislav Salopek has been beheaded by ISIS, according to photos published by the group on social media. The pictures were uploaded on the morning of August 12 but it’s unclear exactly when the execution took place. The 31-year-old had been held by the group since July 22 when he was kidnapped close to Cairo, Egypt. His death, ISIS says, was due to Croatia’s role in the war against the Islamic State.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\n1. Gruesome Photos Showed Salopek’s Decapitated Body\n\nIn a previous video featuring Salopek, it was said that Salopek would die unless Egypt released “muslim women” from jail in 48 hours from the clip’s appearance. Salopek was shown in a yellow jumpsuit, kneeling down in front of a masked knife-wielding terrorist. The clip of Salopek begging for his life has been removed from YouTube due to a violation of the site’s terms of service. The video was released on August 5. The photos of Salopek were verified by the terrorism watchdog SITE Intel.\n\nIn the images released by ISIS, there are two photoshopped insets from Egyptian newspapers, one highlighting Croatia’s support for Egypt in the War on Terror, the other Croatia’s support of Kurdish rebels. The Independent reports that the Egyptian interior ministry has not yet confirmed Salopek’s death and was working to confirm the authenticity of the photos. The Croatian foreign ministry said the same though the BBC reports that the country’s prime minister is preparing a statement on the execution. A spokesman for Salopek’s employers said “we fear the the worst,” reports the Associated Press.\n\n2. He Was the First Civilian Hostage to Be Taken by ISIS in Egypt\n\nSalopek had been working in Cairo, the Egyptian capital, as a surveyor for the French company CGG. Reuters reported two days after he was taken that his car was stopped by militants while Salopek was traveling to work. The specific group responsible for his capture were ISIS-Egyptian offshoot Wilyat Sina. He’s the first civilian to be taken hostage by the group.\n\nIn a brief statement, CGG said “His car was stopped by an armed group who forced the driver to leave the car and then took off in an unknown direction.” General Geoscience (CGG) specializes in the exploration and production of gas and oil. Al Arabiya reports that Salopek’s kidnapping “rattled foreigners working for multinational companies and underscored the jihadists’ reach.”\n\n3. The Family of One Female Islamist Prisoner Expressed Their Disgust at Salopek’s Death\n\nSpeaking to the Associated Press, Doaa el-Taweel, sister of Esraa el-Taweel, who has been in an Egyptian prison for two months, referred to “the life of an innocent man who is not responsible for … (Egyptian government) detainees …” In an open letter in July 2015, el-Taweel wrote about her arrest. She’s accused of being a member of the banned Muslim Brotherhood. She said, “I spent 15 days at the national security premises, listening to interrogations, hearing sounds of torture, and men crying loudly…I was the only lady there, fifteen days with my eyes were covered.”\n\n4. He Was Experienced With Working in the Middle East\n\nAccording to LinkedIn, Salopek worked in Iraq from 2012-2013, living in Kurdistan. His page says that he’s been with CGG since December 2014 having previously worked for Nageco in Libya. Prior to that, Salopek spent a year working in the Czech Republic for a different company. On his LinkedIn, Salopek states that he’s fluent in English and has basic Arabic.\n\nOn his Facebook page he’s shown to be married to a woman named Natasa. The couple have two young children, a boy and a girl, together. They live in the western part of the country. He married his wife in November 2007.\n\n5. ISIS Wants Muslims in the Balkan Countries to Rise Up & Enforce Sharia Law\n\nCNN reported in February 2015 that Croatia was considered a part of the coalition to battle ISIS. Also in the coalition are Croatia’s neighbors Serbia and the predominantly Muslim country of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In July 2015, an ISIS video encouraged Muslims in the Balkan countries to take up arms and establish Sharia Law in the region. Meanwhile in March 2014, Brown Moses reported that ISIS had taken control and was using Croatian weaponry the group hijacked from convoys meant for the Free Syrian Army.",
  "latent_29041": "Away from the glare of arch-lights, Leonardo DiCaprio is enjoying a romantic date with India. The Wolf of Wall Street actor, who was reportedly in the country to shoot for a documentary film on climate change, took time out to visit Taj Mahal on Saturday morning.\n\nHis entire schedule was kept under wraps. “He reached Taj around 7.15 am and left around 9:30 am on Saturday. He was wearing a cap, black sunglasses to conceal his identity and was surrounded by bodyguards, who donned an all-black look. They were trying hard to keep the visit low-key. Whenever someone tried to get close to DiCaprio or tried to click his photographs, the people were asked to leave him alone,” said a person present at the monument.\n\nThe three-time Academy Award nominee, who has shared screen space with Indian megastar Amitabh Bachchan in The Great Gatsby, even hired an Indian guide to help him understand the culture.\n\nHollywood film actor and environmentalist, Leonardo DiCaprio took a walk in the gardens of the Taj Mahal. (AFP)\n\nNarrating an incident,a source said: “There was one foreigner, who identified the Hollywood star and approached him, but the bodyguards came forward and said ‘No photographs. Go’“.\n\nThe actor, who enjoys a wide fan base around the globe including India, was not alone. He was with his mother, other family members and a still photographer. “He roamed inside and around the vicinity and then sat in golf cart and went out. There was a still photographer, who was clicking his photographs,” the source said.\n\nRead: This is why Leo was in India\n\nEveryone associated with his trip to India has been asked to maintain distance from the media and refrain from doling out any information. “He admired the monument to the fullest and fell in love with its story. He was here with his mother and is in India to shoot a documentary. He wanted to explore the whole vicinity of the monument before it started getting crowded, so that he can click photographs,” the source said.\n\nThe actor left for Delhi after his visit to the monument, one of the seven Wonders of the World. The Hollywood actor has been named the United Nations Messenger of Peace on Climate Change.\n\nIt is reported that DiCaprio was in the country to profile Sunita Narain of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) for an untitled, yet-to-be-announced documentary film on climate change that will “explore the crisis of our time in a way that has never been done before”. The actor reportedly reached India on Thursday and left on Saturday.\n\nNarain had earlier said, “I have been in touch with the filmmakers for the past year about their plans to make a film on climate change. They wanted me to particularly talk about our concerns about the need for ambition and equity in climate negotiations.”\n\nFirst Published: Nov 01, 2015 15:03 IST",

  "latent_29439": "This article is over 1 year old\n\nChairman Peter Coates says company’s plan is ‘consistent with good value’, but experts call it ‘a breathtaking failure to come to grips with a world in transition’\n\nThe oil and gas company Santos has admitted its business plans are based on a climate change scenario of a 4C rise n global temperatures, at odds with internationally agreed efforts.\n\nIts chairman, Peter Coates, made the comments at an AGM in Adelaide on Thursday, telling shareholders it was “sensible” and “consistent with good value”.\n\nEarlier this week, the Australian National University, which previously divested from Santos citing a commitment to its renewables research, appeared to have reinvested in the company.\n\nThere has been a shareholder push for a resolution that Santos disclose its climate risk assessments and scenario analyses.\n\nClimate change impact on Australia may be irreversible, five-yearly report says Read more\n\nAsked whether the analyses were conducted on a 2C pathway, Coates replied that the company had adopted a 4C pathway.\n\n“It’s in comparison to the [International Energy Agency] business-as-usual forecast on carbon emissions,” Coates said.\n\n“There’s been no nationally determined commitment to the 2C scenario, and even the 4C scenario is not funded. So I think what we’re doing is very sensible, and consistent with good value.”\n\nWill Steffen, councillor with the Climate Council, and an emeritus professor at ANU, said Coates’s revelation was “absolutely appalling”.\n\n“[A 4C pathway] really is a worst-case scenario,” he told Guardian Australia. “This is not some minor climatic blip we need to deal with. It’s a completely different climate system.”\n\nSteffen said the difference between the ice age and the Holocene age, which Earth has been in for about 12,000 years, was 4C. “You’d be locking in tens of metres of sea-level rise, and you can forget about the world cities,” he said.\n\nIn 2015 Shell was accused of pursuing a business strategy based on 4C warming, which experts have said would lead to catastrophic climate change, including a devastating impact on world food production and the finance market.\n\nThe Paris climate agreement, which came into effect late last year, sets a target of carbon emissions that would mean a global temperatures rise of no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThere have already been warnings from UN agencies that current government pledges to cut emissions would only hold it to 3C – well beyond what climate scientists consider the limit of safety.\n\nDaniel Gocher, an analyst for Market Forces who attended the Santos meeting and pushed for the resolution, said Santos had breached the trust of its investors.\n\n“Two degrees means they’re serious about climate change. That’s what governments around the world agreed to in Paris. Four degrees means business as usual and that means they’re not taking it seriously.”\n\nGocher said Santos had effectively displayed climate denialism, and “a breathtaking failure to come to grips with a world in transition”.\n\nApra says companies must factor climate risks into business outlook Read more\n\nAt the meeting Coates also said there was no gas shortage, but there was a “policy shortage”, and he accused the federal government of not showing commitment and support for the development of an ongoing supply to the east coast, the ABC reported.\n\nThe Australian National University has apparently bought back into Santos after controversially divesting its shares in 2014, Guardian Australia can reveal.\n\nIn October 2014 ANU divested from about $16m worth of shares in seven fossil fuel companies. The vice chancellor, Ian Young, said at the time the ANU was a major environment and alternative energy researcher and had to “be able to say that we’re confident that the sort of companies that we’re investing in are consistent with the broad themes that drive this university”.\n\nThe university was blasted by Coalition MPs and ministers, and in the media. Eighteen months later it also faced criticism from its own staff and students for not divesting the remaining estimated $45m it still had in the resource sector.\n\nHowever according to ANU disclosures, it appears the university has since bought back into at least four of the seven companies.\n\nA report on its 2016 investments, which totalled more than $326m, listed dozens of companies including Santos, Sandfire, Oil Search, and Newcrest Mining - all previously divested under its socially responsible investment policy, adopted in July 2013.\n\n“As a result of that policy, we don’t invest in companies whose primary business is coal, gambling, tobacco or pornography, and we have taken steps to reduce the carbon intensity of our portfolio,” an ANU spokesman told Guardian Australia.\n\nIn October 2015 the university appointed an external portfolio manager. ANU’s website said it made no decision itself about stock selection, but had placed conditions on the manager’s decisions, including that investments:\n\nFor a horrible glimpse into Australia's dark future, look to Trump's views on coal | Ketan Joshi Read more\n\nexclude companies that derive more than 20% of revenues from coal, gambling, tobacco or pornography;\n\nhold a portfolio with 25% less carbon intensity than the S&P/ASX 200;\n\nensure that the portfolio demonstrates a 10% improvement in the overall environment, social, governance (ESG) rating relative to the benchmark.\n\n“These conditions were imposed on the external manager to decrease the university’s investment exposure to CO2-intensive industries without increasing the university’s exposure to volatility in the equities market,” it said.\n\n“If this balance was not managed, it might adversely impact the university’s financial stability, including its ability to meet obligations to pay superannuation liabilities.”\n\nThe spokesman said an April meeting of the ANU council decided to make the report public in the interest of transparency.\n\nMatt Rogers of Fossil Free ANU welcomed the “step forward in disclosure” with the list’s publication, but criticised the reinvestment. “It fails to acknowledge the political dimensions of the issue and fails to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for their climate change obstructionism and blatant disregard for environment,” he said.\n\nGocher said ANU’s move was “strange”. “If they were going to get back into a fossil fuel company, Santos wouldn’t be it,” he said.\n\nTom Swann, a researcher at the Australia Institute, said there was some progress shown by ANU’s report, including the investment disclosure itself, a commitment to proxy voting which could lead to pressure on the university to vote for companies to avoid resource projects like Adani, and a big investment in a Victorian windfarm.\n\n“I do think they’ve gone further than previously - but it is still concerning that they reinvested and didn’t tell anyone,” he told Guardian Australia. “I think there will be backlash. People on the ANU campus and the thousands that came out in support of them when they were being bullied will feel a bit betrayed by this.”\n\nSwann said there was a “broader lesson” about ethical investing for universities.\n\n“Clear policies, clear principles, and need to communicate really clearly about what you’re doing.”",
  "latent_29588": "Did food prices cause the Arab Spring? Will food and water be at the core of future protests against fundamental inequities in the world?\n\nThis study, released this month by the New England Complex Systems Institute, certainly suggests so. Examining data from 1990 to the present, researchers Marco Lagi, Karla Bertrand, and Yaneer Bar-Yam have found a striking correlation between global food prices and numerous uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East. This year’s revolutions in Egypt and Libya are the most recent examples of such conflicts, the researchers warn, but they certainly won’t be the last.\n\nTheir essential theory is fundamentally simple, and can be summarized as follows:\n\nHumans count on governments to maintain a baseline level of security for themselves and their families. Adequate, accessible food supply is one component of security, and likewise, an effective food infrastructure is generally regarded as a government responsibility. Poor countries, which historically relied upon subsistence agriculture, are, as a result of globalization, increasingly dependent on world-girdling supply chains. As long as food is coming in through international trade, and is affordable, many populations will tolerate even the most despotic of dictators. However, when prices get too high, often as a consequence of the global marketplace, an oppressed population can quickly move toward insurgency.\n\nThe explanation here is somewhat straightforward:\n\nif you and your family are facing imminent starvation, risking your life to try to overthrow an entrenched government becomes a far more realistic option, because you have nothing to lose. When enough people are hungry enough for this logic to become widespread, you have yourself a revolution.\n\nWhile logical in its own right, this theory has been bolstered by dramatic evidence in the past few years, as Lagi et al demonstrate. In 2008, more than 60 food riots took place in 30 different countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East. As the researchers explain, a concomitant spike in global food prices accompanied—and probably precipitated—this spike in worldwide violence. Accordingly, the relative decrease in global food prices in 2009-10 accompanied a comparable lull in food-related protests. However, by late 2010, prices were once again on the rise, and lo and behold, 2011 has experienced a comparable spike in food riots, and, in North Africa and the Middle East, a series of full-on revolutions—the so-called “Arab Spring.”\n\nAs the researchers’ data displays, the probability that the Arab Spring had nothing to do with the simultaneous spike in food prices is highly improbable (p < 0.06, considering the 1990-2011 period). Indeed, the ‘nothing to lose’ logic helps explain the motivation to finally uproot such longstanding autocrats as Hosni Mubarak and Muammar Qaddafi.\n\nThe report, while primarily descriptive, also has a prescriptive component for the future.\n\nIn the absence of large-scale intervention, food prices will again reach the so-called “threshold of instability,” above which widespread violence is likely, by summer 2012, or latest, spring 2013, if inflation estimates are taken into account. Likewise, the study’s researchers advocate widespread government action, such as halting subsidies for ethanol production (which consumes large quantities of corn), and more careful regulation of commodities markets.\n\nAnd what if food prices, next time they ‘bubble,’ don’t come down anytime soon? If we are to trust commodities expert and philanthropist Jeremy Grantham, they very well may not. According to Grantham, who was featured for his ecological-minded efforts in the New York Times this month, future price hikes of such products as corn and soybeans may reflect a larger paradigm shift that’s taking place.\n\n“From now on, price pressure and shortages of resources will be a permanent feature of our lives,” he contends. “The world is using up its natural resources at an alarming rate, and this has caused a permanent shift in their value. We all need to adjust our behavior to this new environment. It would help if we did it quickly.”\n\nA paradigm shift in food prices could also, we might extrapolate, mean a broader increase in violence in the developing world in the near future. Lagi et al submitted an earlier report to the US government, back in December 2010, warning of impending violence due to food prices in the crisis-battered global economy—and four days later, the first of the past year’s long series of food riots began in Tunisia.\n\nIt’s not surprising, therefore, that the researchers declare it completely possible to identify the conditions for violence before violence occurs. The problem, however, is getting policy makers to listen to the experts on the need for preemptive action. As the researchers explain,\n\nOur predictions are conditional on the circumstances, and thus allow for policy interventions to change them. Whether policy makers will act depends on the various pressures that are applied to them, including both the public and special interests.\n\nWe have been warned.\n\nGRAPHIC: http://viviansalama.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bread-egypt.jpg\n\nWhere else do you see journalism of this quality and value?

  "latent_29735": "The proposed Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”), unveiled by Speaker Paul D. Ryan in early March and now making its way through the House with the support of President Donald J. Trump, has few fervent supporters but countless critics, from the AARP to the conservative Freedom Caucus. The U.S. Catholic bishops have also been wary of the proposal, and the Catholic Health Association has opposed it outright.\n\nOne Catholic member of Congress, Rep. Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts, called the proposal “an act of malice,” ridiculing Mr. Ryan’s characterization of the bill as an “act of mercy.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“With all due respect to our speaker, he and I must have read different Scripture,” Mr. Kennedy said at a meeting of one of the House committees considering the bill. “The one that I read calls on us to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the homeless and to comfort the sick. It reminds us that we are judged not by how we treat the powerful but by how we care for the least among us.”\n\nThe A.C.A. is flawed in many ways, especially the way it was rolled out without due regard for questions of religious liberty, but the Republican replacement, called the American Health Care Act, seriously tests many principles of Catholic social teaching.\n\nThe Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church mentions health care as a human right alongside food, housing, work, education and transportation (No. 166). Pope Francis has also been vocal about access to health care, especially with regard to how the poor are treated. “Health is not a consumer good but a universal right, so access to health services cannot be a privilege,” the pope said during a meeting with members, volunteers and supporters of Doctors with Africa in May.\n\nThe proposed changes to the health care system exacerbate rather than ease social inequities.\n\nThe plan is still under review by the Congressional Budget Office, which provides official nonpartisan numbers for Congress, but other organizations have begun to cast their own predictions. The Brookings Institute predicts that the C.B.O. “will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the ten-year scoring window.” An analysis by the rating agency Standard & Poor predicted that “about 6 million to 10 million people will lose health insurance if the bill passes, including 2 million to 4 million currently enrolled in the individual health insurance market, and 4 million to 6 million currently enrolled in Medicaid.” The Compendium identifies “those without health care” among the poor who must be given preferential treatment when making decisions, on a structural or personal level (No. 182).\n\nFurther, the proposed changes to the health care system exacerbate rather than ease social inequities. The new tax credits for buying insurance, which would replace the A.C.A.’s subsidies and tax credits, range from $2,000 to $4,000 per year, depending on age. But they are “flat”—that is, not tied to need—and so lower-income households would lose financial support. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, for example, that a 40-year-old making $20,000 per year would be eligible for $4,143 in premium tax credits under the current system (in addition to A.C.A. subsidies he may receive to lower the cost of his monthly premiums) but only $3,000 under the Republican plan. He would also lose the A.C.A.’s current tax credits to help with out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles and co-payments.\n\nSimilarly, the new tax credits do not take into account the costs of policies in individual markets, so they would be less valuable in places (predominantly rural areas) where there is little competition in the insurance market and where premiums are higher.\n\nThe plan would also freeze Medicaid enrollment in 2020 and cap federal funding per enrollee, based on how much each state was spending in 2016. Vox estimates that the changes amount to ”a $370 billion cut to federal funding to Medicaid over 10 years,” with states unlikely to pick up much of the reduction. And the law would allow states to drop Medicaid coverage of mental health treatment, including drug addiction—another case of reducing care for the most vulnerable in society.\n\nWhile the Republican plan keeps the requirement that insurance companies cover people with pre-existing conditions, it allows companies to levy a 30 percent surcharge on premiums for one year for anyone who has a 63-day “break” in coverage. Given that many such gaps occur because someone has lost a job or has faced an unexpected expense—such as repairing a car needed to get to work—it is cruel to penalize families who try to do the responsible thing and resume paying for insurance.\n\nJust as disturbing as the details of the plan is the rhetoric used to justify cutting health care for the most needy. Mr. Ryan calls his bill “an act of mercy,” even though the most comfortable will benefit the most, in the form of both tax cuts and tax credits. He seems scandalized by the notion that \"The people who are healthy pay for the people who are sick,” though that is not only the whole point of insurance but also a bedrock of a compassionate society. One congressman, arguing for the elimination of requirements that all health insurance cover certain treatment, complains about having to help pay for prenatal care—a far cry from a truly pro-life position.\n\nOthers have waved away the need for adequate health care by misrepresenting Jesus’ observation that “the poor will always be with us” or by saying that people could afford health care on their own if only they gave up supposed luxuries like smart phones. As Stephen Pimpare wrote in The Washington Post, echoing Pope Francis’ comments on donating money to the homeless: “Why do we begrudge people struggling to get by the occasional indulgence? Why do we so little value pleasure and joy? Why do we insist that if you are poor, you should also be miserable? Why do we require penitence?”",

  "latent_30071": "The 2016 Presidential election was about creative destruction, pitting one candidate, Hillary Clinton, who stood for continuing down the same path that our nation had been on since George H.W. Bush’s election in 1988, against Donald Trump, who promised to rethink everything.\n\n“Creative destruction” is the term MIT economist Joseph Schumpeter used to describe the capitalist process where business constantly seeks product and process upgrades that result in the development of new and improved ways of doing things and new products that drive out the old and outdated ones.\n\nDonald Trump’s first 100 days should be judged on whether he is successfully generating the creative destruction the voters demanded. By any standard, he is doing just that.\n\nThe Supreme Court nomination and confirmation of Neil Gorsuch has set the stage for a complete rebooting of the nation’s court system.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s quixotic insistence on denying the extremely well-qualified Gorsuch the votes to achieve cloture resulted in the complete elimination of the judicial filibuster.\n\nThis single change will allow Trump to not only appoint hundreds of lower level federal judges without input from the Senate minority, but possibly fill three additional Supreme Court seats, defining the judiciary for generations. It is quite possible that if the President does nothing else but fill the judiciary with constitutional constructionists, he will be the most consequential president of the first half of the 21stcentury.\n\nDonald Trump’s budget is equally transformational. In proposing the elimination of agencies like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities, Trump is signaling that his administration will end government payments to organizations that could be better supported by the private sector.\n\nWhile many conservatives would prefer that the debate be on the proper role of government, this president is simply saying that programs that force middle class taxpayers to fund upper class wants should end. This isn’t about Robert Mapplethorpe and the like. It’s just a practical business decision that New York and Hollywood elites can support these priorities without forcing the people of the flyover states (who they despise) to pay the freight.\n\nOn the economic front, Trump is deconstructing much of Obama’s pen and phone activism with a clear focus on regulations that harm growth. Utilizing the Congressional Review Act process, Congress has passed and the President has signed eleven bills rescinding midnight regulations promulgated in the waning days of the Obama administration.\n\nAs a result, domestic energy production will increase, small and mid-sized businesses won’t be strangled with additional paperwork, and federal government encroachment on state powers over wildlife management, education and drug testing for government assistance recipients is dramatically restricted.\n\nEnergy development, a key to robust economic growth, has been freed up due to the approvals of the Keystone XL pipeline and Dakota Access pipeline, providing less expensive ways to get oil from Canada and the Bakken Oil fields to refineries. The move to end the coal-industry-killing Clean Power Plant rules will stop the shutdown of coal fired utilities, while new competition between natural gas and coal will force efficiencies in both industries, ensuring reliable low-cost power for a generation.\n\nAnd perhaps most consequentially, Trump has re-ordered how the United States is going to interact with the rest of the world.\n\nBy exiting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Trump is resetting what it means to be a trade partner with the United States. His Labor Department, working with the Customs Bureau, can be expected to target goods made in places where slave and child labor are encouraged. If you want to end the use of slave labor, why not make it harder to sell those goods in the United States, rather than rewarding these nations with better tariff rates? That is transformational.\n\nTrump has also already met with Chinese Premier Xi Jingping, and, along with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, has softened the administration’s stance on China’s currency manipulation. At the same time, China is taking a much more assertive role in attempting to end the North Korean nuclear threat before they develop the capacity to destroy Seoul, Tokyo, Hawaii or the western continental United States. Make no mistake, Trump’s anti-Chinese currency manipulation rhetoric set the table for China to ratchet up the pressure on North Korea, because it gave the United States government something valuable to trade for Chinese help.\n\nFinally, since January 20th, Trump has begun to assert his America first foreign policy, changing relationships for the better through key meetings with the leaders of Japan, Great Britain, Germany, and Canada, as well as having his Secretary of State meet with his Russian counterpart as well as Vladimir Putin in Moscow.\n\nCreative destruction is not easy and there will be stumbling blocks along the way, particularly when it comes to draining the swamp in Washington, as government -- unlike natural free markets -- lives in symbiosis with businesses whose livelihoods are impacted by its decisions.\n\nThe groaning and complaining about the Trump Administration among establishment voices on both the left and the right can largely be attributed to the uncomfortable movement of these swamp creatures as they are being knocked off their moorings, uncertain about what will happen next — a key attribute of creative destruction at work.\n\nWhat more could a Trump voter want?",

The velodrome found in Penrose Park is one of only 27 bicycling velodromes in the United States found listed on the VelodromeShop.net website. Built in 1962, with a resurfacing occurring in the 1980s, and minor repairs in the mid-aughts, the track’s rough surface helps it earn its nickname, “Mr. Bumpy Face.”\n\nA seemingly more ambitious plan was proposed and published on NextSTL in 2013. According to 24th Ward Alderman Scott Ogilvie, The Saint Louis City Parks and Public Works departments evaluated options for the track and settled on a repair of the existing blacktop, an ultra-thin white-topping of the concrete oval, the striping of the lanes, and some infield drainage work.\n\nUltra-thin white-topping is a relatively new reconstruction or rehabilitation process for failed asphalt surfaces. Most concrete crews gain experience with this process when re-surfacing parking lots. Matt Poirot, the Chief Construction Engineer with the city’s Board of Public Service, explained that the City of Saint Louis, their consultant, the contractors, and the Concrete Council of St. Louis will all work together to address any special considerations that might arise given the steep slopes and unique use case of the velodrome.\n\nThe process has been bid out with the lower end of the bids, per Alderman Ogilvie’s Facebook post, coming in at $655,000 for this less ambitious scope of work. Mr. Poirot told NextSTL that the winning bid for the construction phase has yet to be selected.\n\nThe city had previously committed to $635,000, so the group is now starting a push to gather the remaining funds from private donors. To that end, the group has started a GoFundMe.com page seeking donations to bridge the gap in funding for the repairs.",

At least one of the thieves was said to be wearing a Dayton letter jacket.\n\nOne female UD student living in Marycrest posted this Twitter message afterward:\n\n“The best advice I’ve ever gotten was from the two black guys I woke up to breaking into my room — ‘maybe U should lock ur door next time,’…Thnx”\n\nEarly Sunday morning Miller realized something was amiss.\n\n“Word got to me by 8:30 or 9 that morning that something was going on,” the still-dazed coach recalled Thursday afternoon. “It was a weekend incident that occurred after we’d left the bus. Bits and pieces came in since then and once we put enough of them together, the decision was simple … and unanimous.\n\nHe said he, school president Dr. Dan Curran and athletics director Tim Wabler agreed Scott and Robinson had to go — immediately.\n\nScott and Robinson — juniors from Columbus Northland High School — have been in trouble before in their UD careers.\n\nWednesday afternoon when he first announced the stunning turn of events, Miller made it clear neither player has a chance of returning to the Flyers program.\n\nThe quickness and severity of the punishment hints at the heinousness of the acts.\n\nIf the allegations are true, the thefts show a true disdain for their fellow students who they looked at as marks rather than equals who routinely cheer them and wish them luck.\n\nScott was the starting center and one of the captains of the team. He averaged 9.1 points and a team-high 7.4 rebounds a game.\n\nRobinson was a much-used backup who averaged 3.2 points and 2.4 rebounds for the 7-2 Flyers.\n\nThe pair’s alleged actions hurt not only the victims, but the university as a whole, the fans, and coaches and especially the other players, who are on a team that already had a thin roster and now has no one over 6-foot-6.\n\n“Right now I’m just numb,” Miller said as he sat in his office. “You go through all the emotions. You’re very upset. You get down. And at the same time you get very, very serious because you understand this has impacted a lot of people.\n\n“It’s just so hard to believe. Everybody is taken aback. As coaches, we spend more time with these guys than we do our own kids. And as for the other players, when you’re in the locker room every day with the other guys, you can’t help but care about them.\n\n“That’s why everybody is saying the same thing: ‘Why?’\n\n“Why would this happen right now? It just doesn’t make sense. We’re on the bus talking about sticking together, moving in the right direction and then this happens.”\n\nScott was having his best semester in the classroom and his best season on the court. After the spring incident, he seemed to have straightened up his life, was dedicated to his 10-month-old son and had appeared to take seriously his role as captain.\n\nSeveral people around UD and in the community had stood by him during past troubles because they believed he was salvageable.\n\n“Both of these guys had people bending over backward at all times to give them not only help. but advice,” Miller said. “But when someone doesn’t want to be helped, at the end of the day they won’t be helped and then they’ll suffer the consequences.\n\n“This is a life-altering moment for a lot of people here and, unfortunately in this situation, two young guys are going to wake up one day and say, ‘Wow, where’d it all go?’ ”\n\nOther Flyers over the years have run into trouble during the season. One player a few years back stole his roommate’s credit card and bought gifts for his girlfriend at the campus bookstore. Another player feigned an abduction by an armed man and ended up driving to Texas. Most recently, Matt Kavanaugh was suspended for a year from school for a sexual encounter with a female student.\n\nThis incident comes out of nowhere. The team had created so much good will with last year’s Elite Eight run, in part because the players seemed like such great representatives of their school and community.\n\nNow the rest of the Flyers are left to pick up the pieces.\n\n“One thing I’ve learned is that young people are resilient,” Miller said. “As much as you think they are really affected by things, they tend to recover really quickly. And we have some very tough-minded guys who will band together.\n\n“When I was a player, I always said it didn’t matter if we had five guys, six or seven on the team. As long as I got to play, I was ready to go.\n\n“Now more avenues will open up and more guys will step up and be better players.”\n\nAs for the two guys who got the boot, I think back to a conversation I had with Scott just last week.\n\nWe were talking about his son, who came to many of the games.\n\n“My son knows what I do,” he said. “I think he really likes it.”\n\nIf he could speak, the boy might not be able to say that now.",
  "latent_30318": "Tax Credits For Low-Carbon Individuals & Businesses\n\nDecember 24th, 2015 by Sponsored Content\n\nHow can they partner to electrify transport?\n\nHow can they partner to switch to clean electricity sources?\n\nHow can they partner to get more people in transit and on bikes?\n\nHow can they partner to cut energy use?\n\nHow can they partner to reduce emissions from livestock?\n\nThere’s a simple answer to some of these questions: have governments create policies that reward individuals and businesses with tax credits when they consume and act in ways that produce less carbon.\n\nFor example, you don’t have to reduce emissions from livestock only, because you can reduce meat and animal products consumption by giving tax credits to consumers who eat more plants and less meat. The consumers would need to document their food purchases, and that might be inconvenient and even annoying initially, but eventually some people would change their behavior because they would want to save money on their taxes. Imagine if you could save $150 a year by having a mostly vegetarian or vegan diet. (There could obviously be some health benefits at the individual and societal levels.)\n\nSimilarly, purchasing and driving ULEVs, PZEVs, hybrids, and EVs should not only get tax credits upon the initial purchase, but for every year they are driven.\n\nMost interestingly – how about a tax credit for those people who do not own any vehicles and use public transportation, ride a bike or walk? Some of these people don’t have much money, so they might be able to well utilize such a tax break, and they may as well be rewarded for not polluting as much as some other citizens. One of my former co-workers did not drive a car for 30 years, and not surprisingly, she saved tens of thousands of dollars. Why should someone like that not also be given a small tax credit every year?\n\nFor people who do own vehicles and drive themselves, how about using the car’s odometer and something like a smart meter that documents the number of miles driven, and then transmits that information to the IRS, or adds it to the IRS form that will be submitted so that vehicle owners who drive less than 10,000 miles or kilometers a year receive some tax credit for that?\n\nThere could also be a tiered system, so if you drive less than 5,000 miles or kilometers you receive an even greater benefit. It might also work to reduce vehicle registration fees for vehicle owners that only drive a certain number of miles each year or less. So, for a person who drove less than 10,000 miles in a year, there could be a 15% reduction in the vehicle registration fee. (This is just a hypothetical example.)\n\nA similar kind of incentive could be created for homeowners who consume the least amount of electricity. If they are below a certain number of kilowatt-hours per year and that is documented by their utility, they can receive a reduction in property tax.\n\nAdditionally, for state tax reporting sometimes there is an option when taxes are filed electronically, to donate money for various charitable causes like cancer research or wildlife conservation.\n\nAn option for carbon offsetting could be added, so it would be very easy for a tax filer to select $10 or more for tree planting in order to help offset the amount of carbon that she or he generated that year. If this option were available at that point in the filing process, there would be more visibility for the low-carbon lifestyle.\n\nOf course, these suggestions are hypothetical only – if carbon tax credits were actually implemented the details might be very different, but just like creative financing that happens sometimes for renewable energy projects to make them happen, tax credits for low-carbon lifestyles might be effective too.\n\nImage Credit: Jan Seifert, Wiki Commons",
  "latent_30606": "Richmond, Virginia is a fascinating city with a criminally underrated music scene. With a total population hovering around 200,000, the state capital has given us modern R & B legend D’Angelo, successful rapper and ghostwriter Skillz, the cult metal band Gwar, and rapper, producer, songwriter, and rumored Drake ghostwriter Nickelus F. As of late, however, Richmond has gained recognition for its diverse, ever-evolving beat scene. The increased attention lead to an April of 2017 Bandcamp feature showcasing the likes of recently-signed Stones Throw artist DJ Harrison and Street Corner Music-affiliated producer Tuamie. The article also paid particular attention to Ohbliv, a prolific Richmond pioneer who boasts a whopping 44 Bandcamp releases and a recent entry in Fat Beats’ prestigious Baker’s Dozen series.\n\nMusic video for “TakeMeOhm” from New Black Renaissance (Side B) album.\n\nFor Ohbliv, seeing so many Richmond beatmakers find success through their craft is a long-held dream come true. “I tell all the young cats that this is what I’ve been waiting for,” he told Bandcamp. “We’ve finally become ambassadors for our city, finally we’re carrying our vibe elsewhere.”\n\nBut Ohbliv’s status as a spokesman for his city didn’t happen overnight. Long before he was held in high regard as an ambassador, the SP-404 sensei started out from the humblest of beginnings — making pause-tapes in his parent’s basement. “I had just started doing pause-tapes around 97, 98,” he tells me. “I’m a bit older than a lot of the current producers out here. I actually grew up in that time of pause-tapes. That was pretty much what you had to do to make beats if you didn’t have any other equipment.”\n\n“Patience, that’s a very important factor that a lot of people fail to understand or acknowledge or even embrace — the patience that’s involved in finding something that works.”\n\nFor Ohbliv, using his parent’s stereo system and vinyl was the only way to test his production abilities before he had any real gear. “At the time I didn’t have any samplers, I didn’t have anything,” he says. “I just had my dad’s records. I had a component set with a turntable on top and the cassette decks in the middle and all that.”\n\nMusic video for “skeetersbeatcd” from the LewseJoints album.\n\nBefore mastering the labor-intensive art of the pause-tape, the inspiration for Ohbliv’s very first beat started with a connection he made between a hip-hop classic and the original sample source. “I clearly remember hearing ‘Lyrics To Go’ by A Tribe Called Quest and the Minnie Riperton loop, and I knew that I had that record,” he says. “So that was one of the first pause-beats that I tried to re-create.”\n\nThe decision to interpolate a well-known Tribe song set the wheels of his production career into motion. Before long he was immersed in his family’s record collection and all the possible sounds it could offer him for manipulation. “It pretty much just started that way, just exploration,” he remembers. “I had a bunch of records and I didn’t have anything to do with them. I loved hip-hop so I was like, ‘Let me try to make this stuff.’ I would sit in the basement of my parent’s house and I would just pause, un-pause, pause, un-pause and just try to make something that was clean enough to rap over.”\n\n“At the time I didn’t have any samplers, I didn’t have anything. I just had my dad’s records.”\n\nThough the pause-tape phase may seem like it was a mere workaround until he obtained his first sampler, Ohbliv thinks of this period of his development as something much more meaningful. “It taught me patience first of all,” he says. “Patience, that’s a very important factor that a lot of people fail to understand, or acknowledge, or even embrace — the patience that’s involved in finding something that works and then manipulating it to make it work for you.”\n\nMicro-Chopping Ohbliv: an exclusive, 32-track playlist of choice Ohbliv tracks.\n\nOhbliv emphasizes that patience and mental toughness are key if you expect to last long in a profession that requires many hours of frustration, repetition, and isolation. “You gotta have the patience and the will, cause it gets tedious,” he says with a laugh. “You spend thirty minutes on it and it’s not working. You might have to scrap it and start on a new thing. Dedication and patience is super, super important if it’s something you really want to do.”\n\nIn addition to patience, making pause-tapes taught him about timing and the art of chopping samples. “When I first was making beats I would just pause it right on the snare,” he says. “ I learned that you gotta pause it a little bit before the snare so it doesn’t clip. Little stuff like that, little technical things.”\n\n“I’m definitely a more sound-driven artist.”\n\nWhen the eventual transition to a Roland SP-303 happened, it felt like someone had given Ohbliv a cheat code. “Learning that way made making beats on a sampler so much easier,” he says. “It jumped leap years when I finally got my sampler. I already had a working knowledge of how to chop, how to sequence, things like that.”\n\nMusic video for “sunhymn” from the SLPHNC2 album.\n\nAs comfortable as Ohbliv was on the 303, he soon felt discouraged about his future as a producer when a well-known DAW started to grow in popularity during the early 2000s. “This was during the time of Little Brother,” he explains. “Fruity Loops was going crazy and everybody was trying to make 9th Wonder beats. I was using my 303 and it wasn’t really sounding like that.”\n\nDisheartened, he even tried cooking up his own FL Studio creations, but his attempts to master the program fell flat. “That was a quick six months and I was done with that — back to the SP,” he says with a laugh. “I was stubborn and I learned on hardware initially. It felt more natural to me. I’m definitely a more sound-driven artist.”\n\n“I would sit in the basement of my parent’s house and I would just pause, un-pause, pause, un-pause and just try to make something that was clean enough to rap over.”\n\nOhbliv’s Lewse Joints VI, a representation of “early beat tapes of pause loops and raw sketches.”\n\nThankfully for his fans, Ohbliv met some like-minded LA producers through MySpace before his frustration reached a level that made him want to give up. “I discovered Dibia$e and Jonwayne and they were using the same equipment I was,” he says. “It helped me, whether they know it or not. Dibia$e and Jonwayne were like the only two people I knew of that were even using SP products back then. They were definitely influential and inspired me to go further and continue with it.\n\nHe has indeed gone much further with it — now with the SP-404 as his primary weapon. After carving himself quite a niche and a staggering discography worth of in the instrumental material, Ohbliv is opening himself up for more collaborations with rappers. Though he’d prefer to keep the specifics hush-hush for the time being, it’s exciting to think about who his collaborators might be.\n\nWhatever his next release brings, with over 20 years spent honing his craft Ohbliv shows no signs of slowing down or burning out. If his recent Passion and Lewse Joints VI albums are any indication, he’ll continue to be one of the leaders of the Richmond, Virginia beat scene for many years to come.",

Characters are challenging enough, particularly when there are extras, but it's backgrounds and objects that really makes things difficult for me. I underestimated the challenge the overall composition posed back when I brought color into Squirrel Prophet, and while it could be fun and rewarding to work in color, it was horribly impractical for sticking to a schedule, and I likely would have stopped using color mid-storyline if not for the fact that almost everything was happening in one location with a reusable palette.\n\nEGS:NP",
  "latent_30847": "This looks like good news for women—after facing a persistent wage gap despite decades of proving themselves the equal of male colleagues, perhaps they are finally getting their due.\n\nBut the actual mobility rates (as opposed to the relative ones) show a different story. Here’s the raw chance a man or a woman will outearn his or her father, again charted from 1970 through 2014:\n\nRemember that 4-in-10 chance that a 30-something man would rise above his father’s wage? Women of the same age have just a 26 percent chance of doing that. Indeed, women have always been less likely to out-do their fathers, and while the gap has narrowed, it’s no triumph of equality—for most of the past 40 years, men’s chances just got a lot worse.\n\nMuch of this can be traced back to the increasing number of women who are now in the workforce full time. As the United States continues its long transition from manufacturing to services—from an economy that makes stuff to one that does stuff—jobs once considered solely the domain of women are becoming central to family income. Traditionally male jobs, on the other hand—mining, manufacturing, steel-working—are on the way out.\n\nUnfortunately, women’s gains are not making families richer. The manufacturing jobs men have lost, on the whole, were well-compensated; the service-sector jobs many women have filled pay less. While wages from women have become more important to the average family, their depressed earning power, compared to men, means some households are just making do with less.\n\nThat’s backed up by a recent report by the left-leaning Center for American Progress, which noted that while 42 percent of mothers are the primary breadwinners for their family, the wage gap “continues to drag down women’s wages, which makes households less economically secure.” The earnings of black mothers are particularly important: 70 percent are the sole providers for their families, and 85 percent contribute more than a quarter of their household’s income.\n\nPerhaps the most important dynamic captured in the Harvard-Stanford study is that intergenerational mobility has dropped sharply for both genders since the 1970s. Simply put, most Americans are no longer getting ahead. In the 1970s, more than 90 percent of families headed by 30-year-olds made more money than their parents’ did at the same age. Today’s families, by contrast, have only a 50-50 chance of out-earning their parents.\n\nEven so, it’s hard to look at these numbers without thinking of the much-discussed decline of working men, and the effect it had on this election. To be sure, men are still doing better than women, on average: They’re paid more, and they still have a better shot at making a better living than the previous generation. But this is another illustration of an inflection point in the American economy, another divergence between the genders—and perhaps another possible explanation for Donald Trump’s victory in November.",

  "latent_31812": "In cased you missed it, earlier this week, Intel let slip with new details on their forthcoming low power mobile processor, code named Broadwell-Y and now known as Intel's new Core M family. To give you the quick-take view, based on Intel's new low power 14nm process technology (a chip manufacturing process significantly smaller and lower-power than virtually any manufacturer in the world currently), Intel has taken their mainstream notebook processor microarchitecture and shrunk it down (a die shrink) to address tablets and ultra-light 2-in-1 designs. Where previously only Intel's Atom architecture could compete in \"fanless\" tablet designs, Core M and Broadwell-Y can now mount a serious attack on this high growth market. Intel's Broadwell and Core M family are a very big deal for the company and will allow Intel to compete with the full force of their strong suit CPU architecture, in designs they could not address in the past, due to power consumption and heat.\n\nFirst, let's discuss the architecture and then we'll discuss what impact it will have on the market and retail products slated to arrive as early as this coming holiday shopping season. Broadwell is the follow-on to Intel's Haswell line of 4th generation Core series processors. It shares the same chip architecture but with Intel's migration from a 22nm manufacturing process technology, to their new bleeding-edge 14nm process node, Broadwell and specifically the \"Broadwell-Y\" variant, will have much lower power consumption but at better performance overall with additional graphics processing resources. Again, historically, Haswell and Intel's low power Core series processors have only really played in notebooks and larger 2-in-1 hybrids like Microsoft's Surface Pro 3, at best. Standard tablets and the lightest, fanless designs were traditionally not an option for Intel's successful Core series architecture, that is until Broadwell-Y came along.\n\nA couple of the intrinsic benefits of a die shrink are lower power consumption and faster transistor switching speeds. The above slide depicts a number of benefits with Intel's move from it's 22nm 3D Tri-Gate technology to its second generation 14nm 3D Tri-Gate technology. In short, Intel has been able to reduce idle power consumption of their processor (when the system isn't under load) by 60 percent and also has reduced the total TDP or Thermal Design Power by more than 2X. Couple the power savings with a few silicon tweaks to things like their FIVR (Full Integrated Voltage Regulator), increased L2 buffer cache and a few additional graphics cores, (because they have the extra silicon real estate at 14nm), and you're left with combined, net CPU and graphics performance gains. And all of this was achieved while enabling a chip that was previously relegated to much larger devices, but is now able to sip power at low enough levels that it can function in a tablet form factor.\n\nBroadwell is on the right in this shot; Haswell, Intel's previous generation for notebooks, is on the left. A picture, as they say, is worth a thousand of what I bang out every day on the keyboard. Size matters. Okay, I'll ease up on the cliche′s. What's impressive here is that Intel is claiming that the little guy on the right offers, in general, a 5 percent boost in CPU performance and 20 percent more graphics horsepower. To reiterate, this is over and above what they previous achieved in a notebook-targeted processor, but now can achieve this in a fanless tablet design.\n\nIntel wasn't specific about the price points they can hit with Broadwell-Y and their Core M series of processors, beyond noting that, for tablets and 2-in-1 hybrids, it would target the higher-end of the mid range or premium segments. I pried more for detail and they were pretty tight-lipped but my gut tells me we'll see this in devices at the high-end of the tablet market, at say $499 and up. Think iPad Air kind of thin, but with high resolution displays and more features. Core M-powered devices won't compete with low-end 7 - 10-inch Android slates but in the premium tablet segment (devices like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S, iPad Air etc.) Intel could really make inroads.\n\nThe real question is timing. Technically, Intel is late with Broadwell and other manufacturers like NVIDIA with their Tegra K1 family have caught up. Forbes contributor and industry analyst Patrick Moorhead notes, \"There are two ways to look at this. Glass half full says that 22nm was the best yielding process in recent history so anything close to it is good. Glass half empty says that they are behind and product should have been here in volume by now. Only Intel knows for sure. What we do know is that 14nm Broadwell is “healthy,” and the process and Broadwell is in volume production.\"\n\nPersonally, I think the indicators are aligning well for Intel and Q4 will mark a continuance of the company's surge in sales and revenues. We've already heard rumblings from major OEMs like ASUS, Lenovo and others that are planning Broadwell-Y Core M 2-in-1 devices and tablets. My opinion is that Intel's 14nm process hitting volume production finally signals the next round for the company in the tablet and ultralight arena, and they're coming out fired-up and swinging.\n\nIntel's 14nm Broadwell is a game-changer and they've put their competition officially on notice.",
  "latent_31826": "They have unwillingly become settlers, for whom life should go on far away from their countries. They have neither a home, nor hope in the future. Every one of the refugees who have been looking for safety and protection for the lives of their families in Bulgaria has a sad story to tell. The data by the State Agency for Refugees are disturbing. Just for two months since the beginning of 2015, people who had sought protection from Bulgaria are more than 2000 people. Less than half of them, however, have identification documents necessary in order to get help from the state.\n\nThe period of hardship can last for a month and during that time newcomers live with the help of relatives and donators. The situation becomes even more complicated if we add to the picture a child or a person in need of medical assistance. This is what volunteers of the Council of Refugee Women in Bulgaria point out. They have organized a donation campaign with the major goal to provide medical care to children and young people looking for protection in Sofia. The start was given by a Christmas bazaar organized by their partners from the International Women’s Club- Sofia.\n\nThe first part of the donations will reach 50 children in the capital, where the group of immigrants is the biggest. Refugee Women in Bulgaria hope that by the end of the year the funds will be enough to cover the costs of a total of 150 medical examinations for those who need it the most.\n\n\"We invested the funds from the Christmas sale in food for babies, but we lack financing to provide them with health checks and medicines,” says Linda Awanis - Chairman of the Board of the Council of Refugee Women in Bulgaria.\n\n\"When one arrives to Bulgaria becoming part of the health insurance system requires nearly six months,” she says. “Often these are families with small children, and if their babies get sick during this period, they have no access to medical care. These are the case we work on and try to help. We accompany these people in institutions because of the language barrier. These are not people engaged in criminal activities and many of them receive help from abroad. They often need advice and information about their rights. We are to use the donations to pay for medical examinations of children as an interpreter of the organization will accompany families in medical institutions. Years ago in the Ovcha Kupel district in Sofia, where a number of immigrants reside, there was no doctor to take care for them. Over time things changed and now there are doctors to help them.”\n\nWar in the Arab countries is unlikely to stop soon, so we must be ready to help people fleeing from the region, the Council of Women Refugees in Bulgaria say. According to them, Bulgarians are sensitive to the suffering of others and they often organize fundraising campaigns themselves. The sum allocated for the treatment of refugee children in Sofia, is not big, but this is the beginning of a lasting partnership and the funds will be used transparently and purposefully, says Maria Ilieva, coordinator of “International Women's Club – Sofia.\"\n\n\"To make sure the money is spent properly, we started the campaign with smaller sums to our new partners,” she says. “This is only the beginning, but the fact that we support them with financial assistance and contacts is a sign of trust and we believe our cooperation would develop. Unfortunately, in recent years the amounts donated by companies and individuals have noticeably decreased. We have been trying to spend the money for those who need it the most. We have already gained experience and see the Council of Refugee Women in Bulgaria as good and reliable partners.\"\n\nEnglish: Alexander Markov",

  "latent_32021": "UPDATE: Kurt Busch lost his second and final appeal of the suspension on Saturday. His attorney, Rustin Hardin, released the following statement:\n\n\"We are unhappy with the latest decision to deny our re-appeal, but we will continue to exhaust every procedural and legal remedy we have available to us until Kurt Busch is vindicated. Along the way we intend to continue to call attention to the facts and witnesses that will shed light on Ms. Driscoll's true character, motivations and history.\"\n\nDAYTONA BEACH, Fla.—Three thoughts on Kurt Busch’s indefinite suspension from NASCAR, which came after a Delaware court ruled Friday \"it is more likely than not\" Busch committed an act of abuse against his ex-girlfriend in September 2014.\n\n1. The written opinion from the Delaware judge who ordered Busch to stay away from ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll was too strong to ignore:\n\nOn Friday, Commissioner David W. Jones finally delivered the opinion that he had promised after awarding the protection-from-abuse order against Busch that Driscoll had been actively seeking since mid-December. Jones wrote plainly. He found Driscoll’s version of the pair's encounter at Dover International Speedway on the evening of Sept. 26th, in which she alleged that Busch choked her and three times knocked the back of her head into the bedroom wall of the racer’s motorcoach, to be “more credible based on her demeanor\" and her testimony to be “corroborated by documentary evidence” and “corroborated in important respects by the credible testimony of other witnesses.”\n\nAs for the story offered by Busch, who said he cupped Driscoll’s cheeks while asking her to exit his motorcoach, Jones said it was “implausible, does not make sense and is unlikely to be true.” Of Kristy Cloutier and Charis Burrett, Busch's personal assistant and business partner, respectively, who attacked Driscoll’s credibility on the stand, Jones called their testimony “so dramatically tarnished by their obvious bias and personal financial interest in [Busch’s] public image and racing career, which according to [Busch’s counsel], could be irreparably damaged if he were to be determined to have committed an act of domestic violence.” Of bus driver Mike Doncheff’s assertion that Driscoll is a trained assassin, the commissioner said Busch’s “summation appears to reflect that [he] has, appropriately, abandoned this argument.”\n\nStill, no line in Jones’s opinion hit harder than this: “Given [Busch’s] passion for his racing career and his intemperate and frequently violent reactions to seemingly minor racing setbacks, the Court finds that there exists a likelihood of future acts of domestic violence against [Driscoll].”\n\nJones’ words clearly resonated with NASCAR. During a hastily convened news conference on Friday night, executive vice president Steve O’Donnell announced Busch’s suspension under its code of conduct guidelines, specifically rules 12.1.a (actions detrimental to stock car racing) and 12.8 (behavioral penalty). He added that NASCAR arrived at its decision “based on our review of the available details, including the court’s findings that were released earlier today.” He restated the seriousness with which NASCAR takes “the broader issue of domestic violence.\" He granted Busch an opportunity to appeal the decision under an expedited process. (Later Friday, NASCAR confirmed that Busch's appeal would be heard Saturday.) All told, O’Donnell spoke for a little over a minute before stepping down from the dais. It was not the visual the sport had hoped for two days before its signature event, the Daytona 500. Busch was due to start fourth on the grid.\n\n​\n\n2. The Stewart-Haas contingency plan will be tested:\n\nThis might be the most significant start for Regan Smith, a seasoned veteran who has spent more of his eight-year Cup career as a utility player than an everyday starter. But it’s not the first time he’s been called up from the Stewart-Haas bench. After Tony Stewart's accident in upstate New York in August that resulted in the death of Kevin Ward Jr., Smith took the three-time Cup champion’s place on the grid at Watkins Glen and crashed out to a 37th-place finish. Daytona, alas, has been just as unkind to the 31-year-old New Yorker. In 11 starts on the 2.5-mile oval, he’s placed in the top-10 twice. (Compare that with Busch, who finished third here last year and scored five top-threes before that.) If there’s an upshot, it’s that one of those top-10s came last year.\n\nExpecting Smith to produce a performance that is as strong or stronger might be a bit of a tall task, however. He hasn’t had much time to acclimate himself behind the wheel and will start at the pack of the pack, in accordance with NASCAR’s driver substitution rules.\n\n3. Busch’s winding road just turned into something resembling a cul-de-sac:\n\nAt least as far as his career is concerned. With Busch's appeal coming Saturday, the matter could be successfully resolved before Sunday, which would technically allow him to race the 500. The catch is that he can't rely on representation from attorney Rusty Hardin, who said he was “extremely disappointed” by NASCAR’s decision. (Compare that statement to Stewart-Haas executive vice president Joe Custer, who said “we understand NASCAR’s position regarding Kurt Busch and accept their decision.”) No, Busch will have to represent himself in front of a three-member panel—and produce the $500 processing fee for that privilege. Of course, if he were to win his appeal, the question then becomes, what would he drive?\n\nShortly after O’Donnell’s announcement, Chevrolet announced that it was suspending its partnership with Busch. He could always land a ride with another team in driving for another manufacturer. Or trade on his IndyCar relationship with Andretti Motorsports (with whom he teamed for the 2014 Indianapolis 500 and finished sixth) and bolt for IndyCar. To that end, an IndyCar executive confirmed Friday night that top brass are planning on meeting Saturday to discuss the possibility of Busch resuming his open wheel career.\n\nHe could also try and find a ride in sports cars or rally cars. Busch, a 2004 Cup champion, certainly has talent to spare. But would potential partners be willing to sign him with this cloud hanging over him? The smart money says no, at least not in the short term.",

But there were concerns about whether Johnathan would remain at the club with board members keen to get rid of him.\n\n“I even hired a private investigator to prove he hadn’t done anything wrong. They looked at footage and saw that he had just two drinks and walked out at 2.30am, being held up for 15 minutes to sign autographs.\n\n“The negative publicity around the incident, saying Johnathan was drunk, made people at the club nervous.”\n\nThanks to Ayoub and Gould, Thurston retained the captaincy and remained at the Cowboys, becoming the superstar we see today.\n\nAt the time ‘JT’ wasn’t in a good place.
