Rules of engagement are anything goes.\n\nPremeditated wars of aggression are waged without mercy, civilians and nonmilitary related sites considered legitimate targets, populations under their control terrorized.\n\nMass slaughter and destruction are considered OK. America and Israel partner in each others high crimes. Wholl dare intervene to stop them?\n\nWholl enforce international law? Wholl protect the rights of defenseless people?\n\nMassacred and brutalized Afghans, Iraqis, Syrians, Libyans, Yemenis, Somalis, Palestinians and others attest to the brutality of two rogue states, fascist regimes masquerading as democratic ones.\n\nThe cold-blooded murder of a seriously wounded defenseless Palestinian by an Israeli soldier authorized to shoot to kill sparked widespread outrage.\n\nIt was business as usual for the self-styled worlds most moral army, responsible for around 210 extrajudicial assassinations of Palestinian civilians in the last six months alone.\n\nSoldiers and police are authorized to use lethal live fire. Knives are routinely planted beside bodies of victimized Palestinian men, women and children as justification for cold-blooded murder.\n\nTheir lives dont matter. Slow motion genocide is longstanding Israeli policy, wanting all valued parts of Judea and Samaria exclusively for Jews, including international city Jerusalem as its exclusive capital.\n\nIsrael justifies the unjustifiable with full international community support. State terror and institutionalized racism are longstanding official policies.\n\nNetanyahu is a world-class thug, a serial liar, more barbarian than Jew, maintaining the fiction about IDF soldiers upholding high ethical values while courageously fighting against bloodthirsty murderers under difficult operational conditions.\n\nSo-called bloodthirsty murderers are defenseless men, youths, women, children, the elderly and infirm, terrorized by occupation harshness - dispossessed of their land, extrajudicially executed or imprisoned without just cause.\n\nNetanyahu calling criticism of IDF practices outrageous and unacceptable belies longstanding viciousness against an entire population.\n\nBreaking the Silence combat veterans exposed the reality of daily life in Palestine, explaining what Israel wants suppressed - horrific crimes of war and against humanity, defenseless civilians murdered excused as military necessities, or explained as extreme and unique cases.\n\nSoldiers kill civilians with impunity. No Israeli commander or regime official was every held accountable for the highest of high crimes.\n\nOperation Protective Edge in summer 2014 was Exhibit A - well-planned months in advance naked aggression against 1.8 Gazans trapped under siege, unrelated to Hamas rockets and other phony pretexts.\n\nMass slaughter and destruction followed, defenseless civilians mostly harmed, murdered in their homes, UN shelters and elsewhere where they sought refuge.\n\nSoldiers were ordered to shoot to kill anything that moved, anything in sight, small children, women and the elderly routinely targeted, residential buildings, schools, hospitals and other nonmilitary sites destroyed or damaged, many victims inside perishing.\n\nDozens of entire families were slaughtered in cold blood. Breaking the Silence testimonies paint(ed) a disturbing picture of the IDFs policy of indiscriminate fire, which directly resulted in the deaths of hundreds of innocent Palestinian civilians.\n\nSoldiers were told to shoot to kill anyone in sight. They were deliberately lied to about areas supposedly cleared of civilians where entire families remained.\n\nThroughout the conflict, the IDF fired thousands of imprecise artillery shells into residential neighborhoods - indiscriminately murdering defenseless noncombatants.\n\nSoldiers were ordered to carry out mass destruction of civilian infrastructure and homes.\n\nMany residential homes were shelled, from the ground and from the air, in order to demonstrate presence in the area, or even as an act of punishment.\n\nMajor war crimes were committed over 51 horrific days, no one held accountable for flagrant international law breaches too grave to ignore.\n\nExecuting a defenseless Palestinian, lying helpless on the ground wounded, captured on video gone viral online, is one of countless examples of daily ruthless business as usual without mercy in Occupied Palestine.\n\nStephen Lendman lives in Chicago.

  "latent_110": "Here’s the moment that many PC performance enthusiasts have been waiting for: pricing and specs for AMD ’s Ryzen Threadripper family of processors (as well as a couple of benchmark numbers). AMD first teased details about the high-end desktop (HEDT) processors back in mid-May, but we now have additional details on the first two products in the family.\n\nBoth processors are of course based on the 14nm Zen core, make use of AMD’s new Socket TR4 interface, support quad-channel DDR memory, and feature a total of 64 PCIe lanes. In addition, both processors will come from the factory unlocked. Without further ado, here’s how each processor stacks up:\n\nRyzen Threadripper 1920X: 12 Cores, 24 Threads, 3.5/4.0 GHz (Base Clock/Precision Boost)\n\nRyzen Threadripper 1950X: 16 Cores, 32 Threads, 3.4/4.0 GHz (Base Clock/Precision Boost)\n\nIf you’re wondering when you’ll be able to get your hands on either processor, AMD says that Ryzen Threadripper processors and motherboards will be available in early August. However, if you want to get a Ryzen Threadripper system ASAP, you can always splurge on Dell’s new Alienware Area-51 Threadripper Edition systems, which will begin shipping on July 27th. Although we don’t know how much X399 motherboards will cost, AMD says that the Ryzen Threadripper 1920X and 1950X will be priced at $799 and $999 respectively.\n\nTo put those prices into perspective, the 12-core Intel Core i9-7920X is priced at $1,199, while the 14-core Core i9-7940X is priced at $1,399. The core-for-core, thread-for-thread match for the Ryzen Threadripper 1950X is the $1,699 Core i9-7960X. Although AMD doesn’t have an 18-core/36-thread equivalent, the Core i9-7980XE is priced at a wallet-busting $1,999.\n\nWhile we don’t have any leaked numbers pitting the Core i9-7960X head-to-head with the Ryzen Threadripper 1950X, we have the feeling that price differential of $700 would negate any performance advantage (if any) that Intel will have over AMD for most enthusiasts. However, we'll have to wait until we get our hands on both processors to test out that theory.\n\nUpdate: 7/13/2017 9:00AM EST - We do have a video demo of Ryzen Threadripper 1950X and 1920X CPUs in action sent over by AMD. The duo is pitted against Intel's currently shipping Core i9-7900X 10-core CPU in the Cinebench R15 and the results are fun to watch to be sure...\n\n(Click to Enlarge)\n\nWith that being said, it will be interesting to see how Intel’s Core i9 pricing holds up in the coming months now that Ryzen Threadripper will be entering the fray.\n\nMoving on to more mundane processors from AMD, the company has also officially announced the two members of the Ryzen 3 family: the Ryzen 3 1200 and 1300X. These are budget processors aimed at the lower end of the desktop market, so you won’t find SMT support. If you caught our report on AMD’s Ryzen PRO announcement late last month, you shouldn’t be too surprised about the specs for either chip, which are as follows:\n\nRyzen 3 1300X: 4 Cores, 4 Threads, 3.5/3.7 GHz (Base Clock/Boost)\n\nRyzen 3 1200: 4 Cores, 4 Threads, 3.1/3.4 GHz (Base Clock/Boost)\n\nAt this time, AMD has not announced pricing for either Ryzen 3 processor.\n\nNow, if we could just get some specs, official pricing, and availability for AMD’s upcoming Radeon RX Vega graphics cards, that would be greeeaaattt, thanks!",
  "latent_141": "\"Caramelldansen\" Song by Caramell from the album Supergott Language Swedish B-side \"Caramelldansen (Album Version)\" Released 7 June 2002 Recorded June 2001 at Playhouse Studios\n\nStockholm, Sweden) Genre Dance pop, Eurodance Length 3 : 30 (single version)\n\n5:20 (album version) Label Remixed Records Songwriter(s) Jorge \"Vasco\" Vasconcelo and Juha \"Millboy\" Myllylä \"Caramelldansen\" \"Caramelldansen\" chorus. Problems playing this file? See media help.\n\n\"Caramelldansen\" (Swedish for \"The Caramell Dance\") is the first track and the final single off of Swedish music group Caramell's second and final album Supergott released on 7 June 2002.[citation needed] It has become a popular Internet meme in recent years.\n\nInternet phenomenon [ edit ]\n\nThe meme started as a fifteen frame Flash animation loop showing Mai and Mii, characters of the Japanese visual novel Popotan, doing a hip swing dance with their hands over their heads to imitate rabbit ears, and the chorus of a sped up version of the song \"Caramelldansen\" sung by Malin Sundström and Katia Löfgren from Swedish music group Caramell.\n\nPopotan, used in the internet meme known as \"Caramelldansen\". Animation loop from the visual novel, used in the internet meme known as \"Caramelldansen\".\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nPopotan first appeared as a Japanese PC game on December 12, 2002. After the anime was aired from July 17 to October 2, 2003, short GIF animations clips were created from the opening of the game and posted on the internet.[1] It was not long before parts from the introduction of the PC game were captured too. Caramelldansen is also known as the \"Uma uma dance\" (ウマウマダンス) in Japan.[citation needed]\n\nAs the Caramelldansen video gained popularity, it became a meme. Artists and fans started to copy the animation and include other characters performing the dance. Its boom began at the end of 2007 in Japan (known as the \"Uma uma Boom\") where an explosion of different Caramelldansen iterations appeared in the Japanese video-sharing site Nico Nico Douga.[2] The meme soon after spread to YouTube and became a global phenomenon. By 2008, one critic derided YouTube as a chasm filled with \"endless versions of 'Caramelldansen'.\"[3]\n\nPopularity [ edit ]\n\nThe meme is not limited to the small Flash animation loops. 3D animation shorts have been released performing the dance, and live action videos made by fans. Caramelldansen is known in Japan as \"Uma uma dance\" (ウマウマダンス), because the chorus's lyrics \"u-u-ua-ua\" were misheard as ウッーウッーウマウマ (\"u- u- umauma\"; \"uma\" has been interpreted as \"yummy\", \"nice\" (うまい, umai, slurred: umē (うめぇ) or \"horse\" (馬, uma) in Japanese). The Japanese title is sometimes written with the symbol (ﾟ∀ﾟ) added to the end. Also, Japanese listeners have interpreted the lyrics, \"Dansa med oss, klappa era händer\" (\"Dance with us, clap your hands\"), as \"Barusamiko-su Yappa irahen de\" (\"(I) don't want any Balsamic vinegar after all\" in the Kansai dialect). Thus, the song has a different interpretation in Japan than in Sweden.\n\nIn April 2008, Japanese music distributor Quake Inc. gained the rights from the original Caramell producers, Remixed Records, to distribute the sped-up version of the original song in Asia, releasing first an album which included Caramelldansen and other popular meme songs at the time, this follows up an album sung by Toromi, the voice actor who played Mii in Popotan who sang her own version of the song,[4] and follows a single and an album dedicated to the Swedish band.[5] On May 25, 2008, Caramelldansen achieved number one in the international music chart in Japan for two weeks, and on June 2 managed to obtain number sixteen in the Japanese combined chart, beating Bon Jovi with their song \"Have a Nice Day\" the last one who entered that chart three years ago.[6][7][8][9] One part of the song predicts its worldwide popularity. On May 1, 2008, Remixed Records released the sped-up version of the original Supergott album on Apple's iTunes Store. The album was called \"Supergott Speedy Mixes\". This was followed by the single \"Caramelldansen Speedy Mixes\" and on September 16 a single with the English version of the song called \"Caramelldancing\".[10] A German version of the song, \"Caramelltanzen\", was released on April 15, 2009. On March 2, 2009, Caramelldansen was awarded single of the year (international section) in the 23rd Japan Gold Disc Award.[11]\n\nAfter the \"U-u-uma uma[Maxi]\" single was released in Japan on May 21, 2008, the original concept of the Caramell group was changed. First in Japan, Malin Sundström and Katia Löfgren were replaced by their anime character counterparts, removing the rest of the band members, and later for the original Swedish release, all members were replaced by 3 anime-like girls called \"Caramella Girls\".[12][13] The idea of the new Swedish concept came from YouTube, showing more than 16,000 different versions of the original flash animation, including small loops, complete song shorts and live action videos.[14][15] \"We are definitely not disappointed and we were never able to sing the song at this pace,\" said Katia. \"We do not know who developed the dance, but it is simple and is apparently very well liked in Japan,\" added Malin.\n\nWhile the group Caramell disbanded in 2002, the group's music started to spread widely across the Internet thanks to the popularity of this Internet meme. Malin Sundström commented on the popularity of the meme: \"We felt that it was time to move on; that one of our songs now may be a breakthrough is just a bonus.\" Caramell's Juha \"Millboy\" Myllylä, responding to questions from Japanese show Netstar NHK, said that he first learned of the dance on YouTube. When asked if he does the dance himself, he responded, \"Yeah, well, the dance is very funny to do, so I used to do it every time, I mean in the shower, and I used to show my family and my friends to make them dance. I like it. It's very funny.\"[16]\n\nIn July 2009, the Taiwanese gaming company Gamania launched an advertising campaign with the \"Caramelldansen\" song for the Japanese version of its online game Lucent Heart.[17] \"Caramelldansen\" has also been used in Japanese arcade games. On November 18, 2009, an interactive game version of the dance was released for the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch. On November 23, 2009, the team behind popular comedy site LoadingReadyRun performed the dance made famous by the meme as part of a task in the Desert Bus charity appeal. The team chose to perform the dance to raise money for the charity Child's Play, founded by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik in 2003. The dance was also streamed by live web cam to those following the Desert Bus appeal through LoadingReadyRun and online gaming magazine The Escapist. In August 2010, the American Disney Channel program Phineas and Ferb used an imitation of the dance in their \"Summer Belongs to You\" special, during their characters' stop in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nOn March 18, 2011, Caramella Girls launched their first single as a virtual group, the song \"Boogie Bam Dance\" was recorded by Caramell's original vocalists Malin and Katia and its available in 3 different languages (English, Spanish, and German).\n\nOn October 2012, the band released the \"Caramelldancing Remixes EP\", which features remixes of the English version of the Caramelldansen song by Crazy 1, No Trixx, and DJ Triplestar.[18]\n\nMedia [ edit ]\n\nAfter 2008, official releases of the song and animation from this meme started to appear.[19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27]\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nJapanese [ edit ]\n\nUma Uma Dekiru Trance wo Tsukutte Mita (\"Tried making a trance you can Uma Uma to\" ウマウマできるトランスを作ってみた) (Album – April 16, 2008)\n\nToro☆Uma (とろ☆ウマ) (Album – May 11, 2008)\n\nU-u-uma uma[Maxi] (ウッーウッーウマウマ[Maxi]) (Single – May 21, 2008)\n\nU-u-uma uma[Speed] (ウッーウッーウマウマ(゜∀゜)SPEEDアルバム) (Album – June 18, 2008)\n\nCaramelldansen (Official Japanese Version) (Single – December 3, 2009)\n\nSwedish [ edit ]\n\nSupergott (Album - November 16, 2001)\n\nSupergott Speedy Mixes (Album – May 1, 2008)\n\nCaramelldansen Maxi (Single – June 25, 2008)\n\nEnglish [ edit ]\n\nCaramelldancing (Single – September 16, 2008)\n\nCaramelldancing (Christmas Version) (Single – November 26, 2009)\n\nBoogie Bam Dance (Single – March 18, 2011)\n\nCaramelldancing Remixes EP (Single - October 30, 2012)\n\nCaramellDansen 2018 (Official) (Single - May 22, 2018)\n\nRussian [ edit ]\n\nМира - Caramelldansen Russian Cover =^_^= НЯ!

Thanks S.”\n\nThe president remained silent about Bannon on Friday as news of his resignation from the White House broke in the media.\n\nBannon resigned from the White House and returned to Breitbart News as the company executive chairman on Friday evening with mixed feelings about the future of the Trump agenda.\n\n“The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,” Bannon told the Weekly Standard. “We still have a huge movement, and we will make something of this Trump presidency. But that presidency is over. It’ll be something else. And there’ll be all kinds of fights, and there’ll be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over.”\n\nHe admitted that his frustration with the Republican establishment was part of the reasons he left the White House.\n\n“The Republican establishment has no interest in Trump’s success on this,” he said. “They’re not populists, they’re not nationalists, they had no interest in his program. Zero.”\n\nBannon ridiculed the “half-hearted attempt” at replacing Obamacare and found the malaise on infrastructure discouraging. He predicted that the tax cuts would be the “standard Republican version.”\n\nIn the same interview, Bannon signaled his excitement to return to Breitbart News and fuel the populist-nationalist movement forward.\n\n“I feel jacked up,” he says. “Now I’m free. I’ve got my hands back on my weapons. Someone said, ‘it’s Bannon the Barbarian.’ I am definitely going to crush the opposition.”",
  "latent_232": "\"I'm so bored!\" I groaned sitting on the slab of cement in front of my door.\n\n\"Why don't you go work for the guy at the general store?\" Blake asked, thumbing through a book while sitting next to me.\n\n\"I got let go.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Yesterday apparently. I showed up again this morning, but he told me I was done.\"\n\n\"So now what?\"\n\n\"I spent some time at the forge working on Jaune's present, but I could only get an hour long turn without paying.\"\n\n\"That sucks. What are you making anyways?\"\n\nI reached into the pouch on my waist I kept with my casual clothes. I found the slightly crumpled up paper with the reworked design and after organizing all the other notes and such handed it to her.\n\n\"I increased the size of the gun so it can use proper light ammunition.\" Blake flipped to the next page and I moved on with her.\n\n\"I have it set so the barrel runs along the flat edge of the blade. It folds into itself to reduce it's length to just an inch longer than the barrel before folding into a proper pistol shape. I don't expect Jaune to be able to operate or even fully utilize a more complex weapon.\"\n\n\"He's doesn't exactly have the most intricate fighting techniques. Remember when he \"\n\n\"Well he's had sword and board drilled into his head to the point that he isn't compatible with anything else.\"\n\n\"Why are you giving him a gun?\" She turned to me to show the seriousness of the question, \"You remember last time he used a gun it bounced off a steel beam and hit you in the shoulder.\"\n\n\"It was an accident, and that was almost ten years ago. It's just a tiny scar now, I'm sure he'll be just fine now.\"\n\n\"Second problem: How are you going to convince him to use this instead of Crocea Mors? You know how attached he is to it, once his dad gave it to him.\"\n\n\"I was hoping I could teach him to dual wield. plus I plan to make the pistol small enough that he can hold it with his shield.\"\n\n\"Have you practiced dual wielding outside when I taught you in training?\"\n\n\"A little bit.\"\n\n\"Maybe I should train him.\"\n\nI looked over to see she had looked away from her book. Her knowing grin spoiled her intent to me. I crossed my arms and puffed my cheeks while I told her \"No, I'll do it.\"\n\nBlake was the only person who tricked me into admitting I liked Jaune and why. She also knew I absolutely hated it when she poked fun at the fact.\n\n\"Hello again!\"\n\nMe and Blake turned forward to see Pyrrha waving to us from the road.\n\n\"Hey Pyrrha, what are you doing here?\" I returned her smile.\n\n\"I wanted to check up on you. I heard you got badly hurt while on the mission we had together and I couldn't find you yesterday.\"\n\n\"Well here I am. Don't worry though, I'm fine. Doctor said I just need a week and I'll be back in the action.\" Throwing my fist in the air, the thought of being back in the field made me excited with anticipation.\n\n\"I am pleased to hear this. Is your sister here?\" looking around and realizing Yang wasn't with us.\n\n\"No.\" I groaned, thinking of how boastful she'll be when she get's back.\n\n\"With Ruby injured,Ozpin decided to put her uncle and dad together with Yang. They're currently doing an 'elite' mission probably on the surface.\"\n\n\"What makes it so special?\"\n\n\"We don't know,.I've never been on one before and apparently they are classified.\"\n\n\"They also get free bullets!\" I whined, \"It's not fair! I want Ozpin to pay for all the bullets I have my sweetheart use.\"\n\n\"Only you would be happy about getting harder work.\"\n\n\"Uncle Qrow makes them sound so cool though! Anyone would want to go on those kind of adventures.\"\n\nThe two giggled, no doubt at my antics while I leaned on my back rubbed my face hoping it get some sort of feeling out of them. Being injured sucks. I liked getting sick when I was younger, because I didn't have to go to my boring classes; but now I was missing out on the only thing that help the day go by. Now I was being forced to realize just how long the days actually were.\n\n\"Oh yeah!\" I exclaimed to myself while sitting back up.\n\n\"What is it?\" Blake asked, while both her and Pyrrha gave me quizzical looks.\n\n\"Remember that white beowolf on the mission? I wanted to ask Mr. Port or Mr. Oobleck about them. I've never seen grimm fight each other before.\"\n\nI started getting to my feet, but Pyrrha was kind enough to give me a hand. I lead the way, crouch underarm, while Pyrrha and Blake followed at my heels.\n\n\"So who are Mr. Port and Mr. Oobleck?\" I heard Pyrrha ask Blake behind me.\n\n\"They are both instructors for hunters and huntresses in training. Oobleck handles the more academic half of our basic training while Mr. Port does sparing and survival.\"\n\nI only stopped when I realized Blake wasn't following. I turned to face her and Pyrrha did the same.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Have you noticed the metro has been very empty?\"\n\nI looked around, to see plenty of people out and about. She was right though. There should have been twice as many people filling the street.\n\n\"Do you think it's just a very slow day?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, it's been like this for a bit, every day there are fewer and fewer.\"\n\n\"Do you have anywhere else that people could go to?\" Pyrrha asked.\n\n\"No,\" Blake replied, shaking her head, \"There are other metro stations that we live in, but travel isn't safe, and I'm sure the guards would have noticed if people were leaving on mass.\"\n\nA flare of worry built up in me, as I thought to Mr. Green and his abandoned shack.\n\n\"Do you think we should tell Ozpin? He might know where they are.\" I offered, completely forgetting my original objective.\n\n\"It wouldn't hurt.\" She agreed, confirming the decision.\n\nIt was the same direction, but we were heading all the way down the way now. Well we were going to. There was a massive explosion in front of us. One that shook the entire metro and sent me to the ground. Dust filled the air, and my breaths turned to coughs and wheezes as I struggled to breath.\n\nBloody grimm, why don't I have my respirator.\n\n\"What the fuck was that!\" Some random man choked, getting to his feet.\n\nGunfire answered, followed shortly by screams.\n\n\"What's going on?\" everyone asked, or was at least thinking.\n\nThere was more gunfire then a loud ringing filled the tunnels.\n\n\"Is that the alarm? Has the barricade been breached?\" I heard Blake shout this time.\n\nI started picking myself up only to have a pair of arms wrap around my body. I was placed on my feet, with Blake turning me around to Pyrrha.\n\n\"Pyrrha, take Ruby to the emergency shelter. If the grimm have breached the barricade I need to help hold them off till everyone can get away.\" She ordered with authority in her voice.\n\n\"What? No! I want to help!\"\n\n\"No Ruby. You don't have your weapons with you.\" She said, shaking her head.\n\n\"Pyrrha just take me back to the house! I'll get my stuff, I can help!\"\n\nBlake turned me to face her, looking me dead in the eye.\n\n\"Ruby, even if you had your gear right now, you're in no condition to fight.\"\n\n\"But I-\"\n\n\"What do you think you'll do? You can't stand on two legs, and you can't walk or run. Someone would have to next to you, just to protect you, instead of helping.\"\n\n\"But...\" I trailed off, looking for some way to argue and failing to find anything.\n\nI dipped my head in defeat, upset about not being able to help. Blake pulled me into a hug, but I couldn't really tell if she was trying to cheer me up, or motivate herself.\n\n\"You can help everyone by getting to the bunker and keep them all calm.\"\n\nI nodded, taking her suggestion. Pyrrha scooped me up, disorienting me suddenly so I was in her arms; crutch still in hand. Blake ran towards the entrance of the metro while I pointed Pyrrha back to the shelter. Most people had already started making their way there. Gun fire started to approach behind us, but all the dust in the air cut down our vision to only a dozen feet at most.\n\nI ordered Pyrrha left, and she followed my order. There were several bunkers set up incase of an emergency, but this was the only one at this end of the station. Pyrrha ran down the alleyway before coming to a stop suddenly. In front of us was a huge crowd of people.\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked, as the crowd was just standing still.\n\n\"I think the bunker is still closed.\" A man in front of us stated.\n\n\"Closed? Why? They should be open, even when the station isn't under attack.\"\n\nHe shrugged, and looked forward again to wait patiently for the door to open. The crowd was calm for the moment, but as the battle and the grimm got closer that was sure to change quickly.\n\n\"Come on. Let's head back toward my house, there's another bunker at the very end.\" Pyrrha nodded and we ran off to the far end.\n\n\"You sure you don't want to stop by my house?\"\n\n\"I apologize Ruby, but I must agree with Blake. You are in no condition to fight.\"\n\n\"Well I just thought maybe seeing a fully armed huntress could help keep people calm while we wait out in the bunker.\"\n\nShe ran for a bit longer, before nodding to my logic and we made a quick detour to my house. The gunfire faded, but I wasn't sure if it was because the fighting was going the other way, or if we were simply out running it. I didn't feel a need to fully change, so just threw my blouse over my tank top, and my skirt over my shorts. I traded my shoes for my combat boots and put on the rest of my equipment.\n\nI was about to leave, but decided to bring Jaune's sword with me. I didn't know how long I would be in there, so having something to do would help. I limped out as fast as I could back to Pyrrha. I moved as fast\n\nThe sounds of fighting returned, but it was much lighter than before sounded like some grimm might've gotten through and they were just cleaning up. I hoped the other group was safe, but for now I could help everyone at this end.\n\n\"Sounds like the fighting almost over.\"\n\n\"We should still go to the bunker till we're told it's ok.\"\n\nWe marched the last hundred meters or so to the bunker, only to find another crowd.\n\n\"What's going on! Why are all the shelters closed!\" I shouted leaving Pyrrha's support.\n\nI pushed my way through the thinner crowd. Most people moved aside for me, not exactly having anything to be doing. I came to see a very concerning sight. The massive door sealed shut, but that wasn't what worried me. It was the the spray painted crown broken by a black lightning bolt on it that did.\n\nMy fist slammed into the metal. I was certain that there were some people inside who probably just closed the door to save their own skins.\n\n\"Open the door immediately! There's a crowd of people here trying to get in!\"\n\nThere was no response so I slammed my fist into the metal again. I let out a groan, getting angry with this whole situation.\n\n\"Open this door right now! I'm a huntress and I WILL have you tried for endangerment of the metro!\"\n\n\"Everyone put your hands in the air!\"\n\nI turned around to where the call came from behind me. I weaved back through the crowd, who were murmuring to themselves with fear present in many of their voices.\n\n\"What's going on!\" I shouted, breaking through to where Pyrrha was standing.\n\nShe had her shield and sword out, in a combat stance. In a line blocking our way, was a group of individuals each with guns aimed at the crowd. Each had black kevlar vests on and what I could only guess were black welding mask to conceal their faces. Their guns looked like they had been cared for poorly; one even had put tape around the barrel and scope to keep them together.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked, not meaning for as much anger in my voice as there was.\n\n\"Put your hands in the air!\" One of them shouted back.\n\n\"Ruby, I don't think they are part of your security force.\" Pyrrha said, turning to me.\n\n\"Drop your weapon and put your hands in the air, now!\" The same guy, who I guess was their leader, ordered me.\n\n\"Is that a threat?\" I asked, already knowing the answer but wanted to hear it from their own mouth.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nPyrrha looked to me not sure what to do. I cocked my head slightly to give her the go ahead. Her sword made a few clicking sounds while it extended out into a spear. I dropped my crutch to the ground and pulled out Crescent Rose in one smooth motion, slamming its tip into the ground.\n\nThree of the attackers took a step back at the sudden display of hostility, with a fourth shifting in place. Only the leader remained calm and spent the moment rallying his men.\n\nI yanked my scythe from the dirt and threw it behind me, shifting my weight to balance on one foot. I pulled the bolt to prime the weapon, while everyone behind me immediately moved out of the way so I had a clear firing line.\n\nMe and my target pulled the trigger at the same time. I launched forward coming at him head on purposely to take the bullets so the crowd behind me wouldn't risk getting hit. His shots slammed into me and I could feel each one do a serious blow to my aura, but I held out long enough to close the distance.\n\nMy blade came around and sliced the man's gun clean in half in his hands. I let the weight of my blade carry me around as I looped back, turning Crescent rose around to bat the unarmed man away. I watched him fly a good twenty feet into the air before he reached the peak.\n\nI was pulled back from my distraction when my aura burned my sides with irritation. One on my left at my shoulder the second on the right side of my head. The irritation on the right grew stronger as its threat grew more imminent. Without having time to look, I ducked down, hoping to avoid what it was. A loud whizzing sound passed overhead and I followed it to see a bronze disc fly head on at a man who was taking aim at me. It landed dead on, though I didn't know how much damage it actually did behind the iron mask, as I had to focus on the man on the far end on the left who seemed to be coming out of a daze, probably just registering they were being attacked.\n\nLike the first foe, I used Crescent Rose to launch me forward. He fumbled with his gun in surprise for a bit before finally taking aim. I was too close though, and moved my weapon forward so the top of the blade would hit him.\n\nA perfect blow to his low center sent him to the ground, while I pivoted on the curve of my blade till the barrel was over his center chest. I fired a point blank round, hoping his armor would protect him as I sent myself airborn. I folded up my precious as I flipped through the air, taking in the sight around me. The crowd was fine and only one last enemy was left to deal with. Pyrrha was expertly avoiding the shots from the man, but couldn't get an opening to counter from.\n\nI threw my legs and weight 'till I was facing the two mid flight and fired a single heavy round at the man's shoulder. His arm flew back as the force of the hit pulled his whole body with it. Pyrrha took the moment and rolled her spear back into a throwing stance. She held off until the man recovered and turned to face her again. With pinpoint precision, she threw the spear through his protective armor just over the shoulder with enough force to actually take the man off his feet. He flew a solid ten feet before he hit the ground, the spear anchoring him to the ground.\n\nI remembered gravity's influence on me, and looked down to see I only had seconds before hitting the ground. I didn't have time to fully adjust my balance, and landed on both legs. Pain shot through my bad one and I collapsed to the floor, unable to stay standing. I grabbed my leg in some attempt to sooth it, but knew I couldn't.\n\n\"Do you need some help getting up Miss?\"\n\nI looked over to see a small boy, probably only five or six standing next to me with my crotch in his hands. I smiled and thanked him while another group of adults ran over and helped me up.\n\n\"Alright, can I have your attention?\" I called out so everyone could hear me.\n\nHaving so many eyes on me made me pause and swallow my nerves before I could continue.\n\n\"Since the shelter is locked I want you all to hide in the houses. Make sure you stay away from the windows and entrances and stay quiet. Me and Pyrrha are going to head for the front and try to find out what's happening. So stay safe while we're gone.\"\n\n\"Not so fast you young whippersnappers!\" An older gentleman pushed through the crowd before continuing, \"I might not be as young as you kids, but I was a soldier. I can still fight!\"\n\n\"Mr. Bark?\" I asked, not exactly registering what he said.\n\n\"Don't act so surprised,\" He said while turning to Pyrrha, pointing at her DMR, \"These guns you use now, might not have the kick that my old Reaper had, but bullets are still bullets, and people have thinner skulls then grimm.\"\n\nPyrrha reluctantly handed him her rifle. He made a quick inspection of the ammo in the mag, and took account of the crosshair. Much of the crowd was whispering amongst themselves looking at the sight.\n\n\"I don't think you should come, you might get hurt.\" I honestly didn't have a reason for him to go; but he had been my neighbor my whole life and I didn't want to see something happen to him.\n\n\"Bah! So you can fight even though you are injured, yet think I can't because I might?\"\n\n\"Well...\" I trailed off. He might not have been dad, but he sure scorned me like he was.\n\n\"Well I guess that means I'm coming too.\"\n\nEveryone turned toward the center of the crowd. Everyone's gaze was fixed on Doctor Arneke, who was pulling out a revolver from under his coat.\n\n\"I think I can make this piece of trash work.\" Someone called from the side, picking up one of the unconscious soldier's weapons.\n\n\"I'm not just going to sit here twiddling my thumbs when there is some action to be had!\"\n\n\"These punks just put vacancy signs on their asses, and my foot is looking for a room!\"\n\n\"These scrubs need to learn this is our station!\"\n\nOne by one, a group of people stepped forward from the crowd. Each with weapons in their hands. The eight people had a fire in their eyes that I doubt anyone could squash. Pyrrha looked over to me and gave a reassuring nod. With everyone against me I let out a sigh in defeat.\n\n\"Alright, you can come.\"\n\n\"We don't need your permission, we're your elders.\" Mr. Bark humphed.\n\n\"Well we're going to need a plan,\" The one who made the comment about twiddling his thumbs stated.\n\n\"Right, I still think the everyone else should hide in the houses.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" Mr. Bark stated.\n\n\"Don't worry we'll stay out of your way. You focus on showing those bastards what for!\" A women stated, with the crowd nodding and heading for the houses.\n\n\"Alright, now what?\" Doctor Arneke asked.\n\n\"We should divide into four teams. Me and Pyrrha will take point, and then we'll have three groups of three to cover the flanks. We should put the amateurs with the vets.\"\n\n\"I guess I can put up with fighting alongside these dumbasses for a bit, but I'll need to get by works shoes so I don't get these ones scuffed up on their asses.\"\n\n\"Ha! I had to deal with them when I was in the army. The trick is to make sure your instructions are thorough enough that even their thick skulls can understand.\"\n\nEveryone they were referring to gave Mr. Bark a scowl, but him and the other man just shared a small laugh.\n\n\"If you're keeping two in reserve, then I'm guessing you're going to have me in the back?\" Arneke asked.\n\nI nodded and explained, \"If someone's hurt you can quickly move to help them. Plus it'll keep you safer if you aren't in direct line of fire.\"\n\n\"I can understand that logic, any volunteers to play nurse? Preferably someone who's ok with getting some blood on their hands.\"\n\nOne man volunteered. The one next to him offered to trade weapons to things more appropriate to their roles.\n\n\"So are we set?\" Mr. Bark asked, pulling the primer to his weapon.\n\n\"On second,\" Doctor Arneke started, coming over to me, \"That was a bit of a fall, let me check your leg first.\"\n\nI nodded while he raised my skirt so he could get a clear view of my legs. Fortunately, I wasn't wearing my stockings so I wouldn't have to strip so he could get a good look. He rolled his hand up my leg, pinching it every few inches, making me wince every time.\n\n\"Alright, looks fine. Your bone is healing nicely. Just make sure you don't do anything too reckless, the structure is still a little frail, so I doubt it could take that kind of pressure a second time for a little while.\"\n\nI nodded to him in acknowledgement. He then turned to face the rest of the group and asked if they had any pains he should look at.\n\n\"Only if you're a love doctor.\" The man with the enemy soldier's gun joked.\n\n\"I got a crick in my neck if you want to get that for me.\" The second veteran said, making his own joke.\n\n\"Get contacts, and wash your face to get rid of that acne and you should have women able to tolerate you; at the least. You look like a complete nerd.\" He commented, while walking over to the other joker.\n\nHe swiftly grabbed the man by the sides of his head. Flicking it to the side both ways he was rewarded with loud cracks from his neck, both ways. The gentleman groaned, rubbing his neck of the new sensation. He then swiped his bronze hand over his face and through his white full beard. A soft, self inflicted smack to the face and he thanked the doctor for his help.\n\n\"Anything else?\"\n\nThere was no reply this time. Seeing we were all good, he nodded for me to take the lead.\n\n\"Mr. Bark will take the left side of the street, while...\" Looking to the other man not knowing his name.\n\n\"I guess you kids get the honor of fighting with Brun on the right.\" He said pridefully pointing his thumb at himself.\n\n\"Alright we all know what to do. So let's go!\" The man who volunteered to help Arneke shouted.\n\n\"Alright, let's go!\" I agreed turning around and leading the way toward the probably now destroyed entrance of the metro station.\n\nSorry this took so long to write. I was struggling to get through because of the set up I originally had, finally I decided to change the start of the chapter and BOOM it all spilled out of my brain. Hopefully next chapter wont take so long, but you know real life and such. Also I was playing through 2033 (original release) and finished the game. They got rid of the \"good\" ending, I'm guessing it's because last light picked an ending and so they patched it out so if you went from 2033 to last light you wouldn't feel like your choice was pointless, but still, they could have just said the other one is the Cannon ending before you moved on.\n\nAlright who are all the people who helped edit this? /u/Challos, /u/Dekktheodst, I think /u/Spartacus400 too. If not just consider it an extra thank you for the other things you've helped me with.\n\nTill next time Review + Follow; Cheers.",
  "latent_425": "There’s no denying it. Left-handers are the odd ones out.\n\nSure, lefties make up about 10 percent of the population — but, frankly, it seems like society has forgotten about them. Just consider all of the right-handed gadgets, awkwardly designed desks, and cooking tools that fit comfortably only in your right hand.\n\nWhat causes someone to become a southpaw? Scientists aren’t exactly sure, but research points to a complex collaboration between genes and environment. While no exact set of “leftie genes” have been discovered, people who dominantly use their left hands do have more left-handed family members. And researchers have found different brain wirings in righties vs. lefties.\n\nBut no matter what it is that drives someone to use their antipodal paw, science has also uncovered a particular set of personality traits that left-handed people tend to have. So for all of you lefties, leftie-loving righties, and ambidextrous folks out there — it’s time to brush up on your left-handed knowledge and help put an end to leftie discrimination once and for all.",
  "latent_471": "11/11/2015 CIUDAD DE M�?XICO.- En la zona urbana de Acapulco, Guerrero, otras tres escuelas cerraron por temor a las extorsiones, luego de que los docentes han denunciado que grupos del crimen organizado quieren cobrarles cuotas en el periodo en el que se hace entrega de sus aguinaldos.\n\nDe acuerdo los propios maestros, este es el décimo año en que grupos del crimen organizado acuden a las escuelas de Acapulco a extorsionarlos y robarles el aguinaldo. Los profesores tienen la instrucción del Gobierno de Guerrero que cuando esto pase, se concentren en las oficinas centrales. Así lo confirmó el delegado de Servicios Educativos en la Región de Acapulco-Coyuca de Benítez, José Luis Ramírez Flores.\n\nDe acuerdo con el diario local El Sur, las instituciones educativas que cerraron fueron el Colegio de Bachilleres (Cobach) 16, de la populosa colonia Emiliano Zapata, así como el jardín de niños Miguel Alemán Valdés, y la Telesecundaria Manuel Quiroz Cabrera, ubicadas en la colonia Postal.\n\nA los padres de familia y alumnos se les informó que las labores se reanudarán hasta �??nuevo aviso�?�, sin otorgar más información.\n\nEntrevistado por el rotativo, el Secretario de Educación estatal, José Luis González de la Vega Otero, informó que está visitando escuelas y que la próxima semana estará en las ubicadas en las colonias Emiliano Zapata y Renacimiento, para informarles que se está dando el seguimiento al problema de la inseguridad que se ha suscitado durante los últimos días en los planteles educativos.\n\n�??Estamos accionando para que no vuelva a suceder y sobre todo, evitar que estos hechos lamentables afecten la vida escolar�?�, dijo González de la Vega.\n\nEl funcionario estatal indicó que las clases se reanudarán una vez que estén dadas las condiciones. Además dijo que en este momento existen recorridos de la Gendarmería y el Ejército. El Sur realizó un recorrido por las escuelas, y pudo constatar que los planteles educativos se encuentran vacíos y algunas no tienen letreros para anunciar cuándo se reanudarán las clases.\n\nEn la primaria Artículo 27, turno matutino, ubicada en la Zapata, que comparte instalaciones con la escuela vespertina Plan de Ayala, ubicadas en la calle 13 de la colonia Emiliano Zapata, se cumplieron cuatro días sin clases, después de que fueran suspendidas el jueves 5 de noviembre. Ese día hombres armados ingresaron a la escuela para pedir cobro de piso y parte del aguinaldo de los maestros.\n\nTambién la escuela vespertina Plan de Ayutla, que en la mañana recibe el nombre de Tierra y Libertad, continua sin clases, indica El Sur. Mientras que la secundaria técnica 200 cumplió tres días sin clases, porque el viernes 6 de noviembre ingresaron hombres armados para extorsionarlos.\n\nEl pasado martes el Cobach 16, el jardín de niños Miguel Alemán Valdés y la telesecundaria Manuel Quiroz Cabrera, que el lunes 9 sí habían tenido clases, se unieron a la suspensión de clases.\n\nAntes, el lunes por la tarde, se informó que en la primaria Adolfo López Mateos, de Renacimiento, varios hombres armados intentaron ingresar a la escuela, por lo que el martes los padres de familia tuvieron una reunión, donde acordaron pedir la presencia del Ejército.\n\nMAESTROS PIDEN SEGURIDAD\n\nEn entrevista con Grupo Fórmula, el delegado de Servicios Educativos en la Región de Acapulco-Coyuca de Benítez, José Luis Ramírez Flores, pidió a las policías y fuerzas federales el resguardo de las escuelas en esta época de entrega de aguinaldo, porque �??es cuando el crimen organizado aprovecha para extorsionarlos y aseguró que hasta ahora no han cerrado ningún centro educativo en la zona�?�.\n\nTras informar que ya son seis escuelas que han sido víctimas de la delincuencia, indicó que este problema ocurre desde hace diez años, pero a medida que ha pasado el tiempo estas acciones del crimen han aumentado.\n\n�??En el caso de las escuelas, en este momento no tenemos escuelas cerradas, pero ha habido cierres momentáneos o por horas, mientras pasa el susto, sin embargo, ellos siguen trabajando. La ética profesional de muchos de nuestros compañeros los hacer, con ese temor, seguir trabajando, eso sí lo puedo asegurar�?�, aseguró en la entrevista.\n\nEl delegado también aseguró que las autoridades del gobierno de Guerrero tienen pleno conocimiento de la situación y están en coordinación con los cuerpos de seguridad y a raíz de estos sucesos la Gendarmería ha estado haciendo sus rondines en esas escuelas, así como la fuerza pública del municipio, además de los soldados y los marinos.\n\nSobre el modus operandi de los delincuentes, dijo que han entrado a las escuelas a mano armada, organizados, y que en el caso de una primaria �??entraron dos hombres, y dos los esperaron afuera en un auto y se arrancaron, le quitaron las pertenencias al director, a algunos maestros y se llevaron algunos materiales�?�.\n\n�??El día de ayer en la colonia centro de Acapulco, 20 de Noviembre tengo el reporte de una balacera donde murió una persona, un transeúnte y un joven fue herido, fue una balacera de una hora, y eso ocurrió al lado de la escuela Revolución Social, la lectura que le damos es que debemos incrementar el resguardo de los maestros y los alumnos y por eso hacemos un llamado a las fuerzas de seguridad en general�?�, indicó Ramírez Flores.\n\nPor otra parte, narró el caso de un profesor de la secundaria 200 que se encuentra en la colonia Postal, a quien le pidieron diez mil pesos de su aguinaldo.\n\nEl portal local Notimundo, aseguró que fuentes magisteriales les revelaron que ante la nula presencia de las policías federales y del estado, la delincuencia organizada que opera en la zona han regresado a hacer de las suyas con amenazas y extorsiones al personal docente.\n\n�??Ahora cumplieron con su amenaza al raptar al profesor, Ulises Omar Fierro de 35 años de la escuela primaria Adolfo López Mateos, que se encuentra en la colonia Renacimiento�?�, aseguró el medio local.\n\nLas fuentes del portal les aseguraron que la extorsiones y secuestros han provocado que los maestros arriesguen su propia integridad personal y la de sus familias, sin que tengan alguna seguridad por algunas corporaciones policíacas que simplemente abandonaron su resguardo.\n\nALCALDE NIEGA EXTORSIONES\n\nEl Alcalde de Acapulco, Evodio Velázquez Aguirre, afirmó en entrevista con Milenio Televisión, que pese a que no hay denuncias de maestros por extorsiones o cobros de piso, ya sostienen reuniones con las instituciones bancarias para garantizar que los docentes gocen de su aguinaldo.\n\nEl Edil manifestó que �??Acapulco está en una condición diferente�?�, al asegurar que los tres niveles de gobierno trabajan en coordinación y �??hay esperanza de la ciudadanía�?�.\n\nA pesar de sus altos índices de violencia, dijo que municipio tiene problemas, �??como los de otras ciudades del país�?�, y �??con las dificultades que se dan con su magnitud de población�?�.\n\nRespecto a que delincuentes extorsionan y cobran piso a los maestros, en vísperas del pago de sus aguinaldos, el funcionario precisó que no hay denuncias penales, �??solo orales�?�, pero aseguró que están atendiendo �??de manera inmediata�?� estos señalamientos.\n\n�??Hay operativos desde hace más de una semana con presencia militar y policiaca. Estamos trabajando de manera conjunta con el Ejército, la Marina, la Policía Federal, la estatal y la municipal alrededor de las escuelas, en la zona conurbada, e introduciendo los operativos a diferentes lugares con violencia�?�, sostuvo.\n\nAl subrayar que �??necesitamos rescatar la confianza de los ciudadanos�?�, los exhortó a denunciar, y adelantó que durante los próximos días presentarán una estrategia municipal llamada Escudo Acapulco, que será la aportación al Plan Nuevo Guerrero en materia de seguridad, y que incluye tres rutas: la operativa, la mejora de los elementos policiacos y la tecnología.",
  "latent_512": "Morning, afternoon or evening to all of you out there on the trail. This is Garret Coliga with another installment of TRACKER, your source for all the latest news, tech and tips in the world of bounty hunting. This broadcast is brought to you by Talisman. Whenever I’m on a hunt, Talisman is the only name I trust with their proven line of armor and shields. Talisman, take the hits.\n\nAs usual, we’re going to start out with the latest HotSheet, our picks of the latest bounties to hit the Guild. Remember all bounties are validated by the Bounty & Capture Division of the UEE Advocacy and are subject to Advocacy and BHG rules. Consult your local Bounty Hunter Guild or law enforcement office for the complete list of available bounties.\n\nFirst out. The smuggling team of Alfredo and Judy just got hit with another mark. Last seen quick-burning through Pyro System in their modded Connie. They paid out of their last one so I would mark them as a low threat. Once they drop off whatever their smuggling, I’ll bet they’ll turn themselves in.\n\nMoving on, Cah Feng, aka Jagged Tooth, has been destroying CommRelays outside the jump points along Kellar’s Run. For those outside of the know, Feng doesn’t much like the Law or anybody that represents it, so be easy on your approach. Word in the hubs is that Feng’s been tapping a pretty healthy SLAM habit, so he’ll be extra twitchy. If you find him, make sure you confront him with shields up and guns hot.\n\nLast there’s Sara Clip, aka Needle, aka Killshot. Seems Sara’s back in the mix after getting slapped with a dime on QuarterDeck. Nice to see the cops guarding the prison world managed to keep her there for a whole three months. This is a high risk jacket. Sara got pinched on multiple counts of murder and piracy. She likes to jack ships to keep Shacklers and Advocacy off her trail, so double-check those reg-tags and, above all, be careful.\n\nRemember, you can always consult your local Bounty Hunter Guild or law enforcement office for the complete list of available bounties, and double-check any bounty before confronting a fugitive, as bounties may have been cleared.\n\nNow, onto our main story for this segment. Many of you Guild members know that the Board is currently locked in a debate regarding entry requirements for prospective new Guild members. For months this has been going on and it seems like the battle lines have pretty much settled to two sides. Now, I know many of my Guild-mates might be sick of this topic, but this is for our viewers out there, our prospective brothers and sisters who would be keen to know what’s happening behind closed doors and how it might affect their application or acceptance into our network.\n\nIn short, it breaks down like this. There has been a very vocal movement in the Guild to lower the requirements for membership. They want to open up the Guild to attract more members, their logic being that the more sanctioned bounty enforcers out in the black, the safer everyone will be since there will be another level of law enforcement to keep a lid on crime. They propose that a percentage of Guild bounties be cleared for non-members. These pilots would need to register with the Guild before attempting to enforce the bounty. If the pilot were to collect blank-number of these bounties, they could earn their way into the Guild.\n\nNow the opposition feels that inviting the public to participate in bounties will be essentially taking money out of the hands of the seasoned veterans who have been paying Guild dues for decades. In fact, proponents of this mentality have introduced a counter-bill that tightens Guild Membership, requiring a series of applications as well as recommendations from three Guild Members of good standing. They feel that in these difficult economic times, that the Guild shouldn’t be “opening the floodgates” to new members when it has enough difficulty finding work for the members it already has.\n\nSo there it is. While it may sound to the non-members that the former situation is obviously preferable as it makes entry into the Guild much easier, there is a trade-off if there are dozens of Guild-rated Hunters scrambling for each low-risk bounty.\n\nBut we want to open it up to you. Drop a message to the show and let us know which way you’re leaning. In the meantime, we’ll take some comms from our listeners in-system, so stick around if you can. If you can’t, you take care and watch your back.",

  "latent_633": "The Turkish government has exercised its censorship chops in banning Twitter in an attempt to quell distribution of anti-government recordings, and in the process has materially popularized the service, to wit: Forbes - Streisand Effect Takes Hold As Turkey Bans Twitter\n\nIn an attempt to halt widespread allegations of corruption, Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has shuttered Twitter – but so ineffectively that the number of tweets sent in the country has remained unaffected. Last night, Erdogan announced that, following a court order, Twitter was now disabled in the country. “We’ll eradicate Twitter,” he said. “I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic.”\n\nLeaked recordings shared on Twitter include one in which Erdogan allegedly instructs his son to dispose of cash [AP] Turkish and global social media users have mocked moves by Turkey's government to restrict access to Twitter. The hashtags #TwitterisblockedinTurkey and #Turkey blockedTwitter became the top trending topics globally on Friday, just hours after the Turkish government imposed the ban. The number of tweets from Turkey reportedly rose by 138 percent as savvy Internet users, including the country's president Abdullah Gul, found it easy to circumvent the shutdown. \"The whole world is laughing at you #ErdoganBlockedTwitter,\" users tweeted, as dozens of images mocking the ban - including one showing Twitter birds covering Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's head in droppings - were shared on the platform. Another popular tweet shared a poster of the prime minister on a Barack Obama campaign poster with the message, \"Yes, we ban\". Erdogan on Thursday night promised to \"root out\" and wipe out\" the social media platform after users published claims of corruption against him. Leaked recordings shared and linked on Twitter include one in which Erdogan allegedly instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police corruption probe.\n\nOne method of ridicule was to go around the the blocking if the Twitter domain name by using Google's DNS (Domain Name Server) services which allowed anxious and potential Twitter users to find the Twitter website through Google's machinations. So, what does the Turkish government do? They blocked Twitter at the IP level and then went so far as to bank Google's DNS. This means that Turkey is attempting to block out a portion of the Internet, to wit: Turkey Blocks Google DNS as Erdogan Defends Twitter Action\n\nNow here comes a quick education for the old fogey-type folk that declare Bitcoin is a bubble, ponzi scheme currency with no intrinsic value. If you recall my many videos that declare the value of Bitcoin is in the protocol, and not the unit of account that everyone is calling a currency, then you may realize that the Bitcoin technology can literally take the Turkish government down.\n\n(go to time market 1:10 in the video for the explanation)\n\nThose that know the Bitcoin protocol well know that it is an ideal method of overcoming centralized control in regards to value transfer. Well, it's easily assumable that website data access is value transfer as well. If anybody in Turkey is reading this, then email me and I'll show you how to step around even Erdogan's Google DNS ban using the Bitcoin derivative known as Namecoin - A peer-to-peer, censorship resistant, alternative DNS root and data storage technology. Using that \"tulip\" technology with \"no intrinsic value\", Namecoin facilitates cryptographically secure decentralized name and data storage.\n\nNow, we all know that Krugman and Roubini and all of the not so technologically inclined macro economists may not believe that Bitcoin, et. al. has any intrinsic value, but if somebody like me led a \"Coin\" revolt in Turkey, do you think Erdogan would believe the economists or me in regards to the intrinsic value of this technology.\n\nIf you think Namecoin can be disruptive to the status quo, you aint't seen nothin' yet. Wait until the launch of UltraCoin, when those little Haitain kids in shacks out trade the Goldman prop desk on that BTC/AU pair trade.\n\nThat's right, I'm teaching 3rd world children how to trade using cryptocurrency derivatives and plain old fashioned derivatives. I'm comfortable pitting them against the names that the developed world worships, as long as its using this new tech. Let's see how they fair...\n\nI just love the smell of creative disruption in the air. These pics were taken after some training sessions in Port au Prince, Haiti this weekend.",

  "latent_967": "At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) this week Microsoft detailed the future of Gaming Across the Microsoft Ecosystem’. During the session, Xbox head Phil Spencer talked about the hologram based device the HoloLens. The glasses use hard augmented reality (AR) to create holograms for the user to interact with. However Spencer stated that first-party videogame developers have been working on content for the device.\n\nPreviously in the unveiling video for the device, the audience saw the applications of videogames. Most notably Minecraft featured as being a new way of playing. Digital Spy wrote that Spencer stated to the audience “that studios are “active” in developing games, and that their efforts are set to be shown this year”. Mainly, HoloLens intends on bringing a new style of interactive environment using this type of ‘hard AR’.\n\nThough the first-party developers working on these titles are yet to be announced, many virtual reality (VR) development teams have expressed a great interest in the device and all it can offer the videogaming community. The HoloLens itself was shown in use not just in videogames, but In creative industries, office environments and general use for apps like Netflix.\n\nCurrently, the release of the device is not known, however evidence suggests that it may be a long while before enthusiasts see a release date.

  "latent_1378": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Austria plans to deploy soldiers at the Brenner border with Italy to stem an expected increase in migrants trying to get to northern Europe, Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil told news outlets on Saturday.\n\nAustrian Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil arrives for a cabinet meeting in Vienna, Austria, February 16, 2016. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader\n\nAustria, whose introduction of border restrictions in February has caused a sharp fall in the number of migrants to Germany, previously said it was preparing to introduce tighter controls if needed. But the minister’s choice of words appeared to toughen the discourse.\n\n“As the EU’s external borders are not yet effectively protected, Austria will soon ramp up strict border controls. That means massive border controls at the Brenner (Pass), and with soldiers,” Doskozil told daily Die Welt.\n\nSeparately, he told the Austrian newspaper Oesterreich he was leaving open-ended the number of soldiers who might be deployed for border duty at the Alpine pass, saying it would be based on need.\n\n“From the state of Tyrol alone, there are three companies with 100 men each ready to deploy,” Doskozil told Oesterreich. “If we need more forces for border protection, we’ll get them.”\n\nSoldiers, already helping police handle migrants at borders, could help with border protection, migrant registrations, the humanitarian effort and deportations, he said.\n\nDoskozil also reiterated his call for a civil-military EU mission to support the bloc’s border agency Frontex where needed at external borders, possibly in Greece, Bulgaria or Italy.\n\nWith the main migrant route through the Balkans and Austria largely closed, the number of migrants entering Germany from Austria fell more than sevenfold in March to below 5,000, the interior ministry in Berlin said on Saturday.\n\nIn February, 38,570 migrants arrived, already down sharply from 64,700 in January. Austria is the main entry point for migrants crossing into Germany.\n\nBut Vienna believes new routes will develop through Bulgaria or Albania as Mediterranean crossings to Italy from Libya resume.\n\nOn Monday, a deal takes effect between the EU and Turkey that is aimed at stopping the flow of migrants to Europe in return for political and financial rewards for Ankara, sealing off the main route by which a million migrants crossed the Aegean into Greece last year.\n\n“We expect strong use to be made of the central Mediterranean route in the coming weeks,” said Doskozil, adding last week alone 5,000 refugees came that way.\n\n“When the weather gets better, these numbers will increase strongly,” he said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, under pressure to stem the influx of migrants to Germany after 1.1 million arrived last year, is critical of tighter border controls and is banking on the EU-Turkey deal being a success.\n\nUnder that agreement, Germany is to take in 1,600 migrants initially. About 40 people could arrive on Monday, said an interior ministry official.\n\nCritics say the deal may make Europe soften its line towards Ankara on human rights, while aid agencies say safeguards needed to start returning refugees to Turkey from next week — also part of the agreement — are not yet in place.",
  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\n(This essay was originally posted on the game design website Lostgarden.com.)\n\nBack in the 80’s and 90’s, when conversation about game design was first bubbling up out of our community of inexperienced practitioners, a few polarizing topics would arise again and again. You’ll recognize them:\n\nThe correct definition of ‘game’\n\nNarrative vs Mechanics\n\nRandomness vs Skill\n\nThe importance of realism\n\nCasual vs Hardcore\n\nMany were (and are) merely the irritated observations of game players picking at specific games. However, with a flip of the rhetorical switch, players become designers expressing a universal design truth. Opinions inevitably differ and thus positions harden in the absence of data. And it snowballs from there.\n\nThankfully, as a developer community, we've grown older. With time and the accumulation of thousands published games, experienced game makers have a lot more insight into how game design actually works. It turns out there’s plenty of room for nuance.\n\nThere’s also the growing maturity to ignore false dichotomies and worn out talking points. We could instead spend our precious time making great games. And then take that practical knowledge to build working theories that help us all reach further.\n\nIn the spirit of becoming a forward looking game designer, here are my top 5 design debates that I've ignored in 2014.\n\n#1 The correct definition of 'Game'\n\nI've seen a metric ton of definitions for game over the years and have dabbled in crafting them myself. Not a single one has been useful to me in my daily practice of making great games.\n\nWhy this discussion is exhausted\n\nGames are vast and varied. A single definition tends have one or more of the following issues:\n\nOverly broad : The definition is unable to provide any direction or guidance.\n\n: The definition is unable to provide any direction or guidance. Overly narrow : The definition eliminates useful tools and influences from other areas of systems, thought or art. Per project constraints can often be beneficial, but they should be mischieveously broken as often as they are forged.\n\n: The definition eliminates useful tools and influences from other areas of systems, thought or art. Per project constraints can often be beneficial, but they should be mischieveously broken as often as they are forged. Overly convoluted: The definition is only useful to lawyers who care primarily about edge cases and not about getting things done.\n\nAlternative discussions to have instead\n\nI focus on finding and exploring useful design tools. I don’t need to care about the definition of ‘woodworking’ in order to be damned happy that hammers and nails exist. The same goes for games. I focus on scaffolding. And loot drop tables. And internal economies.\n\nA useful goal is to find general tools that a smart designer can use to radically improve their work.\n\nContext matters : Like most tools, they should to be applied in the proper context. So they are rarely universal or one-size fits all.\n\n: Like most tools, they should to be applied in the proper context. So they are rarely universal or one-size fits all. Execution matters: And like a craft tool, they need to be applied with skill. They aren’t a playbook pattern that you toss at a problem and get a fixed result.\n\nRecommendation: Build your flexible design toolbox. Master those tools. Apply them where appropriate. Ignore pedants obsessed with defining ‘game’.\n\n#2 Narrative vs mechanics\n\nScience was once plagued by the idea that certain behavior derived entirely from genetics (nature) or entirely from environmental effects (nurture). This turned out to be a naive simplification of a vastly most intricate and interrelated system genetic predispositions, environmental triggers and feedback loops. Narrative (the telling of stories) and mechanics (the systems of cause and effect) have proven to be similarly intertwined.\n\nWhy this discussion is exhausted\n\nIn the end, the human brain has neither a pure systemic understanding the world. Nor does it have a purely narrative understanding of the world. Memory, learning, emotional triggers, cause and effect all feed into how our brain adapts to environmental mechanics and then flow out again as a social response.\n\nSo the model suggested by the supposed conflict is simply broken. There is no ‘versus’.\n\nThere are many explanations for how this argument even arose. My favorite: A cocky tribe from old linear media clashed with an isolated tribe of game makers. They fought a stupid fight about authority and status that had almost nothing to do with making games. Meh.\n\nAlternative discussions to have instead\n\nA modern discussion could include:\n\nWhat existing schemas are activated by my game?\n\nHow should we implement learning and scaffolding structures?\n\nWhat is the impact of various forms of stimuli within game loops?\n\nHow should we tighten or loosen our systems of cause and effect?\n\nWhat are systems of pacing?\n\nWhat are some practical edge cases? Chris Bateman wrote a worthy essay that's a great example of this type of discussion.\n\nWhat social role does narrative serve? How can we engineer human systems to encourage it?\n\nTheories like Interaction Loops or Emotion Engineering integrate narrative and mechanics. In the process of banging our heads against building great interactive experiences, we've been forced to break down ‘narrative’ and ‘mechanics’ into atomic chunks and see how they fit in practice. Let’s discuss the rich synthesis of story, world building and mechanical techniques that thrives in interactive systems.\n\nRecommendation: Consider how narrative emerges from existing mechanics. And consider how theme illuminates mechanics by activating existing mental schema. We need holistic, integrated models. Ignore antagonistic dichotomies.\n\n#3 Randomness vs Skill\n\nThere’s been a sad resurgence of this 80’s wargamer rant. Randomness is obsessively derided as less masterful or strategic relative to pure skill games.\n\nWhy this discussion is exhausted\n\nRandomness is just another design tool. Used with skill, it yields some amazing games. As a society, we've time and time again demonstrated our love for wonderful games like Civilization, MMOs, match-3 and cards games of all forms. From puzzle games to strategy games, randomness is here to stay and for good reasons.\n\nRandom systems are rife with mastery . ‘Randomness’ can provide strong elements of mastery, in terms of learning distributions, managing options and adapting to new situations. Even slot machines are engineered for mastery (via near miss distributions). In game design, all dice are loaded.\n\n. ‘Randomness’ can provide strong elements of mastery, in terms of learning distributions, managing options and adapting to new situations. Even slot machines are engineered for mastery (via near miss distributions). In game design, all dice are loaded. Games involve loops. Random outputs almost never occurs in isolation, but are part of an internal game economy. Randomness is often an essential tool for creating strategic variation and context.\n\nRandom outputs almost never occurs in isolation, but are part of an internal game economy. Randomness is often an essential tool for creating strategic variation and context. There are different, equally valid playstyles. Not everyone is a rigidly intellectual young man who desires only mental-skill games that let them dominate others. Some play to relax, some to socialize, some for physical mastery, some to feel part of a shared purpose. Randomness can be a beneficial tool when designing for these players.\n\nAlternate discussions\n\nWhat games use randomness in interesting ways?\n\nHow does your game use randomness as skill?\n\nHow does randomness map onto noise?\n\nWhat are other noise generators? Complexity noise, social noise, feedback noise, etc.\n\nHow do we make people better through play?\n\nRecommendation: Practice using randomness where appropriate. Explore the space. Make a game with randomness that is about mastery. If you happen to be someone that values intellectual rigor over chance, make a game for someone other than yourself. Stretch your humanity.\n\n#4 Realism\n\nPast futurists sold a vision where games must inevitably become indistinguishable from reality. We marketed the hell out of that vision to the point it became dogma. You bought a new console, a new video card, a new computer to creep ever closer to the dream. You argued for 1080p as a paladin fighting for the glorious Holodeckian cause.\n\nWhy this discussion is exhausted\n\nRealism in graphics or simulations no longer is a dominant goal for most game developers. In practice, it turned out it wasn't really an essential feature for a successful games. In our far future era, you can snub realism and still make a billion dollars with a game like Minecraft or Puzzle & Dragons.\n\nRealism has niche appeal. It is an aesthetic choice that tends to appeal to a singular sub-culture that we've trained with our decades of marketing. Cartoons, text and other stylized forms of representation are also appealing.\n\nIt is an aesthetic choice that tends to appeal to a singular sub-culture that we've trained with our decades of marketing. Cartoons, text and other stylized forms of representation are also appealing. Realism can be an unnecessary expense . We sometimes wholesale replicate reality when we don’t know what specific stimuli actually appeals to players. It is sort of a shotgun approach that wastes vast amount of effort to hopefully make something interesting. A substantial portion of the exponential escalating cost of game development can be attributed directly to the pursuit of realism.\n\n.

It is sort of a shotgun approach that wastes vast amount of effort to hopefully make something interesting. A substantial portion of the exponential escalating cost of game development can be attributed directly to the pursuit of realism. Simulation adds design risk : Many simulations are complex and difficult to manipulate. They also are not inherently emotionally satisfying. Insisting on mechanical realism while simultaneously trying to make a fun game tends to yield failed game designs.\n\n: Many simulations are complex and difficult to manipulate. They also are not inherently emotionally satisfying. Insisting on mechanical realism while simultaneously trying to make a fun game tends to yield failed game designs. Games are also endogenous systems of value . They are like little self contained baubles of math that set up interesting internal relationships. A game like Tetris has immensely value independent of references to the real world.\n\n. They are like little self contained baubles of math that set up interesting internal relationships. A game like Tetris has immensely value independent of references to the real world. When players ask for realism, they often aren't asking for realism. The desire for realism is often best understood in terms of how players learn and apply existing mental schema to new system. A request for realism could be: A new player asking for a metaphor that helps them understand an abstract system. Or it could be an advanced player pointing out unnecessary edge cases. Both these have solutions outside belabored realism.\n\nAlternative discussions to have instead\n\nWhat is the right art style for your audience?\n\nWhat are the trade offs between art style, production concerns and budget?\n\nWhat sort of math or systems are interesting independent of their appearance in the real world?\n\nHow do we make game-like, cartoon-like, info rich, surreal virtual reality games?\n\nRecommendation: Ask what utilitarian feedback your game truly needs. Invest your art resources making those elements amazing. Ask what level of modeling a system needs to create rich gameplay. Invest your design resources to create a tiny rule set with deep emergence. Be smart. Be frugal. When someone demands realism, try to figure out what they really want.\n\n#5 Casual vs Hardcore\n\nThere’s a set of cultural stereotypes that casual players act one way while hardcore players act another. A surprising number of design decisions are made based off these stereotypes.\n\nWhy this discussion is exhausted\n\nThe casual and hardcore stereotypes suffer from the problems typical of stereotypes. They are gross simplifications that yield the incorrect design decisions.\n\nMany of the stereotypes are simply wrong : The longest average playtimes? Not console or PC. Handheld games, particularly those ‘kiddy’ Nintendo titles dominate session length. Regular daily play happens more often on smartphones and tablets than it does on consoles. When I look at data, there are very few ‘casual’ or ‘hardcore’ stereotypes that hold true. And when they do there are massive exceptions.\n\n: The longest average playtimes? Not console or PC.

When I look at data, there are very few ‘casual’ or ‘hardcore’ stereotypes that hold true. And when they do there are massive exceptions. The variation within a specific game is huge : You've got a half dozen or more distinct playstyles within almost any game of reasonable complexity. Each game is a vast city with many different people living within it. Mere averages tell you very little about how to improve the state of your game.\n\n: You've got a half dozen or more distinct playstyles within almost any game of reasonable complexity. Mere averages tell you very little about how to improve the state of your game. The market is shifting: Service-based games are driving for improved retention by doubling down on play. Women are playing more. Console owners are aging and slowing down. A lot of the old lessons about demographics and play styles have shifted. And they’ll continue to change in the future.\n\nI see ‘casual’ or ‘hardcore’ as poisoned tribal labels like ‘gamer’ or ‘skinner box’. Mostly they are just weaponized stereotypes, deployed to enforce perceived group boundaries. They have little productive place in a modern design (or marketing) discussion.\n\nAlternative discussions to have instead\n\nHow do you break out of thinking in cheap stereotypes in order to gain an advantage over the dinosaurs that don't see the market has it truly exists?\n\nHow do different groups unique to your game behave? (Hint: We can get the data!)\n\nWhat motivates the groups unique to your game?\n\nHow do you include diverse hooks to appeal to multiple passionate audiences?\n\nHow do you make a targeted niche game using iteration with a live community?\n\nI personally tend to make games that look 'casual', but consistently melt the brains of self identified 'hardcore' players trained on endless tutorials, cut scenes and QTEs. Some of the best players are smart 30-40-year old women that have the intense mental stamina for activities like logic, planning and creative thinking. They thrive on hard games. My market doesn't even exist if you see the world through a 'casual / hardcore' lens. Yet there it is, merrily enjoying games amidst the vast diversity of this planet's billion odd players.\n\nRecommendation: No one really makes 'hardcore' or 'casual' games. At best, we use existing markets, tribes and distribution channels to get a tentative foothold in a player’s psyche. But then it gets complicated. Embrace the complexity of your players. Learn who they actually are. Create elegant solutions that serve your many types of players.\n\nThoughts for 2015\n\nIf you happen to find yourself facing these 5 topics: Turn away. Our creative lives are limited. Pour your time into something productive.\n\nTeachers that spread these memes : Consider teaching modern game design tools. Cull disproved dogma.\n\n: Consider teaching modern game design tools. Cull disproved dogma. Academics that expound on these ideas : Stop naive theory crafting and start referencing nuanced data from working designers.\n\n: Stop naive theory crafting and start referencing nuanced data from working designers. Game design students that gnaw at these bones: Arguing ancient talking points in comment sections gets you nowhere in life. Make games instead. Base your design conversations around your hands-on experiments. You'll learn more, faster.\n\nGoodness knows that conversations on depleted design ideas will not end. Players and their innumerable derivatives (fan press, forum warriors, cultural critics, etc) continue talking about these topics. Some talk for entertainment. Some for status. Some for business. Some talk about their game experiences in order to process them mentally and emotionally. For many of these purposes, simplistic polarizing hooks are more enticing than deep comprehension.\n\nSo these inane design views become practically tradition, or at least common hazing rituals. Like yelling at televised football games. Or laughing at trucknuts. Sure, players aren't having a productive craft conversation, but they shouldn't be judged by the same rubric. Consider their chatter a cultural performance.\n\nAs for game designers, you have a different role to fill. Recognize when you are accidentally acting like a uninformed player or student. Instead of getting caught up in the babble of ill-informed internet backwash, try talking directly with other working designers. Build tools and knowledge together.\n\nHere's to a more productive 2015,\n\nDanc.",

(А вы говорите, что может сделать небольшая фракция в Госдуме и какая разница, будет ли у ЕР большинство или нет — большая разница, даже сегодня, не говоря уже про завтра.)Что же это за бюджет такой, который даже лояльные Путину депутаты толком не хотят принимать? Действительно, там есть от чего волосам встать дыбом.— чтобы вам проще было разобраться в отдельных статьях, я свел важные расходы в одну табличку, в сравнении с дкризисным бюджетом 2008 года, чтобы было понятно, что и насколько выросло (материалы бюджета-2016, принятого в первом чтении, здесь ):Как видно, статья «Национальная безопасность и правоохранительная деятельность» выросла с 2008 года по расходам почти втрое, причем расходы на органы внутренних дел — более чем в три раза (привет «реформе МВД» имени Д.А.Медведева). На этом фоне, замечу, преступность растет В целом, как вы можете увидеть, кратно наращивались расходы на всех силовиков — полиция, внутренние войска, прокуроры и следователи, ФСИН, МЧС, «контроль за оборотом наркотиков» (смертность от наркотиков в России только по официальным данным 90 тыс человек в год), расходы на миграционные службы (привет визовой политике открытых дверей).Еще один «чемпион роста» — статья «Национальная экономика». Это вот все те самые государственные прожекты, которые финансируются за наш с вами счет — «мосты в никуда», пустующие олимпийские объекты, и так далее. Это вообще ненормально, что государство так много на себя взяло в плане финансирования экономики — экономику должен финансировать частный бизнес, именно провал с созданием в России благоприятных условий для инвестиций и приводит к тому, что эти дыры затыкают за счет средств налогоплательщиков.Там есть и полезные вещи (дороги, поддержка сельхозпроизводителей и т.д. — хотя и на строительстве дорог можно сереьзно сэкономить за счет конкуренции, борьбы с коррупцией и откатами, о чем писал Навальный ), но в бюджете-2016 по этой крупнейшей экономической статье (которая превышает примерно в 5 раз расходы и на образование, и на здравоохранение) заложены всякие вот такие интересные штуки:Ну а также госпрограмма социально-экономического развития Крымского федерального округа на 132 млрд руб, и помощь Абхазии и Южной Осетии на 16 млрд.Там много еще чего интересного, в бюджете, но вот что характерно, расходы по статье «Управление делами Президента РФ» (46 млрд) кратно даже собственно расходы на «Функционирование Президента Российской Федерации» (почти 17 млрд) — не слишком ли дороговато нам эта президентская власть обходится??? Задумаешься тут лишний раз о переходе к парламентской республике))И еще один чемпион по росту расходов — более чем вдвое за 8 лет — «поддержка СМИ». Ну куда же без нее, народу же надо правильно объяснить, что во всем этом Обама виноват., родное и любимое. Вы вот смеетесь над телеканалом «Звезда», а он дотацию в 1 млрд из бюджета получит в следующем году — а у вас нет миллиарда, так что вы идете сами знаете куда.Но это все было бы смешно, если бы не было так грустно, так как(триллион на двоих из 16 трлн). Россия занимает 95-е место в мире по расходам на медицину как % от ВВП (6,5%), пропуская намного вперед не только Украину (7,8%), но и многие африканские страны.Практически на том же уровне, как и в 2008 году, остается уровень прямых бюджетных трансфертов регионам — хотя основные налоги собираются там, дефицит региональных бюджетов уже огромен",

  "latent_1952": "After weeks dominated by the dysfunctional launch of his most important piece of legislation reforming the national health care system, Barack Obama on Wednesday tried to nudge the national spotlight on a deeper issue: the still growing gaps in income and opportunity between the richest Americans and the rest of the country.\n\nCiting the words and deeds of presidents past — Democrats and Republicans alike — Obama equated income disparity as measured by an array of economic statistics as the “defining challenge of our time.”\n\nReturning to an issue he highlighted in his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama said he wanted to dispel three myths about inequality he believes are keeping Americans from engaging with the issue: 1) that inequality primarily affects poor racial minorities; 2) that growing the economy and increasing equality are mutually exclusive; and 3) that the US government can't do anything about reducing inequality.\n\n\"The decades-long shifts in the economy have hurt all groups,\" Obama said before a friendly audience at the Center for American Progress, a liberal Washington think tank. \"Some of the shifts that were once attributed to the urban poor…it turns out now we're seeing that pop up everywhere.\"\n\nJust days after Pope Francis issued an apostolic exhortation eviscerating the “dictatorship of an impersonal economy lacking a truly human purpose,” Obama argued that government programs like Social Security and unemployment benefits are essential safety nets preserving the chance for Americans to move up in society, while casting the Affordable Healthcare Act as a positive step toward reducing inequality. He also advocated a \"middle class economics\" that prioritizes investment in public education, protection of workers' rights including strengthening collective bargaining laws and raising the national minimum wage.\n\nMore from GlobalPost: 'The Great Divide' — A Special Report on global income inequality\n\nObama noted that since he graduated from high school in the late 1970s, the US economy had roughly doubled in size, and yet more than half of the income created in the process went to the top 10 percent of American families.\n\nIndeed, studies consistently indicate that US income disparity has been growing almost unabated since about 1970, accelerating during the 1980s and peaking just before the 2009 financial crisis, when they reached a level not seen since the crash of 1929.\n\nThe recession that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers caused a temporary halt in the growth of the gap, but subsequent numbers suggest that the gap has again started to grow.\n\nWhat’s more, separate studies show that the children of middle class and poor Americans are less likely than ever to attain the next rung on the economic ladder — a stark rebuke to the notion of the American Dream.\n\n“A child born in the top 20 percent has about a 2-in-3 chance of staying at or near the top,” Obama said. “A child born into the bottom 20 percent has a less than 1-in-20 shot at making it to the top. He’s 10 times likelier to stay where he is,” he continued, adding that children from Germany, France and Canada now stand a far better chance of advancement.\n\n“The combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American Dream, our way of life and what we stand for around the globe. And it is not simply a moral claim that I’m making here. There are practical consequences to rising inequality and reduced mobility.”\n\nEconomists have tracked and debated the causes and the significance of the trend for decades.\n\nBut the idea that wealth disparity in America had reached Third World proportions certainly did qualify. In a recent series (and an upcoming ebook), The Great Divide, GlobalPost correspondents found that the levels of inequality in many American communities are approaching those of the emerging world.\n\nUsing the standard economic measure of income inequality known as the Gini coefficient, the series showed that many American cities now rank so poorly that they now have emerging world statistical doppelgangers — cities in countries just emerging from decades of dictatorship, dysfunction or worse whose income disparities precisely mirror those of American communities.\n\nObama echoed these concerns in Wednesday’s remarks. America, he said, faces “a dangerous and growing inequality and lack of upward mobility that has jeopardized middle-class America’s basic bargain that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead. I believe this is the defining challenge of our time: making sure our economy works for every working American.”",
  "latent_2058": "PDGA Ends Formal Relationship With WFDF\n\nWhat's next for disc golf's international growth?\n\nCiting its own growth and a disparity in resources, the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) terminated its membership with the World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) after a little more than two years, the organization announced Wednesday.\n\nThe two governing bodies originally entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in January 2014, with the purpose of expanding disc golf’s international reach.\n\nPDGA Executive Director Brian Graham attributed the move to the PDGA’s prosperity since the original agreement.\n\n“The PDGA international program grew by an astounding 40 percent in 2015,” Graham said via email. “WFDF is a great organization, but with all due respect they are much smaller than the PDGA and have limited resources. So in order to maintain our momentum, we felt that it is in the best interest of our sport if we were to pursue our goals in growing disc golf internationally outside the constraints of a formal relationship with them.”\n\nThe WFDF, according to the organization’s 2015 Census data, has 156,956 active members in 51 affiliated countries and at the end of 2014 reported net assets of $326,441. It does not collect individual membership fees.\n\nThe PDGA, per minutes from its 2015 Fall Summit, has only 27,265 active members in 38 countries, but – in part because it collects individual membership fees – counts more than $1.2 million in assets.\n\nWFDF President Robert “Nob” Rauch said the PDGA never hinted that breaking the MOU was on the horizon.\n\n“We received the 30-day notice of termination letter in late January without any previous alert the PDGA board was contemplating such a move,” he said.\n\nDespite the divorce, neither organization has abandoned disc golf’s Olympic dream.\n\n“WFDF will continue to seek Olympic acceptance for all disc sports, including disc golf,” Graham said. “The reality is that only two disc sports have the numbers to be anywhere near being considered as an Olympic sport – ultimate and disc golf.”\n\nRauch confirmed the WFDF would maintain its pledge to help disc golf qualify as a future Olympic event under its Flying Disc International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognition, even if it may be more challenging without the PDGA.\n\n“Things will be a bit trickier, but we hope to ensure that we can get disc golf on track in connection with our Olympic Movement aspirations,” Rauch said. “The IOC has made it clear that it wants to have related disciplines governed under a broader sport umbrella…We believe it is important to start getting disc golf into the discussion, and to do that we will have to build a track record of world championships with broad geographic coverage.”\n\nIn response to criticism on social media, Graham reiterated that ending the PDGA’s membership was a pragmatic decision.\n\n“I see our withdrawal from WFDF as neither positive nor negative,” Graham said. “It is simply a more effective way for the PDGA to be able to better pursue its goals and continue our exponential growth internationally without outside constraints.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rauch said that both sides plan to continue communicating, even if they are not formally united.\n\n“We have had a couple calls since, and both of us want to strengthen the dialogue and are willing to work together in ways that make sense for our respective organizations and the global disc golf community,” Rauch said.\n\nGraham echoed those sentiments.\n\n“Despite the severing of our official ties, both organizations have pledged to continue to cooperate and work with each other on mutually beneficial projects moving forward,” he said. “Our partnership with WFDF has not ended.”\n\nOne of those projects is the World Team Disc Golf Championship, to be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, from August 18-21, 2016. Both the WFDF and PDGA have vowed to see the event through, and Rauch said he hopes it has a future beyond this year.\n\n“I think that with time this could grow to be an incredible event that would provide elite disc golfers with the pride and honor of representing their national teams and generate a lot of spectator interest, and really ensure that there was growth and development of disc golf in many new countries,” Rauch said.\n\nIn the interim, the PDGA’s decision to withdraw its membership means the WFDF will have to reorganize its disc golf committee.\n\n“We have had to reconstitute the committee from scratch and hope to have a new team in place by later this month if possible, composed of individuals focused on disc golf representing WFDF’s members associations who take a multi-disciplinary approach that includes disc golf,” Rauch said. “We also have offered to have a PDGA representative join the committee as an observer so that we have clear communication on disc golf matters.”\n\nThe WFDF will continue to employ PDGA rules and technical standards in disc golf events, Graham said, and the PDGA will take the WFDF up on its offer to have a representative on the committee.",
  "latent_2082": "MEET Sidney Torres IV, the suave New Orleans businessman who is taking policing the city’s crime-ridden streets into his own hands.\n\nThe wealthy real estate developer was sick of the painfully slow police response to widespread gunfights, theft and drug offences, so he created an Uber-style app to clean up his neighbourhood.\n\nHe bought a fleet of black Polaris Rangers, fitted with blue flashing lights and iPads to deal with requests, and hired off-duty police officers as his team. The former waste disposal mogul, who managed a network of garbage trucks, told The New York Times: “I’m handling crime the same way I did trash.”\n\nTorres’s foray into cleaning up New Orleans began when his home in the affluent French Quarter was burgled, just weeks before the bar next door was held up at gunpoint.\n\nThe self-assured 39-year-old responded with a $100,000 TV ad demanding action to from the mayor, Mitch Landrieu, to make residents feel safe again — featuring locals discussing their fears for the city. When the mayor challenged Torres to put his money where his mouth was, the entrepreneur came up with his daring solution.\n\nHe spent $US380,000 setting up his app in the French Quarter, and within six weeks, almost 10,000 people had downloaded it — twice the population of the area.\n\nUsers can describe an unfolding crime and the mobile interface will mark the incident as a red dot, and Torres’s private patrol squad, the French Quarter Task Force, as a green arrow. The aim is to always have three officers circling the neighbourhood of just one square mile, so they can respond within two minutes, where the police can take about 30.\n\nThe project is endorsed by the New Orleans Police Department, which has shrunk by about 500 officers since Hurricane Katrina, and many in the city welcome this injection of private cash.\n\nThe head of the Louisiana State Police even invited Torres to sit in on an undercover sting targeting human traffickers at a French Quarter hotel.\n\nBut other locals are concerned about the privatisation of policing, and fear that putting so much power in the hands of a man once known as “Trashanova” could stoke tensions.\n\nTorres recently worked with the city on moving on the “transient people” who loiter about the streets, usually not committing crimes but causing something of a nuisance for authorities. Where the city had delayed because of concerns around these people’s dogs, and their issues with diabetes, Torres called an animal protection service and made sure the medicine was available in the city’s prisons.\n\nMany were up in arms about this ruthless destruction of the characters who some see as the beating heart of New Orleans, but Torres believes this bullish approach is vital. “The government loves its rules, so many pointless rules that just slow everything down,” he told The New York Times.\n\nTorres, who compares himself to Bruce Wayne, has now hired retired rocket scientist Bob Simms to act as the Robin to his Batman, overseeing the day-to-day running of the service. He says neighbouring states have already expressed interest in the app, but he makes it clear that he is still very much in control.\n\n“If someone doesn’t show up, I can see it on my phone: Why’s the truck still at the station?” he said. The businessman buys gift certificates to a steak house for officers who have done a good job, something his partners in City Hall worried might create a divide.\n\nWhatever people think, the enterprising plan has been a success, with assaults and armed robberies dropping by 30 per cent in the two months to May, and Torres’s force assisting on state arrests.\n\nThe New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau have agreed to finance the $US900,000-a-year scheme for the next five years. The mayor has hailed the project as part of a wider success story in privatising areas including sewage and recreation programs — saying that the rest of the nation needs to follow suit.\n\nTorres’s disregard for authority and carelessness around sensitive information have raised eyebrows, but there’s no stopping this juggernaut.\n\nSidney Torres is leading the charge to turn cities into slick, efficient, clean machines.",
  "latent_2103": "American Truck Simulator – New Mexico is the latest and first paid expansion for SCS Software’s remarkable fusion of dreamlike roadtrip game and business simulation, which is one of my favourite videogames of all time despite my having almost no interest in motor vehicles. New Mexico adds one of the largest but least-populated states into the mix, with cities including Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Roswell. I’ve been playing it ahead of its release tomorrow.\n\nThis New Mexico is not the America of the movies – at least not all those cowboy movies and 60s road movies that are evoked by American Truck Simulator’s initial California/Nevada/Arizona stomping grounds. New Mexico is more the America of modern television. There’s the Breaking Bad connection, of course, given that Albuquerque is one of the major cities in this latest, state-sized expansion, but it’s more than that. This is anyplace America, not a cinematographer’s America.\n\nThere’s a shortage of widescreen romance in this New Mexico, and instead a quiet sense of not quite desolation, but certainly something lost, something less straight-backed and self-confident. The sort of America we see in contemporary television dramas that flirt with existential angst in modern America – starker places, nowhere places filled with nowhere faces and oppressive, lifeless architecture.\n\nFor instance, though Washington State is doubtless several expansion packs away from release, New Mexico most evoked the recent, incomparable season 3 of Twin Peaks for me. (Or perhaps I have been programmed by that show to respond to on-the-road experiences very differently than before). Which is to say, haunted and lonely rather warm and celebratory.\n\nI did not pursue sights as I did in the other states, but instead followed the trail of a sad murmur that haunts everything from the tacky inflatable roadside aliens in Roswell to the sporadic tumbledown farms amidst the endless, scrubby desert to the almost deadening blankness of places like Las Cruces, Raton, even the weirdly one-note, semi-industrial sprawl of Albuquerque itself.\n\nThe famous Rio Grande river, for instance, was not a dramatic flourish of crystal water, but a brown scar across a concrete land. The New Mexico DLC is not out to impress in that way: it is there to be modern America.\n\nThese are not places that make you sigh and long to be, but places you drive through with a slight shudder, relieved when you have left them and have returned to the dramatic telegraph poles and satellite dishes of the vast, abandoned-feeling land outside.\n\nDoes that sound like I enjoy my time in New Mexico less than I do my time in ATS’ other states? Not a bit of it. When I drive, I drive in search of a mood. In California-Arizona-Nevada, that mood is one of a yearning for freedom: the open road, no masters, no simple life. In New Mexico, that mood is one of almost savage introspection. I don’t want to stop in any of these places, I don’t have anywhere particular I want to reach: I just want to drive, and think, and mourn for lost things and lost people both real and imagined. It is purgatorial rather than a liberty song.\n\nThis is not to say that New Mexico (or, at least, this rendition of it – I can’t speak to how accurately it has recreated the feel of the place) is ugly, or without beauty. Many of the towns and cities are deeply dour places – too stark, too uniform, and without a personality of their own – but the land around them is grandiose and changeable, if forever fairly arid. There is, I think, a little more detail and variety than in earlier states (this expansion brought with it many new art assets in addition the land and road itself), and it feels much more like somewhere I want to explore than the other zones did.\n\nI turn off down side roads and unwisely stare out of the window out of curiosity, whereas before I tended to unswervingly A-to-B it. Again: I have seen little that awakens real-life wanderlust in me this time, but I am grateful for the chance to see it here, and doubly grateful that ATS now has an “ooh, I wonder what’s over there?” element that was previously lacking. And, if you do want levity, Roswell’s oddball mix of tackiness and civic blandness is a treat for the wry eye.\n\nThe downside of this small step up in a sometimes slightly sterile game’s sense of life is that it reveals other limitations too keenly. All this world they’ve made, all these wonderful/bleak sights, but I can only really see it from within a cab and after extensive fiddling with camera modes. I don’t want ATS to evolve into some kind of city sim, because to undermine the purity of its road might just destroy it, but as it slowly looks better and better, it feels increasingly absurd that there isn’t some kind of first-person, on-foot mode.\n\nI don’t ask for interaction: I just want to get a better look, and to evoke that other critical element of the road trip, which is getting out to stretch your legs and take the air in a strange new place. It’s not a small thing to ask for, I know, but by this point, with so much world and, if you travel the length of the game, trips this long, it feels by now necessary.\n\nI’ll also raise a call for a better lighting system. Under the hood, American Truck Simulator is still 2012’s Euro Truck Simulator 2, and sometimes it shows. Sunsets and night time look great, the wash of colour or dark hiding a multitude of sins, but in full daylight there is an abiding plainness to those shrubs and skinny trees and acres of beige dust. A little more shadow, a little more variety to the light: again, not a small request, but it could achieve great things.\n\nAs such, New Mexico is paradoxically both everything it needed to be and at the same time merely a roadside motel halfway to some better destination. Its combination of heightened detail and less iconic, therefore more authentic-feeling scenery makes it an essential puzzle piece for what this game will one day presumably/hopefully become.\n\nI.e. not just the greatest hits of America, but all of it, the rough with the smooth, the desolate with the thrilling, the places you want to escape from with the places you want to move to. Already, New Mexico makes ATS significantly different – that much more varied, more of a place to explore, rather than just one to tick tourist traps off the list.\n\nAnd that drive, the big drive, from opposite extremes of this new map? Now that drive is an afternoon-long odyssey. Just imagine what it will become. Next time around, American Truck Simulator could go to Oregon, Utah, Idaho, Colorado or Texas.

  "latent_2361": "Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nPaul van der Bas, a young Dutch man, traveled from Amsterdam to Israel a couple of weeks ago for the sixth time in recent years. But this trip was special. This time he arrived in the Holy Land as a leader of a mission titled “CIJO Fact-Finding Mission,” involving 23 young people, with co-leader Jonathan de Geus.\n\nVan der Bas is a past participant of the 2012 fact-finding mission.\n\nThe pleasant and articulate 23-year-old Van der Bas is currently completing his Master’s degree in crisis and security management at Leiden University in the Netherlands.He is also the chairman of an association of 120 Dutch students who support Israel called CIJO. It is the youth organization of the Center for Information and Documentation of Israel, the main pro-Israel group in the Netherlands.Like many other members of CIJO, Van der Bas is not Jewish.Yet he feels that despite growing up Christian, he is strongly connected to the Jewish faith. Stating he was always very interested in politics, he vividly remembers how he was strongly influenced by the events of 9/11 and the second intifada.“Growing up I did not know any Jews,” he says, recalling that while attending a Christian school, he learned a lot about the Bible, and specifically about the Israelites. “I guess, as a kid, that did make me curious as to what was going on in the news about Israel,” he said. He also explains his connection to Israel and Judaism as “an emotional kind of intuitive response to what’s going on” that is “hard to explain.”Operation Cast Lead (2008- 9) was a turning point for him, the point at which he started paying more attention to events in Israel. He points to the fact that of the 120 members of CIJO, the ratio between Jews and non-Jews is half and half. “Non-Jews have various reasons to sign up – some are part of other political youth organizations and join because of an interest in Middle East politics. Some sign up after joining a trip to Israel.”Other than organizing events for the members of the group such as lectures, debates and meetings, CIJO reaches out to people who are not necessarily involved with Israel, inviting them to debates or lectures at high schools and universities.“We are also regularly invited to share our opinions in lectures or debates... I was even invited by the Muslim student association where I debated the chair of Students for Justice in Palestine,” he added.Van der Bas made it clear that CIJO has made a conscious choice not to receive funding from any government, Dutch or Israeli. “We’re an independent organization,” he said. “If you want to be a real independent organization, you should not receive any government funding.”The name of the annual “CIJO Fact Finding Mission” is meant to show exactly what the organization tries to accomplish.“The goal of the trip is to show a fair and balanced view of Israel, and also a complete view which is difficult to do in seven days,” he said. “I do believe the overall program shows a very nuanced, balanced and as whole and complete picture as possible.”The 23 young Dutch participants, ranging in age from 18 to 30, come from various political, social and religious backgrounds.What they all share is a desire to learn more about Israel, Middle East geopolitics, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Israeli society. They all hope to be better informed before forming an opinion.The itinerary was packed, including visits to Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, the Golan Heights, Sderot, Netiv Ha’asara, Ramallah and Rawabi, as well as lectures by Israeli and Palestinian officials. On one day, the group met with a settler from Shiloh shortly after meeting Palestinian officials from Fatah and Hamas.“Personally, I do think the facts are in favor of Israel” admits Van der Bas. He said that support for Israel would actually increase by exposing the students to the “facts,” although he stated that he always tries to be as balanced as possible.He spoke passionately about the misconceptions surrounding Israel: “I think there are many misconceptions – some people think that the entire country is a war zone. And people think that the Palestinian territories are a big war zone, which perhaps to a limited extent it is, but on the other hand I think seeing the situation there is the only way to have an informed opinion of what is going on.”Van der Bas discussed the impact of seeing the situation first hand.“We went to Jelazoun, which is a refugee camp, and it is shocking to see, but we also went to Rawabi, which is a sparkling, new, a great city, a Palestinian-built city, which is not something people know about or imagine when they hear about Israel and the Palestinian territories.”The success of CIJO’s mission seems undisputed. All 23 tour participants reported that their perspective on Israel had changed following the visit.Most participants also said they now realize the proximity of the dangers Israel faces at its borders, and have gained a newfound understanding of the security challenges as well as the diversity of Israelis.Whether the motive to support Israel is religious, political or just an emotional affinity, it is clear that Israel has many young, promising, passionate and dedicated friends in the Netherlands.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_2507": "Army Secretary Eric Fanning said on Saturday annual military drills between the US and South Korea will go ahead next month, despite North Korea’s warning of a “vicious” showdown if the war games proceed.\n\nNorth Korea accuses Seoul of 'cunning plot' to release snakes over border Read more\n\nOn Thursday, North Korea’s top diplomat for US affairs said the maneuvers have become openly aggressive, and that Pyongyang is ready for war. The US and South Korea regularly conduct joint military exercises south of the demilitarized zone dividing the two Koreas, and Pyongyang typically responds with tough talk and threats of retaliation.\n\nFanning, who was in Malaysia as part of a regional tour, said the US has conducted military drills with South Korea for decades, and that “these exercises contribute to stability, they don’t compete with stability”.\n\n“The games are currently to continue as planned,” he said. “We have been conducting exercises with South Korea and with many other militaries in the region for decades. That’s partly what had provided stability that we have seen since world war two.”\n\nThe drill is a “routine and defense-oriented exercise designed to enhance readiness, protect the region and maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula,” Major Chris Ophardt, Fanning’s public affairs officer, said in an email.\n\nLast year’s Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises involved 30,000 American and 50,000 South Korean troops and followed a period of heightened animosity sparked by land mine explosions that wounded two South Korean soldiers. The exercises escalated tensions and rhetoric but concluded with no major incidents.\n\nDespite plans to scale down the size of the army, Fanning said the US has increased its presence in Asia-Pacific, reflecting its commitment to the region. The number of soldiers and civilian army workers in the Pacific region has shot up to more than 100,000, from 70,000 four years ago, he said.\n\n“The types of relationships that we have with armies across the Pacific are really what helps, I think, keep things stable in this part of the world,” he said. “We find these exercises to be very important, very fruitful and build relationships that last generations.”\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Han Song Ryol, director-general of the US affairs department at North Korea’s foreign ministry, said the US move to put North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on its list of sanctioned individuals and other recent actions have put the situation on the Korean Peninsula on a war footing.\n\nHan said US-South Korea military exercises conducted this spring were unprecedented in scale, and that the US has deployed the USS Mississippi and USS Ohio nuclear-powered submarines to South Korean ports, deployed B52 strategic bombers around South Korea and is planning to set up the world’s most advanced missile defense system, known by its acronym THAAD, in the South, a move that has also angered China.\n\nHan said North Korea believes the drills reportedly now include training designed to prepare troops for the invasion of the North’s capital and “decapitation strikes” aimed at killing top leadership.\n\n'I got too rich in North Korea and had to fake my own death' – a defector's story ​ Read more\n\n“Nobody can predict what kind of influence this kind of vicious confrontation between the DPRK and the United States will have upon the situation on the Korean Peninsula,” he said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\n“By doing these kinds of vicious and hostile acts toward the DPRK, the US has already declared war against the DPRK. So it is our self-defensive right and justifiable action to respond in a very hard way.\n\n“We are all prepared for war, and we are all prepared for peace. If the United States forces those kinds of large-scale exercises in August, then the situation caused by that will be the responsibility of the United States.”\n\nFanning, who was appointed to his post in May, was in Malaysia to observe an annual joint army drill. He earlier visited Hawaii and Guam. He flew to Japan late on Saturday and will then travel to South Korea.",
  "latent_2537": "Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (bottom) looks on as he waits for his Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Tehran August 11, 2008. REUTERS/Morteza Nikoubazl\n\nISTANBUL (Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad launched a fresh verbal attack on Israel on Wednesday on the eve of a visit to Israel’s close ally Turkey, saying Western countries should not support the Jewish state.\n\nThe comments highlight the difficult path which Turkey, a member of NATO, must follow during the two-day visit which reflects its desire to remain on good terms with its neighbor and secure future energy needs.\n\n“Western countries should not support them (Israel) so much. The life of this regime has come to an end,” Ahmadinejad said in comments translated into Turkish in a live interview broadcast by Turkey’s NTV and CNN Turk channels.\n\n“Our position is clear on this issue. A referendum should take place in Palestine. If they withdraw from invaded lands it would be a good step,” he said.\n\nTurkish President Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan have come under criticism at home and abroad for inviting Ahmadinejad.\n\nAnkara has said his visit was necessary given a standoff between Iran and the West over Tehran’s disputed nuclear enrichment program, but analysts said the visit was more about ensuring centuries-old ties during a period of global tensions.\n\nAhmadinejad said the talks on Iran’s nuclear program were on a “good path”.",
  "latent_2604": "Nearly 20 years ago, while Turkey was in the midst of a military coup, I was asked to interview a member of a secretive religious organization whose membership — and even its aims — was little understood.\n\nI was a young reporter for a television news program, Teke Tek, and Mr. X, as we referred to him, was a member of a group led by Fethullah Gülen, known to his followers as Hocaefendi.\n\nWe spent days together, starting in the morning and sometimes talking until midnight. What he said was astonishing. Mr. X, a shy, well-behaved young man, told me about the movement’s clandestine methods to sneak into the military schools.\n\nFirst, we determine the talented, brilliant, but at the same time loyal 11- to 12-year-old students to prepare them for the military school examinations. Then we separate them from the others. And we start to meet with them secretly. We never talk in public area. We don’t want to be seen with them. Because if the military knows that these students are taught by us, they don’t have a chance to get in. And once they’ve been elected, we keep communicating again carefully. Precaution is essential for us. This is Hocaefendi’s order. And if we suspect that the relationship might be uncovered, we cease to see the student. Sometimes this non-communication takes years. But one day, we remind the student ourselves. And he always responds positively. That is why we pick the most loyal ones. And that is why they obey their hierarchal level. Everyone talks to his own big brother. No one can break the hierarchy.\n\nAccording to Mr. X, the mostly highly prized of the recruits were the military pilots, and particularly pilots who could fly the American-made F-16 fighters. “Without exception, Hocaefendi wants to see every F-16 pilot by himself to bless him, even though it is very rare to see him if you are not a high-level imam,” Mr. X said (senior leaders in the organization are called “imams”). Mr. X said he was tired of the secrecy and was leaving the movement and wanted people to know about its operations.\n\nAt the time, I was shocked by this description of a massive organization. The Gülenists were, according to Mr. X, recruiting in the police, the judicial system, and other government agencies. Gülen’s followers were creating a playbook for religious adherents to survive in a government dominated by a rigid secular ideology promulgated by the Kemalists.\n\nPhoto: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut after the February 28 military coup of 1997 and the resignation of the Islamist prime minister, circumstances changed. Fethullah Gülen left Turkey for the U.S. in 1999. Three years later, AKP, an Islamist political party, came to power in Turkey with the support of Gülenists, and being religious was no longer a reason to be excluded from the government.\n\nI didn’t see Mr. X again. I had finished my interview with him and gave the notes to the anchorman, who was planning to write a book. Nothing was ever published or broadcast, however. Mr. X was never exposed, and he started a new life after leaving the movement.\n\nMuch has changed in the intervening years, most notably a break between Gülen and the AKP’s charismatic leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, now president of Turkey. Clashes between the two fronts erupted in 2012, and Erdogan accused the Gülen movement of creating a “parallel structure” within the state. When followers of the Gülen movement in the police and the judiciary initiated a graft probe against the Erdogan government on December 17, 2013, the hostility between Gülen and Erdogan boiled over into the public.\n\nThen, last month, when the military initiated a thwarted coup, Erdogan pinned the blame on Gülen.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Gülen and his movement were really behind the coup, but a source I spoke to recently said the structure that Mr. X outlined for me years ago had changed. The Gülen movement was still powerful, and Gülen was now communicating directly with the middle-level imams. “Before, Hocaefendi was very strict about the rules that he set,” he told me. “A mid-level imam could never talk to him directly without his own big brother. But five to six years ago, Hocaefendi started to welcome the imam of the military, for example, without his superior. He was talking to them privately.”\n\nThe people Gülen was talking to were ambitious young men in their 30s, and older members — the “big brothers” — were upset about being excluded and concerned about what the younger members were telling Gülen. “I am sure that if these big brothers were involved with these conversations, they would raise their concerns about some of the ideas that mid-level imams suggested to Hocaefendi.”\n\nEven though there’s no public evidence that last month’s coup attempt is linked to Gülen, Erdogan’s government responded by dismissing or detaining over 100,000 people — a reflection of how deeply Erdogan believes Gülen’s followers have penetrated official institutions. Erdogan has also requested that the U.S. extradite Gülen back to Turkey.\n\nThe U.S. government said Turkey must first present evidence of alleged complicity for action to be taken against Gülen, who has been living in Pennsylvania for the past 17 years. President Obama personally denied press reports that the U.S. either knew or assisted with the attempted coup.\n\n“America’s governed by rules of law, and those are not ones that the president of the United States or anybody else can just set aside for the sake of expediency,” Obama said of Ankara’s extradition request during a press conference. “We’ve got to go through a legal process.”\n\nRecently, the Turkish government has raised a new concern regarding Gülen. The Turkish justice minister, Bekir Bozdag, warned that Gülen could flee the U.S. to seek political asylum in Australia, Mexico, South Africa, Egypt, or Canada.\n\nOf these countries, only Canada is considered a serious option by those inside Gülen’s movement. Canada, unlike the United States, does not have an extradition treaty with Turkey.\n\n“Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship never confirms or denies whether a person has made an asylum claim,” Nancy Caron, the agency’s spokesperson, said. She said that Canada offers refugee protection to people in Canada who fear persecution and are unwilling or unable to return to their home country.\n\nPhoto: Monique Jaques/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nIs that a serious option for Mr. Gülen? Is he packing for Canada?\n\nHis spokesperson Alpaslan Dogan denied these rumors. “No such plans,” he told The Intercept.\n\nGraham E. Fuller, a former vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council at the CIA, and one of the prominent figures who helped Gülen obtain his green card eight years ago, said he doubted the U.S. would extradite Gülen or force him to leave, unless Turkey provided concrete evidence of his involvement in the attempted coup.\n\n“I suppose if the U.S. said he should leave if he didn’t want to get extradited, I suppose he would have to consider it,” wrote Graham, who lives in Canada and is currently an adjunct professor of history at Simon Fraser University, in an email exchange.\n\n“Would Canada accept him?” Graham asked. “Possibly, but it depends on how much Canada’s relations with Turkey matter.”\n\nSo what about Mr. X, the young man I interviewed nearly two decades ago? I was told that he had returned to the Gülen movement and had moved to Canada.\n\n“It has been years,” I said, when Mr. X picked up the phone. “Hope you are doing well.”\n\nHe didn’t say anything for a few seconds. And then he replied, “I was waiting your call.”\n\n“Did you rejoin the movement?” I asked.\n\nHe didn’t want to answer.\n\nI explained to him that these many years later, I wanted to use the notes from our interviews.\n\n“Can we talk?” I asked.\n\n“I don’t want to talk,” he said, and hung up the phone.",

The nine-part production (captured perfectly above) has been raved about by MLS followers around the country, even by the so-called enemy. I caught up with ECS director of tifo Rob Scott on Tuesday to talk about the standard-setting display.\n\n* * *\n\n(How and when did the concept for that tifo come together?) \"I probably started thinking up concepts a good month or so ago, month and a half. Ideas just kind of generate themselves on our website and our message boards. Members kind of kick around ideas and come to a consensus on what we think the overall message should be.\"\n\n(I think including Roger in the display speaks for itself, but how did you narrow down the list of the other five Sounders to be honored?) \"The whole theme was 'Decades of Dominance' so we wanted to incorporate players all the way back from the '70s to now. It was about who has played well against the Timbers. Levesque for obvious reasons. Schmetzer, not so much for playing but coaching great teams against them. We thought that was a nod to him that we could throw in there. Montero for obvious reasons. Burpo and Hahnemann were very good goalkeepers in their times here. It was just a general discussion on who we thought would be good.\"\n\n(Let's shift a little to the execution of this massive display. It's such a huge undertaking, do you have a warehouse somewhere to create these banners?) \"We've used a couple different places. We've got a place in Seattle we use to make displays, which is where this one was done. We've also made previous displays in a location in Federal Way.\"\n\n(So they're just like big garage-types?) \"Pretty much. Partial open-air areas. Just big open spaces.\"\n\n(How many people do you think had some hand in this one?) \"If you're talking just numbers in terms of painting and sewing, you're probably looking at about 45-50. Other people were involved with getting the supplies and finalizing the art work.\"\n\n(Any rough estimate on how much it cost?) \"A lot. Multiple thousands, I can tell you that.\"\n\n(I saw some facts on Twitter regarding square feet and man hours put into this. Can you verify those numbers?) \"[ Ed note: Scott provided updated figures via email after the phone interview ] I was a bit short with the 23,000 sq. ft. estimate. It was closer to 26,000. And the 2,000 man hours was just in the sewing/painting. If you take in to account all the conceptual work, artists' renderings and supply pick up, it was around 3,200.\"\n\n(How much did you work with Sounders FC to put this together? I noticed the Roger display came up on the netting for field goals and extra points in Seahawks games...) \"Obviously some. They're not going to allow us to do whatever we want, but they trust that we're not going to do something terribly offensive. The field-goal banner we definitely had to double-check on. There was some back and forth, but they trust us that what we're going to do will be quality.\"\n\n(I've been getting a lot of feedback and comments about the display. What have been some of the coolest things you've seen or heard?) \"The praise from our members and the team is what's most memorable. But I've seen posts on BigSoccer saying it's the best display people have seen in MLS and even North America for that matter. We've been doing big displays like this since '09 and it's nice to get a little. It's not like we're these praise-mongers or that type of people, but it's nice for MLS to get some recognition in this regard. Hopefully it will bring more attention to the league.\"\n\n(Did you see the Timbers Army tweet some kudos?) \"Nice. Wow, I hadn't seen that. Right on. What I saw on BigSoccer was a lot of posts claiming it was probably manufactured, that we probably outsourced it, which I think is too funny. For some people, if it's not their own piece, they can't accept that anyone could do something bigger.\"\n\n(There might've been a crazy rumor floating around that it was all manufactured by the Sounders FC...) \"Of course, of course. We get that every time we do a big display it seems like.\"\n\n(How much was big Portland game, and all the attention around it, a motivator to remind folks around the country about Seattle's soccer support with a display for the ages? Especially since Jeld-Wen and Timbers fans have been getting a lot of love...) \"I'm not going to say the Timbers don't have a good supporters group because they obviously do. I think they've been forced to up their game because of what we've been doing for the last couple years. The display that they did for their home opener, don't get me wrong, it was a very good display. I don't want to sound arrogant, but I think we have better supporters and better displays, and the atmosphere and the noise that we generate at Qwest proves that.\"\n\n(How long have you been the director of tifo and how did you get involved in that?) \"I've been more of less the director since the end of '09. I've been involved in making all the displays since the beginning of '09. I don't remember when exactly it was but I was heading to the bar after one match and turned to Sean McConnell, our head capo, and said I'd like to be in charge of all the large-scale displays. I had already been involved in leadership at that point. The first one that I was actually in charge of was the final display in 2009, the \"Sounders Forever\" tifo if you remember that one.\"\n\n(In your opinion, what is it about tifo that creates and adds to the atmosphere at a stadium so well?) \"It's designed to up the crowd involvement and participation -- get them psyched, get the team psyched, of course. The bigger that we can go and the more support that we can show to get the crowd involved and the team amped up, the better it's going to be.\"\n\n* * *",

He was arrested at Dulles Airport on Monday night by Capitol Police and federal law enforcement. His passport was confiscated and he was arraigned, but he has pled not guilty to all charges.\n\nAccording to the US District Court in DC, Awan is accused of attempting a $165,000 fraud against the Congressional Federal Credit Union, which provides mortgages for employees of the House of Representatives. He then allegedly attempted to wire the money to unknown individuals in his home country of Pakistan.\n\n© Photo : Pixabay US Urges Immediate Release of Activists Arrested in Turkey\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that the FBI had also seized destroyed hard drives from Awan's home, although this has not been corroborated by other outlets.

  "latent_2908": "With the Assad regime and the Islamist rebels currently laying siege to one another in the major city of Aleppo, its worth looking back at the beginnings of the civil war, and remembering the radical roots of what once looked like a genuine revolution.\n\nConsider the influence of the Damascus-born anarchist Omar Aziz, whose ideas of “local self-governance, horizontal organization, cooperation, solidarity and mutual aid” contributed heavily to the creation of a sprawling network of locally-based organizations — the Local Coordination Committees — that created a system of dual power that reorganized political, economic, and social life outside of the regime’s authoritarian neoliberal boundaries.\n\nIn stark contrast to liberal and Islamist elites in exile, the LCC resisted calls in late 2011 to militarize the unrest or to advocate for foreign military intervention, arguing that such turns would undermine the democratic and popular nature of the revolution. They were, of course, correct.\n\nBut given their lack of friends outside of Syria (the West conveniently upheld the pro-intervention exile lobby as the true voice of “the Syrian people”), the descent into a violent sectarian civil war fueled by regional and international geopolitics was perhaps inevitable. What could have been done about Saudi Arabia and Qatar’s intense desire to pour billions of dollars into Salafi-jihadist paramilitary groups loyal to them, absent a significant leftist anti-imperialist movement in those countries that could resist such turns? And the same goes for US cooperation with the efforts and desires of the Gulf States.\n\nRadical civil society was the spine of the uprisings in 2011; but the lack of strong leftist anti-imperialist movements in the US and the Gulf arguably meant that they were doomed from the start, as there were no obstacles to the inevitable efforts by regional and global powers to exploit the chaos for their own benefits. Those of us who live in these areas need to be ruthlessly self-critical about the consequences of our failures in this regard.\n\nThe only seeming bright spot is Rojava, which seems to be continuing its radical projects — but this is largely because of the temporary alliance of convenience between the military forces of Rojava and the US military in their fight against Islamic State.

If Hilton is going to advertise in mainstream media, at the very least, it should promote with images that reflect a family friendly atmosphere.\"\n\nLump said he received an angry voicemail about the ad earlier this week and guessed that the person leaving the message had no idea Lump is gay. \"I could tell, based on what he said and how he said it,\" Lump wrote, \"that he didn't know he was leaving a voicemail for one of those people that 'disgust' him so much.\"\n\nEditor of Travel + Leisure since 2014 and named just this month as Time Inc.'s editorial director for lifestyle brands (including his own magazine, along with Food & Wine, Real Simple, Southern Living and more), Lump says he came out at as gay at age 19 and has been open about it ever since. Several times, he has mentioned his travels with his husband in the magazine.\n\n\"I write about Charles and the places we've gone together fairly often in my Editor's Note in the magazine, and I have been quietly pleased that there's been no hate mail or threats of canceled subscriptions,\" Lump wrote. \"To me, that's a reflection of how open and accepting the Travel + Leisure audience is—qualities that I think go hand in hand with a love of travel.\"\n\nBrushing off the conservative AFA's complaint that children shouldn't be exposed to an image of men sharing an intimate moment in a consumer magazine, Lump focused much of his response on why he believes tolerance and travel are so frequently aligned.\n\n\"I have written many times that travel works against bigotry and hatred,\" Lump wrote. \"I believe few things more strongly. Everyone has a right to his or her opinion, and to express it in legal and respectful ways, but I absolutely, utterly reject bigotry of any kind, and I think most serious travelers do too. Bigotry works better for people who stay at home.\"\n\nHilton has also stood behind the ad, telling the AFA: \"Hilton Worldwide is a global company of diverse cultures serving diverse guests. … We are proud to depict and reflect our guest diversity in our advertising.\"\n\nLump said Hilton deserves high praise for its willingness to openly portray homosexuality in its consumer advertising, at a time when many brands still limit such imagery to niche publications aimed at gay audiences.\n\n\"Despite all the progress we have made in recent years, it's still relatively rare to see depictions of gay life like what we see in that Hilton ad, including in 'mainstream' magazines like ours,\" Lump wrote. \"Few companies have the vision or the courage to do it. I was proud to run that ad in Travel + Leisure. I applaud our partners at Hilton for creating it, and I thank them for placing it with us.\"\n\nThe full ad is below:",
  "latent_3087": "Report by cross-party committee of peers accuses government of failing to prepare and warns of legal and economic chaos\n\nIt is impossible to imagine a worse outcome for Britain than failing to agree a Brexit deal, the House of Lords will warn on Thursday, in a last-ditch warning to ministers under increasing pressure to walk away from stalled talks with the EU.\n\nIn a 60-page report that predicts legal and economic chaos without an exit agreement, the cross-party committee of peers cautions that a government strategy of brinkmanship with Brussels “risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy”.\n\n“‘No deal’ would mean the abrupt cessation of over 40 years of economic, political and legal partnership,” they conclude. “It is difficult, if not impossible, to envisage a worse outcome for the United Kingdom.”\n\nDUP leader finally talks to May but says border issue still needs work Read more\n\nThe government was accused of failing to prepare for the future on Wednesday after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, revealed there had been no cabinet discussion on Britain’s ultimate relationship with Europe, and the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said no assessment of the likely impact on different business sectors had been carried out.\n\nTheresa May is also facing a backlash from hardliners in the cabinet after it emerged that the only way to salvage a stricken first-phase agreement over Northern Ireland might be to extend EU regulatory alignment to the whole of the UK – a soft Brexit option many regard as the worst of all worlds.\n\nNow the Lords report warns that the alternative of walking away from the talks entirely and relying on existing WTO trade rules would have catastrophic implications, ranging from a 20% rise in food prices and grounded airline flights, to the loss of 75,000 jobs in the City and £8-10bn in tax revenues.\n\n“A complete ‘no-deal’ outcome would ... bring UK-EU cooperation on matters vital to the national interest, such as counter-terrorism, police, justice and security matters, nuclear safeguards, data exchange and aviation, to a sudden halt,” said the report, after taking evidence from more than 50 expert witnesses.\n\nWhat does a 'no deal' Brexit mean and how bad could it get? Read more\n\n“It would place the status of UK nationals in the EU, and EU nationals in the UK, in jeopardy, and would necessarily lead to the imposition of controls at the Irish land border.\n\n“The short-term impact on trade in goods would also be grave,” the peers added. “The UK’s ports would be overwhelmed by the requirement for customs and other checks. There is simply not enough time to provide the necessary capacity, IT systems, human resource and expertise to deal with such an outcome.”\n\nThe Lords warning came as business leaders also accused the Tory party of “gross irresponsibility” for considering a no-deal route out of the Brexit impasse. “To those politicians suggesting we walk away from the negotiating table, I have a simple message: careless talk will cost jobs,” the CBI president, Paul Drechsler, told an audience in the City on Wednesday night. “Businesses will press snooze for as long as they can – but the alarm will go off,” he added.\n\nBritish business leaders have long warned that failure to move on from phase one talks by next week could force them to take painful contingency measures to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, but the Lords report sets out in unprecedented detail why it fears such a scenario could come about by accident.\n\n“The key factor adding to the risk of ‘no deal’ is the lack of time,” the peers write. “While we reiterate our support for the government’s goal of securing a comprehensive agreement by October 2018, the uncertainty over the feasibility of that aim means that the overriding UK and EU interest is now to secure an orderly and legally certain transition, as early as possible.”\n\nThe committee also dismissed testimony provided by David Davis in which he claimed there could still be a “bare bones” deal with the EU if the main exit negotiations broke down. The peers argued that a disorderly breakup would be more likely to lead to a widespread breakdown in trust between the two sides.\n\nLord Jay, acting committee chairman and a former ambassador to France, said: “The overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that ‘no-deal’ would be the worst possible outcome for the UK, in terms of the economy, security, the environment and citizens’ rights.”\n\nCampaigners against a hard Brexit claimed the report provided damning evidence against the theory that Britain could be prepared to walk away. “For months we have have heard bluster from Brexiteers about how no deal is better than a bad deal,” said Eloise Todd, of Best For Britain. “What this report finally tells us is that no deal is a bad deal... [it] is a brutal character assassination carried out on the whole, shambolic government.”\n\nThe government argues that it has to maintain the ‘no-deal’ option to prevent Brussels from dictating all the terms of the exit. Responding to criticism of the government’s strategy during prime minister’s questions, Theresa May claimed “very good progress” had been made in the talks.\n\n“We’re leaving the European Union, we’re leaving the single market and the customs union but we will do what is right in the interests of the whole United Kingdom,” she said. “And nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”",
  "latent_3286": "There were a whole lot of people who believed in Max Scherzer coming into 2013. I was not particularly one of them.\n\nScherzer arrived with Detroit as part of the three-way deal between the Tigers, New York Yankees and Arizona Diamondbacks in 2009 that resulted in Curtis Granderson, Austin Jackson, Phil Coke and Ian Kennedy also switching teams. Over the next two years, Scherzer was an entirely acceptable pitcher: ERAs of 3.50 and 4.43, never more than 200 innings, and a strikeout to walk ratio that improved across the two seasons, from 2.63 to 3.11. In 2012, Scherzer did even better than that, posting a 3.85 K/BB, his 11.1 K/9 being the highest among qualified starters in MLB, along with a 3.74 ERA in 187.2 innings pitched. Tigers fans were ready to name him the best No. 2 starter in the game; I liked the progression, but didn't particularly see why he would be great in 2013, instead of merely good.\n\nI also thought Justin Verlander was going to be the anchor of the rotation, Doug Fister would be the second-best pitcher in the rotation and Anibal Sanchez's repeatedly shredded shoulder would come back to haunt him. None of that came to pass, either.\n\nI was wrong, and not only is the Tigers' rotation the class of the American League, but Max Scherzer -- not Justin Verlander -- is the Detroit pitcher with the most legitimate argument for the Cy Young Award going into the final six weeks of the season.\n\nScherzer's record is 18-1, and while that's a pretty pair of numbers that will endear him to voters, it's mostly a distraction. The true value of his work lies in his 2.82 ERA over 172.1 innings so far this season, with 185 strikeouts to just 38 walks. Barring injury, Scherzer will break 200 innings pitched for the first time in his career sometime in mid to late September. He will likely reach 20 wins, too, as the Tigers are a good baseball team that plates runs for its pitchers, and there's a stretch at the end of the season where he should get a pair of starts (at least) against two of the Mariners, White Sox, Twins and Marlins. While 20 pitcher wins looks nice on a baseball card, Scherzer remains compelling without them.\n\nBut if Scherzer is going to win his first Cy Young Award, first he has to distinguish himself from the rest of the American League, in a year that's been very good to pitchers. Merely eyeballing the leaderboards, there are two candidates who are at least as compelling as Scherzer: Chicago's Chris Sale and Seattle's Felix Hernandez. Sale is a bit behind on innings pitched, at 165.1 to Scherzer's 172.1 and King Felix's 178.2, but his 2.78 ERA is slightly better than Scherzer's, while Hernandez's 2.49 ERA is even better than that. King Felix has the worst (\"worst\") K/BB of the three at 4.79 strikeouts for every walk; Sale has 4.86, and Scherzer barely tops him at 4.87.\n\nBut even that gives a limited perspective on the race for the AL Cy Young Award. If you're a WAR(P) person for pitchers, Sale has half a win over Scherzer with Felix falling in a comfortable second place between the two of them, according to Baseball Reference's WAR: 6.1 for Sale, 5.8 for Hernandez, and 5.5 for Scherzer. Going by Fangraphs WAR, however, Hernandez and Scherzer are tied at 5.3, with Derek Holland coming in third at 4.8 and Sale lagging in fourth at 4.6. Holland is having a great season too -- 2.95 ERA over 168 innings -- but he's striking out fewer batters while walking a good number more, and unless he really turns it on over the last six weeks, he should end up around fourth place in the voting.\n\nFinally, using Baseball Prospectus's WARP metric, Sale is the best pitcher in the AL (3.78), followed by Scherzer (3.58), and Felix Hernandez (2.81) is eighth, behind Hiroki Kuroda (3.03). Kuroda is proving himself to be one of the best Yankee free agent signings in recent memory: 160.1 innings of 2.41 ERA -- this leads the AL among qualified starters-with 116 strikeouts and 29 walks. He doesn't strikeout as many guys as Sale, Hernandez and Scherzer, but he does it at a better ratio, 4.00 exactly going into Tuesday's action.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nInnings pitched do matter, however, and while Kuroda is having an elite season -- and would, on a better Yankees team, probably be breezing to his own first Cy Young -- he is still likely to end up short of the pace set by Hernandez and Scherzer by the year's end. Derek Holland's teammate in Texas, Yu Darvish, will get substantial attention in the voting as well. He currently leads the American League in strikeouts, both in aggregate total (214) and in rate (12.0 K/9). He too is a pitcher who has been extremely effective (2.68 ERA), but in roughly two starts less than the leaders, 161 innings pitched to Scherzer and Hernandez's mid-170s.\n\nEssentially, then, with six weeks to go in the season, a reasonable person can make a case for any one of five pitchers (or six, if you're absolutely in love with Anibal Sanchez and his 2.50 ERA despite his low 133 innings pitched; he does lead the league with a 168 ERA+) for the American League Cy Young Award.\n\nSo what distinguishes Scherzer in particular from the pack?\n\nRelated Articles Too Much To Fix It's an odd transition for the Philadelphia Phillies, who fired manager Charlie Manuel, even though nobody would… More»\n\nA Beautiful Swing Slows Down Todd Helton, the most iconic player in Rockies history, was a No. 1 draft pick who lived up to expectations. He… More»\n\nHead Game Nearly a year has passed since pitcher Brandon McCarthy suffered severe injuries after being struck in the head by… More»\n\nCircumstance and good fortune, mostly. Scherzer is having an elite season, even considering the league-wide offensive downturn of the past couple years. But barring injury or extreme misfortune he will be a heavy favorite for the Cy Young, because the voters do love their pitcher wins, and at 18-1 already, Scherzer has a very appetizing tiebreaker. Felix Hernandez's 2010 Cy Young Award, given to him during a season when his record was merely 13-12, is commonly quoted as an example of the voters bucking win-loss record for ERA as a lynchpin stat. The thing to remember about 2010, however, is that the second place finisher, David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays, had an ERA over half a run greater than Hernandez's frankly ridiculous 2.27 in 249.2 innings. King Felix's ERA that year was the best in baseball, and his innings pitched the most in the American League.\n\nThis season, there's likely to be a lot more pitchers finishing within a half-run of each other -- that 2.45 to 2.95 range -- without anyone quite reaching the 240-inning threshold (though with a complete game or two from the leaders, it's not an unreasonable number), but with most of them breaking 210 innings. Hernandez also had six complete games in his Cy Young year, compared to Price and third-place finisher C.C. Sabathia's two. This year Sale leads the league with four complete games, and no other reasonable candidate has more than two.\n\nIn 2011, Justin Verlander won both the American League MVP and Cy Young Awards by virtue of having the best ERA in the American League, the most innings pitched in baseball, the most strikeouts in baseball, and a 24-5 record. He probably would have won the Cy Young again last season, instead of David Price, if voters hadn't been skittish about giving him the same reward for a season slightly worse than the last -- even though on the merits it was still better than Price's outstanding year. Wins and losses are still a big part of the Cy Young equation for voters, and that should help Scherzer even if all it means is that he pitched well in front of a good offense, while Sale and Hernandez had to make do with whatever the White Sox and Mariners could accomplish at the plate that day.\n\nBut even with the odds in his favor, Max Scherzer isn't aiming for the Cy Young Award, in the same way that his teammate Miguel Cabrera isn't aiming for another Most Valuable Player Award. Both things would be nice to have, and if the proper work is put in and the current production is sustained then both things will come to them -- but the Detroit Tigers have dominated the regular season awards voting for two years now, without backing those performances up with a title. So far, Max Scherzer has been the best pitcher in the best rotation on the best team in this year's American League. He doesn't need to win a Cy Young Award to prove all of that's for real. He needs to win a World Series.",

Courtesy:Channel Seven\n\nRADIO 2Day FM DJ Mel Greig is set to appear at the inquest into the death of British nurse Jacintha Saldanha.\n\nThe nurse died after taking a hoax call from Greig and 2Day FM host Michael Christian who posed as the Queen and Prince Charles last December.\n\nLawyers Slater & Gordon issued a statement this morning saying that Ms Greig will appear at the inquest later this year.\n\n“Ms Saldanha’s suicide was a devastating tragedy and Ms Greig’s thoughts have been with the family ever since,” the statement says.\n\n“Ms Greig fully understands their need for answers, which is why she has taken this step to appear as an individual at the inquest.\n\n“She is determined to address any questions surrounding her role in these tragic events as part of the inquest.”\n\nThe decision comes as Britain’s Sunday Times reports that one of three suicide notes left by the nurse blames Ms Greig and Mr Christian for her death.\n\n“Please accept my apologies,” the note purportedly says. “I am truly sorry.\n\n“Thank you for all your support. I hold Radio Australians Mel Greig and Michael Christian responsible for this act. Please make them pay my mortgage. I am sorry.

An inquest into her death is expected to reopen and conclude this week.\n\nBut, according to The Sunday Times , one of three suicide notes left by the nurse directly blames the 2Day FM radio DJs behind the prank Ms Greig and Michael Christian for her death.\n\n\"Please accept my apologies,\" the note purportedly said.\n\n\"I am truly sorry. Thankyou for all your support. I hold Radio Australians Mel Greig and Michael Christian responsible for this act. Please make them pay my mortgage. I am sorry. Jacintha.\"\n\nRead more about the letter at The Sunday Times\n\nThe DJs called the hospital posing as members of the royal family a day after the Duchess of Cambridge was admitted with acute morning sickness.\n\nThe pair laughed through the episode with their bad English accents which was recorded and then broadcast. Ms Saldanha answered the initial phone call then put it through to the ward treating the Duchess.\n\nAnother nurse, believing she was talking to the Queen, answered the call and spoke about Kate's condition and how she was fairing.\n\nThe prank make headlines around the world and three days later Ms Saldanha was found dead by a hospital security guard.\n\nIt is understood she had made three notes including one that references another dispute she was having with hospital management on an unrelated matter. The inquest is expected to hear how she had apparently attempted suicide on at least two occasions before prior to the radio hoax call being made.\n\nMs Greig has yet to return on-air and both she and Mr Christian are said to have been traumatised by the consequences of their broadcast. 2Day FM owners Southern Cross has paid a $500,000 into a trust fund for Ms Saldhanha’s family including her two children Junal, 17 and 14-year-old Lisha.\n\nThe company is to be legally represented at the inquest, with the Saldanha family legal representatives indicated they were likely to take action against the station owners.\n\nMs Saldanha's remains hopeful an inquest will unravel the events that led to her death.\n\nBritish MP Keith Vaz, who has been representing the family, says three months after the Indian-born nurse's death there remain a number of unanswered questions.\n\nMr Vaz has said he's astonished the prestigious King Edward VII hospital had a nurse rather than a trained operator answering calls at reception.\n\n\"The family remain hopeful the inquest and investigating will provide the answers they seek,\" the MP has previously said in a statement.\n\nSouthern Cross Media Group, which owns 2day FM who staged the prank, has been granted a position on the legal bench at the Westminster Coroners Court inquest into the death of the mother of two.\n\nThe move came after Ms Saldanha's family hired a QC to act for them at the inquest which could partly apportion blame for her death on the radio DJs and the station that allowed the airing of the prank call.\n\nAt the end of March, the coroner's court handed over copies of all the evidence gathered for the inquiry including copies of the three notes she left before her apparent suicide, a police report, toxicology results, a statement from the duty nurse who was the last person to see her alive as well as a letter from her GP which is expected to detail whether she was on medication at the time of her death.\n\nIt is reported she may have been taking antidepressants prescribed to her by a doctor in India after an incidence of self harm while on holidays in her native country.\n\nThe court ordered copies of the evidence be given to Southern Cross Media’s lawyer Maya Sikand to prepare for the May 2 inquest. It is understood the inquest has been delayed.\n\nDespite the broadcaster, the family, the police and the King Edward VII Hospital all being granted legal representation at the inquest, the coroner has warned all parties she will not accept \"adversarial issues\" to cloud proceedings.\n\nThe caution came as Ms Saldanha's lawyer John Cooper, QC, hinted there was likely to be a dispute with both the radio station and the hospital since the former claimed it had rung the nurses back to seek permission to broadcast the prank which Mr Cooper said was not correct and the hospital for placing Ms Saldanha to answer telephone calls which may be outside her contract of employment.\n\nThe inquiry is expected to hear from four witnesses including the duty nurse who saw her last and the hospital boss John Lofthouse.\n\nFor help with emotional difficulties, contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or www.lifeline.org.au\n\nFor help with depression, contact Beyond Blue on 1300 22 46 36 or at www.beyondblue.org.au\n\nThe SANE Helpline is 1800 18 SANE (7263) or at www.sane.org",
  "latent_3665": "With the shift to cloud well under way, can we expect to see the same innovation-crushing surge of patent abuse in the field of cloud computing? Given the increasing deal sizes in the cloud space, the move by market leaders to focus on cloud for future growth, and the shortfall of current reform activity to restrict only the most egregious patent trolls (and not those using trolling as a line-of-business within a larger enterprise), it seems foreordained.\n\nMuch of cloud computing relies deeply on open source software. So the cloud news from the OIN (Open Invention Network) that broke in December -- that Google would join and OIN would cover OpenStack -- should come as no surprise.\n\n[ Is OpenStack the new Linux? Read the early signs around the \"cloud operating system.\" | Track the latest trends in open source with InfoWorld's Technology: Open Source newsletter. ]\n\nWhy is the attack of the trolls inevitable? First, cloud computing has deep roots in clustering, scientific computing, and data analysis -- and those have been favored topics for university research for years. As we discovered from those who opposed the Innovation Act, universities frequently sell patent rights to trolls as they desperately try to make good on their mistaken belief they can make their institutions rich by patenting research. Second, the cloud computing space has been slow to become profitable, and many startups have already come and gone. VCs often insist on startups filing for patents so that there's something to sell should their investment fail. The trolls lie in wait for these cheap spoils.\n\nAs a consequence, it's highly likely that key cloud computing patents are in the hands of patent trolls from both sources. That's just the small trolls -- the big trolls have cloud computing business units and are sure to already have a patent arsenal.\n\nProblems like these inspired the creation of OIN nearly nine years ago. These days, OIN regularly updates its Linux definitions -- the list of packages that the licensee network agrees not to fight over with patents. The updates include packages that are growing in popularity and which OIN has received requests to include in the list.\n\n\"Linux System\" is a specialized term here. It refers to a comprehensive list, not just of the files comprising the Linux kernel, but also the files from the GNU Project and other essential user tools, plus an ever-expanding tally of applications and infrastructure hosted on top of GNU/Linux. You don't even have to run these applications and tools on Linux to be eligible for protection; the packages themselves are protected. Thus, the patent pool and non-aggression pact have significant effects, due both to the expanding pool of patents owned by OIN and to the increasing community of licensees.\n\nI reported in 2012 on a set of additions that led to OIN members Phillips and Sony limiting their involvement, and updates last year brought on the rapidly growing NoSQL database MongoDB to the definition, as well as much of the Android system and OpenJDK, the open source peer of Java. These latter recruits were serious enough to provoke Oracle into withdrawing. The actions by Oracle, Sony, and Phillips show that the OIN defenses are not just window dressing -- they have real consequences.\n\nBut these most recent updates are highly significant. As well as adding further growth packages -- the new definition includes MariaDB, the popular variant of MySQL -- there is also a significant and intentional move into protecting cloud computing. OIN has added the packages from OpenStack to the new definition, which comes into effect on March 6. Given that IBM and Red Hat are both members of OIN and heavily invested in OpenStack, that means the cloud infrastructure project has serious protection from the inevitable patent attacks.\n\nThe network has grown too. There are now more than 700 licensees of OIN, each committed to non-aggression with patents against the Linux system and each committed to offer its own patents for the defense of other licensees. In addition, a new full member has joined the OIN team -- Google -- both offering its full patent portfolio for cross-licensing in defense of Linux and funding the acquisition of key patents for OIN's own defensive portfolio. It doesn't seem to be well known, but OIN has acquired an impressive portfolio of patents to prevent them falling into the wrong hands, as well as for use by members and licensees.\n\nAs I recommended last year, you should seriously consider joining OIN if you in any way rely on open source software in your business (even though it's better protected than proprietary software). The addition of so much cloud computing software strengthens the case. If you plan no patent aggression, what have you got to lose?\n\nTell them I sent you!\n\nThis article, \"Patent trolls target their next victim: Cloud computing,\" was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

  "latent_3746": "For those of you looking to follow the series, I am sorry that I did not have a post ready for last week. I was preparing for and taking the United States Green Building Council?s (USGBC.org) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification test. I passed, and now carry the designation Accredited Professional (LEED AP).\n\nWhat is a LEED Accredited Professional??\n\nLEED Accredited Professionals are experienced building industry practitioners who have demonstrated their knowledge of integrated design and their capacity to facilitate the LEED certification process. It demonstrates an understanding of green building practices and principles, and familiarity with LEED requirements, resources, and processes.\n\nIn the last article, I took a very detailed look at mechanical systems and insulation as related to cost and return on investment for upgrading to gain more efficiency. I think I effectively demonstrated that the costs are not unreasonable, and in almost every case the additional cost of the more efficient upgrade could be recovered in two seasons or less. Every year forward, those additional savings, and the decreased carbon output, mean more money in your pockets and less wasted energy.\n\nResources for Starting to be Being Green\n\nThe next question to answer is ?how in the world do I figure out where to start?? There is quite a bit of green washing out there. It seems that every magazine I read or junk mail flyer I get has something ?green? to say. In one respect I think that having the green movement become more mainstream is a benefit. The more people see it and hear about it, the more likely they will be to ask for it. In medicine, the mantra is ?see one, do one, teach one?.\n\nWe are definitely seeing green in more and more places. If you want a really nice example of a mainstream green building, the Devon Bank in Wheeling, Illinois is a LEED Gold certified building, with solar panels and a beautiful sculpture garden that has six wind mills as its focal point. I watched this building being built, and never knew it was a green project until last week! Also, if you live in the Chicago, the Chicago Center for Green Technology is a nice place to get a handle on what can be done. And the Museum of Science and Industry has an ongoing exhibit of a green home.\n\nNow, its time to get more people doing green in their everyday lives. My tenet is that there is a shade of green for every project and every budget. Demonstration projects like the Green Technology Center, the MSI Green home, or my own River Hill Conservation Community Project purposefully push the envelope on implementing green building practices. The idea is to demonstrate as many types of green products and practices to showcase how individual pieces can be worked into any project.\n\nWhen you are ready to tackle your next home project, consider using green products in the process. From a bathroom or a kitchen remodel, a simple paint job, or an addition, the opportunities to go green are immediately available and often not more expensive. You can search product catalogs on line like www.greenhome.com, or www.buildinggreen.com, and others, or go to The Home Depot and look for their EcoSpec line of products.\n\nAn Energy Audit Is a Strong Starting Point for Going Green\n\nBut for any major project, like discussed in Article 1, then you need a road map. Let?s face it, budgets are tight. If you are going to do a once-in-ten-years project, you want to do it right, and you should get the most bang for your buck. If you do not want to use a green consultant (like me) to help wade through the choices, the very least you should do is a home energy audit. This is very much like a home inspection, but focused on the mechanical systems, their efficiency ratings, the building envelope, windows, doors, and insulation. The audit will give you a very detailed picture of how well your home functions as a system.\n\nIt is the system approach that I alluded to in the first article. There are trade offs for everything, whether going green or not. Every sub-system in the home affects every other system in the home to some degree or another. One of the key pieces of information you get from a home energy audit is the amount of air exchange per hour you are getting. While fresh air coming into the home in some amounts is a good thing, air infiltration through window seals, door seals, outside wall electrical outlets or leaking air out through recessed lighting are all problems. The more air that is leaking in or out of the house, the harder the heating and cooling system have to work to control temperature and humidity.\n\nSo improvements in the building envelope through insulation, caulk, weather stripping, and duct sealing, will lead to increased efficiency in the heating and cooling systems. This may lead to better hot water delivery, since the pipes won?t be as cold, which leads to water savings since you won?t run the tap for 2 minutes waiting for that hot water to come. See??\n\nA Sample Energy Audit\n\nHere is a sample of a home energy audit. This one was prepared for a client by eZing, Inc (708-848-3066) and shows the type of information we get from it. After the 4 hour survey, the audit provides concrete, scientific information about how your home performs right now, and how you can improve its performance. The most valuable data it gives it an itemized action plan ? a list of to dos, their potential costs, the probable return on the investment, and the time it will take.\n\nWith this list you can then prioritize your project or projects. Don?t want to do windows this year? Ok, take care of the weather stripping, caulk, and insulation. Just did your water heater five years ago? Then tackle the 18 year old furnace. You will know exactly what to do and have a plan to do it that you can refer back to over and over again until the jobs are done.\n\nI recommend this type of audit as part of a pre-purchase home inspection as well. There are a number of home inspectors who can add this service to a traditional inspection, and give you some real understanding of what you will be getting into, energy-wise, before you buy your next dream home. It?s a shame to buy that dream home, only to find out you can?t afford to live in it because it costs $500 a month to heat! To find an energy auditor go to www.resnet.us for a complete listing of certified auditors.\n\nIn the next article, I?ll go over some of the ways to finance these upgrades. From mortgages specifically geared to energy efficiency, to federal grants, state rebate programs, and tax incentives ? I?ll try to cover as many options as possible and provide valuable links to sources.\n\nIn the meantime, Go Green!\n\nGoing Green Series\n\n[TABLE=7]",
  "latent_3796": "As it stands, the main therapy for autoimmune diseases involves suppressing inflammation by inhibiting immune cells with anti-inflammatory medications and steroids. While they temporarily relieve symptoms, these drugs can hamper the immune system at the same time and leave patients susceptible to infections.\n\nThat’s why scientists are looking to develop a new type of treatment that targets the autoimmune and inflammatory immune cells without compromising the immune system's function.\n\nNew research, highlighted in Science Translational Medicine, details how researchers developed special T-cells that can destroy disease-causing immune cells without eliminating good immune cells needed to protect against infections.\n\nGet the Facts About Autoimmune Disease »\n\nReprogramming the Immune System\n\nThe research was led by Shimpei Kasagi of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), who figured out how to produce regulatory T-cells, or Tregs, that can treat autoimmune diseases. The researchers created a suppressed immune environment in mice with either experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or non-obese diabetes using an immune-regulating molecule called TGF-beta. Then they injected autoantigenic-peptides into the animals; these peptides are molecules that produce specific Tregs and resulted in antigen-specific T-cell differentiation.\n\nThe Tregs then stopped inflammatory responses by traveling into the tissues and organs of the mice. In essence, the researchers reprogrammed the immune system with the Tregs.\n\nThe scientists found that the newly generated Tregs not only stopped the autoimmune disease, but the animals were able to stay disease-free long after stopping the peptide injection.\n\nRelated News: Severe Headaches Not Linked to Lupus, Study Shows »\n\nThe key for this treatment is the introduction of autoantigen-specific Tregs. The procedures aim to reprogram the native T-cells to differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells, not to pro-inflammatory effector T-cells, said Dr. WanJun Chen, one of the researchers with the NIH. Once reprogrammed, these autoantigen-specific Tregs regenerate, which is probably why the mice in the study continued to experience disease remission after the treatment.\n\nIt still needs to be confirmed if more peptides would need to be administered for long-term remission, Chen said.\n\n“The long and dramatic effectiveness and duration of the suppression of the autoimmune diseases is better than we expected,” Chen said.\n\nAs a result of the treatment, the mice had normal immune system defense when exposed to bacterial antigens.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nWhat’s next for this methodology? The researchers say they want to assess how the Tregs work in animals with other autoimmune diseases, such as arthritis, before performing clinical trials in humans.\n\nIn theory, the protocol could be applied to other types of autoimmune diseases in mice—and, ultimately, in humans—as long as researchers identify one or more autoantigens specific to the particular disease.\n\n“Maybe MS and type I diabetes are the diseases we should explore first,” Chen said in a statement.\n\nFor now, Chen said it provides a big step to reach the “Holy Grail” of immunology research—that is, how to target immune cells without weakening a patient’s immune system.\n\nLearn More: Genetic Clues to Autoimmune Disorders Discovered »",

In 1999, he and his friends attended a midnight screening of \"Star Wars: the Phantom Menace.\" Just hours later, a local TV station interviewed them, filmed their downcast eyes and listless responses, captured these men in a daze as their faces radiated both disappointment and denial.\n\n\"I love the film,\" Rotan said then. \"It's going to do incredibly well, to say the least.\"\n\nJohn did not love the film. He told me recently that he looks back and cringes a bit, although his words felt true at the time.\n\nAfter all, it's easy to forget how intense the anticipation was for the opening of \"The Phantom Menace.\" There was no social media, no endless stream of leaks and tweets about the movie, just whispers. John and his brother would set their VCRs to record whenever George Lucas would appear on talk shows, just to see if he said anything about the new films. There was a vacuum of information, and hype rushed inward to fill it.\n\nThe night the \"Phantom Menace\" premiered, as the lights went down, John said he and everyone there cheered.\n\nAnd then the movie happened.\n\nLater that night, John and his friends staggered home in a daze. They tried to make sense of a world where, after so much anticipation, there were were no longer three Star Wars movies, but four, and one of them really sucked.\n\n\"We were all just mostly like, 'what the hell was that?'\" John said. \"We were just stunned.\"\n\n\"All this stuff about the senate and senators and trade routes, who even cares about all that gobbley gook?\" John continued. He added that they also took issue with the acting, and with Jar Jar Binks.\n\nAnd yet something happened just a few hours later, as John and his friends were interviewed on live television.\n\nThey began to doubt their feelings. They began to doubt themselves. Perhaps, were they the ones in the wrong? \"We wanted to see it again, just to make sure what we saw, just to double check,\" John said.\n\nOnly one person was willing to describe how they really felt about the movie. For the rest of them, their faces were drawn in shades of denial, mixed with dabs of disappointment, as if they were cultists eager for the end of the world who had just found George Lucas was a false prophet, and who now had to reconcile their beliefs after the long-awaited day had passed without their cherished apocalypse.\n\nThe term cognitive dissonance was coined for these true believers, who are capable of amazing rationalizations, and such cognitive dissonance is also a feature of fandom in another arena: sports.\n\nIt's almost as if Rotan and his friends had become Cleveland Browns fans. It's something somewhat nuts: there's the buildup of hope in some sort of communal glory, the investment of faith and emotional energy into something one has absolutely no control over, and then after all that, at the end of the movie or game, sometimes you're just left in the parking lot in a dumb costume, wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nImage: GIPHY\n\nJohn already has his tickets for the premiere of new Star Wars. That said, he said he simply cannot be as disappointed as he was when the prequels came out. He is older and more cautious now. Two and a half failed prequels will do that to a person.\n\nAnd yet, like any true believer, he's already talking himself into a new hope, a new prophet: J.J. Abrams. Who knows what will happen when the lights dim and the Force Awakens finally begins?\n\nEither way, there is something beautiful and inherently human in the hype. After all, irrationality, as Kurt Vonnegut once said, is what makes people fascinating.",

It's not explained. You have no idea it's coming. And he deserved far more, as a character.\n\nWe didn't need the burp.\n\nBB-H8 was pointless.\n\nI don't get why DJ had that stutter. It wasn't necessary...nor consistent.\n\nNot enough Chewie.\n\nI don't remember anyone saying \"I've got a really bad feeling about this.\"\n\nWe needed more BB8.\n\nHoldo says \"godspeed,\" I believe. Who the Hell is God?\n\nNot enough lightsaber battles. The battle at the end of TFA was easily twice as long as the single one in this movie.\n\nNot enough space battles.\n\nI still don't get why the republic ship was just sitting there forever.\n\nPorgs are not nearly as annoying as you think they're going to be. They're pretty irrelevant and, honestly, didn't need to be in the movie at all...and neither did the women who clean the temple.\n\nThe humor. There's a lot of it. It was far too campy for a SW movie. Luke throwing the lightsaber behind him was funny...but i don't think it's going to hold up on multiple watches.\n\nAgain, don't think this movie will hold up like TFA does. That one is very much a rocket-ship. I LOVED the pairings of Finn/Poe, Finn/Rey....etc.\n\nRose. Dear God...Rose. Go away. No one cares about you. The kiss is awkward and comes out of nowhere.\n\nI'd love to hear about how TFA haters love this one...with lines of dialogue lifted right out of Jedi and Empire.\n\nWhy was the Emperor's theme played during Snoke torturing Rey? Just cuz he was saying almost the same dialogue?\n\nI was going to be extremely pissed if the movie ended with the big Falcon party when Luke just died. Fortunately it didn't and ended on something far more poignant. However....that's still sticking with me. Zero emotional weight. Luke deserves FAR, FAR better.\n\nJW reused several pieces of music. I was actually surprised at how much repetition there was.\n\nPhasma dies like a chump. She's the Darth Maul of this trilogy. Deserved much, much better. Looked VERY cool. Did VERY little.\n\nThat's it for now. I'll add more if I think of more. I'll be seeing it again on Thursday and I'll add my thoughts.\n\nThat said, DO NOT expect massive spoilers. There is no \"I am your father\" moment. There are just some cool \"ooh I need to see that\" moments. Nothing earth shattering is revealed.\n\nThat's why i said...temper your expectations.

  "latent_4196": "Joseph Jeffrey Hazelwood (born September 24, 1946) is an American sailor. He was the captain of Exxon Valdez during its 1989 oil spill. He was accused of being intoxicated which contributed to the disaster, but was cleared of this charge at his 1990 trial after witnesses testified that he was sober around the time of the accident. Hazelwood was convicted of a lesser charge, negligent discharge of oil (a misdemeanor), fined $50,000, and sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service.\n\nEarly years [ edit ]\n\nHazelwood was born in Hawkinsville, Georgia, and raised in Huntington, Long Island, New York.[1] His father, Joseph was a United States Marine Corps torpedo bomber pilot turned airline pilot.[2] His mother, Margaret, was born in Georgia.[2][3] Hazelwood was their first-born son. He was married in 1969 to Suzanne and has one daughter, Alison (born September 7, 1975).[1][2]\n\nIn 1964, Hazelwood graduated from Huntington High School, where his IQ was reportedly tested at 138.[2] As a youth he was an avid sailor and was a member of the Sea Scouts. In May 1968, he received a bachelor of science degree in marine transportation from the State University of New York Maritime College.[4]\n\nEarly career [ edit ]\n\nFollowing college, on June 10, 1968 he was hired as a Third Mate by Humble Oil and Refining Company, which later became Exxon Shipping Company.[4] His first ship was Esso Florence homeported in Wilmington, North Carolina.[1] Hazelwood climbed the ranks of the merchant marine until he obtained a master's license at age 31.\n\nBy age 32, he was the youngest captain working for Exxon when he took command of Exxon Philadelphia, a California-to-Alaska oil tanker, in 1978. In 1985 he was master of Exxon Chester when the asphalt carrier ran into a storm during its New York to South Carolina trip. High winds damaged the ship's mast including radar and radio communications antennas. Though the crew was prepared to abandon ship, Hazelwood rallied them and guided the ship to safety.[1] In 1987, he became the alternate master of Exxon Valdez which subsequently received Exxon Fleet safety awards for the year of 1987 and 1988.[5][6]\n\nHazelwood's driver's license had been suspended or revoked three times by the state of New York for alcohol violations since 1984. At the time of the Exxon Valdez incident, his New York state driving privileges were suspended as a result of a driving under the influence arrest on September 13, 1988.[7] He entered a rehabilitation program in 1985 at South Oaks Hospital in Amityville, New York. Following rehabilitation he received 90 days of leave to attend Alcoholics Anonymous.[8]\n\nExxon Valdez oil spill [ edit ]\n\nExxon Valdez offloading its remaining crude oil to another tanker three days after the vessel grounded. offloading its remaining crude oil to another tanker three days after the vessel grounded.\n\nExxon Valdez departed the port of Valdez, Alaska at 9:12 p.m. March 23, 1989 with 53 million gallons of crude oil bound for California. A harbor pilot guided the ship through the Valdez Narrows before departing the ship and returning control to Hazelwood, the ship's master. The ship maneuvered out of the outbound traffic lane in the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) to avoid icebergs. Following the maneuver and sometime after 11 p.m., Hazelwood departed the navigation bridge and was in his stateroom at the time of the accident.\n\nHe left Third Mate Gregory Cousins in charge of the navigation bridge and Able Seaman Robert Kagan at the helm with instructions from the third mate to return to the southbound traffic lane in the TSS at a prearranged point. Exxon Valdez failed to return to the shipping lanes and struck Bligh Reef at around 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989. The accident resulted in the discharge of around 11 million gallons of oil, 20% of the cargo, into Prince William Sound.[9]\n\nDuring Hazelwood's trial following the accident, Alaska state prosecutors failed to convince the jury that Hazelwood was intoxicated at the time of the grounding. By his own admission, Hazelwood drank \"two or three vodkas\" between 4:30 and 6:30 that same night, his blood alcohol content was found to be .061. However, the defense argued that the blood samples were taken nearly ten hours after the incident and were mishandled.\n\nMost states, including Alaska, do not allow samples after three hours and a preservative required to halt fermentation was not added to the sample. Fermentation could have added to the amount of alcohol in the sample, making the result invalid. As a result of the accident, in 1991 the United States Coast Guard suspended his masters' license for a period of nine months. Hazelwood was acquitted on all felony charges, but was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil, fined $50,000, and sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service.[2]\n\nPost-Exxon Valdez [ edit ]\n\nHazelwood never had his masters' license revoked and it remains valid to this date, but he has been unable to find long-term work as a captain after the spill. His alma mater, SUNY Maritime College, hired him in a show of solidarity as a teacher aboard the T/S Empire State V the year after the incident with the Valdez. In 1997, he was working as a para-legal and maritime consultant with New York City's Chalos & Brown, the firm that represented him in his legal cases. He was residing in his native Long Island as of 1997.[10]\n\nThough he was originally sentenced to assist with the clean-up of the oil spill, due to the lengthy appeals process, his community service was conducted in the Anchorage, Alaska, area, beginning in June 1999 picking up trash from local roads, later moving to Bean's Cafe, a local soup kitchen.[11] His community service was conducted over five years with the Anchorage Parks Beautification Program.[12] He paid the $50,000 fine in May 2002.[13]\n\nIn 2009, Hazelwood offered a \"heartfelt apology\" to the people of Alaska, but suggested he had been wrongly blamed for the disaster: \"The true story is out there for anybody who wants to look at the facts, but that's not the sexy story and that's not the easy story,\" he said. Hazelwood said he felt Alaskans always gave him a fair shake. The apology appears in an interview in the book The Spill: Personal Stories from the Exxon Valdez Disaster by Sharon Bushell.[14]\n\nPop cultural references [ edit ]\n\nFollowing the Exxon Valdez incident, Hazelwood was ridiculed by talk shows and late night television. He was the subject of a \"Top Ten\" list on Late Night with David Letterman, in which one of his excuses was, \"I was just trying to scrape some ice off the reef for my margarita.\"[2]\n\nHe was featured in the syndicated comic strip The Far Side, which showed him as a clumsy person who spilled in various stages of his life; as a baby (his cup), teenager (pen ink in his shirt pocket), and ultimately as an adult, driving into a water tower.[15]\n\nIn the 1995 film Waterworld, Hazelwood was anointed the patron saint of the movie's villain \"The Deacon\", leader of the \"Smokers\", a band of scavenging raiders. The film displayed Hazelwood's portrait prominently aboard their flagship, also called Exxon Valdez. The ship also seemed to have a large stockpile of booze as \"The Deacon\" is seen holding an old Jack Daniel's bottle. This is yet another reference to accusations that Hazelwood was intoxicated at the time of the spill.[2]",
  "latent_4337": "Eulogizing aide Carey Gabay at Emmanuel Baptist Church in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn on Saturday, Gov. Cuomo called for lawmakers to \"end this scourge\" of gun violence \"once and for all\" by demanding federal gun control. Gabay was caught in the crossfire of what police believe were feuding gang members during J'Ouvert celebrations in Prospect Lefferts Gardens early on the morning of September 7th and struck in the head. Doctors disconnected him from life support 10 days later.\n\nInvoking the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado and Newtown, Connecticut, Cuomo said:\n\nCarey Gabay, 43 years old, making a difference in life, married, hoping to start a family, ducked down for cover, from shots he never caused from a shooter he never saw and never got up. Why? Well, maybe that’s the way it is everywhere. Maybe there’s nothing you can do about it. If only that were true. It’s not.\n\nRaised by Jamaican parents in the Boston Secor Houses public housing development in the Eastchester neighborhood of The Bronx, Gabay started working for the governor as assistant counsel in 2011 and was deputy general counsel at the state pro-development nonprofit Empire State Development at the time of his death. Reading from prepared remarks, Cuomo noted that Gabay worked to draft the SAFE Act, which bans high-capacity magazines, mandates background checks for gun purchases, and heightens penalties for crimes committed with banned guns. Cuomo urged DC Democrats to bring the government to the brink of shutdown to get gun control measures passed.\n\n\"If the far right is willing to shut down the government because they don't get a tax cut for the rich,\" he said, \"then our people should have the same resolve and threaten to shut down the government if they don't get a real gun control law to stop killing of their innocents.\"\n\nDuring the eulogy, Cuomo also took an oblique jab at Mayor de Blasio in the audience, evoking the New York Post's campaign to manufacture outrage about street homelessness. Cuomo said that Gabay envisioned \"a society that has more compassion and a government that has more competence than to allow homeless people to sleep on the street and children to sleep in the squalor of shelters. That this great, rich city of New York should hear the words of Saint Francis and not just nod at the pope's words, but act.\" De Blasio was in the audience but left without speaking to reporters.\n\nGabay's mother, brother, two sisters, and his widow Trenelle Gabay also attended, but did not speak publicly.\n\nNeighbor and friend Pasha Durr told the New York Times Gabay \"was selfless, genuine, Carey was the real deal.\"",
  "latent_4417": "Mike Tannenbaum has plenty to tackle when he officially takes over on Feb.1.\n\nHis top priority, of course, is helping identify and acquire the talent needed to get the Dolphins over the hump.\n\nAnd yet, the earliest projections of May’s NFL Draft present an early red flag. The top tier is weak at places the Dolphins need help most: Up the middle on both offense and defense.\n\nThat’s according to ESPN’s Todd McShay, whose business is to know these things. And based on his hour-long Q&A with sportswriters from across the country this week, the Dolphins better fix their porous run defense in free agency, because the talent might not be there to do it in the draft.\n\nSign Up and Save Get six months of free digital access to the Miami Herald\n\n“There’s a good amount of talent, probably better than average, on the perimeter,” McShay, speaking of edge rushers expected to be available.\n\nAs for defensive tackle, inside linebacker and safety – all positions where the Dolphins need reinforcements?\n\n“Average,” was McShay’s assessment.\n\nArguably the best inside linebacker in the draft? Miami’s Denzel Perryman, who will be lucky to go late in the first round.\n\nThat’s bad news for the Dolphins, who finished 8-8 and again will draft in the no-man’s land: the middle of the first round. Mediocre seasons are unfulfilling in two ways: Not quite good enough to get to the playoffs, and not quite bad enough to be in position to draft an elite player.\n\nThey had to sweat out 18 picks before taking Ja’Wuan James – the last offensive tackle with a first-round grade – last year.\n\nAnd the same scenario could occur this year, particularly if the Dolphins don’t solve their issues at defensive tackle in free agency. The Dolphins were uncharacteristically bad against the run last year – ranking 24th in rushing yards allowed and 21stin yards per rush – and that was with Jared Odrick and Randy Starks, who both could both be gone in the coming months.\n\nThat will make the very few elite defensive tackles in this year’s draft all the more coveted.\n\nThe fastest riser: Danny Shelton, a first-team All-American at Washington in 2014. Shelton, who has accepted an invitation to participate in the Senior Bowl later this month, could go as high as 10th, and certainly would be an option.\n\nEddie Goldman, whom McShay calls Florida State’s best defensive player from last year, is another option on the defensive interior.\n\nAfter that, there’s not a ton of great options up the middle.\n\nAnd cornerback doesn’t appear to be much better. Marcus Peters, also of Washington, might be a bit of a stretch, and Oregon’s Ifo Ekpre-Olomu is dealing with a knee injury.\n\nSo how about on the interior offensive line? Surely, there has got to be an elite guard available in the middle of the first round who could help shore up a group that allowed 46 sacks last year, right?\n\nThere again, need might not match up with value for the Dolphins.\n\nThe best lineman in the draft might be Brandon Scherff, a tackle from Iowa who reminds McShay of Zach Martin – a player the Dolphins coveted last year but was off the board by the time they picked. Though Scherff played tackle in college, his measurable probably translate to guard on the NFL level.\n\nAfter that? Not much.\n\n“The sweet spot for offensive line will be the bottom half of the first round,” McShay said. “That’s where you’ll get a lot of value.”\n\nSo if Scherff goes before the Dolphins pick, they might not have any other great option at 14. Texas A&M, as it does seemingly every year, will have a lineman selected in the first round, but prospect Cedric Ogbuehi is a tackle, and the Dolphins seem set there.\n\nSame goes for UM’s Ereck Flowers, another tackle whom McShay called “probably the most underrated tackle in the draft.”\n\nMcShay added: “He’s really jumped out to me as an underclassman who’s made improvements. … He could be the surprise of this class if he comes out.”\n\nProblem is, the Dolphins have James and Branden Albert as their bookends.\n\nAll this means unless a top-tier player unexpectedly falls, the Dolphins might be best served to trade back and accumulate picks, or simply stand pat and take the best player available, regardless of need.\n\nThere should be some good ones available, including Alabama safety Landon Collins, Georgia outside linebacker Leonard Floyd, Florida defensive end Dante Flowers, running back Melvin Gordon, Clemson outside linebacker Vic Beasley and West Virginia receiver Kevin White – who at 6-foot-3 could finally provide the team with a big target in the red zone.",

  "latent_4490": "Lenoard Cohen, singer and songwriter best known for the anthem “Hallelujah,” has died at the age of 82.\n\n“It is with profound sorrow we report that legendary poet, songwriter and artist, Leonard Cohen has passed away,” the musician’s Facebook revealed Thursday. “We have lost one of music’s most revered and prolific visionaries.”\n\nThe Canadian native has been inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nAlso Read: Review: Leonard Cohen Has Some New 'Old Ideas' -- Hallelujah!\n\nCohen was born in Quebec in 1934 and began publishing books of poetry in 1956, beginning with “Let Us Compare Mythologies.” He wrote two novels in the 1960s, “The Favourite Game” and “Beautiful Losers,” before moving to New York City in 1967 to immerse himself in the growing folk music scene there. He was championed by a number of established singers on the scene, notably Judy Collins, who had a hit with his song “Suzanne.”\n\nHis first album, “Songs of Leonard Cohen,” was released in 1967 and contained the classics “Sister of Mercy,” “Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye” and “So Long, Marianne,” in addition to his own version of “Suzanne.” Subsequent albums reinforced his status as the poet of romance and despair, and included “Bird on the Wire,” which became one of his signature songs, as well as “Famous Blue Raincoat,” “Chelsea Hotel #2” (about a liason with Janis Joplin in the celebrated New York hotel) and “Who By Fire.”\n\nA limited vocalist and a painstaking writer who spent months and occasionally years carefully crafting his songs, Cohen recorded only sporadically and couldn’t even get his record label, Columbia, to release his 1984 album “Various Positions.” Columbia president Walter Yetnikoff famously commented, “Look, Leonard, we know you’re great, but we don’t know if you’re any good.”\n\nBut that album contained the song that would open almost every show for the rest of Cohen’s life, “Dance Me to the End of Love,” and the one that would become his most famous composition, “Hallelujah.” The song gained popularity throughout the years, especially after it was covered by musician Jeff Buckley. The song has since been recorded by over 200 artists and became especially popular after it was used in 9/11 memorial tributes.\n\nCohen enjoyed a career resurgence in the late ’80s and early ’90s with the albums “I’m Your Man” and “The Future,” which included standout songs like “First We Take Manhattan,” “Take This Waltz,” “Everybody Knows,” “Waiting for the Miracle” and “Anthem.”\n\nHe followed those albums by spending five years in the Mt. Baldy Zen Center near Los Angeles, but released a string of albums beginning with “Ten New Songs” in 2001. For that album, as well as “Dear Heather” (2004), “Old Ideas” (2012) and “Popular Problems” (2014), Cohen embraced a voice that had deepened so much that many of his songs became recitatives, with female vocalists supplying the melody.\n\nHe also toured constantly, performing marathon shows with both courtly grace and boyish enthusiasm. He spent time on the road, he explained, because he needed money after a former manager, Kelley Lynch, had misappropriated more than $5 million from his accounts; he won a $9 million judgment against her, but was not able to collect.\n\nCohen published books and released music all the way until the end of his life, putting out his 14th and final album “You Want It Darker” on October 21, just a few weeks before his death.\n\nAlso Read: 'Spider-Man' on Broadway Actor Reeve Carney Lands Jeff Buckley Role\n\nTo accompany the album’s release, Cohen gave his final extensive interview to the New Yorker, in which he said, “I am ready to die. I hope it’s not too uncomfortable. That’s about it for me.” The comment echoed the last line in his new album’s title track: “I’m ready, my lord.”\n\nA memorial service will take place in Los Angeles at a later date, according to Facebook.\n\nSteve Pond contributed to this report.",

He was also convicted of the deaths of two other young Tampa women, Stephanie Collins and Natalie Holley, killed the same way that year.\n\nBolin, 53, who is best known for his televised wedding to a legal assistant after his death sentence, has filed a new round of appeals to stop the lethal injection, which would be the first of 2016 after executions dropped to a record low last year.\n\nThe former carnival worker argues he needs more time to challenge his conviction on the grounds that an Ohio inmate confessed to Matthews' murder and then committed suicide and that the FBI agent who oversaw hair and fiber analysis in the case was later discredited.\n\n\"We should be able to have a meaningful examination of the evidence,\" said defense lawyer Bjorn Brunvand.\n\nReeves, who is now widowed and has outlived three of her children, said she has no doubt that Bolin kidnapped and killed her daughter — but she's also bracing for another last-minute delay.\n\n\"I'm always prepared for Rosalie to pull a rabbit out of the hat,\" Reeves said.\n\nShe was talking about Rosalie Bolin, who was a married mother of four daughters working in the public defender's office when she fell for the death-row inmate. They were wed by phone in 1996, with cameras rolling, and she has been crusading to free him ever since.",

  "latent_4549": "Terrance Watanabe was a fixture of the Caesars Palace and Rio casinos in Las Vegas, where in 2007 he went on a year-long gambling binge.\n\nThe 52-year-old Omaha man had made a fortune running his family's party-favor import business, and he proceeded to lose much of it, going $127 million in the hole.\n\nHis compulsion led him to practically live at the two casinos, sometimes playing roulette and $25 multi-line slot machines for 24 hours straight, or playing three hands of blackjack - each with a $50,000 limit - simultaneously.\n\nAt one point, The Daily Mail reported, Watanabe lost $5 million in a single day.\n\nHis total bets that year were $825 million - roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product of the British Virgin Islands.\n\nIn a city of tourist attractions he became one himself. \"It got to the point where people would go just to watch,\" one Vegas regular told the Daily Mail.\n\nAnd his profligacy was not limited to losing hands. Court documents say he often handed bundles of $100 bills to employees at Caesars. Two of his personal handlers at the casino testified that he handed out thousands of Tiffany gift cards or $100 coins to bartenders, nightclub operators, security guards and others, and even gave out free steaks.\n\nAnd one man's loss is another's gain: The Wall Street Journal reports that Harrah's Entertainment Inc., which owns Caesars Palace and Rio, derived about 5.6% of its total 2007 Las Vegas gambling revenue from Watanabe alone.\n\nWatanabe has paid back nearly $112 million of his debt to the casinos, but faces four felony counts of intent to defraud and steal. Earlier this year the Clark County District Attorney charged that Watanabe owes $14.7 million which Harrah's says it extended to the gambler as credit but that he refuses to pay back. Watanabe denies the charges, which could cost him 28 years behind bars.\n\nNow he has filed a civil suit, claiming casino staff regularly plied him with alcohol and painkillers in order to keep him gambling. Casino rules and state law both say anyone who is visibly intoxicated should not be allowed to gamble.\n\nCivil Complaint: Watanabe v. Harrah's (Las Vegas Sun)\n\nLetter of Complaint to Nevada Gaming Control Board (11.18.09)\n\nA Harrah's executive said Watanabe's suit was merely a ploy to shirk responsibility and get out of paying a debt. \"Mr. Watanabe is a criminal defendant who faces imprisonment,\" Harrah's senior vice president for communications and government relations Jan Jones told the Journal's Alexandra Berzon.\n\nAccording to the Journal, several former and current employees of Harrah's said they were told by their managers to let Watanabe keep betting even while he was visibly drunk, and were afraid they would be fired if they tried to prevent him from gambling.\n\nA Watanabe attorney told the Journal that while his client \"takes full responsibility\" for his drinking, the casinos \"preyed\" on Watanabe's condition.\n\nHigh rollers are catered to - often quite extravagantly - by their hosts, and at a time when overall gambling revenues in Vegas are down, the wallets of high rollers are particularly attractive.\n\nWatanabe said in court documents that the Wynn casino barred him in 2007 because of compulsive drinking and gambling, while the Harrah's Caesars and Rio casinos kept their doors open to him - throwing in a free 3-bedroom suite, attendants, and seven-course meals delivered to him while he was betting.\n\nHarrah's sweetened their invitation to him to gamble money at their tables by offering more incentives: tickets to the Rolling Stones, $12,500 a month for airfare, a half-million in credit at gift stores, and 15% cash back on table losses greater than $500,000.\n\n\"We're in the gambling business,\" Jones told the Journal. \"We had no reason to believe that Terry Watanabe was anything other than a big player with huge resources who made an adult decision to bet the money he did. Are we going to provide an environment that keeps him very happy? Of course we are.\"\n\nBy December of 2007, having learned of the extent of Watanabe's losses, his sister, Pam Watanabe-Gerdes, brought him home to Nebraska, and the following year - after another brief gambling stint - he entered a residential treatment facility.\n\nHe hasn't been in a casino since, said Watanabe-Gerdes. He later sold his Omaha mansion and moved near San Francisco.\n\nThe Journal notes that Nevada's Gaming Control Board has opened an investigation into the allegations that Harrah's violated gambling regulations.",
  "latent_4558": "This article is about the sport. For other uses, see Badminton (disambiguation)\n\nBadminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are \"singles\" (with one player per side) and \"doubles\" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.\n\nEach side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.\n\nThe shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.\n\nThe game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles,[2] with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.\n\nHistory\n\nGames employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia,[a] but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the British as a variant of the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. (\"Battledore\" was an older term for \"racquet\".) Its exact origin remains obscure. The name derives from the Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House in Gloucestershire, but why or when remains unclear. As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published a booklet entitled Badminton Battledore – A New Game, but no copy is known to have survived. An 1863 article in The Cornhill Magazine describes badminton as \"battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground\".[7]\n\nThe game may have originally developed among expatriate officers in British India, where it was very popular by the 1870s. Ball badminton, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being played in Thanjavur as early as the 1850s[9] and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.\n\nEarly on, the game was also known as Poona or Poonah after the garrison town of Pune, where it was particularly popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in 1873.[7][b] By 1875, officers returning home had started a badminton club in Folkestone. Initially, the sport was played with sides ranging from 1 to 4 players, but it was quickly established that games between two or four competitors worked the best. The shuttlecocks were coated with India rubber and, in outdoor play, sometimes weighted with lead. Although the depth of the net was of no consequence, it was preferred that it should reach the ground.\n\nThe sport was played under the Pune rules until 1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the Bath Badminton Club drew up revised regulations. In 1890, Hart and Bagnel Wild again revised the rules. The Badminton Association of England (BAE) published these rules in 1893 and officially launched the sport at a house called \"Dunbar\"[c] in Portsmouth on 13 September.[12] The BAE started the first badminton competition, the All England Open Badminton Championships for gentlemen's doubles, ladies' doubles, and mixed doubles, in 1899. Singles competitions were added in 1900 and an England–Ireland championship match appeared in 1904.\n\nEngland, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand were the founding members of the International Badminton Federation in 1934, now known as the Badminton World Federation. India joined as an affiliate in 1936. The BWF now governs international badminton. Although initiated in England, competitive men's badminton has traditionally been dominated in Europe by Denmark. Worldwide, Asian nations have become dominant in international competition. China, Denmark, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea are the nations which have consistently produced world-class players in the past few decades, with China being the greatest force in men's and women's competition recently.\n\nThe game has also become a popular backyard sport in the United States.\n\nRules\n\nThe following information is a simplified summary of badminton rules based on the BWF Statutes publication, Laws of Badminton.[13]\n\nCourt\n\nThe court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only.[13] The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of the same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.\n\nThe full width of the court is 6.1 metres (20 ft), and in singles this width is reduced to 5.18 metres (17 ft). The full length of the court is 13.4 metres (44 ft). The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98 metres (6 ft 6 inch) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76 metres (2 ft 6 inch) from the back boundary.\n\nThe net is 1.55 metres (5 ft 1 inch) high at the edges and 1.524 metres (5 ft) high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.\n\nThe minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton. Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.\n\nServing\n\nThe legal bounds of a badminton court during various stages of a rally for singles and doubles games\n\nWhen the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents' court or it will count as a fault.\n\nAt the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite service courts (see court dimensions). The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receiver's service court. This is similar to tennis, except that a badminton serve must be hit below waist height and with the racquet shaft pointing downwards, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand inside their service courts, unlike tennis.\n\nWhen the serving side loses a rally, the server immediately passes to their opponent(s) (this differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles partner for what is known as a \"second serve\").\n\nIn singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in her/his left service court when her/his score is odd.\n\nIn doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he/she changes service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time. If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even, the player in the right service court serves; if odd, the player in the left service court serves. The players' service courts are determined by their positions at the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the rally. A consequence of this system is that each time a side regains the service, the server will be the player who did not serve last time.\n\nScoring\n\nEach game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served[13] (this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15 points). A match is the best of three games.\n\nIf the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such as 24–22), except when there is a tie at 29-all, in which the game goes to a golden point. Whoever scores this point will win.\n\nAt the start of a match, the shuttlecock is cast and the side towards which the shuttlecock is pointing serves first. Alternatively, a coin may be tossed, with the winners choosing whether to serve or receive first, or choosing which end of the court to occupy first, and their opponents making the leftover the remaining choice.\n\nIn subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. Matches are best out of three: a player or pair must win two games (of 21 points each) to win the match. For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives. The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading player's or pair's score reaches 11 points.\n\nThe server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.\n\nLets\n\nIf a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may occur because of some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on a court (having been hit there by players playing in adjacent court) or in small halls the shuttle may touch an overhead rail which can be classed as a let.\n\nIf the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet, if the receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, the receiver shall be judged to have been ready.\n\nEquipment\n\nBadminton rules restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks.\n\nRacquets\n\nBadminton racquets are lightweight, with top quality racquets weighing between 70 and 95 grams (2.5 and 3.4 ounces) not including grip or strings.[14][15] They are composed of many different materials ranging from carbon fibre composite (graphite reinforced plastic) to solid steel, which may be augmented by a variety of materials. Carbon fibre has an excellent strength to weight ratio, is stiff, and gives excellent kinetic energy transfer. Before the adoption of carbon fibre composite, racquets were made of light metals such as aluminium. Earlier still, racquets were made of wood. Cheap racquets are still often made of metals such as steel, but wooden racquets are no longer manufactured for the ordinary market, because of their excessive mass and cost. Nowadays, nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and fullerene are added to racquets giving them greater durability.[citation needed]\n\nThere is a wide variety of racquet designs, although the laws limit the racquet size and shape. Different racquets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players. The traditional oval head shape is still available, but an isometric head shape is increasingly common in new racquets.\n\nStrings\n\nBadminton strings for racquets are thin, high performing strings with thicknesses ranging from about 0.62 to 0.73 mm. Thicker strings are more durable, but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings. String tension is normally in the range of 80 to 160 N (18 to 36 lbf). Recreational players generally string at lower tensions than professionals, typically between 80 and 110 N (18 and 25 lbf). Professionals string between about 110 and 160 N (25 and 36 lbf). Some string manufacturers measure the thickness of their strings under tension so they are actually thicker than specified when slack. Ashaway Micropower is actually 0.7mm but Yonex BG-66 is about 0.72mm.\n\nIt is often argued that high string tensions improve control, whereas low string tensions increase power.[16] The arguments for this generally rely on crude mechanical reasoning, such as claiming that a lower tension string bed is more bouncy and therefore provides more power. This is, in fact, incorrect, for a higher string tension can cause the shuttle to slide off the racquet and hence make it harder to hit a shot accurately. An alternative view suggests that the optimum tension for power depends on the player:[14] the faster and more accurately a player can swing their racquet, the higher the tension for maximum power. Neither view has been subjected to a rigorous mechanical analysis, nor is there clear evidence in favour of one or the other. The most effective way for a player to find a good string tension is to experiment.\n\nBadminton Undergrip Flat\n\nGrip\n\nThe choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of their racquet handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer.\n\nPlayers may choose between a variety of grip materials. The most common choices are PU synthetic grips or towelling grips. Grip choice is a matter of personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands, sweatbands may be used, the player may choose another grip material or change his/her grip more frequently.\n\nThere are two main types of grip: replacement grips and overgrips. Replacement grips are thicker and are often used to increase the size of the handle. Overgrips are thinner (less than 1 mm), and are often used as the final layer. Many players, however, prefer to use replacement grips as the final layer. Towelling grips are always replacement grips. Replacement grips have an adhesive backing, whereas overgrips have only a small patch of adhesive at the start of the tape and must be applied under tension; overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, because they may be removed more rapidly without damaging the underlying material.\n\nShuttlecock\n\nA shuttlecock with a plastic skirt Shuttlecocks with feathers\n\nA shuttlecock (often abbreviated to shuttle; also called a birdie) is a high-drag projectile, with an open conical shape: the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping feathers embedded into a rounded cork base. The cork is covered with thin leather or synthetic material. Synthetic shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily. These nylon shuttles may be constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base and a plastic skirt.\n\nBadminton rules also provide for testing a shuttlecock for the correct speed:\n\n3.1: To test a shuttlecock, hit a full underhand stroke which makes contact with the shuttlecock over the back boundary line. The shuttlecock shall be hit at an upward angle and in a direction parallel to the sidelines. 3.2: A shuttlecock of the correct speed will land not less than 530 mm and not more than 990 mm short of the other back boundary line.\n\nShoes\n\nBadminton shoes are lightweight with soles of rubber or similar high-grip, non-marking materials.\n\nCompared to running shoes, badminton shoes have little lateral support. High levels of lateral support are useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up lateral support will not be able to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe's support fails, and the player's ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is more than just a safety concern: proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court.\n\nTechnique\n\nA female player flies high in USA, 2006\n\nStrokes\n\nBadminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of skill to perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either forehand or backhand. A player's forehand side is the same side as their playing hand: for a right-handed player, the forehand side is their right side and the backhand side is their left side. Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading (like hitting with the palm), whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading (like hitting with the knuckles). Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand side with a backhand hitting action, and vice versa.\n\nIn the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rear court, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands, often preferring to play a round-the-head forehand overhead (a forehand \"on the backhand side\") rather than attempt a backhand overhead. Playing a backhand overhead has two main disadvantages. First, the player must turn their back to their opponents, restricting their view of them and the court. Second, backhand overheads cannot be hit with as much power as forehands: the hitting action is limited by the shoulder joint, which permits a much greater range of movement for a forehand overhead than for a backhand. The backhand clear is considered by most players and coaches to be the most difficult basic stroke in the game, since the precise technique is needed in order to muster enough power for the shuttlecock to travel the full length of the court. For the same reason, backhand smashes tend to be weak.\n\nPosition of the shuttlecock and receiving player\n\nA player does a forehand service, 2009, Philadelphia\n\nThe choice of stroke depends on how near the shuttlecock is to the net, whether it is above net height, and where an opponent is currently positioned: players have much better attacking options if they can reach the shuttlecock well above net height, especially if it is also close to the net. In the forecourt, a high shuttlecock will be met with a net kill, hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally immediately. This is why it is best to drop the shuttlecock just over the net in this situation. In the midcourt, a high shuttlecock will usually be met with a powerful smash, also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply. Athletic jump smashes, where players jump upwards for a steeper smash angle, are a common and spectacular element of elite men's doubles play. In the rearcourt, players strive to hit the shuttlecock while it is still above them, rather than allowing it to drop lower. This overhead hitting allows them to play smashes, clears (hitting the shuttlecock high and to the back of the opponents' court), and drop shots (hitting the shuttlecock softly so that it falls sharply downwards into the opponents' forecourt). If the shuttlecock has dropped lower, then a smash is impossible and a full-length, high clear is difficult.\n\nVertical position of the shuttlecock\n\nA player prepares for a vertical jump smash\n\nWhen the shuttlecock is well below net height, players have no choice but to hit upwards. Lifts, where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to the back of the opponents' court, can be played from all parts of the court. If a player does not lift, his only remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net: in the forecourt, this is called a net shot; in the midcourt or rear court, it is often called a push or block.\n\nWhen the shuttlecock is near to net height, players can hit drives, which travel flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents' rear midcourt and rear court. Pushes may also be hit flatter, placing the shuttlecock into the front midcourt. Drives and pushes may be played from the midcourt or forecourt, and are most often used in doubles: they are an attempt to regain the attack, rather than choosing to lift the shuttlecock and defend against smashes. After a successful drive or push, the opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock.\n\nSpin\n\nBalls may be spun to alter their bounce (for example, topspin and backspin in tennis) or trajectory, and players may slice the ball (strike it with an angled racquet face) to produce such spin. The shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, but slicing the shuttlecock does have applications in badminton. (See Basic strokes for an explanation of technical terms.)\n\nSlicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to travel in a different direction from the direction suggested by the player's racquet or body movement. This is used to deceive opponents.\n\nSlicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to follow a slightly curved path (as seen from above), and the deceleration imparted by the spin causes sliced strokes to slow down more suddenly towards the end of their flight path. This can be used to create drop shots and smashes that dip more steeply after they pass the net.\n\nWhen playing a net shot, slicing underneath the shuttlecock may cause it to turn over itself (tumble) several times as it passes the net. This is called a spinning net shot or tumbling net shot. The opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has corrected its orientation.\n\nDue to the way that its feathers overlap, a shuttlecock also has a slight natural spin about its axis of rotational symmetry. The spin is in a counter-clockwise direction as seen from above when dropping a shuttlecock. This natural spin affects certain strokes: a tumbling net shot is more effective if the slicing action is from right to left, rather than from left to right.[17]\n\nBiomechanics\n\nBadminton biomechanics have not been the subject of extensive scientific study, but some studies confirm the minor role of the wrist in power generation and indicate that the major contributions to power come from internal and external rotations of the upper and lower arm. Recent guides to the sport thus emphasize forearm rotation rather than wrist movements.[19]\n\nThe feathers impart substantial drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate greatly over distance. The shuttlecock is also extremely aerodynamically stable: regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork-first and remain in the cork-first orientation.\n\nOne consequence of the shuttlecock's drag is that it requires considerable power to hit it the full length of the court, which is not the case for most racquet sports. The drag also influences the flight path of a lifted (lobbed) shuttlecock: the parabola of its flight is heavily skewed so that it falls at a steeper angle than it rises. With very high serves, the shuttlecock may even fall vertically.\n\nOther factors\n\nWhen defending against a smash, players have three basic options: lift, block, or drive. In singles, a block to the net is the most common reply. In doubles, a lift is the safest option but it usually allows the opponents to continue smashing; blocks and drives are counter-attacking strokes but may be intercepted by the smasher's partner. Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body. Hard shots directed towards the body are difficult to defend.\n\nThe service is restricted by the Laws and presents its own array of stroke choices. Unlike in tennis, the server's racquet must be pointing in a downward direction to deliver the serve so normally the shuttle must be hit upwards to pass over the net. The server can choose a low serve into the forecourt (like a push), or a lift to the back of the service court, or a flat drive serve. Lifted serves may be either high serves, where the shuttlecock is lifted so high that it falls almost vertically at the back of the court, or flick serves, where the shuttlecock is lifted to a lesser height but falls sooner.\n\nDeception\n\nOnce players have mastered these basic strokes, they can hit the shuttlecock from and to any part of the court, powerfully and softly as required. Beyond the basics, however, badminton offers rich potential for advanced stroke skills that provide a competitive advantage. Because badminton players have to cover a short distance as quickly as possible, the purpose of many advanced strokes is to deceive the opponent, so that either he is tricked into believing that a different stroke is being played, or he is forced to delay his movement until he actually sees the shuttle's direction. \"Deception\" in badminton is often used in both of these senses. When a player is genuinely deceived, he will often lose the point immediately because he cannot change his direction quickly enough to reach the shuttlecock. Experienced players will be aware of the trick and cautious not to move too early, but the attempted deception is still useful because it forces the opponent to delay his movement slightly. Against weaker players whose intended strokes are obvious, an experienced player may move before the shuttlecock has been hit, anticipating the stroke to gain an advantage.\n\nSlicing and using a shortened hitting action are the two main technical devices that facilitate deception. Slicing involves hitting the shuttlecock with an angled racquet face, causing it to travel in a different direction than suggested by the body or arm movement. Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to travel more slowly than the arm movement suggests. For example, a good crosscourt sliced drop shot will use a hitting action that suggests a straight clear or a smash, deceiving the opponent about both the power and direction of the shuttlecock. A more sophisticated slicing action involves brushing the strings around the shuttlecock during the hit, in order to make the shuttlecock spin. This can be used to improve the shuttle's trajectory, by making it dip more rapidly as it passes the net; for example, a sliced low serve can travel slightly faster than a normal low serve, yet land on the same spot. Spinning the shuttlecock is also used to create spinning net shots (also called tumbling net shots), in which the shuttlecock turns over itself several times (tumbles) before stabilizing; sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of tumbling. The main advantage of a spinning net shot is that the opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has stopped tumbling, since hitting the feathers will result in an unpredictable stroke. Spinning net shots are especially important for high-level singles players.\n\nThe lightness of modern racquets allows players to use a very short hitting action for many strokes, thereby maintaining the option to hit a powerful or a soft stroke until the last possible moment. For example, a singles player may hold his racquet ready for a net shot, but then flick the shuttlecock to the back instead with a shallow lift when she or he notices the opponent has moved before the actual shot was played. A shallow lift takes less time to reach the ground and as mentioned above a rally is over when the shuttlecock touches the ground. This makes the opponent's task of covering the whole court much more difficult than if the lift was hit higher and with a bigger, obvious swing. A short hitting action is not only useful for deception: it also allows the player to hit powerful strokes when he has no time for a big arm swing. A big arm swing is also usually not advised in badminton because bigger swings make it more difficult to recover for the next shot in fast exchanges. The use of grip tightening is crucial to these techniques, and is often described as finger power. Elite players develop finger power to the extent that they can hit some power strokes, such as net kills, with less than a 10 centimetres (4 inches) racquet swing.\n\nIt is also possible to reverse this style of deception, by suggesting a powerful stroke before slowing down the hitting action to play a soft stroke. In general, this latter style of deception is more common in the rear court (for example, drop shots disguised as smashes), whereas the former style is more common in the forecourt and midcourt (for example, lifts disguised as net shots).\n\nDeception is not limited to slicing and short hitting actions. Players may also use double motion, where they make an initial racquet movement in one direction before withdrawing the racquet to hit in another direction. Players will often do this to send opponents in the wrong direction. The racquet movement is typically used to suggest a straight angle but then play the stroke crosscourt, or vice versa. Triple motion is also possible, but this is very rare in actual play. An alternative to double motion is to use a racquet head fake, where the initial motion is continued but the racquet is turned during the hit. This produces a smaller change in direction but does not require as much time.\n\nStrategy\n\nTo win in badminton, players need to employ a wide variety of strokes in the right situations. These range from powerful jumping smashes to delicate tumbling net returns. Often rallies finish with a smash, but setting up the smash requires subtler strokes. For example, a net shot can force the opponent to lift the shuttlecock, which gives an opportunity to smash. If the net shot is tight and tumbling, then the opponent's lift will not reach the back of the court, which makes the subsequent smash much harder to return.\n\nDeception is also important. Expert players prepare for many different strokes that look identical and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke. If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, he may move in the wrong direction and may be unable to change his body momentum in time to reach the shuttlecock.\n\nSingles\n\nSince one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court. Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with drop shots and net shots. Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up his effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return. Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a player's energy is at a premium. However, players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to create openings, and players commonly smash weak returns to try to end rallies.\n\nIn singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve. Low serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand. Drive serves are rare.\n\nAt high levels of play, singles demand extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of patient positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.[20]\n\nDoubles\n\nBoth pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when the opportunity arises. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rear court, and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift. If the rear court attacker plays a drop shot, his partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes. In doubles, players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes.\n\nAt high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.\n\nAt high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men's doubles are the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges. Because of this, spectator interest is sometimes greater for men's doubles than for singles.\n\nMixed doubles\n\nA mixed doubles game – Scottish Schools under 12s tournament, Tranent , May 2002\n\nIn mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. This is because the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can, therefore, produce smashes that are more powerful. As a result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front. In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.[21]\n\nAt high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if required. When the opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position, with the woman in front and men in the back.\n\nOrganization\n\nGoverning bodies\n\nThe Badminton World Federation (BWF) is the internationally recognized governing body of the sport responsible for conduction of tournaments and approaching fair play. Five regional confederations are associated with the BWF:\n\nCompetitions\n\nA men's doubles match. The blue lines are those for the badminton court. The other coloured lines denote uses for other sports – such complexity being common in multi-use sports halls.\n\nThe BWF organizes several international competitions, including the Thomas Cup, the premier men's international team event first held in 1948–1949, and the Uber Cup, the women's equivalent first held in 1956–1957. The competitions now take place once every two years. More than 50 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within continental confederations for a place in the finals. The final tournament involves 12 teams, following an increase from eight teams in 2004. It was further increased to 16 teams in 2012.[22]\n\nThe Sudirman Cup, a gender-mixed international team event held once every two years, began in 1989. Teams are divided into seven levels based on the performance of each country. To win the tournament, a country must perform well across all five disciplines (men's doubles and singles, women's doubles and singles, and mixed doubles). Like association football (soccer), it features a promotion and relegation system at every level. However, the system was last used in 2009 and teams competing will now be grouped by world rankings.[23]\n\nBadminton was a demonstration event at the 1972 and 1988 Summer Olympics. It became an official Summer Olympic sport at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 and its gold medals now generally rate as the sport's most coveted prizes for individual players.\n\nIn the BWF World Championships, first held in 1977, currently only the highest ranked 64 players in the world, and a maximum of four from each country can participate in any category. In both the Olympic and BWF World competitions restrictions on the number of participants from any one country have caused some controversy because they sometimes result in excluding elite world level players from the strongest badminton nations. The Thomas, Uber, and Sudirman Cups, the Olympics, and the BWF World (and World Junior Championships), are all categorized as level one tournaments.\n\nAt the start of 2007, the BWF introduced a new tournament structure for the highest level tournaments aside from those in level one: the BWF Super Series. This level two tournament series, a tour for the world's elite players, stage twelve open tournaments around the world with 32 players (half the previous limit). The players collect points that determine whether they can play in Super Series Finals held at the year-end. Among the tournaments in this series is the venerable All-England Championships, first held in 1900, which was once considered the unofficial world championships of the sport.[24]\n\nLevel three tournaments consist of Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix event. Top players can collect the world ranking points and enable them to play in the BWF Super Series open tournaments. These include the regional competitions in Asia (Badminton Asia Championships) and Europe (European Badminton Championships), which produce the world's best players as well as the Pan America Badminton Championships.\n\nThe level four tournaments, known as International Challenge, International Series, and Future Series, encourage participation by junior players.[25]\n\nComparison with tennis\n\nBadminton is frequently compared to tennis. The following is a list of manifest differences:\n\nScoring: In badminton, a match is played best 2 of 3 games, with each game played up to 21 points. In tennis a match is played best of 3 or 5 sets, each set consisting of 6 games and each game ends when one player wins 4 points or wins two consecutive points at deuce points. If both teams are tied at \"game point\", they must play until one team achieves a two-point advantage. However, at 29–all, whoever scores the golden point will win. In tennis, if the score is tied 6–6 in a set, a tiebreaker will be played, which ends once a player reaches 7 points or when one player has a two-point advantage.\n\nIn tennis, the ball may bounce once before the point ends; in badminton, the rally ends once the shuttlecock touches the floor.\n\nIn tennis, the serve is dominant to the extent that the server is expected to win most of his service games (at advanced level & onwards); a break of service, where the server loses the game, is of major importance in a match. In badminton, a server has far less an advantage and is unlikely to score an ace (unreturnable serve).\n\nof service, where the server loses the game, is of major importance in a match. In badminton, a server has far less an advantage and is unlikely to score an (unreturnable serve). In tennis, the server has two chances to hit a serve into the service box; in badminton, the server is allowed only one attempt.\n\nA tennis court is approximately twice the length and width of a badminton court.\n\nTennis racquets are about four times as heavy as badminton racquets, 10 to 12 ounces (280 to 340 grams) versus 2 to 3 ounces (57 to 85 grams). [26] [27] Tennis balls are more than eleven times heavier than shuttlecocks, 57 grams (2.0 ounces) versus 5 grams (0.18 ounces). [28] [29]\n\nTennis balls are more than eleven times heavier than shuttlecocks, 57 grams (2.0 ounces) versus 5 grams (0.18 ounces). The fastest recorded tennis stroke is Samuel Groth's 163.4 miles per hour (263 kilometres per hour) serve,[30] whereas the fastest badminton stroke during gameplay was Lee Chong Wei's 253 miles per hour (407 kilometres per hour) recorded smash at the 2015 Hong Kong Open.[31]\n\nStatistics such as the smash speed, above, prompt badminton enthusiasts to make other comparisons that are more contentious. For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racquet sport.[citation needed] Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed of a racquet sports projectile, the shuttlecock decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls. In turn, this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the shuttlecock travels: a smashed shuttlecock travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve.\n\nWhile fans of badminton and tennis often claim that their sport is the more physically demanding, such comparisons are difficult to make objectively because of the differing demands of the games. No formal study currently exists evaluating the physical condition of the players or demands during gameplay.\n\nBadminton and tennis techniques differ substantially. The lightness of the shuttlecock and of badminton racquets allow badminton players to make use of the wrist and fingers much more than tennis players; in tennis, the wrist is normally held stable, and playing with a mobile wrist may lead to injury. For the same reasons, badminton players can generate power from a short racquet swing: for some strokes such as net kills, an elite player's swing may be less than 5 centimetres (2 inches). For strokes that require more power, a longer swing will typically be used, but the badminton racquet swing will rarely be as long as a typical tennis swing.\n\nSee also\n\nNotes",

They made us fight for all our chances and made us fight for zone time. They're a big team, they're physical.\"\n\nSuch postgame analysis from Washington's opponents has been common this season as the Capitals' transformation into a more versatile team under coach Barry Trotz has taken hold.\n\nAt an average weight of 209.9 pounds, the Capitals have the heaviest roster in the NHL, among the advantages they utilize.\n\n\"I know it's a heavier team than it has been in the past,\" Trotz said. \"I think you play in the [Stanley Cup] Playoffs a little heavier style, so you're used to that style on a regular basis and so you get used to it. Size is a weapon and I think we're one of the bigger teams, so why not use it?\"\n\nThe Capitals play the New York Rangers on Wednesday (8 p.m. ET; NBCSN, SN1, TVA Sports), the first of three games remaining between the two Metropolitan Division rivals in the final month of the season.\n\nRecently, the heavy style has been associated with the Los Angeles Kings, who have won two of the past three Stanley Cup championships with a brand of physically imposing hockey. All but three players on the Capitals active roster are listed as at least 200 pounds, weight they use to lean on opponents as much as possible.\n\n\"I think it starts with going north with the puck,\" forward Brooks Laich (210 pounds) said. \"You push the pace, you go north with the puck and you get in, you make the other team face their net all the time. When they go back for pucks, you finish.\n\n\"That guy moves the puck, you finish the next guy. You play well as a five-man unit, so F1 [first forechecking forward] finishes, it goes across to the [defenseman], F2 finishes that guy. It goes up the wall, the D-man goes up the wall, finishes on that winger. That's three body checks within three seconds, which wears them down, makes them feel like we're playing fast, makes them feel like we're more aggressive.\"\n\nIn the defensive zone, the Capitals initiate and absorb contact whenever possible along the boards and in front of the crease. On faceoffs, they bump opposing players in order to prevent them from sweeping pucks back and getting inside position.\n\n\"Makes them feel like they're a long way from the net, a long away from scoring,\" Laich said. \"Just always having a shoulder and leaning into somebody all over the ice can really make you feel like a heavy team.\"\n\nAfter failing to qualify for the playoffs last season, the Capitals are in position to return this season, holding the first wild card in the Eastern Conference with 15 games remaining.\n\nThey feel their newly developed rugged style, when combined with their natural talent, makes them a postseason threat.\n\n\"We're playing smarter,\" forward Tom Wilson (210 pounds) said. \"We're not trying all these drop passes and stuff around the blue line. [It] kind of creeps into our game here and there because of the skill that we have, but we've been better about getting back to just making [safe] plays and getting the puck back. Once we get it into the offensive zone, that's when we allow our game to take over and capitalize.\n\n\"There's something to be said about having skill and speed. That kills, but if you have skill, speed and you're big, that's the other team's worst nightmare.\"",

The City and advocates of drug users also fought the federal government in the courts to prevent the Insite supervised drug injection site from closing.\n\nDuring his campaign to become prime minister, Trudeau promised to legalize marijuana and support the opening of more drug injection sites. He also committed to work with Robertson and the provincial government to get a rapid transit line built along the Broadway corridor.\n\n“The lack of federal funding will no longer be a roadblock to action,” said Trudeau during a campaign stop in September from a rooftop patio at Cambie and Broadway, where he announced $20 billion for transit infrastructure across the country. The patio was part of a city-leased building used by engineering staff.\n\nOn housing, Trudeau promised to provide tax incentives to boost development and renovation of rental housing, renew existing co-operative housing agreements set to expire and review temporary and non-resident home purchases.\n\nTrudeau and Robertson, however, have opposing views on Kinder Morgan’s pipeline proposal, with the mayor campaigning against another pipeline from Alberta to Burrard Inlet while Trudeau has said he supports the project provided it meets certain environmental standards.\n\nFour of Vancouver's six MPs are Liberals, including rookies Jody Wilson-Raybould (Vancouver-Granville) and Harjit Sajjan (Vancouver-South).

Average wages would be slightly lower than under current law through 2024, primarily because the amount of capital available to workers would not increase as rapidly as the number of workers and because the new workers would be less skilled and have lower wages, on average, than the labor force under current law. However, the rate of return on capital would be higher under the legislation than under current law throughout the next two decades. [Congressional Budget Office, June 2013]\n\nReal GNP Would Rise Overall By 2.4 Percent In 2023 And 4.5 Percent In 2033. According to the CBO report, real Gross National Product (GNP) could increase by as much as 4.8 percent in 2033 but would be greater by 2.4 percent in 2023 and 4.5 percent in 2033:\n\nThe effects of the legislation on real GNP would be slightly smaller because increases in the rate of return on capital and in interest rates would imply greater flows of profits and interest to foreigners. According to CBO's central estimates, real GNP would be greater by 2.4 percent in 2023 and by 4.5 percent in 2033. Under the full range of estimates, the bill could boost GNP by an amount between 4.1 percent and 4.8 percent in 2033. [Congressional Budget Office, June 2013]\n\nCBO: Per Capita GNP Would Decrease Due To Increase In Population. According to the CBO, the per capita GNP would decrease temporarily over the next decade, even though Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would increase by 5.4 percent by 2033 due to the increased population growth associated with immigration reform, and GNP is expected to rise again by 2033:\n\nTaking account of all economic effects (including those reflected in the cost estimate), the bill would increase real (inflation adjusted) GDP relative to the amount CBO projects under current law by 3.3 percent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033, according to CBO's central estimates. Compared with GDP, gross national product (GNP) per capita accounts for the effect on incomes of international capital flows and adjusts for the number of people in the country. Relative to what would occur under current law, S. 744 would lower per capita GNP by 0.7 percent in 2023 and raise it by 0.2 percent in 2033, according to CBO's central estimates. Per capita GNP would be less than 1 percent lower than under current law through 2031 because the increase in the population would be greater, proportionately, than the increase in output; after 2031, however, the opposite would be true. [Congressional Budget Office, June 2013]\n\nCBO: Temporary Reductions In Wages And Per Capita GNP \"Do Not Imply That Current U.S. Residents Would Be Worse Off.\" The estimated reduction in average wage and per capita GNP include immigrants who would be newly legalized who would earn lower wages, on average, than other residents, but that does not mean current U.S. residents will be worse off than under current law:\n\nThe estimated reductions in average wages and per capita GNP for much of the next two decades do not necessarily imply that current U.S. residents would be worse off, on average, under the legislation than they would be under current law. Both of those figures represent differences between the averages for all U.S. residents under the legislation--including both the people who would be residents under current law and the additional people who would come to the country under the legislation--and the averages under current law for people who would be residents in the absence of the legislation. As noted, the additional people who would become residents under the legislation would earn lower wages, on average, than other residents, which would pull down the average wage and per capita GNP; at the same time, the income earned by capital would increase. [emphasis added] [Congressional Budget Office, June 2013]\n\nUnemployment Would Increase By 0.1 Percentage Point Over The Next Five Years. According to the CBO report, enacting the immigration reform bill would increase the unemployment rate by 0.1 percent over the next five years:\n\nAs a result, enacting S. 744 would raise the unemployment rate over the next five years by up to roughly 0.1 percentage point relative to projections under current law; the rate would remain slightly elevated through 2020, CBO estimates. [Congressional Budget Office, June 2013]\n\nShort-Term Increase In Unemployment Rate Due In Part To Immigration Reform Is Due To Expanding Workforce And Lack Of Occupations Available To Workers. According to the CBO report, the short-term increase in the unemployment rate would be in part due to the arrival of new immigrants who would not be able to fill the jobs demanded. Some workers would be forced to move into new fields in order to restore equilibrium which causes short-term unemployment. [Congressional Budget Office, June 2013]\n\nCBO: Legislation Would Have \"No Effect On Unemployment After 2020.\" According to the CBO report, the immigration reform bill would have no effect on the unemployment rate after the year 2020. [Congressional Budget Office, June 2013]\n\nCBO: Over Long Term, \"There Would Be Little Effect On The Unemployment Rate.\" According to the CBO report, the long-term unemployment rate would be \"comparable, on average, to that of the current population\":\n\nIn the long run, the actual unemployment rate in the economy tends to be close to its natural rate. The natural rate of unemployment of the additional immigrants would be comparable, on average, to that of the current population, CBO expects, so there would be little effect on the unemployment rate in the long run. Thus, in the long run, the number of employed people would increase by the same percentage as the growth in the labor force--by about 3½ percent in 2023 and by about 5 percent in 2033, CBO estimates. [Congressional Budget Office, June 2013]\n\nActual, Long-Term Effects Of Legislation Would Be Positive For American Workers And Economy\n\nOver 2014-2023 Period, U.S. Could See A Net Savings Of $175 Billion. According to a summary of the CBO's report, the United States would see the federal budget deficit decrease by $197 billion between 2014 to 2023. Combined with increased discretionary outlays of $22 billion over the same time period, the net savings for the U.S. would be $175 billion. [Congressional Budget Office, 6/18/13]\n\nOver 2024-2033 Period, U.S. Could See A Net Savings Of $700 Billion. According to the CBO, changes in direct spending and revenues would decrease federal budget deficits by approximately $700 billion over the second decade following the bill's enactment:\n\nThe additional amount of federal direct spending stemming from enactment of S. 744 would grow after 2023 as more people became eligible for federal benefits as a result of the bill. The additional amount of federal revenues owing to the legislation also would increase after 2023 as the labor force continued to increase. On balance, CBO and JCT estimate that those changes in direct spending and revenues would decrease federal budget deficits by about $700 billion (or 0.2 percent of total output) over the 2024-2033 period. In addition, the legislation would have a net discretionary cost of $20 billion to $25 billion over the 2024-2033 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. According to CBO's central estimates (within a range that reflects the uncertainty about two key economic relationships in CBO's analysis), the economic impacts not included in the cost estimate would further reduce deficits (relative to the effects reported in the cost estimate) by about $300 billion over the 2024-2033 period. [Congressional Budget Office, 6/18/13]\n\nRelative To Current Law, Immigration Bill Would Increase Average Wages, Boost Capital Investment And Raise Productivity Of Labor And Capital Over Long Term. According to a summary by the CBO, long-term benefits to the U.S. economy include increases in employment, wages, capital investment, and productivity of labor and capital. [Congressional Budget Office, 6/18/13]\n\nCBO Findings Supported By Various Studies\n\nCenter For American Progress: \"The Positive Economic Impacts\" Of Providing Immigrants Legal Status \"Likely To Be Very Large.\" In a comprehensive report titled, \"The Economic Effects of Granting Legal Status and Citizenship to Undocumented Immigrants,\" the Center for American Progress found that immigration reform that includes legal status and a pathway to citizenship yields significant economic benefits:\n\nThe positive economic impacts on the nation and on undocumented immigrants of granting them legal status and a road map to citizenship are likely to be very large. The nation as a whole would benefit from a sizable increase in GDP and income and a modest increase in jobs. The earnings of unauthorized immigrants would rise significantly, and the taxes they would pay would increase dramatically. Given that the full benefits would phase in over a number of years, the sooner we grant legal status and provide a road map to citizenship to unauthorized immigrants, the sooner Americans will be able to reap these benefits. It is also clear that legalization and a road map to citizenship bestow greater gains on the American people and the U.S. economy than legalization alone. [Center for American Progress, 3/20/13]\n\nCato Institute: Immigration Reform Would \"Lay The Foundation For Robust, Just, And Widespread Economic Growth.\" The Cato Institute made the case for immigration reform in a 2012 study, which concluded that immigration reform will benefit both undocumented immigrants and the U.S. economy:\n\nThe experience of IRCA and the results of our modeling both indicate that legalizing currently unauthorized immigrants and creating flexible legal limits on future immigration in the context of full labor rights would raise wages, increase consumption, create jobs, and generate additional tax revenue--particularly in those sectors of the U.S. economy now characterized by the lowest wages. This is a compelling economic reason to move away from the current \"vicious cycle\" where enforcement-only policies perpetuate unauthorized migration and exert downward pressure on already-low wages, and toward a \"virtuous cycle\" of worker empowerment in which legal status and labor rights exert upward pressure on wages. Legalization of the nation's unauthorized workers and new legal limits on immigration that rise and fall with U.S. labor demand would help lay the foundation for robust, just, and widespread economic growth. Moving unauthorized workers out of a vulnerable underground status strengthens all working families' ability to become more productive and creates higher levels of job-generating consumption, thereby laying a foundation for long-term community revitalization, middle-class growth, and a stronger, more equitable national economy.

  "latent_4940": "How bad has this election been for Canada's international reputation?\n\nCongratulations, Canada: now the world is talking about your Prime Minister’s “racist” rhetoric\n\nCongratulations, Canada: now the world is talking about your Prime Minister’s “racist” rhetoric\n\nHow do we want the world to see us?\n\nThis last month has been devastating for Canada’s international reputation – from 1-800 hotlines to snitch on your neighbours to screening refugees based on their religion to policing how a handful of women dress, it doesn’t square with what most Canadians have in mind when they think: mutual-respect.\n\nWhen Americans start turning their heads away from train wrecks like Donald Trump or Sarah Palin and ask what’s “going on up in Canada?” it might be a sign we’ve got an image problem.\n\nHere are eight international news stories that underline just how far off course Stephen Harper’s divisive rhetoric has taken all of us:\n\n1. New York Times: “Canada has its Trump moment”\n\nThe New York Times is one of the biggest and most prestigious newspapers in the world. A recent headline suggests Harper is turning to a Donald Trump-style of “demonizing” Muslims all in a selfish drive to win the election:\n\n“Effectively, Mr. Harper hopes to win his fourth term on Oct. 19 in part by demonizing those few who wear the niqab — and much of Canada’s Muslim population by extension.”\n\n2. The Economist: Harper is “Muslim-bashing” as a “campaign tactic”\n\nThe Economist informs its international readership that Harper’s “Muslim-bashing” rhetoric appears to have spurred a series of physical attacks on Muslim-Canadians:\n\nThe [Niqab] fuss is a godsend for Stephen Harper, who hopes voters will re-elect him for a fourth term as prime minister—despite their fatigue with his ten-year rule and a weak economy … Canada’s 1m Muslims are dismayed. Although hate crimes in general are declining, those targeting Muslims are not. In the past week, a pregnant woman wearing a headscarf in Montreal was knocked down by two teenagers. Another wearing a niqab in Toronto said she was assaulted. Politicising the niqab is “unbelievably dangerous,” said Calgary’s mayor, Naheed Nenshi, who is a Muslim.\n\n3. The Guardian: Harper is using “Islamophobia to make gains in polls”\n\nA recent article in the UK-based Guardian observes that Harper’s fear-mongering about foreigners has gotten so over-the-top, he’s starting to sound like Donald Trump:\n\n“Thanks to candidates like Donald Trump and Ben Carson, American political discourse seems to be dominated by xenophobia. Now, Canada seems to be following suit.”\n\n4. Washington Post: Harper is playing “a dangerous xenophobic game”\n\nOver at the Washington Post, confusion abounds as to how an “insignificant” issue has dominated a Canadian election at the same time as our economy is tanking and a few other issues that actually present a threat to the security and welfare of Canadians:\n\n“There are lots of important issues at stake, including Canada’s flagging economy, its role in counterterrorism operations overseas, and the looming specter of climate change. But, of late, something far more insignificant has begun to dominate the conversation: whether Muslim women can wear the niqab, a type of full-face veil, during Canadian citizenship ceremonies.”\n\n5. Esquire Magazine: “What the f–k is going on up in Canada?”\n\nEsquire Magazine has a piece that says Harper has “learned all the wrong lessons from the Bush-Cheney-Halliburton years” and is “going to Trump University this time around”:\n\n“​Once uncorked, xenophobia rarely stays in the bottle. If it’s not questioning someone’s citizenship, it’s good old-fashioned nativism.”\n\n6. The Independent: Harper’s rhetoric has “dark, racist overtones”\n\nA headline in the British daily The Independent expressed disbelief that Canadian democracy is losing its way – “something has gone profoundly wrong”:\n\n“Faithful ally of Britain in two world wars, peacekeeper to the world, Nato but neutral across the globe, it’s difficult to believe that Canada’s democracy might have come adrift. But the last weeks of election campaigning by Stephen Harper’s ruling Conservative party – with its dark, racist overtones and anti-Muslim rhetoric — suggests that something has gone profoundly wrong with the nation which Winston Churchill once called “the linchpin of the English-speaking peoples.”\n\n7. Vox: “Disturbing questions” are being raised “about how Canada sees Muslims and immigrants”\n\nCalling it a disturbing “wedge issue,” the news website Vox attempted to explain to American readers why an “unusual issue” could come to dominate Canada’s election news coverage:\n\n“It’s not as if there’s an epidemic of Muslim women wearing niqabs to Canadian citizenship ceremonies. But in the past months, and especially the past few weeks, the niqab issue has become a huge part of Harper’s campaign. What’s more, it appears to be working — raising some pretty disturbing questions about how Canada sees Muslims and immigrants.”\n\n8. Salon: “White people don’t have to worry about Canada’s new ‘report your neighbor’ hotline”\n\nBut at least Salon, a New York-based outlet covering current affairs, took note of how Canadians have been ruthlessly mocking the “Conservatives’ racist strategy”:\n\n“The criticism of “Report Your Neighbor” has been voluble, with news outlets emphasizing that the Conservative defense of “old-stock”— i.e. White –“Canadian values” is, rather, a coded way of validating Islamophobia in Canada, and that this fear-mongering has led to vicious physical attacks against Muslim women wearing the veil, including one pregnant woman. (The irony abounds, for it would seem that women and children could, in fact, use some protection from “barbaric cultural practices,” just the ones that are being whipped up by the “old-stock” government itself.) Meanwhile, internetizens have been grimly mocking the racism of “Report Your Neighbor.” Not only has a satire site popped up to target the Un-Canadian behavior of Conservatives, but the hashtag #BarbaricCulturalPractices has been skewering the campaign.”\n\nMaybe that should give us all hope.\n\nBecause if there’s one thing that unites us as Canadians, it’s ridiculing bad Conservative ideas. It’s what we do best.",
  "latent_5161": "Rep. Nadler Proposes The RIAA Bailout Act Of 2012\n\nfrom the riaa-bailout dept\n\n“The lack of a performance royalty for terrestrial radio airplay is a significant inequity and grossly unfair. We can’t start a race to the bottom when it comes to royalty rates and compensation for artists,\" Nadler said in a statement. \"The Interim FIRST Act would provide artists with fair compensation for the valuable creations they share with all of us.\"\n\nAh, the whole fight over licensing and royalty rates for internet radio had been quiet for a little while, but has sprung back up thanks to Rep. Jerry Nadler proposing a music royalty bill that would effectively bump up the rates that cable and satellite radio stations have to pay to make them more aligned with the insanely high rates that internet streamers are supposed to pay (rates so high, and set by a group of judges who don't appear to know what the internet is half the time, that no real business can be built off of them). This is in contrast to a different, but similar, attempt by Rep. Jason Chaffetz to basically bring the internet rates back down to the same rates as those other providers.Of course, this is all somewhat related to the RIAA's ongoing push for a Performance Rights Act , which would force radio stations to pay extra royalties for when they play music. Under existing law, radio stations only pay the composers/songwriters for songs played on the air, due to the recognition that radio airplay is basically a massive advertisement for the musicians and it's silly to have stations pay the copyright holders for advertising their works. In fact, it's doubly crazy when you realize that the history of radio is filled with pretty indisputable evidence that the major music labels find tremendous value in radio play: payola. Payola is all about the labels increasing the airplay, knowing that it leads to all sorts of revenue elsewhere. But the RIAA is so insanely greedy these days that it's been begging for this form of a \"bailout\" for quite some time -- seeking to get radio stations to pay them for playing the same music that the labels are paying the stations (indirectly, of course, thanks to all the payola settlements) to play!These proposals don't directly address that issue, but are clearly based on this idea. In fact, Nadler is incredibly upfront that he views taxing internet radio is his way ofthe money that isn't being collected from terrestrial radio:In other words, because we can't fund an RIAA bailout off the backs of terrestrial radios (thanks in part to the powerful lobbying of the NAB), we'll instead increase the existing (and already crippling) tax on the useful and innovative services that are trying to help drag the RIAA (kicking and screaming) into the future.Pandora is, quite reasonably, worried about this turn of events, noting that this new tax would be \"astonishingly unfair.\" Nadler seems to think that Chaffetz's plan is unfair because it would mean lower royalties from the internet streamers, but that's a gross distortion for a few reasons. First off, it assumes a perfectly static market, which is wrong. Second, it seems to assume that the identical number of services and the identical number of listens will occur. That's not true. As it stands now, the rates are so damaging that Pandora -- the top player in the space -- has made it clear it maybe profitable. Yes, never. Nadler's bill would effectively make sure that no one else in that market would be profitable either. The end result? Many of these services don't exist or never get started. That would actually meanservices,listeners androyalties.It's almost as if he has no concept of price elasticity. Lower prices can create higher total income. Also, the idea that any particular Congressional Rep. should be (effectively) determining what the \"fair\" price is for anything is, well, horrifying.If these royalties are going to exist, is it really so crazy to think that perhaps (just perhaps) keeping the rates low, to encourage these useful new services to come along and grow, might be a good thing? But, instead, the RIAA and its members are so greedy for the largest payout per music listen, that they're clearly willing to kill off useful legal streaming services like Pandora. In the long run, that's not good (at all) for the record labels and the RIAA, but they've never been particularly good at seeing beyond the price per listen.Either way, can anyone explain just why the government is bailing out the RIAA in the first place?\n\nFiled Under: bailout, internet streaming, jerry nadler, licensing, royalties\n\nCompanies: riaa",
  "latent_5164": "It was probably with a strong sense of relief that George Washington wearily made his way to his second-floor bedchamber on the evening of July 9, 1799. A self-described old man at 67 years of age and with little more than five months of life ahead of him, Washington had just completed a task that seemingly resolved an issue that had troubled him for decades. It was on that day that the former president finished writing his last will and testament, which spelled out his directions for freeing the more than 100 enslaved human beings that he personally owned. Much more than just a functional legal instrument, the will served as Washington’s final message to his country, and the manumission clause represented one of the most symbolic acts of his long and distinguished career in public service.\n\nGiven the nature of this type of document, Washington addressed a range of personal matters in dividing his estate among his heirs. Debts owed to him by family members were forgiven; personal items, such as the many swords and canes that he had acquired over the course of his public career, were distributed as cherished mementos; and the thousands of acres that Washington had acquired so assiduously over the years were parceled out among a substantial number of relatives. Because Washington had no offspring of his own, his estate was passed on to the children of his siblings, to the Custis family relations he gained by marriage, to a select few old friends and to his wife, Martha Dandridge Custis Washington.\n\nThe former president also made clear statements on other topics that were aimed at a much wider audience. He took this opportunity to reinvigorate his one-man campaign for the creation of a national university by authorizing a portion of his estate to help endow it. But the clause in the will to which Washington probably devoted far more attention than any other — and which he hoped would send an unmistakable message to his countrymen — dealt with the issue of slavery. With the stroke of a pen, Washington set in motion the apparatus intended to free 123 enslaved African-American men, women and children.\n\nWhile Washington acted to manumit those slaves that he owned in his own right, more than 150 other enslaved workers living at Mount Vernon were the legal property of the heirs to the estate of Daniel Parke Custis, Martha Washington’s first husband, and they remained in bondage. Under Virginia law, the Custis (or ‘dower’) slaves could not be freed without payment of compensation to the heirs. At an estimated average value of 40 pounds sterling per slave, this would have amounted to a payment of more than 6,000 pounds. By comparison, the total profit Washington received from all of his plantation operations for the year 1797 was calculated at just less than 900 pounds sterling.\n\nMany of the dower slaves were the spouses and children resulting from the intermarriage of Custis and Washington slaves. George Washington elected to honor the marital status of the Mount Vernon slaves, even though unions among the enslaved had no legal standing in Virginia. He followed through on his conviction by consistently working to keep the families from being dispersed, even when doing so would have been in his own financial best interest. He repeatedly declined to sell unneeded slaves if it meant that family members would be separated. In a 1786 letter, Washington emphasized his unwillingness to carry out any such transactions, stating that ‘it is…against my inclination…to hurt the feelings of those unhappy people by a separation of man and wife, or of families.’\n\nIt was this quandary — the desire to free his slaves, balanced against the sorrow that would result from being able to liberate some but not all of the Mount Vernon slaves — that was at the heart of Washington’s thoughtful deliberations over the provisions of his will. In the end he arrived at a compromise: He stipulated that those slaves he owned were to be freed, but only after the deaths of both himself and his wife. All the careful planning was needed in order to avoid witnessing the ‘painful sensations’ that were sure to result from the enforced separation of the intertwined families.\n\nThree years earlier, when it came time for Washington to announce his decision to forego a third term as president, he had expressed his views on a variety of topics, but conspicuously avoided mentioning slavery. Instead, he maintained silence on the issue. Undoubtedly he viewed this most troubling of all problems as having the potential to destroy the fragile union that was his life’s work and chief political legacy. For both Congress and the president, silence signified that for the time being this most controversial topic had been laid to rest.\n\nBut to conclude that George Washington’s highest priority was to ensure the future of the nation at virtually any cost — and that potentially divisive issues such as slavery could not be allowed to threaten that goal — is to let Washington and the other founders off much too easily from the charge of hypocrisy. At the same time, it minimizes the struggle that Washington and many of his contemporaries experienced in arriving at their decision. George Washington may have had more depth and breadth of experience than any other man of his generation in dealing with the thorny questions associated with slavery. To examine the circuitous route by which Washington arrived at his parallel decisions — public inaction on the one hand, his personal motivation to resolve the specific issue of the disposition of the Mount Vernon slaves on the other — is to cast light on the difficult questions that had to be addressed.\n\nBorn into a world where slavery was considered a normal part of life, George Washington initially appears to have felt no qualms about following along the same slaveholding path taken by his father, by his many relatives and by virtually every other man of wealth and status whom he knew and respected. At the age of 11, George Washington inherited 10 slaves from his father’s estate. Just as he was ever eager to expand his landholdings, to improve the productivity of his farms and to win election to public office, he steadily acquired more slaves during the next two decades. Along with marrying well, another arena in which Washington was enormously successful, these achievements were the main components of the tried-and-true formula for acquiring wealth and social prominence in colonial Virginia.\n\nOver the course of his lifetime Washington’s attitudes toward slavery seem to have undergone a marked transformation. From his initial unquestioning support for slavery as an economic institution and a wholehearted commitment to it as a core element of his personal prosperity, through time he became increasingly frustrated at dealing with its inherent inefficiencies, and he also grew troubled by the degrading effects it had on anyone who was deeply involved with it. This change of heart is evident at least by 1778, when he remarked that ‘every day [I] long more and more to get clear of [Negroes].’ At the same time Washington became convinced that continuing to own slaves would be a mistake, he decided to discontinue selling them. He commented, ‘The advantages resulting from the sale of my Negroes, I have very little doubt of…[but] my scruples arise from a reluctance in offering these people at public vendue.’ Some years later Washington expressed his opinion on the topic even more candidly, remarking, ‘Were it not then, that I am principled ag[ains]t selling Negroes, as you would Cattle in the market, I would not, in twelve months from this date, be possessed of one as a slave.’\n\nWashington was caught in a conundrum from which he would never really find a way to extricate himself. By 1786 his thinking had progressed to the next level, marked by his statement that ‘I never mean to possess another slave by purchase; it being among my first wishes to see some plan adopted by the Legislature, by which slavery in this Country may be abolished by slow, sure and imperceptible degrees.’\n\nThese developments in Washington’s thoughts stemmed from the evolution, begun long before, of his disillusionment with the American colonies’ subservient role within the British mercantile system. Washington’s changing attitude toward Britain was influenced greatly by his dismay over his own steadily declining fortunes in navigating the tobacco export trade, which was the first of many steps he made along the path to his commitment to the cause of American independence. Just as Washington’s misgivings over America’s place in the British empire initially were related to his own economic concerns, the basis for his questioning the viability of slavery also first seems to have been related to financial considerations.\n\nAs early as 1766 Washington had veered from the staple-crop system based on tobacco production, which he had so eagerly embraced less than a decade before. Instead he turned to cultivating cereal grains, redoubled his efforts at achieving self-sufficiency and increased his commitment to commercial enterprises. Washington’s decision stemmed from his dissatisfaction with the tobacco consignment system, the declining international market for Virginia tobacco and his alarming descent into debt to his London factor. Characteristically, Washington took a series of bold measures to stem the tide of debt and place his plantation on a firmer financial footing. With the shift from tobacco to more diversified grain production, with wheat as his cash crop, new methods of cultivation could be used that had a dramatic effect on Washington’s labor needs. Gone were the many labor-intensive tasks related to growing tobacco: the numerous intermediate steps required to prepare seeds and soil; hand planting, processing, curing and transporting the crop; plus the backbreaking toil of hoe agriculture. Grain farming was a much less intensive occupation that could take advantage of animal power and a growing battery of implements and methods calculated to further reduce the human labor required.\n\nThrough time Washington succeeded in hoisting himself out of debt by more closely attending to his affairs, mastering the new art of wheat production, working to make Mount Vernon a more self-sufficient operation, and, not least of all, by benefiting from an additional influx of cash from the Custis estate. But even as he did so he found that, try as he might to develop new industries and occupations to employ all his slaves, he possessed many more unskilled black laborers than he would ever need. Although his close attention to his financial ledgers meant that Mount Vernon would remain a profitable venture for decades to come, it was clear to Washington that unless he was willing to divest himself of a significant portion of his workers, they would constitute an ever-increasing drain on his resources. Late in life, Washington summed up his predicament with his usual insight and precision:\n\nIt is demonstratively clear, that on this Estate [Mount Vernon] I have more working Negroes by a full moiety, than can be employed to any advantage in the farming system….To sell the overplus I cannot, because I am principled against this kind of traffic in the human species. To hire them out, is almost as bad, because they could not be disposed of in families to any advantage, and to disperse the families I have an aversion.\n\nJust as George Washington’s eight years of fighting for American independence served as a catalyst for his conviction that a strong central government would be critical to the success of the new nation, it was during this period that his growing doubts about slavery seem to have received a significant boost. Washington’s general attitudes toward slavery already may have begun to change by the time he left Philadelphia in the summer of 1775 to take command of the Continental Army camped outside Boston. Even so, there is no question that he assumed that blacks would play little or no part in the prosecution of the war, other than in their traditional role of providing labor to support the American troops. The British had other ideas, however, and Washington was soon forced to reconsider his army’s policies in the matter.\n\nWashington’s initial objection to using blacks as soldiers was manifested in a general order that excluded ‘Negroes’ from service, along with ‘Boys unable to bear Arms…and old men unfit to endure the fatigues of the campaign.’ Shortly afterward, Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia who had embarked on a campaign to harass the American home front and disrupt the war effort, offered slaves their freedom in exchange for enlisting in the king’s service. In response to Dunmore’s actions, and at least partly because of the continuing shortage of fighting men willing to enlist in his army, Washington and Congress soon changed the policy to allow ‘free Negroes’ to join the Continental forces.\n\nMeasures to allow enslaved blacks to join the army as well, and to reward them with their freedom in exchange for their service, were initiated over the next several years. One such scheme called for the legislatures of Georgia and South Carolina to create army units made up of slaves, who would then be freed following their discharge. This plan met with strong opposition in the two states involved, culminating in the threat that South Carolina might even withdraw its support for the war effort. Washington’s silence on the matter and his tempered reaction to the failure of the plan clearly indicate that he was fully aware of the volatility of the subject and foreshadows his decision to abstain from the heated debates on slavery that were to recur during the Constitutional Convention a decade later. The basic issue that Washington saw in 1779 was that the ‘Spirit of Freedom which at the commencement of this contest would have gladly sacrificed every thing to the attainment of its object has long since subsided, and every selfish Passion has take[n] its place — it is not the public but the private Interest which influences the generality of Mankind nor can the Americans any longer boast an exception.’ In other words, private interest already had reestablished itself as the dominant force in American society, and all efforts to affect the institution of slavery would henceforth be held accountable to it.\n\nNevertheless, the spirit of liberty that had been so invigorated by the events of the 1770s did manifest itself in a number of important measures affecting the status of America’s slaves. In 1777 the constitution for the new state of Vermont completely abolished slavery, and Massachusetts soon followed suit. Many other Northern states, such as Pennsylvania in 1780, adopted legislation aimed at gradual emancipation during this period, although it was not until 1804 that New Jersey finally enacted a similar law. Not surprisingly, in the South anti-slavery gains were much more modest. But three Southern states, including Virginia in 1782, passed laws that made it possible for owners to manumit their slaves. It was the provisions of this law that Washington had to respect in formulating the manumission plan outlined in his will.\n\nWith his status as the preeminent symbol of American independence confirmed in the days following the peace of 1783, Washington became the focal point for many who sought to bring the Revolution’s rhetoric on the inalienable rights of man to bear on other issues. Not surprisingly, probably the most prominent among them were men seeking to abolish slavery throughout the United States. Those who approached Washington on the subject reflected the remarkable diversity of perspectives and approaches found within the growing abolition movement. These included highly principled men, such as the Marquis de Lafayette and others who served during the Revolution, who knew Washington well. They argued their case on the proposition of universal freedom. Privately, Washington expressed his support for their views — he even encouraged schemes such as Lafayette’s idea to establish a colony of freed slaves in Africa. But publicly Washington maintained his silence.\n\nFrom his position as presiding officer over the Constitutional Convention, Washington had a ringside seat to observe the deep political divisions in the assembly over the question of slavery. The sectional conflicts that had arisen during the war over the enlistment of free blacks and slaves, the differing approaches taken by the individual states in the regulation of slavery within their borders and the conflict over repeated attempts to restrict the international slave trade all served as precursors to the even more highly charged debates that were to come in the convention hall in Philadelphia. Throughout the extended political maneuvering that was required to resolve the many contentious issues on the table, Washington remained silent, at least outwardly. But his fundamental support for a constitution that would unify the nation behind a strong central government remained unshakable. From this perspective, slavery was a topic fraught with danger, and one for which a compromise solution was the best that could be achieved.\n\nFor Washington, and for the great majority of the founders, a provision allowing for the eventual prohibition of the slave trade was crucial to any acceptable compromise. Outlawing the slave trade had been a point of contention for decades and was perceived by abolitionists as the most likely first objective in achieving their ultimate goal. The slave trade was considered a great evil, even by many slaveholding Southerners who opposed abolition itself. Thomas Jefferson renounced the slave trade in his first draft of the Declaration of Independence. Virginia law prohibited further importation of slaves into the commonwealth beginning in 1778. It was almost inevitable that the slave trade became a particular focus of debate in the convention. Opposition to the slave trade was a hallmark of moderate opponents to slavery, such as Washington, who believed that slavery should be eradicated — but who also were convinced that it could not be ended immediately. By shutting off further importation of slaves, it was widely believed, the demise of slavery would come about in time.\n\nEven though the slave trade proviso that was finally incorporated into the Constitution only stipulated that slavery could not be outlawed before 20 years had passed, it nevertheless represented a victory for moderates. Considered a crucial pro-slavery concession in the South, it was a bitter pill for radical abolitionists to swallow. Practically speaking, the compromise only postponed the ultimate resolution of the issue while giving both sides time to bolster their forces. The slave trade was prohibited in due course, but that act had much less impact than the moderate abolitionists had hoped would be the case. For as it should have been clear to anyone who bothered to examine the evidence closely, even by 1790 the influx of additional slaves was hardly needed to guarantee that slavery would continue to expand by natural means. With the benefit of another 20 years of imports, when the slave trade finally was prohibited it did little to inhibit the continued precipitous growth of the enslaved population in America. By 1860 the number of slaves had multiplied to more than five times what it had been 70 years earlier.\n\nDuring the last years of his second presidential administration, Washington began to formulate plans for putting his personal affairs in order against the day when he would again, and finally, retire to private life. A major element of his plan called for easing the strain of overseeing his vast estate by seeking to sell or rent the great bulk of his property. He hoped to find a group of progressive English farmers who could be induced to migrate to America to farm the well-tended, but still lamentably infertile, Mount Vernon fields. For Washington this plan would seem to have been the answer to so many of his most heartfelt desires. Not only would he be free of the toil and aggravation caused by the day-to-day oversight of the plantation, he would also escape the frustrations of trying to adapt a system of slave labor to his innovative vision of Mount Vernon’s future. And perhaps best of all, Washington would presumably experience the satisfaction of finally witnessing firsthand the benefits of the many innovative farming practices that for years he had been trying to adapt from their English agricultural innovators.\n\nThe land scheme took on even greater significance for Washington because it was an integral part of his final, concerted attempt to solve in one clean sweep the vexing problem of the disposition of the Mount Vernon slaves. Given the substantial cost of reimbursing the Custis estate for the value of the dower slaves, finding a method whereby he could afford to free them under the provisions of Virginia’s 1782 manumission act was a challenge. The first indication of Washington’s ambitious plan is contained in a series of letters exchanged in 1794 between him and his secretary and close friend, Tobias Lear, and between Washington and the English agronomist Arthur Young. As Washington portrayed it to Lear, the plan consisted of two interrelated parts: selling his thousands of acres of western lands and selling or renting the four outlying Mount Vernon farms. By divesting himself of most of his acreage, he would no longer require large numbers of slaves to support himself. This, in turn, would allow him to set free the slaves that he owned. In addition, with the profits from the land sales, Washington hoped to be able to buy the dower slaves from the Custis estate in order to set them free. Thus would he overcome the problem of breaking up the intermarried families, since all the slaves could be freed at the same time.\n\nWashington’s apparent willingness to sell off thousands of acres of land to finance his manumission plan suggests that he had come full circle in respect to the status of the Mount Vernon slaves. If much of Washington’s initial ambivalence toward holding hundreds of black workers in bondage was due to financial issues, this plan suggests that his moral concerns now were dominant. Freeing his slaves, even at great cost, had become the highest priority, and Washington was apparently willing to suffer a major reduction to his personal fortune to make that happen.\n\nJust how far Washington had traveled in his odyssey from unabashed slave master to committed opponent of slavery is hinted at in a letter he wrote to Lear in 1794. Washington outlined the benefits that he hoped he would obtain from the plan, which included reducing his expenses to the point where he could support himself through occupations less onerous than farming. But he elaborated further in an aside marked private. ‘I have another motive,’ he wrote, that ‘is indeed more powerful than all the rest, namely to liberate a certain species of property which I possess, very repugnantly to my own feelings; but which imperious necessity compels.’\n\nUnfortunately, Washington received only a few serious inquiries in response to his advertisements to sell his western lands and to sell or rent the Mount Vernon farms. As a consequence, nothing came of his plan to free the dower slaves. Although he never seems to have expressed his thoughts on the topic in writing, his disappointment must have been acute. When he wrote out his last will and testament, Washington was left with the unpleasant task of devising a final plan for the future of Mount Vernon’s slaves to ensure their freedom without forcing families to break up.\n\nWhen Washington developed his compromise, which stipulated that his slaves would not be freed until the death of his wife, he was fully aware of the impact of his decision. Clearly uncomfortable with the knowledge that the freedom of so many depended on her death, after her husband died Martha Washington decided to implement the clause of his will to manumit her husband’s slaves. This was authorized on December 15, 1800 (to take effect the following January 1), just a year after George Washington’s death and almost 18 months before Martha Washington herself died. While there is no record of the reactions of the Mount Vernon slaves to this event, either on the part of those freed or those who remained in bondage, it must have been the cause of much sadness as well as joy.\n\nWith the failure of his land sales and rental scheme, Washington simply did not have the ready money needed to compensate the Custis estate for the value of the dower slaves. But although the legal wrangling to accomplish it may have ultimately proven unsuccessful — and such an act undoubtedly would have been unprecedented — it seems that George Washington might still have found a way to free the Custis slaves if he had been willing to devote a considerable portion of his estate to that end. As he had apparently seriously considered divesting himself of much of his landholdings just a few years earlier, hoping to pay for freeing the dower slaves, it is puzzling that Washington did not make one final attempt. Or maybe the final decision to give up on the effort to free the dower slaves simply reflects the exhaustion of an old, worn-out man. Whatever the reason, the decision indicates that there was an upper limit that even George Washington placed on the value of his principles. Unfortunately, there is no doubt that this was a condition shared by the vast majority of his slaveholding contemporaries. Nevertheless, Washington’s serious attempt to free all of the Mount Vernon slaves demonstrates his commitment to the principle of emancipation at a time when most of the founding generation of slaveholders were avoiding the issue entirely.\n\nWashington’s will swiftly gained the public attention envisioned by its author, appearing in print almost immediately, with no less than 13 editions published in 10 different cities in 1800 alone. And yet, if Washington hoped that the decision to free his slaves would compel large numbers of his countrymen to follow his lead, he was sadly mistaken. In fact, his example failed to make a significant impression even on the members of his own family. Although Martha Washington controlled the dower slaves, they were still the property of her first husband’s estate. She only owned outright one slave, named Elish. For reasons known only to herself, she chose not to manumit Elish, instead passing him on to her grandson in her will. Of the family members who inherited the more than 150 slaves held by the Custis estate, none of them seem to have elected to free more than a very few.\n\nBushrod Washington, the Supreme Court justice and nephew of George Washington, and the inheritor of the Mount Vernon mansion and 4,000 acres of the estate, never freed the Mount Vernon slaves during his ownership of the plantation. And in fact he even engaged in the practice most abhorred by his famous uncle — the disruption of slave families through public sale. Finally, almost none of George Washington’s peers, either the obscure or the famous — not Jefferson, not Madison, not Monroe — elected to follow their president’s example. We can only speculate on how much suffering and injustice might have been spared succeeding generations if they had.\n\nThis article was written by Dennis J.

Even if you don’t quite grasp the finer details of the problem and the various plans to fix it, it is easy to see that the pension situation threatens to leave Dallas in a very precarious financial position.\n\nThis city is already struggling to keep its streets from degrading even further than they already are, and has a huge inventory of general maintenance and repair needs, plenty of underfunded or mismanaged departments, and a litany of other problems and issues. Thanks to the pension, Dallas could find itself in an even deeper financial hole if it is on the hook for contributing 34.5% of computation pay plus $11 million per year towards the pension, which is what State Rep. Dan Flynn’s remedy for the crises proposes.\n\nThe word “bankruptcy” has been floated around. But even if it doesn’t come to that, a severe tightening of the municipal belt buckle could impact even the basic services we take for granted.\n\nThat’s the scary news for Dallas. Perhaps what’s scarier is that Dallas isn’t alone.\n\nAcross the United States, municipalities and states are struggling with similar unfunded liability crises regarding pensions and civil service retirement packages. For example, Los Angeles is facing $15 billion in debt for its public safety, water, power workers, and general employees pension. In South Carolina, a state plan that serves one in nine South Carolina residents is looking at a $24.1 billion shortfall. Philadelphia woke up last year to the fact that its municipal pension was $5.7 billion in the red. The state of Oregon’s pension is underfunded by $22 billion. Late last year, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation published a report that looked at the Dallas Police and Fire Pension Crisis in light of the situation in other Texas cities. The report found that Texas municipalities owe $18 billion in pension debt.\n\nAll told, by some estimates, state and local governments in the United States are looking at a cumulative total of over $5 trillion in unfunded pension liabilities.\n\nWhy are so many pensions facing similar financial situations? According to one retirement policy commentator writing in Forbes, the same pension management cultural that led to create the Dallas fund’s situation is endemic in many state and local pension funds:\n\nProponents of market-value liability figures, which include most economists as well as many policy analysts concerned about pension funding, argue that current actuarial methods understate pensions’ true benefit liabilities and encourage pensions to take excessive investment risk.\n\nBut the pension crises don’t stop at state and municipal funds. Even corporate pension plans at some of the country’s largest companies are facing huge funding gaps. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC and Citi Research, S&P 500 corporate pensions went from being fully funded in 2007 to an aggregate $375 billion underfunded in just 8 years. Locally, AT&T and American Airlines Group made the top 25 of the Citi Research report’s list of S&P 500 companies with underfunded pension obligations.\n\nWhat does it all mean? Perhaps the answer lies right under our noses. Attempts to fix the Dallas Police and Fire Pension Fund debacle have ranged from reneging on promises made to public servant retirees to raiding our investments in the very services that hold greatest promise for the region’s future sustainability and growth. In other words, Dallas faces choices between rocks and hard places, as well as inevitable periods of austerity, the potential of higher taxes, even more crumbling or poorly maintained infrastructure and a slow corrosion of the very services and infrastructure that give cities their competitive advantage.\n\nAnd we haven’t even talked about the strain on social and medical services created by pensioners facing dwindling resources — precisely at a time when the social safety net is being gutted.\n\nNow multiply that to a national scale. What do you end up with? I kind of can’t even bring myself to think of it.",

  "latent_5697": "It's moving day for bank customers.\n\nA grassroots movement that sprang to life last month is urging bank customers to close their accounts in favor of credit unions by Saturday.\n\nThe spirit behind \"Bank Transfer Day\" caught fire with the Occupy Wall Street protests around the country and had more than 79,000 supporters on its Facebook page as of Friday. The movement has already helped beat back Bank of America's plan to start charging a $5 debit card fee.\n\nIt's not clear to what extent the banking industry's about-face on debit card fees will extinguish the anger driving the movement. But many supporters say their actions are about far more than any single complaint.\n\n\"It's too little, too late,\" said Kristen Christian, the 27-year-old Los Angeles small business owner who started \"Bank Transfer Day.\" She already opened accounts at two credit unions in preparation for cutting ties with Bank of America this weekend.\n\n\"Consumers are waking up and seeing that they have options,\" she said.\n\nEven with its public support, however, it's not likely that any account closings that take place on Saturday will make a big dent with industry titans such as Chase, which is the largest bank in the country with some 26.5 million checking accounts.\n\nBut the call to action shows just how incensed consumers were at the prospect of a debit card fee at a time of so much economic uncertainty. Even those who were appeased by the industry's reversal may have tapped into a new sense of empowerment.\n\nThat's the case for Dan Blakemore, a Bank of America customer for the past 10 years. He said he no longer plans to close his checking account now that the debit fee has been scrapped. But he'll be on the lookout for any other changes that might hit his wallet.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident they're going to find some way to get that extra money,\" said Blakemore, a 28-year-old who works for a nonprofit fundraiser in New York City. \"I'll just have to see if it offends my sensibility enough to close the account.\"\n\nBank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. are keeping mum on whether they've seen an uptick in account closures in recent weeks. But credit unions and small community banks have been basking in the spotlight and issuing press releases highlighting what they say are superior interest rates and more intimate service, along with tips on how consumers can transfer accounts. They haven't been shy about the surge in new business they're enjoying either.\n\nNavy Federal Credit Union, the largest credit union in the country, says new account openings in September and October were up 38 percent from a year ago. National Capital Bank, a two-branch community bank in Washington, D.C., says the vast majority of its new account openings in recent weeks have been by fed up Bank of America customers.\n\n\"The debit fee was definitely a driver,\" said Noah Wilcox, president of Grand Rapids State Bank in Minnesota, which is also enjoying a lift in account openings.\n\nBecause credit unions and community banks vary so greatly in size, however, it's hard to gauge the total scope of the defections they're reporting. For example, the Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union in New York City says it's enjoying more than 55 new account openings a week. That's a big jump from its average of about 10 new accounts per week, but insignificant when weighed against the portfolios of the nation's largest banks.\n\nBig banks have also learned that customer grumblings don't always translate into action. That's particularly true for those who have multiple accounts, direct deposit and automatic bill pay; many decide that switching just isn't worth the hassle.\n\n\"People will do a lot of complaining before they actually uproot and move,\" notes Mark Schwanhausser, a banking analyst with Javelin Strategy & Research.\n\nThe recent firestorm over debit card fees was \"in a class of its own\" because customers saw it as a charge for accessing their own money, he said.\n\nThe timing of Bank of America's fee announcement was unfortunate on multiple levels as well. In addition to the anxiety many are feeling amid high unemployment and stagnant wages, the news broke just as the Occupy Wall Street protests were capturing the national spotlight.\n\nAnd big banks have been a key target for Occupy Wall Street, which has tapped into the lingering resentment many harbor over the role ofbanks in the financial meltdown of 2008.\n\nLast month, two dozen Occupy Wall Street protestors were arrested when they entered a Citibank branch in New York City and refused to leave. Protestors have also banged drums and demonstrated outside bank branches in other cities; PNC Bank twice closed branches in downtown Pittsburgh last week after protestors entered.\n\nBut those are the extremes. Schwanhausser of Javelin said many customers will likely be placated by the industry's white flag on debit card fees.\n\n\"People are people going to look at that Nov. 5 date and say 'We made our point',\" Schwanhausser said\n\nThe banking industry may feel the same way; representatives for Bank of America, Chase, Citi and Wells Fargo indicate they haven't done anything to prepare branch employees for a surge in account closings this weekend. Then again, many of the closures may have already taken place.\n\nMolly Katchpole, a 22-year-old nanny in Washington, D.C., who started an online petition urging Bank of America to drop its debit card fee, says the bank's about-face won't win her back.\n\n\"The damage is done,\" said Katchpole, who has since joined a credit union in Washington, D.C.",
  "latent_5957": "Interim Chief Peter Newsham was appointed Thursday morning as head of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nChief Newsham has been running the department since September, when Cathy L. Lanier stepped down to oversee security for the National Football League.\n\n“As we continue our work in creating a safer, stronger D.C., I am confident that Chief Newsham has the skills and relationships to successfully lead our police force,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a press conference. “He understands and believes in community policing, and he is trusted by members of the community.”\n\nChief Newsham, a 28-year veteran with the department, called his job one of the most “coveted positions in policing” and said his top priority is to build more trust with the community.\n\n“The police are there to help,” he said, adding that community policing is about empathy and respect for residents.\n\nIn the months since Ms. Lanier’s departure, Chief Newsham has overseen the police force’s transition to a sector patrol strategy and the full deployment of body-worn cameras to patrol officers.\n\nBefore being named interim chief, he led the department’s Investigative Services Bureau, which examines violent and narcotics-related crimes. In previous positions, Chief Newsham oversaw the department’s internal affairs and disciplinary review offices, as well as the Northern Regional Command, which includes the department’s 2nd, 3rd and 4th districts.\n\nMiss Bowser said she wanted to wait until after the city found a new schools chancellor and after the presidential inauguration to appoint a new police chief. She praised Chief Newsham’s performance during the inauguration.\n\n“Last month, Chief Newsham oversaw the very successful presidential inauguration, as well as the Women’s March on Washington,” Miss Bowser said. “With the eyes of the world on us, our officers stepped up to the plate and performed.”\n\nDeputy Mayor for Public Safety Kevin Donahue, who led the search for a chief, said the administration received more than 100 applications from across the country.\n\nThose candidates were winnowed to about a dozen, who went through several rounds of interviews, Mr. Donahue said. The four finalists spent “significant time” with Miss Bowser before she chose Chief Newsham.\n\nThe administration also culled opinions from the public. The mayor’s office sent surveys asking for residents’ priorities and views about the police department and received about 6,000 replies.\n\nMiss Bowser released the survey results showing that though most respondents have positive opinions of the police force, there is room for improvement.\n\n“Police are put in place to police the law, not police people. They are ambassadors for the law. They should be in the community to help prevent crime, as opposed to just responding to incidents,” one respondent said.\n\nAnother said police need better training for dealing with residents. “I’ve taken an in-depth look at the police academy curriculum and it is weak,” the respondent said. “I’ve noticed that after five or six years on the beat, officers are not clear on civil and criminal infractions. This leads to reactive instead of proactive interactions with citizens.”\n\nChief Newsham, who needs to be confirmed by the D.C. Council, received praise from several high-level officials.\n\n“Chief Newsham has done a solid job of leading the District’s police department,” said council Chairman Phil Mendelson. “I have complete confidence in his ability to keep the city safe.”\n\nMr. Mendelson said he is happy that Miss Bowser hired from within the department instead of from outside the District.\n\n“The mayor’s decision sends a message to the rank and file that good work leads to promotions and maybe even becoming chief,” he said.\n\nCouncil member Charles Allen, who heads the Judiciary Committee, did not signal whether he supported Chief Newsham’s nomination, but he said he looks forward to hearings on the nominee.\n\nMr. Allen listed priorities for the chief, including a commitment to community policing and relationship building, enhancing the transparency of the department’s operations and data and stabilizing the police force by recruiting and retaining the best of the best.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee will hold three hearings, including two community roundtables, in coming weeks.\n\nD.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said he is impressed by Chief Newsham’s commitment to protecting all city residents.\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.",
  "latent_6048": "Earlier this week, Buzzfeed’s Andrew Kaczynski reported out the fairly bizarre story of Oregon Republican Senate candidate Monica Wehby and the health plan that she plagiarized from Crossroads GPS. Her candidacy has long been a favorite of conservative pundits who convinced themselves that Wehby, a pediatric neurosurgeon running in a state that had an especially rough experience with the Affordable Care Act rollout, was ideally positioned to campaign hard on health policy and take down Democratic incumbent Jeff Merkley.\n\nThe Wehby campaign’s attempts to brush off the Buzzfeed story were inept and made the situation worse. At first they denied everything. “The suggestion that a pediatric neurosurgeon needs to copy a health care plan from American Crossroads is absurd,” a spokesman told Kaczynski, throwing in this gloriously passive-aggressive kicker: “Dr. Wehby is too busy performing brain surgery on sick children to respond, sorry.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThen came the inevitable reckoning: the campaign pulled the plan from the website and copped to the plagiarism, blaming it all on Wehby’s former campaign manager, Charlie Pearce, who denies everything. Now Kaczynski is reporting that Wehby also plagiarized portions of her economic plan from Sen. Rob Portman. You could say all this would hurt Wehby’s chances at victory, but things didn’t look good for her to begin with. Nearly every public poll of the Oregon Senate race has given Merkley a double-digit lead. A Koch-funded outside spending group recently abandoned its plans to air anti-Merkley attack ads in October. Whatever chance at victory she might have has all but vanished.\n\nWhat makes this whole strange scenario even funnier is that while Wehby promoted herself as a staunch Obamacare opponent, conservatives actually hated Wehby’s health plan and had deep suspicions about her on health care in general. During the Republican primary, she was attacked by her Tea Party challenger for having said nice things about a health plan proposed by Oregon’s other Democratic senator, Ron Wyden. And for all her talk of “repealing” Obamacare, she also wanted to keep the parts of it that polled well and would often talk about “fixing” the law, as opposed to doing away with it altogether.\n\nThe talk of “fixing” Obamacare drew the critical attention of National Review’s Ramesh Ponnuru, who wrote a scathing piece for Bloomberg in June arguing that Wehby was simply taking “the popular side of every health-care question” and had thus “come up with a plan that doesn't hang together” and “works at cross-purposes with itself.” Ponnuru’s piece drew angry an response from Charlie Pearce, who was still directing Wehby’s campaign at that time, asking if Ponnuru had even read Wehby’s plan. “I read Wehby's plan more than once,” Ponnuru wrote in response. “No matter how many times I read it, though, I couldn't make it make sense.” Now we know why he couldn’t make sense of it: it was little more than conservative messaging points repurposed as policy.\n\nAs for the pundits who hyped Wehby’s candidacy, their prognostications aren’t looking so hot. George Will wrote in July that very few doctors serve in Congress, “but another doctor may be coming, straight from the operating room to her first elected office.” In May, the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel called Wehby the “Democrats’ worst nightmare,” citing her alleged health policy chops. “She's a policy wonk, able to run rings around Oregon's junior senator, especially on health-care reform,” Strassel wrote. The fact that Wehby’s health policy was pinched from a poll conducted by Karl Rove is, therefore, hilarious.",
  "latent_6078": "About 47 percent will pay no federal income taxes at all for 2009. Either their incomes were too low, or they qualified for enough credits, deductions and exemptions to eliminate their liability.\n\nThat's according to projections by the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research organization.\n\nMost people still are required to file returns by the April 15 deadline. The penalty for skipping it is limited to the amount of taxes owed, but it's still almost always better to file: That's the only way to get a refund of all the income taxes withheld by employers.\n\nIn recent years, credits for low- and middle-income families have grown so much that a family of four making as much as $50,000 will owe no federal income tax for 2009, as long as there are two children younger than 17, according to a separate analysis by the consulting firm Deloitte Tax.\n\nTax cuts enacted in the past decade have been generous to wealthy taxpayers, too, making them a target for President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress. Less noticed were tax cuts for low- and middle-income families, which were expanded when Obama signed the massive economic recovery package last year.\n\nThe result is a tax system that exempts almost half the country from paying for programs that benefit everyone, including national defense, public safety, infrastructure and education. It is a system in which the top 10 percent of earners—households making an average of $366,400 in 2006—paid about 73 percent of the income taxes collected by the federal government.\n\nThe bottom 40 percent, on average, make a profit from the federal income tax, meaning they get more money in tax credits than they would otherwise owe in taxes. For those people, the government sends them a payment.\n\n\"We have 50 percent of people who are getting something for nothing,\" said Curtis Dubay, senior tax policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe vast majority of people who escape federal income taxes still pay other taxes, including federal payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare, and excise taxes on gasoline, aviation, alcohol and cigarettes. Many also pay state or local taxes on sales, income and property.\n\nThat helps explain the country's aversion to taxes, said Clint Stretch, a tax policy expert Deloitte Tax. He said many people simply look at the difference between their gross pay and their take-home pay and blame the government for the disparity.\n\n\"It's not uncommon for people to think that their Social Security taxes, their 401(k) contributions, their share of employer health premiums, all of that stuff in their mind gets lumped into income taxes,\" Stretch said.\n\nThe federal income tax is the government's largest source of revenue, raising more than $900 billion—or a little less than half of all government receipts—in the budget year that ended last Sept. 30. But with deductions and credits, especially for families with children, there have long been people who don't pay it, mainly lower-income families.",
  "latent_6112": "In an era of bad sequels and worse remakes, we've got a genuinely enjoyable horror prequel. And just in time for Halloween.\n\nI tend to shy away from horror movies. Some of it comes from not liking to be scared, but it’s also because there are just so many crappy ones. For every well-done horror movie, there are at least a dozen lazy ones. And considering this is a prequel … I wasn’t very hopeful about this. But The Thing surprised me!\n\nThe movie was legitimately scary, using paranoia to amp up the tension. The pressure between the Norwegians and Americans (especially the language barrier) created even more anxiety in between alien attacks. In this way, the direction was effective. The special effects themselves were just alright. The monster effects didn’t necessarily look bad, but they weren’t anything extraordinary. I don’t see them aging well in the next few years — like the other few horror movies I actually enjoy, the less you see the monster clearly, the scarier it is. However, I did like how the alien moved and how it attacked. It was genuinely scary how fast it took down its victims.\n\nThe female characters are actually far above par compared to the average horror movie. For one, the movie passes the Bechdel test. The two women in the film (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Kim Bubbs respectively), have a quiet conversation in the middle of the night about how finding alien life will change them forever. It’s a poignant moment that builds a bond between the two scientists, and that connection comes back later in the film. Besides that, Winstead’s Kate is smart and resilient. Unlike most actresses trying to pull off serious scientist, I believe Kate. Some of that has to do with the script, which doesn’t suffocate the story with unrealistic pseudo-scientific terms. Another thing I love about Kate? They don’t oversexualize her and she gets to use a flamethrower. It’s just nice to see a movie with explosions that treats the female characters like people first … and then lets them actually fight the monster a little.\n\nI also appreciate that there isn’t really a love story smushed in. Having the protagonist nab a bland love interest can be a crutch in horror movies, and The Thing avoids it. I would say I’d like to know what Kate’s relationship was to Eric Christian Olsen‘s character. Were they colleagues, former students together, just friends? I appreciate the light touch with exposition in the whole film, but that was something I was wondering during the whole movie.\n\nThere are aspects that don’t work as well. The antagonist is a head scientist who is the epitome of wormy greedy idiots. He makes the brilliant choice to take a sample of the alien immediately because you know, that doesn’t scream of hubris. When the alien inevitably escapes, he decides everyone should split up to look for it — horror cliche number one. This goes on for the whole film. I understand that something has to get the alien out of the ice and thus the horror story started, but he’s just such a big movie stereotype. It’s like Walter Peck had a European cousin.\n\nSomething else that took me out of the movie was how easily the characters would weather the elements. They’re in the Antarctic, but they have no problem spending time out doors after dark. Adding in the danger of leaving the buildings and possibly freezing to death could have been a great extra layer to the fear and desperation these people felt. On the other side of the coin, one of their main defenses against the alien is “Kill it with fire!”, and there were multiple scenes where a character was surrounded by fire in an unventilated room and didn’t even cough. Minor details? Maybe, but when a horror movie is actually effective, the little mistakes are even more bothersome. I also have questions about the alien being able to replicate clothing when it can’t replicate metal. Again, details.\n\nI might not have been interested in seeing it on my own, but The Thing was clever, suspenseful and an honestly good prequel. I’ve talked to a couple fans of the 1982 film, and they’ve confirmed that the prequel works with it … there’s even a recreation of the opening scene in the final moments before the credits. At the same time, the movie is solid even if the other film didn’t exist. If you loved the 80s film, you’ll probably enjoy what the prequel adds. However, if you’re like me and are a Thing virgin, go see the new movie to get into the scary Halloween spirit. It stands on its own.\n\nPhoto Credit: Morgan Creek Productions",
  "latent_6140": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video As New Year's Eve approaches, the Chesterfield County Police Department is reminding residents of the dangers of celebratory gunfire, and urging citizens to refrain from it.\n\nWhat goes up will come down, police say, and the consequences could be tragic.\n\nThe story of seven-year-old Brendon Mackey’s tragic holiday death was the most viewed story on WTVR.com this year.\n\nOn July 4th a large crowd had gathered over by the Swift Creek Reservoir, in the Brandermill area, to watch fireworks. As Brendon walked through the Boathouse parking lot with his dad, he collapsed. His father saw blood and thought he may have hit his head.\n\nAt the hospital doctors made the startling discovery of a wound from a .40 caliber bullet in the top of Brendon’s head. To this day, the person who shot off the celebratory gunfire has not come forward, nor been found.\n\nPolice believe the round that struck Brendon was fired randomly into the air, likely from a distance. His death marked the first time in Metro Richmond that someone was killed as a result of unintentional celebratory gunfire.\n\nBrendon’s mother, Marie Harris, who is enduring the pain of celebrating the holidays this year without her son, is making a passionate plea to the public this New Year’s Eve.\n\n“I know it’s another time of year where people like to shoot off guns,” Harris said. “I’m hoping, of course, that this never happens again to anyone. You never think it’s going to be your family and your child.”\n\nWhile celebratory gunfire on New Year’s Eve is well known in some areas, like Churchill, where it’s been famously dubbed the “Churchill Fireworks,” Chesterfield Police Captain Kevin Smith says it’s a growing problem in Chesterfield County as well.\n\n“Celebratory gunfire kills and we know that,” Smith says. “Brendon Mackey’s face should tell you that.”\n\nWhile Smith says the department has increased New Year’s Eve patrols over the years, this year police will be out in even greater numbers looking for celebratory gunfire offenders, especially in dense areas, like apartment complexes, where families live close together.\n\n“We’re going to arrest you,” Smith says. “There’s not going to be a warning and we’re going to seek jail time through the courts and you’re going to be ashamed because we’re going to put your name out there if you’re an adult.”\n\nVirginia State Senator Henry Marsh also plans to introduce legislation this General Assembly session called “Brendon’s Law.” The law will make celebratory gunfire a more specific crime and add to the penalties associated with the offense.\n\nCurrently, shooting a gun into the air is a misdemeanor in the Commonwealth, punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine. Police encourage residents to report any reckless use of firearms immediately.\n\nPolice continue to seek information related to Brendon Mackey's death.\n\nAnyone with information should contact the Chesterfield County Police Department at 804-748-1251 or Crime Solvers at 804-748-0660 or http://www.crimesolvers.net.",
  "latent_6181": "-- Posted Monday, 23 February 2009 | | Source: GoldSeek.com\n\nOriginally posted at http://www.plata.com.mx/plata/ By Hugo Salinas Price Several years ago  I don't remember the date  I read an interesting comment: The great boom that the world is enjoying, is in effect an enormous shorting of cash and going long on debt. Eventually, there will be a short squeeze on cash which will have to be covered by going long on cash and shorting debt. This appears to be a succinct description of events we are now seeing. A tenet of the Austrian School of Economics holds that all human action involves choosing. I am indebted to Professor Antal E. Fekete for the insight that choice involves going long what we choose and giving up  shorting  what we give in exchange. The US consumer has been shorting cash for decades. The very low, sometimes negative savings rate has shown that Americans have not wanted to accumulate cash. Americans did not want to go long on cash, they wanted to short it. They went long on houses to live in, houses to speculate with, boats to have fun with, new cars, extra cars, ocean cruises. They also went long on stocks  now selling for 50% of their value in October 2007. US businesses went in for Cash Management  which was supposed to minimize cash balances  short cash  and go long on purchasing short-term or overnight debt from banks to meet coming maturities. Holding plain cash or checking account balances was old fashioned. Worse, businesses also wanted to expand at all costs. Extend more credit  short your merchandise and go long on accounts receivable  in order to increase sales. Car manufacturers had their own financial arm, to enable them to short their own excess production of autos, and to go long on debts due from customers up to six, seven year's out. The long position in debt held by US banks is enormous. The debt (bank assets) whose market value is known is classified as Tier 1. The debt whose market value can be assumed by comparison with the market value of similar debt is classified as Tier 2. The debt whose value is strictly an assumption on the part of the bank is classified as Tier 3. Then there are the highly dubious assets that some of the big banks are allowed to keep off their balance sheets, as it would not be practical to put them on the Balance Sheet, where accountants know they belong. The banking system of the US went hog wild shorting cash, throwing it around the world in exchange for anything with a signature on it: shorting cash and going long on trash debt instruments. The squeeze on those who shorted cash is now tremendous. The figures on outlandish leverage in US banks and the figures on household debt illustrate the situation. The Fed and the ECB are trying to meet and overcome the short squeeze by providing enormous amounts of money, available at the banks, in an effort to provide funds to those who are trying to cover their shorts on cash by going long  obtaining cash  to cover their long positions on debts owed. The enormous increases in cash available at the banks are insignificant in comparison with the prevailing enormous shorts on cash and long positions in debt. The squeeze is implacable. In effect, everyone on God's green earth is trying to obtain cash - going long on cash - in order to cover their long positions on debt. If consumers and businesses refuse to spend and instead pay back debts  This is saying in effect, consumers and businesses are now attempting to go long cash and cover their long positions on (i.e., short) debt. High time they did so. News today is that US businesses face $200 billion in debt coming due in the next three years. They are going to be terribly squeezed for cash. Maybe lots of businesses will simply declare bankruptcy. Cash is being hoarded by banks and consumers alike means Banks are going long cash and shorting debt (trying to reduce their leverage) and consumers are saving cash (going long on cash) and shorting spending. Deflation and Depression are actually a manifestation of a massive short squeeze on cash in an attempt to reduce a gross and unsustainable long position on debt. The Deflation and Depression will continue until the long position on debt is reduced. The long position on debt in the world is so massive, that it will only be reduced by equally massive defaults. Only until these defaults reduce the long position to a tolerable figure will the squeeze on cash terminate. At that point, banks and consumers will once again be willing to short cash and go long on debt: the banks will once again be willing to lend and consumers will be once again willing and able to take on debt and spend, or reduce their rate of saving and become buyers once more. Delaying the inevitable will only drag out the agony of Deflation and Depression for many years. Bringing all the massive liabilities of the banking system onto the Treasury's indebtedness  while the corresponding assets are worth far, far less than these liabilities  will solve nothing. Debt must be reduced by defaults and bankruptcies. There is no other solution! The driving force behind the rise in the price of gold at this time is not the fear of inflation but rather the fear of placing cash where there is a possibility of default. Only physical gold in possession is free of this risk. I may add that even national treasuries do default on their bond obligations (Nouriel Roubini just confirmed this) and can and do default partially by devaluing their currencies. The world is gradually realizing this and this is propelling investors into gold. Could it be there is Method in the government's Madness? Perhaps the unspoken idea is to save some critical institutions by bailouts at all costs and then  the Treasury defaults later on this year?\n\n-- Posted Monday, 23 February 2009 | Digg This Article | Source: GoldSeek.com\n\nPrevious Articles",
  "latent_6338": "Expand Blood on the floor of a house in al-Taliliya, where ISIS apparently executed at least 15 civilians. © 2014 Human Rights Watch/Wladimir van Wilgenburg\n\n(New York) – Fighters from the extremist Islamist group Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) appear to have executed at least 15 civilians in northern Syria on May 29, 2014. Local residents told Human Rights Watch at least six children were among those killed after ISIS raided the village of al-Taliliya, near Ras al-‘Ayn.\n\nResidents and local officials said the victims were Syrian Arabs who had been displaced from the countryside around the city of Aleppo.\n\n“While everyone is focused on ISIS’s advances in Iraq, they’re also committing atrocities in Syria, including gunning down civilians,” said Nadim Houry, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “ISIS flouts the law, executing civilians at will, while Russia and China paralyze UN Security Council action.”\n\nThree residents of al-Taliliya and others from the area told a Human Rights Watch consultant that ISIS fighters had fought in the area on May 28 against Kurdish fighters from the People’s Protection Units, known as the YPG. The next day, ISIS entered al-Taliliya and killed at least 15 civilians, the residents said. The Kurdish fighters were not in the village at the time, and there had been no fighting in the village, residents said.\n\nOfficials from the YPG and the Democratic Union Party (PYD), which controls the Ras al-‘Ayn area, also said that Kurdish and ISIS fighters had clashed in the area on May 28.\n\nDetails of the killings on May 29 were difficult to obtain because many al-Taliliya residents were afraid to talk. As of mid-June, ISIS fighters were in the village of al-Rawiya, which is visible from al-Taliliya, with a checkpoint operated by the Kurdish forces in between.\n\nAn elderly Syrian Arab woman living in al-Taliliya said she lost family members in the attack:\n\nWe are afraid if we talk they will come to our families and kill us. We do not have any connection with any side, not with ISIS or the Kurds. We just work on our land. We want to stay safe on our land. I don’t want to lose my two other sons.\n\nOne resident of a nearby village said she heard about the killing in the morning of May 29 from the YPG and went with them to al-Taliliya at about 10 a.m. The woman said she saw the bodies of at least five men and estimated that she saw the bodies of four women and six or seven children, one of them an infant. She described a gruesome scene:\n\nWhen I got there I saw one old woman screaming and shouting that ISIS had killed her entire family. Her family was killed in the house. I tried to calm her down. She took me inside and showed me her husband and two sons above 18 years old executed with gunshots to their heads or chest. The wife of her son was also executed, but I don’t remember where she was shot.\n\nShe also told Human Rights Watch that she saw a man who had been shot in the head and a family in another house who had been killed in their beds: a man, woman, and two young boys. “They were all executed,” she said.\n\nThe woman said she heard that there were other bodies in the area but that they could not be retrieved because they were close to ISIS positions.\n\nA member of the local Kurdish police who entered al-Taliliya that morning said he saw the body of a 7-year-old child who had been shot in the head.\n\nA Human Rights Watch consultant who visited al-Taliliya on June 4 inspected two houses that had blood on the floor and bullet holes on the inside walls. The village was empty of most inhabitants but was otherwise intact. Two large graves for the victims were in the nearby village of Mahteleh.\n\nA doctor at the hospital in Ras al-‘Ayn told Human Rights Watch that he saw 16 or 17 bodies brought from al-Taliliya at about noon on May 29. They included four men roughly in their fifties, five or six women, and five or six children, he said. Two injured adult women were also brought to the hospital, the doctor said. One later died from her injuries.\n\nAmnesty International reported the names of 15 civilians who had been killed, including seven children.\n\nResidents and local Kurdish officials gave two possible motives for the attack. One was that ISIS took revenge on the villagers because it suspected them of supporting the YPG. The other was that ISIS thought the village was inhabited by Yezidis, a small predominately Kurdish sect that many Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq perceive to be infidels. Yezidis used to live in al-Taliliya but left when ISIS came to the area about a year ago, the residents and local officials said.\n\nAt the time of the attack, al-Taliliya was instead inhabited by displaced Arabs from al-Safira, near Aleppo. “We suffered so much, no food, no nothing,” said the elderly woman whose relatives were killed in the attack. “I lived there, after running away from Safira.”\n\nIn recent months, based on media reports, ISIS has also abducted hundreds of Kurdish civilians in Aleppo governorate and executed several Kurdish civilians suspected of belonging to the YPG. One of the latest victims was Mohammad Mohammad, a 26-year-old English teacher from Jib al-Faraj, a village outside Aleppo. Mohammad was shot dead and beheaded on May 23, Kurdish media reported.\n\nISIS and other extremist Islamist militant groups have repeatedly targeted Yezidis in neighboring Iraq. In May, hundreds of Yezidis fled Rabia, an Iraqi town on the Syrian border, after suspected ISIS militants shot dead six local Yezidi men – two on May 2 and four on May 8. In both cases, the gunmen stopped the men’s cars, pulled them out, and shot them in the head in front of female relatives, a witness to each incident told Human Rights Watch.\n\n“We have lost our loved ones and we have lost our livelihoods,” said a female cousin of Khader Alyas Qassim, 22, one of the Yezidis killed on May 2, who had been displaced from Rabia. “We don’t know how we will make a living. But no way will we go back to Rabia, even if they paid us in gold.”\n\nThe UN Security Council should take steps to curb abuses and give a measure of justice to victims, Human Rights Watch said. The measures should include both an arms embargo on groups like ISIS that are credibly found to be carrying out widespread or systematic abuses, and referring the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.\n\n“How long will civilians be made to languish while the Security Council fails to protect civilians from extremist groups or indiscriminate barrel bombs?” Houry said. “The price of delay can be counted in Syrian lives.”",
  "latent_6352": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Angry rants about the demise of corporate culture aren't reserved only for ex-Goldman Sachs employees. Microsoft-turned-Google engineer James Whittaker -- now once again a Microsoft employee -- fired off a scathing blast Tuesday on a Microsoft blog about why he left Google.\n\n\"My last three months working for Google was a whirlwind of desperation,\" wrote Whittaker, who headed an engineering team for social network Google+. \"The Google I was passionate about was a technology company that empowered its employees to innovate. The Google I left was an advertising company with a single corporate-mandated focus.\"\n\nWhittaker, who joined Google in 2009 and left last month, described a corporate culture clearly divided into two eras: \"Before Google+,\" and \"After.\"\n\n\"After\" is pretty terrible, in his view.\n\nGoogle (GOOG, Fortune 500) once gave its engineers the time and resources to be creative. That experimental approach yielded several home-run hits like Chrome and Gmail. But Google fell behind in one key area: competing with Facebook.\n\nThat turned into corporate priority No. 1 when Larry Page took over as the company's CEO. \"Social\" became Google's battle cry, and anything that didn't support Google+ was viewed as a distraction.\n\n\"Suddenly, 20% meant half-assed,\" wrote Whittaker, referring to Google's famous policy of letting employees spend a fifth of their time on projects other than their core job. \"The trappings of entrepreneurship were dismantled.\"\n\nWhittaker is not the first ex-Googler to express that line of criticism. Several high-level employees have left after complaining that the \"start-up spirit\" of Google has been replaced by a more mature but staid culture focused on the bottom line.\n\nThe interesting thing about Whittaker's take is that it was posted not on his personal blog, but on an official blog of Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500), Google's arch nemesis.\n\nSpokesmen from Microsoft and Google declined to comment.\n\nThe battle between Microsoft and Google has heated up recently, as the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission begin to investigate Google for potential antitrust violations. Microsoft, with its Bing search engine, has doubled its share of the search market since its June 2010 founding, but has been unsuccessful at taking market share away from Google.\n\nMicrosoft is increasingly willing to call out Google for what it sees as illicit behavior. A year ago, the software company released a long list of gripes about Google's monopolistic actions, and last month it said Google was violating Internet Explorer users' privacy.\n\nDespite his misgivings about what Google cast aside to make Google+ a reality, Whittaker thinks that the social network was worth a shot. If it had worked -- if Google had dramatically changed the social Web for the better -- it would have been a heroic gamble.\n\nBut it didn't. It's too early to write Google+ off, but the site is developing a reputation as a ghost town. Google says 90 million people have signed up, but analysts and anecdotal evidence show that fairly few have turned into heavy users.\n\n\"Google was the rich kid who, after having discovered he wasn't invited to the party, built his own party in retaliation,\" Whittaker wrote. \"The fact that no one came to Google's party became the elephant in the room.\"",

  "latent_6552": "At Toy Fair 2016, there were more new blasters introduced than just about any year prior. Hasbro, in particular, had a field day with new Nerf blasters of all shapes and sizes that they were eager to show-off. But for all of the excitement and spectacle, it was the Buzz Bee booth that contained perhaps the biggest surprise of the show. Not only was it a shock that Buzz Bee was there at all this year (thank you, parent company Alex Brands), they demonstrated prototypes of several models I never saw coming. One of these new models was the Air Warriors Ultra-Tek Destiny, and it was good. Really good. In fact, even in prototype form, it was one of my favorite blasters of the entire show. Now they’ve sent me one of the first Destiny models off the production line to actually test out, so let’s get to it!\n\nI’ve never hidden the fact that the BOOMco Rapid Madness is one of my favorite dart launchers of all time. It’s a blaster that combines incredibly fast rates-of-fire (approximately 10 darts per second) with the satisfaction of a manual, pump-to-prime operation that has become increasingly rare in the toy blaster field. This air-powered model sounds great, and the “harmonica”-style clips make it reasonably easy to reload. But for everything I love about the Rapid Madness, it has always had one significant limitation: it could only fire BOOMco darts. The Ultra-Tek Destiny changes all that.\n\nFor better or worse (mostly better), the Ultra-Tek Destiny is essentially a Nerf-compatible version of the BOOMco Rapid Madness, but built to a price-point that leaves a few rough edges–both figurative and literal. For many, this is enough. The dream of a Nerf version of the Rapid Madness is really all that matters, and at a base level, the Destiny succeeds. In fact, although I don’t produce too many blaster reviews myself anymore (focusing instead on industry relations and news), trying out the Destiny at Toy Fair was enough to convince me that I had to review it. And I don’t regret that decision.\n\nDesign and Ergonomics\n\nThe Buzz Bee Air Warriors Ultra-Tek Destiny is a long name for what is an equally large product. This is a big blaster in both size and heft, a fact necessitated by the 20 dart clip and internal air bladder. But unlike some Nerf blasters that handle their size gracefully, the Destiny looks and feels every bit as large as it is. Unfortunately, the Destiny’s visual heft is punctuated by surface detailing that incorporates shapes and elements that one might see on a children’s party toy. I’ve given it the nickname “fiesta,” for lack of a better term, but it’s really not something that makes me want to smile. In fact, quite the opposite. And it appears I’m not alone.\n\nI reached out to my contacts at Buzz Bee concerning this new party pattern after realizing ALL of the Buzz Bee fall blaster samples I’d been sent show the same texture (and after blaster fans on Reddit expressed identical concerns regarding this new, more juvenile look). I was fortunate enough to have been given access to the Buzz Bee Vice President of Product Development, and he expressed the same concerns regarding the texture. Whether due to our immediate, negative feedback, or due to an internal misunderstanding, I’m now told this pattern will very shortly be replaced by a new, “carbon fiber” look that should bump-up the aesthetic appeal a bit. Look for it in stores soon.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic of design, it’s no secret that I’ve been critical of Buzz Bee’s aesthetic refinement (or lack thereof) for some time now, and it’s fair to say the Destiny shows no great improvement in that regard–the forms are still unrefined, the textures are poor (or lacking completely), there are stickers instead of paint, and the plastics feel down-market–including a fair amount of flexing and creaking while in use. Fortunately, Buzz Bee’s Vice President of Product Development has been hearing us in these regards, too, and said, “we take your comments very seriously.” To that end, I’ve been informed the company is working on improving their blaster colors and designs thanks to new resources that have been made available through Alex Brands relationship. I think I can speak collectively for the blaster community in saying: “we can’t wait!”\n\nUse and Performance\n\nThe Ultra-Tek Destiny is an air-powered blaster that requires roughly 18-20 pumps for maximum pressurization. Much more than that, and an internal pressure release valve goes to work–you’ll hear it kick-in at about 21-22 pumps. There’s no manual pressure release apart from the trigger, which becomes readily apparent when an entire 20-dart clip is fired, the blaster is set off to the side, and it decides to fire another shot or two completely autonomously. This happened repeatedly on my sample, and although mildly disconcerting, it didn’t really cause any operational problems. I was told by Buzz Bee that it was possible the factory “left a little too much pressure capacity,” since they were focused on ensuring that all the darts get fired from a full clip, and that it likewise shoots at a high rate-of-fire.\n\nAnd shoot at a high rate-of-fire, it does! In fact, the Destiny fires through a full, 20-dart clip so quickly, it’s hard to accurately time just how quickly shots are fired. But after several failed attempts (my inability to stop the stopwatch quickly enough), I was able to pin down the Destiny at launching all 20 darts in no more than 1.5 seconds–that’s just over 13 darts per second! And yes, I’m well aware that modded, full-auto blasters are capable of far more speed than this, but we’re talking completely stock, off-the-shelf performance in a world where most blasters only get 1-2 darts per second. Frankly, this is an astonishing figure that is in excess of what the Rapid Madness is capable of achieving, and is probably somewhat conservative given my slow-draw timing abilities. I would not, in fact, be surprised if 15 darts per second or more was possible.\n\nSpeaking of my lack of timing precision, the Destiny likewise lacks precision in how many darts it will fire with a single trigger press. On average, I was only capable of shooting in 2-4 dart bursts. I don’t believe I was ever able to shoot a single dart at a time, though I’m told by other reviewers it may be possible. On the plus side, the Destiny is fully capable of firing darts from other brands–I tested both Nerf Elites and X-Shot Excel darts, and did not have any issues with either. What’s odd, however, is that I DID occasionally have jamming problems with the stock, Buzz Bee darts. Buzz Bee is no longer using the denser, darker charcoal-colored darts for some reason, which is a shame. Their newer darts are lighter, with more flexible bodies. They tend to fly farther than the older Buzz Bee darts, but are just as wayward as Nerf darts now, and seem to be more easily jammed. For what it’s worth, I didn’t experience any jamming issues with competitor’s darts.\n\nSpeaking of dart variety, it turns out they have a direct effect on how the Destiny is able to perform. In particular, I’m talking about the velocity with which the Destiny is able to propel darts (which we typically measure in feet-per-second). I found this the most difficult aspect of the Destiny to test, but I feel it’s the most important and most useful. Why not range tests? Because “range” measurements tend to be affected by any number of variables. While I used to measure indoor ranges myself, I’ve seen so many other reviewers conducting range tests in a variety of conditions that I’ve come to conclude these figures are largely useless–wind changes, terrain inclination or declination, atmospheric pressure, humidity, angle of fire, etc. can all lead to unreliable conclusions. And even indoors, variability of manufacturing tolerances from one blaster to another alone–or even one batch of darts to another–can have more of an impact than just about anything else. And frankly, I don’t have the time, money, or patience to collect enough samples of each model and conduct a high enough number of tests to produce anything that could be considered statistically valid. So, I’ve stopped doing outright range tests for something I can measure more accurately and consistently–feet-per-second data gathered from a precision chronograph. So that’s what I did with the Destiny, and the results were… interesting:\n\nStock (Buzz Bee) darts: High of 65 FPS, Low of 33 FPS\n\nNerf Elite darts: High of 72 FPS, Low of 46 FPS\n\nX-Shot Excel darts: High of 76 FPS, Low of 67 FPS\n\nFrom this data (collected over repeated tests), I would conclude the following: 1) the Destiny is wildly inconsistent in dart propulsion–likely due to the changing pressure of the air tank in use, 2) the Destiny is capable of respectable FPS numbers (higher than the Rapid Madness), 3) the lowest performing darts are the ones that come in the box, 4) if you want the best, most consistent velocity, X-Shot Excel darts would appear to be your best bet. Now, I’ll note that I did not test every single dart currently on the market. I’m in the process of moving, so I only used the darts I had on-hand. Still, it’s interesting to note how sensitive the Destiny appears to be in what ammo is used–perhaps there’s a sealing issue at work, but whatever the case, it’s clear that you may see changes in performance based on what darts you chose. Fortunately, the Destiny appears to work with most of them.\n\nLastly, when it comes to actually using the Destiny, it’s a little more fiddly than the BOOMco Rapid Madness. In particular, that “harmonica”-style clip doesn’t work with the blaster in a very precise manner, resulting in loading that often allows the blaster to miss the first shot or two (in too far), or not fire anything at all (not in far enough). There aren’t any observable detents or other markers to indicate when the clip has been properly seated. Even a small mark on the clip itself to indicate when it’s in far enough (or too far) would be helpful.\n\nValue and Fun\n\nSometimes I wish our numerical review system allowed for independent weighting of certain categories. This is one of those times. The Buzz Bee Ultra-Tek Destiny is not a perfect, Nerf-compatible version of the BOOMco Rapid Madness. It’s rather ungainly, it’s built with plastics that are creaky and hard, it uses darts that aren’t terribly accurate and that sometimes jam, the harmonica clip is fiddly to seat properly, it can only fire in 2-4 dart bursts, and it can be prone to autonomous firing if air pressure is left unreleased. Wow, that’s a lot of annoyances. But… BUT! It’s so much fun to use it’s ridiculous. In fact, the Destiny is just so damn fun it deserves its own paragraph…\n\nSo let’s talk about how much fun the Buzz Bee Ultra-Tek Destiny is to use. For starters, hand-pumping is so old-school these days you can’t help but love it. Sure, it’s not super practical in the middle of a fire-fight, but whatever. Take your LiPo’d, re-motored Stryfe with duct-taped 18s if you want to be competitive, and grab a Destiny if you just want to have fun. The visceral thrill of hearing 20 (twenty!) darts being propelled at roughly 70 FPS in only a second-and-a-half simply does not get old. Nor does the feel of air-powered recoil. Nor does the ability to use just about any dart in just about any condition. Nor does seeing the look on the faces of everyone around you when the beast is unleashed. While it may not be terribly easy on the eyes, the Destiny is simply a riot to use!\n\nNo, the Destiny is not the flawless, Nerf clone of the Rapid Madness we had hoped. It struggles with a lot of design and refinement things that I wish it hadn’t. Yet, those things can still be overlooked pretty easily due to the fact that the Destiny will simply out-perform just about any other stock blaster on the market when it comes to rate-of-fire, including the fabled Rapid Madness. AND it will do it with any type of Nerf-compatible dart you can find at a price nearly anyone can afford, all while putting a smile on the face of anyone who uses it. That, by itself, is a dream come true.\n\nPros:\n\nIt’s a cheaper Rapid Madness that can shoot Nerf darts!\n\nA stock ROF that’s even faster than the Rapid Madness\n\nFully cross-compatible with other dart brands\n\nAir-powered and awesome-sounding!\n\nCapable of solid FPS numbers\n\nCons:\n\nIssue with pressurization may lead to autonomous firing\n\nInitial run has goofy “fiesta” detailing\n\nCan only fire in 2-4 shot bursts\n\nHard, creaky plastics abound\n\nSome dart jamming",

  "latent_6698": "One afternoon in second grade on the bus home, my best friend Carly asked me why my hair was so curly. I simply responded that it was because I was black. She gently placed her hand on my shoulder in an almost compassionate manner and whispered, “African-American.”\n\nI have heard the term \"African-American\" used interchangeably with \"black\" all my life but have never been comfortable with it. Whenever I had to fill in a box describing my race, ethnicity, or nationality, I would always check \"African-American,\" but couldn’t help but wonder why the other kids in my predominantly white school weren’t labeled by their ethnic roots. My peers would proudly claim to be \"half-German\" and \"a quarter Italian\" or \"16 percent Irish.\" They would brag about their family’s traditions: the foods they ate, the holidays they celebrated, the languages their grandparents would teach them. Yet none of them had to check a box that said \"German-American\" or \"Italian-American.\" They were just white Americans.\n\nI was baffled by white kids' ability to be in touch with their heritage without having to label it, whereas I felt forced to identify as \"African-American\" even though I couldn’t even tell you which of the 54 African countries my ancestors are from. This is likely true for most black Americans whose ancestors were slaves, as slaveowners historically made sure that their workers lost ties to their homelands. The thousands of African ethnic groups -- each with its own language and customs -- eventually merged to create a new culture. This history has left me without any emotional ties to Africa. I know nothing about the continent and feel 100 percent American, but am still forced to label myself in relation to this foreign land.\n\nFor years I not only felt disconnected from these roots but ashamed of them. As the only black kid in a room full of white students, I learned that black people once weren't considered human in this nation and were forced to be completely submissive to their white owners. I was ashamed to realize that my peers whose families had lived in the South -— particularly Alabama, where my dad's family is from — could be the descendants of slaveowners who owned my family. In middle school, I even wore hazel-colored contacts and rocked a long, wavy weave and tried to tell people that I was biracial, even though everyone in town knew my parents and could clearly see that they were both black.\n\nOne day I had a talk with my mom about these feelings. She told me that instead of feeling embarrassed about my family’s past, I should be proud. My ancestors may have been enslaved, but only the strongest survived those torturous years. Of the 10 million Africans that were brought through the Middle Passage, I was a descendant of the toughest, healthiest, and most capable captives.\n\nPerhaps my mom exaggerated historical details to cheer up her 10-year-old, but from that day forward, I learned to admire the traits that my strong forefathers passed down to me. Sure, my incredibly oily skin causes more bumps on my face than I would prefer, but this oil is the same that once made my late grandmother, my mother, my sister, and me all look as though we could have been born in the same generation. My skin doesn't sag or wrinkle, and I've never had a sunburn in my life. I'll always find watching girls put on layers of sunscreen in the summer, only to later complain about their peeling faces and their pale complexions in the winter, entertaining. It never gets old to stick my arm into the mix of girls comparing theirs to see whose tan lasted longest into the cold months and proclaim that I have a \"year-round tan.\"\n\nThe shame that I once felt about my race is now gone. Even though I have no record of who my ancestors were or where they came from, I respect them for fighting to survive long enough to pass on their traits to future generations, including me. I label myself as American first, but I am still black -- and damn proud of it.\n\nWant to be an MTV Founders contributor? Send your full name, age, and pitches to mtvfounders@gmail.com.",

(June 12, 2016) James Hoyt | USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nJordy Nelson celebrates during his charity softball game Sunday at Neuroscience Group Field at Fox Cities Stadium in Grand Chute (Photo: Ron Page/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)\n\nGRAND CHUTE - There was a point in the home run derby when Jordy Nelson sprinted off the mound and chased a pop fly near the first-base bag.\n\nHis hustle was greeted by a collective gasp from the crowd and a “No, Jordy, no” scolding from the public address announcer.\n\nConsidering that Nelson will attempt to recapture his role this fall as the Green Bay Packers’ go-to receiver after missing the entire 2015 season with a torn ACL in his right knee, the trepidation was understandable.\n\nNelson was just fine and seems to be on track toward returning to the field where he really belongs: the one at 1265 Lombardi Avenue.\n\nUntil then, venues such as Neuroscience Group Field at Fox Cities Stadium for light-hearted events such as Sunday’s annual Jordy Nelson Charity Softball Game will have to do.\n\n“I’ve been doing a lot more on it than playing softball, so I felt like we were in good shape,” said Nelson, when asked if he had any apprehension about playing in the annual charity game. “Obviously, I wasn’t going to doing anything crazy out there.”\n\nNelson knew entering the event that nervous Packer fans would be watching his every move and fearing the worst in his first public competition since injuring the knee last August in a preseason game at Pittsburgh’s Heinz Field\n\n“Well, we’ve had some open practices and they (Packer fans) have seen me run some routes, so I wasn’t too worried about that,” Nelson said.\n\nIt was clear by his smile and his humorous antics during the game — such as dousing fellow receiver Randall Cobb with a Gatorade shower — that Nelson was thrilled to be back interacting with his teammates.\n\n“Last year, the first couple days after the injury were bad,” Nelson said. “But after that, you accept it. You move forward and you know what your job is for that year.”\n\nNelson’s job Sunday was serving as official host of the annual charity event which benefits Young Life — a faith-based nonprofit organization that benefits middle school, high school and college students by pairing them with focused adults — and doing a little chucking.\n\nAaron Rodgers gets doused with water by Jordy Nelson during Nelson's charity softball game Sunday at Neuroscience Group Field at Fox Cities Stadium (Photo: Ron Page/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)\n\nHe became the winning pitcher in the Offense’s 30-28 win over the Defense when tight end Mitchell Henry slammed a three-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the seventh to send a huge crowd of 8,047 home buzzing.\n\n“Everyone likes a walk-off and were were able to get it done,” said Nelson. “I have to give some credit to the defense. They have a lot of guys who can hit the ball. It was fun and great to give back to the community that supports us and to give back to the kids and help them be successful and build a foundation for the future.”\n\nHenry, who spent time on the Packers’ practice squad in the second half of the season, was the day’s most biggest slugger, slamming five of the Offense’s 11 homers. He went 7-for-8 in the slow pitch game with 12 RBI.\n\n“I’ve been playing baseball my whole life,” said Henry, a Kentucky native who played college football at Western Kentucky. “I actually won the state’s home run derby when I was younger. I’ve been hitting 200 buckets of balls with my dad since I was little. It felt great to hit the game-winner in front of all these fans and with my teammates. It was really a fun atmosphere.”\n\nQuarterback Aaron Rodgers and tight end Richard Rodgers added two homers apiece for the offense, while Nelson and fellow receiver Randall Cobb also connected.\n\nAaron Rodgers played first base and seemed to have a ball, messing with many of the baserunners. He stole Babe Ruth’s move and pointed to the left-field fence before one of his at-bats, prior to hammering a homer to right center. Rodgers also feigned frustration over the countless hits that Nelson was surrendering, kicking dirt on his favorite receiver in a mound conference.\n\nTight end Richard Rodgers didn’t catch any Hail Mary passes, but supplied the longest home run of the day with a blast over the left-field wall. It was the only homer to clear one of the walls at Neuroscience Group Field. A much shorter, temporary fence was installed several feet in front of the walls.\n\n“Richard is getting kind of soft, he only hit one all the way out,” joked Nelson, who went a perfect 7-for-7 at the plate. “Last year, he got five out.”\n\nLong snapper Rick Lovato led the defense with four homers, while rookie outside linebacker Kyler Fackrell added three. Defensive backs Damarious Randall and Micah Hyde, punter Peter Mortell and linebackers Carl Bradford and Clay Matthews, the losing pitcher, had one apiece.\n\nFor Mortell, a Green Bay native who will compete with Tim Masthay for the punting job, the day was special. He attended the charity game as a child and a picture of him posing with LeRoy Butler 16 years ago at the event was shown on the video scoreboard.\n\n“It’s crazy, because when I came here 16 years ago, I wished I’d have a chance to play in this one day,” said Mortell. “I’ll tell you what, I haven’t swung a baseball bat in a very long time. To be able to just make contact today was good, but I think I was just a triple short of hitting for the cycle.”\n\nRandall, who played baseball in community college prior to launching his college football career at Arizona State, won the home run derby with five. Lovato, the other finalist, had two.\n\nTim Froberg: 920-993-1000, ext. 423, tfroberg@postcrescent.com, on Twitter @twfroberg",

As if it isn’t enough that active travel organisations are calling for bold decisions on cycling, now we have the backing of major British brands – with more due to come on board with us in the coming weeks.”\n\nHe added: “This isn’t an issue that is going to go away. Party leaders must demonstrate that they are taking cycling seriously as a legitimate tool to transform Britain’s towns and cities for the better.”\n\nIn recent months, a number of major employers from the public and private sectors in London united under the Cycling Works banner to successfully lobby for Transport for London’s board to vote through schemes including the two segregated Cycle Superhighways that will cross the heart of the capital.\n\nSome of those organisations, including law firm Allen & Overy and the Shakespeare’s Globe theatre have already pledged themselves to Choose Cycling, as have property companies Land Securities and Broadgate Estates – the latter two in stark contrast to perhaps the highest profile opponent of the Cycle Superhighways, Canary Wharf Group.\n\nThe fact that 160 employers signed up to Cycling Works suggests that at national level, Choose Cycling could gain some real momentum if it scales up in similar fashion at national level.",

  "latent_6973": "When Courtney Gregoire read about the chaos unfolding in New York’s John F. Kennedy airport Saturday morning, she began to wonder how President Donald Trump’s ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries would play out in Seattle. Gregoire, an attorney and the daughter of former Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire, is a commissioner of the Port of Seattle, which oversees the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. So she picked up the phone to ask.\n\nIt was the beginning of an astonishing and chaotic day that would see elected officials, civil rights attorneys and thousands of protesters descend upon Sea-Tac in an effort to win the release of passengers caught up in a high-stakes test of Trump's executive powers.\n\nGregoire learned very little from her phone call. “It was pretty clear to me that communication was not going to be easy,” she said Monday.\n\nHer contact at U.S. Customs and Border Protection wouldn’t tell her anything. “CBP is responsible for who gains access to our country and they do not share that information,” she said of the federal agency.\n\nSo while Gregoire knew that flights had come in from Frankfurt and Dubai, major hubs of travel that could very well contain passengers from Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen or Iran, she had no idea how many people had arrived that morning, or if they were being allowed to enter the country. Until they cleared customs, these travelers were not technically in the United States, and therefore not under the port’s jurisdiction.\n\nSo Gregoire jumped in her car and headed to the airport, figuring that she might pry some information out of the agency if she could meet someone in person. Along the way, she called former U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan and asked her to meet at the airport. If she was racing toward direct negotiation with a federal agency, she thought, it would be helpful to have someone who knew the territory.\n\n---\n\nKathleen Taylor, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, was in a board meeting around noon when her phone rang. She glanced at it, saw that the call was from Durkan, and let it go to voicemail. She didn’t want to interrupt the meeting.\n\nWhen the meeting was over, she called Durkan, and heard, with some urgency, that people may be detained in Sea-Tac. Durkan had already made contact with the nonprofit Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP), and one of its lawyers was at the airport, although, according to Gregoire, he didn’t know where to meet Gregoire or what he would actually be doing.\n\nHearing the news, the entire ACLU chapter, already assembled for the board meeting, bolted to action, some driving to the airport, others working from the offices, and all of them joining in a desperate hunt to figure out who was being held and how to stop the feds from deporting them.\n\nFrom there, word traveled quickly through the halls of power. By early afternoon, U.S. Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Suzan Delbene, Gov. Jay Inslee and his lieutenant, Cyrus Habib, King County Executive Dow Constantine, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and Port of Seattle Commissioner Tom Albro were all scrambling their schedules to meet at the airport.\n\n---\n\nGregoire was the first to arrive and she immediately demanded a briefing with CBP. The briefing, held at 1 p.m., was as fruitless as her phone calls. Gregoire doesn't blame the local CBP officers, but rather the nature of the executive order, which was handed down with little warning to the agency. “They were in an exceedingly difficult spot,” she says of the agency staffers.\n\nBut as she was meeting with the officers, Gregoire got her first tip: Her husband, Scott Lindsay, a public safety advisor to Mayor Ed Murray, was prowling the baggage claim area, searching for people who might be waiting for passengers who had been detained. It was there that he met a Somali woman and her family, looking confused and worried.\n\nThey’d been expecting the arrival of a family member at 10:30 that morning. The flight had clearly landed, but there was no sign of the person they were waiting for.\n\nThe family was totally in the dark. CBP had done nothing to seek them out or inform them that their family member had already been returned to Vienna. Had Lindsay not found them, they would not have known until many hours later, when they got a phone call from Europe.\n\nAfter receiving a text from Lindsay, Gregoire pulled the family into a private conference room to have CBP explain what had happened. “Now that I understand that people are being turned away,” said Gregoire of her thoughts at the time, “it was a difficult message.”\n\nSuspicions were becoming reality. Elected officials began to plan a press conference for later in the afternoon. Meanwhile, ACLU and NWIRP lawyers were drafting habeas corpus complaints to be sent off to federal court, requesting a temporary restraining order.\n\nBut the lawyers still didn’t know who they were representing: They had little more information than they'd had at the beginning of the day. That Gregoire had tracked down even one family was by chance.\n\nAt around 2:30, rumors began spreading that 13 people were detained, but no one seemed to know where that number came from. In the hours following, that number was revised to 10, then five, then six.\n\n---\n\nAt 3:30 p.m., local officials gave a stirring press conference that was broadcast widely across local TV networks and social media platforms. Gov. Inslee called the order \"religious discrimination in its barest and most obvious form.\"\n\nEven as the press conference was occurring, people were frantically working to gather information. Partway through, Gregoire learned that there were two detainees and that they had already been booked on a 5 p.m. flight back to Dubai. Gregoire snuck off to the side to find Durkan, understanding that there was now a ticking clock.\n\n“What we really need is an order [from a judge] denying removal,” she recalls telling Durkan. “There’s chaos and no clear lines of communication.”\n\nGregoire and Durkan asked NWIRP and the ACLU if they could expedite their complaint by filing it under John Doe. They did just that, then tracked down U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Zilly and sent off the complaint, signed by many of the elected officials at the airport.\n\nTime was running out. The two detainees had already been put back onto the plane. So Gregoire and NWIRP Executive Director Jorge Baron went to Emirates Airline, demanding that the plane be held while they wait for the judge to weigh in. The airline agreed, at least momentarily.\n\n---\n\nAt the same time, Reps. Jayapal and Delbene and staffers from Gov. Inslee's office were doing their own sleuthing. According to a firsthand account, they demanded a briefing of their own from CBP. When they were told that no one was able come to them, Jayapal strongly suggested going to them.\n\nSecurity staffers initially denied them access, but Jayapal kept pressing until Sea-Tac staff agreed to escort her, along with Delbene and a slew of staffers, to CBP office.\n\nThey cut through baggage processing, took an elevator down to the tarmac and buzzed across the vast expanse of concrete to the CBP offices in a van. Security officials warned them not to be distracted with their phones; runways are busy places.\n\nWhen Jayapal and Delbene arrived at the CBP offices, no one would come to speak with them. The two members of Congress literally banged on the door until, after about 20 minutes, CBP Seattle Port Director Mark Wilkerson finally came out to talk. They patched in Gov. Inslee and Sen. Murray on a conference call. Inslee in particular was apparently audibly frustrated, as he had been all day.\n\nAs that meeting was taking place, Baron and Gregoire got the order from Judge Zilly to stay the deportation of the two detainees, the second such order in the country. The boarding ramp to the Emirates flight was literally pulling away from the plane when Baron confronted airport and CBP staff with the order on his phone.\n\nThe airline offloaded the two confused passengers, one from Sudan, the other from Yemen.\n\n---\n\nWhile this was playing out, the public was starting to get pictures of what was unfolding at Sea-Tac, care of activists and a handful of journalists who were broadcasting the scene live on Facebook.\n\nLocal activist Doug Woos had known that a protest against Trump’s immigration ban was planned for Seattle's Westlake Park on Sunday night, but he'd been restless. So, according to Woos, at around 3 p.m., his friend Joseph Redmon created a Facebook event calling for a protest that night.\n\n\"There were immediately between 10 and 100 people [who had expressed interest in the event], and within an hour it was hundreds,\" Woos says. By the time Woos boarded the light rail in the University District, the roster of attendees was up to 1,000, he says. There were hundreds of protesters on his train, many of them traveling to the airport.\n\nBy the time the two detainees were pulled from their flights, they could see the coverage of the protests outside, which were growing louder and larger, according to a statement sent out by ACLU.\n\nBut no one was sure what would happen next. According to Taylor with the ACLU, the plan was to send them to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. But Taylor says Baron fought with CBP to prevent that from happening until, eventually, the feds agreed to lay down cots in the airport.\n\n---\n\nAs the night wore on, chaos unfolded outside. Sound Transit briefly halted service to the airport, to great outcry, and more than 30 people were arrested. Gregoire says the conduct of the Port of Seattle police will be reviewed.\n\nBehind shut doors, the scene for the two detainees was quiet, but anxious, says Gregoire: They had no idea what was in store for them.\n\nAt 6:30 a.m., the detainees were released, one allowed to reunite with family he was visiting here, the other to travel on to his final destination for a conference on engineering, according to the ACLU.\n\nOn the heels of the weekend, officials in the region began doubling down on their opposition to Trump and his executive order. On Monday, Seattle City Councilmember Lorena Gonzalez introduced a resolution declaring Seattle a \"welcoming city\" to immigrants and refugees.\n\nWashington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the executive order.\n\nGregoire, for her part, still doesn’t know how many travelers were returned to their place of origin. Several news outlets have said there were four, but Gregoire still hasn't been able to confirm that. The whole weekend was a bit of a mess.\n\n\"There’s no question,\" Gregoire says. \"It was fast and furious.\"",

De La Rue says that he is expected to make a full recovery, and has asked that people keep him in their thoughts and prayers. We at ComicsAlliance extend our best wishes for a full and speedy return to health.\n\nBreyfogle, 54, is best known for his work on various Batman comics from 1987 to 1993, often alongside writer Alan Grant -- his work established and defined the Batman aesthetic of that era and revived interest in the Batman comics, and for many readers his arch and pulpy Batman remains the standard that other versions of the character are compared to. His other works include Prime , The Spectre , and Life With Archie for Archie Comics; he also works as a commercial illustrator and a children's book illustrator.\n\nBreyfogle's creations for DC include Victor Zsasz and Anarky, both with Alan Grant, and the Ventriloquist, with Grant and John Wagner. He also illustrated many of Tim Drake's early solo adventures as Robin. In 2011 he and Grant were selected to drawn illustrate DC's DC Retroactive: Batman book for the 1990s -- a tacit acknowledgement of their enormous influence on the era. Breyfogle's recent work includes the Batman Beyond comic and Trinity Of Sin: The Phantom Stranger , and only this week he was announced as the artist on a 2000 AD Free Comic Book Day comic.\n\nIt's unknown at this point whether Breyfogle's health issues will place him in any financial distress.

  "latent_7161": "Being a lifelong Sony fan, I have the highest hopes for the PlayStation conference next week at E3.\n\nThat Uncharted gameplay should be jaw-dropping and I'm holding out hope for a new God of War announcement along with the triumphant resurrection of The Last Guardian. However, I can't ignore the headlines in recent months and given the current circumstances, it seems like Microsoft has all the momentum going into this year's show.\n\nNintendo could be the dark horse in this scenario, as their conference could explode if there was some sort of hardware-related announcement. And again, Sony usually comes strong with the games during their presentation, so you never know.\n\nBut consider:\n\nThe date of the Xbox One's price drop to $399 (sans Kinect) is no coincidence\n\nJune 9. That's when consumers in North America will be able to purchase the Xbox One for only $399. They won't get Kinect, but there are a lot of gamers out there who couldn't possibly care less about Kinect, and are much more interested in saving a hundred bucks. June 9, not coincidentally, is the day of Microsoft's E3 press conference. It's the same day as Sony's presentation, too.\n\nI absolutely guarantee this isn't irony. This is so Microsoft can stand on that stage, crow about how they \"listened to their fans\" (this company has never once listened to its fans, nor have they ever exhibited even the slightest ounce of interest in catering to the consumer, but whatever), and show off that $399 price tag. The mere fact that the Xbox One will be the same price as the PS4 at the time of the conference is a huge shot in the arm.\n\nMany analysts are predicting that Microsoft will reclaim control of North America with the $399 Xbox One, and they're probably not wrong.\n\nSony may have some exclusive surprises, but Microsoft's exclusives aren't lacking\n\nHistorically, PlayStation absolutely dominates in the exclusive category. There's no doubt whatsoever in my mind; at no time has the Xbox or Xbox 360 even approached the PS2 or PS3 in terms of top-tier, cutting-edge exclusive software. However, that's not necessarily the case thus far in the generation. Titanfall is arguably the top game of 2014 thus far (inFamous: Second Son wasn't received as well by critics, and didn't sell as well, either), and I'm loving the look of Insomniac's Sunset Overdrive.\n\nThere are several more exclusives on tap for the Xbox One this year, and there's no doubt we'll learn more about them next week during the conference. Over time, I'm sure PlayStation will once again outpace the Xbox brand in the exclusive category but right now, heading into next week's trade show, I'm not so sure that Sony has the obvious first-party edge.\n\nThis could all change on Monday, of course, especially if Sony has more than a few tricks up their sleeves.\n\nIt's Xbox on the comeback trail\n\nEver since the announcement of the price drop and the arrival of Titanfall, the Xbox One has been gaining a better foothold everywhere, especially the US. I predicted early on that no matter how well the PS4 started, the Xbox One would eventually own this territory because our consumers are a bunch of mainstream lemmings. Oh, calm down, I mean no harm. Microsoft does a better job advertising its game branch in the US, it's a domestic company for American citizens, and we're coming off a generation where the Xbox 360 dominated North America from start to finish.\n\nIf the PS4 and Xbox One had launched with the same price tags, there's no doubt in my mind that Microsoft's machine would be #1 in North America right now. I still think the PS4 would be tops in Europe and Japan but again, that's nothing new, as the PS3 led in those territories, too. The bottom line is that with all this positive news surrounding the Xbox One, it's impossible to say it's not staging a comeback. It is.\n\nTherefore, as we embark on another E3 extravaganza, I think it's painfully obvious which manufacturer has the momentum.",

  "latent_7310": "by Lark Turner\n\nThis article was originally published on UrbanTurf in 2013, but we re-publish from time to time to remind readers of the homebuyer programs available in DC.\n\nWhether you’re buying a home for the first time or looking to move, several programs in the DC area are available to assist buyers. Homebuyer assistance programs can be a bit complex, though, so this edition of First-Timer Primer aims to provide some clarity. This article looks at programs in DC proper, but we hope to do similar pieces on programs in Maryland and Virginia as well.\n\nDC Open Doors: If you qualify for this program (and many do), it could be a simple way to get part of a deposit loan forgiven if you plan to be in the city awhile. DC Open Doors is designed to provide down payment assistance to homeowners who may exceed the income levels of other assistance programs (individuals earning up to $123,395 a year are eligible). To qualify, applicants likely need to have a credit score of 640 or higher and a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 45 percent. The program will offer a loan of either 3.5 or 3 percent of the home price to be used as a down payment (for either an FHA -backed loan or a standard loan through Fannie Mae). For every year you stay in the home, 20 percent of that loan is forgiven.\n\nIndividual Development Account ( IDA ) program: An IDA is designed to help those with a lower-income buy a home. The program sets participants up with a savings account, held in escrow, that’s matched to help build up the investment and encourage saving. At Capital Area Asset Builders in DC, participants in the IDA program receive dollar-for-dollar matches while attending classes and receiving training on finances and budgeting — before they make the big purchase.\n\nHome Purchase Assistance Program ( HPAP ): HPAP gives first-time buyers interest-free loans and help with closing costs to those who qualify.

  "latent_7559": "Update (August 21, 1:45 P.M.): FX has released the title sequence for American Horror Story: Cult. Some notes: more bugs! More trypophobia-inducing images of bugs and hives and hole-ridden skin! Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton masks! (Ugh.) Clowns crawling out of a coffin! (Twisty?) Circus-like music and carnival rides that likely allude to the reported ties between Cult and Season 4, Freak Show. Lots of bloody hands and a butcher’s cleaver and an American flag. This is going to be a wild ride. The original post continues below.\n\nWe’re less than a month away from the premiere of Ryan Murphy’s American Horror Story: Cult, and as usual, the season remains shrouded in mystery. Will there really be clowns, or are they a metaphor for . . . something? What’s up with all the bees? Who will Frances Conroy be playing this time? Questions abound, but thankfully, as the weeks wind down, answers are coming. Here’s a handy guide to what we know so far. (We’ll keep this updated as the clown-themed dispatches come along.)\n\nThe Basics\n\nThis season will span 11 episodes, and will premiere on September 5. It will be set in Michigan, and use last year’s election as a jumping-off point. During a Television Critics Association panel, which Vanity Fair’s Joanna Robinson attended on Wednesday, the cast alluded to a heightened sense of paranoia this season. The panel confirmed that there will be a haunted house—a theme Murphy seems to like returning to. The cast also alluded to an “addictive” campiness this season.\n\nMurphy told The Hollywood Reporter that this season will be all about “highlighting people who don’t have a voice in our culture—people who are ignored by the current administration and who are afraid and feel terrorized that their lives are going to be taken away.”\n\nThe Cast\n\nSo far, we know that Sarah Paulson will return to play a character named Ally Mayfair-Richards, who is married to newcomer Alison Pill’s Ivy Mayfair-Richards. At the T.C.A. panel Wednesday, the two revealed more about their characters, including that they are married and living together. The panel did not reveal how A.H.S. vet Evan Peters will factor into the story; in July, Murphy posted a sketch of the actor’s character, Kai, next to Ally—with the caption “Ally and Kai in CULT...a love story for the ages.” All Paulson offered on the subject was, “I think it’s going to reveal itself in surprising ways.”\n\nOther returning cast members include: Adina Porter, who made her Horror Story debut in Season 1 before returning for Season 6 and will play a broadcast journalist named Beverly Hope this time around; Cheyenne Jackson, who will play “Dr. Rudy Vincent”; and Frances Conroy, Mare Winningham, Chaz Bono, and Emma Roberts, whose roles have yet to be specified. It also seems likely that John Carroll Lynch, who played Twisty the Clown in Season 4 and John Wayne Gacy in Season 5, will reprise his Season 4 role, but he has yet to be officially confirmed.\n\nAs for the newcomers, there’s Billie Lourd, who plays Winter Anderson; Leslie Grossman, who plays Meadow Wilton; Billy Eichner as Harrison Wilton; Colton Haynes as Detective Samuels; and Lena Dunham, whose role remains unknown. At the T.C.A. panel, Lourd revealed that her character will be more emotional and “human” than her Scream Queens character. And then, there’s one more possibility: Cher. The musician and mother of Chaz Bono fired off a tweet in August that got fans abuzz:\n\nThe Theme\n\nObviously, we know this season will have something to do with cults. The panel confirmed that the season will use last year’s election as a catalyst, although executive producer Alexis Martin Woodall added, “When Ryan had to make the announcement originally that the season would deal with Trump. It’s not what you think it is. It’s a jumping off point. It’s an element on our launch point.” When pressed for further hints, she offered: “Bloody tension. A well-cooked meal. An exciting trip to a grocery store.”\n\nThose words might hint at another theme at play: cannibalism. We’ve seen people eating people before on this show—like last season’s family of hillbilly cannibals, one of whom was played by Chaz Bono. This season, Ally and Ivy own a restaurant called The Butchery on Main, and if this shot of Ivy is any indication, they might not just be serving burgers.\n\nIt seems the shooting process was a little different this year: “We had a bunch of scripts in advance,” Pill said at the panel, “but my understanding is that most seasons aren’t like that. They’re more fly by the seat of their pants.” Paulson confirmed that notion, adding, “Typically we start with one maybe two scripts. We got lucky this year.” The actors seemed cagey as to why this year merited a different process.\n\nPromotional materials have been heavy on clown imagery, bees, and children’s music. It’s perhaps unwise to take any of this literally; A.H.S. promotional materials tend to give very little away about plot details. Still, the season’s Web site offers some clues, separated by week. Perhaps the most noteworthy theme across the Web site and all of its promotional materials is the frequent reference to fear. Aside from that, Week 2 revealed costume concepts that look awfully clown-like, hinting that perhaps literal clowns will make another appearance this season. (That makes sense, considering Murphy’s hint that Twisty will be back, in one form or another.) Week 3 revealed cast photos, which—once again—are littered with clown imagery. Week 4 revealed snippets of script.\n\nHere's the first one:\n\nINSERT -- PLATE A crumpet full of HOLES sits on top of a bed of endive. Blood seeping through the holes in the pastry. In the endive, little sausage-shaped “things” are REVEALED to be severed fingers - pinkies to be exact. [Redacted] recoils from the image. . . [Redacted] hyperventilates as she lurches back. Her hand grabbing the dome and covering the offending plate. She reaches for her glass of wine, but misses, KNOCKING it off the table.\n\nAnd here's the second:\n\nBUS FLOOR: A bloody tongue drops INTO FRAME, a silver rod pierced through the pink muscle. The image changes into [redacted]. CAMERA PANS [redacted] showing the demented face of [redacted] holding [redacted]’s phone.\n\nAnd then, there was one more page of script that required the code “FEARISTHEENEMY” to unlock:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nIt was like fifty, sixty years ago. Right here. On this spot. A deranged [redacted] attacked a couple on a picnic, just like you and me. He hacked the dude to death. They say you can tell it’s him by [redacted]. Because half [redacted] shotgun [redacted]. [REDACTED] You’re an asshole [REDACTED] To this day, he’ll appear if you say his name three times in a row. [Redacted]. . .\n\nThe snippet of dialogue almost certainly refers to Twisty, whose first appearance in American Horror Story involves just what is described: attacking a picnicking couple. (He did, indeed, repeatedly stab the male picnicker.) As for the shotgun, that probably refers to his origin story—when he shot the bottom half of his face off in a botched attempt at suicide. As for saying his name three times in a row? Well, let’s just say that based on a hunch, we wouldn’t recommend it.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nGet Vanity Fair’s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood.

Human rights groups accuse Poland of a cover-up.\n\nThe court told Reuters last month that Warsaw had requested that the hearing into allegations from two men who say they were illegally detained by the CIA in Poland should take place behind closed doors.\n\nThis has now been rejected. “I can confirm that the hearing on 3 December will be a public hearing,” a spokeswoman for the court said on Thursday.\n\nThe court will hold an additional hearing, behind closed doors, a day earlier, the spokeswoman said, adding that the proceedings of that hearing “are confidential, and no public statement will be made about their nature or content.”\n\nThe Polish foreign ministry, which oversees relations with the court in Strasbourg, said in a statement sent to Reuters it noted the decisions of the court, including the decision to hold an additional hearing in private.\n\nFOREST FACILITY\n\nThe United States acknowledges that, after the September 11, 2001 attacks on U.S. cities, it held al Qaeda suspects outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. legal system.

  "latent_7930": "[np_storybar title=”Read the full text of Justice Zuker’s decision in the Mustafa Ururyar sexual assault case” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/toronto/mustafa-ururyar-verdict-full-text-read-justice-zukers-decision-in-the-mandi-gray-sex-assault-case”%5D\n\n[/np_storybar]\n\nA 28-year-old PhD candidate who was sexually assaulted by a fellow doctoral student in Toronto says she is glad to finally have some closure after her rapist was found guilty of sexual assault on Thursday.\n\nBut the war isn’t over: Mustafa Ururyar is still out on bail; his sentencing hearing isn’t until Oct. 24; his defence team is going to push for house arrest (the maximum sentence is 18 months in jail); and Mandi Gray still doesn’t know if York University will allow her rapist to return to campus.\n\n“I feel excited that this judgment came out, but in a lot of ways it hasn’t changed anything at this juncture in my life,” said Gray, who waived her right to a publication ban on her name. She decided not to attend the judgment hearing, but came to Old City Hall Court after the verdict was delivered.\n\n“Gray was very credible and trustworthy. I accept her evidence,” Ontario Court Justice Marvin Zuker told a courtroom. “Rape it surely was.”\n\nMustafa Ururyar was charged with sexual assault for raping Gray, 28, and forcing her to perform oral sex in his apartment in the early hours of Jan. 31, 2015. Ururyar pleaded not guilty in the judge-only trial and testified that the sex was consensual. The Crown chose to proceed by summary conviction, which means the penalty Ururyar will face is much lower than the maximum 10 years for an indictable offence. But as a result, the case took less time to get to trial.\n\nZuker said in his ruling that he did not believe Ururyar’s testimony, describing it as a “feeble attempt in hindsight” to clear his name.\n\n“I stress his version is without reality. It never, never happened,” Zuker said. “It was a joke. A fabrication. I must and do reject his evidence.”\n\nThe courtroom burst into applause after he delivered the final lines of his judgment: “The Crown has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore find Mr. Ururyar guilty of the charge before the Court.”\n\nGray said in a statement posted to Facebook that while both the judge and Crown did a good job in handling her case, this “should not be out of the ordinary.”\n\n“It’s really sad that the legal system is quite literally doing what it’s supposed to and we’re all shocked. I think that says a lot.” Gray said outside court. “I am tired of people talking to me like I won some sort of rape lottery.”\n\nIn her statement, she listed a number of examples of how she believes the police and legal system let her down over the course of 18 months and expressed concern about the tactics used by Ururyar’s defence lawyer in an attempt to discredit her.\n\nFor much of our history the ‘good’ rape victim, the ‘credible’ rape victim has been a dead one\n\n[np_storybar title=”Christi Blatchford: Judge’s florid ruling seems to be his attempt to blow up every so-called ‘rape myth’” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/christie-blatchford-judges-florid-ruling-seems-an-attempt-to-blow-up-so-called-rape-myths”%5D\n\nRare, as a wise friend noted, is the cultural pendulum that swings so hard and sharp it hits people smack in their foreheads and all but knocks them out cold.\n\nBut that’s precisely what happened in a criminal courtroom at Old City Hall in Toronto Thursday where Ontario Court Judge Marvin Zuker found former York University graduate student Mustafa Ururyar guilty of sexually assaulting another, Mandi Gray, in the wee hours of Jan. 31, 2015.\n\nTo scattered titters of pleased surprise at first and finally to applause, the judge also seemed to be trying to blow every so-called “rape myth” to smithereens and set right what he clearly sees as society’s failure, and perhaps the justice system’s, to deal better with the issue.\n\nIn the result, his judgment sometimes sounded as if borrowed from a college course on feminist thinking.\n\nRead more …\n\n[/np_storybar]\n\n“Justice within a sexual assault case regardless of the verdict will always remain an illusion,” she said. “These statements don’t un-rape me.”\n\nIn her closing arguments, Crown prosecutor Jennifer Lofft accused the defence of “hauling out rape myths” and dismissed Ururyar’s narrative of a “spurned lover,” saying “it just makes no sense.”\n\nThe judge agreed, and he said the defence did a “job — and a real mad one — trying to shake me.”\n\n“No other crime is looked upon with the (same) degree of blameworthiness, suspicions and guilt,” Zuker said, adding that it doesn’t matter if a victim was drinking, had previously had sex with the accused, did not fight back, how they were dressed or whether they were out alone at night. “No one asks to be raped.”\n\nHe said Ururyar tried to take advantage of the fact that it is hard for a victim of trauma to remember every detail about an assault, and the defence tried to paint Gray as a person who did not behave like a “good rape victim.”\n\n“For much of our history the ‘good’ rape victim, the ‘credible’ rape victim has been a dead one,” he said. “When someone takes control of you and pushes their penis in your mouth what can you do?”\n\nThe Ururyar trial began on Feb. 1 — the same day as Jian Ghomeshi’s trial on four counts of sexual assault involving three different women. The ex-CBC star was acquitted of all charges on March 24. (He signed a peace bond to resolve a separate allegation of sexual assault on May 11). But it has taken 17 more weeks to conclude the Ururyar trial.\n\nLinda Redgrave, the first complainant at Ghomeshi’s trial, attended the ruling to support Gray. On March 23, the day before Ghomeshi was acquitted, Redgrave launched the website comingforward.ca, which is aimed at helping sexual assault survivors better prepare for court. On April 18, she waived the publication ban on her name.\n\nShe said she was sad about what Gray went through, but glad that the Ururyar case was heard by a judge who didn’t buy into “rape myths.”\n\nThe ruling has not restored her faith in the entire justice system, but “it’s restored my faith in fighting,” she said.\n\nAfter about two weeks of casual dating (Ururyar was in an open relationship with another woman at the time of the sexual assault), Gray invited him to join her and a few of their mutual friends at a Toronto bar on Jan. 30. At the end of the night, Ururyar and Gray went back to his apartment.\n\nTo listen to Mr. Ururyar paint Ms. Gray as the seductive party animal is nothing short of incomprehensible\n\nAccording to defence lawyer Lisa Bristow, Gray took off her clothes in Ururyar’s bedroom and he joined her under the covers. He testified that he chose that moment to tell Gray that they shouldn’t be together anymore. He leaned back when she tried to kiss him, and she burst into tears, he said. Ururyar said he consoled her and they simultaneously leaned in for a kiss. The defence said that Gray initiated the sex and that it was consensual. Ururyar also testified that Gray had groped him twice while they were out at the bar and that she was the sexual aggressor.\n\n“To listen to Mr. Ururyar paint Ms. Gray as the seductive party animal is nothing short of incomprehensible,” Zuker said.\n\nGray never consented to sex on Jan. 31, he said. Gray testified that she Ururyar had an argument on the way to his home because he was disappointed that Gray had failed to convince her friend to join them for a threesome.\n\nGray went home with Ururyar even though he had berated her, but that is not the same as consenting, the Crown said. When they arrived at his place, he “expressed the ultimate contempt,” for Gray and forced her to perform oral sex and have sexual intercourse.\n\n“She was vulnerable. She was scared. He pounced. Forget the condom. I am in power. I am in command. (Ururyar) said to (Gray) and I agree, ‘this is the last time I’m going to f— you, this is the last time… and you’re going to like it.’ Power, power, power. He was the boss and he loved it,” Zuker said.\n\nthe types of questions you are asked to answer in a rape trial. twitter.com/gotmysassypant… —\n\nMandi Gray (@gotmysassypants) July 18, 2016\n\nthis is what justice in canada looks like in a rape trial. twitter.com/gotmysassypant… —\n\nMandi Gray (@gotmysassypants) July 18, 2016\n\nyou read that right.

She has tweeted portions of the transcript from her cross-examination at trial, including a section where the defence asked her if she had heard the term “dead fish,” used to describe a woman who lies still during sex.\n\nThe defence tried to use her activism against her, suggesting she made false allegations against Ururyar in order to gain fame. The Crown dismissed this suggestion, pointing out that Gray had no interest in activism before she went to the police. Gray only got involved in advocacy work as a way to deal with her “trauma,” the Crown said.\n\nGray filed an Ontario Human Rights complaint against York University in June 2015 over alleged gender discrimination. She told The Canadian Press that the school lacked clear procedures for reporting assaults and, as a result, she was forced to repeat her story to a dozen staff members. Her case is currently in mediation.\n\nUruryar will appear in court on Monday for a bail revocation hearing. At that point the judge will decide if Ururyar will be allowed to remain a free man until his sentencing hearing on Oct. 24.",
  "latent_8167": "But it was on a well-traveled road in Grand Forks that Marvin’s life was drastically altered on Nov. 17, 2014. She had just left campus when her 1984 Dodge Ram pickup truck, plagued by a faulty fuel gauge, sputtered and stalled along Gateway Drive, a four-lane road lined with small businesses. Marvin steered the car to the right side of the road, about 100 feet from a gas station. Marvin bought a gas can, filled it, and returned to her truck. The gas cap was on the driver’s side, facing traffic, which made Marvin nervous.\n\n“I remember looking down the street,” she said. “There was a red light, and I went, ‘O.K., I can fill it quick, quick, quick.’ I remember it was super cold, and my hands were freezing. There was a little snow coming down.”\n\nMarvin said she never heard the two cars racing each other toward her. According to witnesses and the police, a red Chevrolet Cavalier driven by an 18-year-old man slammed into the back of her truck and sent Marvin airborne. She crashed to the pavement, where another car nearly ran over her. The driver of the Cavalier was convicted of aggravated reckless driving and sentenced to 126 days in jail.\n\n“I remember a tiny bit of the ambulance ride, kind of waking up going, ‘Where am I, what’s happening, what’s going on, why are they cutting my clothes off?’” Marvin said. “Then I went out again. The next thing I remember was seeing my sister in the emergency room, and I’m still kind of like, ‘What’s happening, what’s going on?’ Then I went out again.\n\n“The next time I woke is when I started feeling the pain, realizing what happened.”\n\nMarvin had three torn ligaments and additional damage in her right knee, a humerus broken in three places, and a soda-can-size hole in her arm where the bone had burst through. Nerve damage locked the fingers and thumb on her right hand into a fist.

  "latent_8352": "Kismayo, Somalia – U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) confirmed on Monday that elements of its command participated in a joint counter-terrorism operation against an al-Qaeda linked terrorist group known as Harakat al-Shabaab. The operation, which was executed on January 7th, included an unknown number of U.S. military advisors which accompanied Somali National Army troops along with Ugandan commandos assigned to the United Nations peacekeeping mission, the African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM.\n\nThe raid occurred in and around the villages of Bula-Gaduud near the southern Somalia port city of Kismayo. The area in and around Kismayo is historically been known as a ‘hotbed’ of al-Shabaab activity with the terror group recently retaking majority control over the towns and villages within the region. The joint raid was described as a ‘counter-terrorism operation’ with the intent of ‘disturbing’ al-Shabaab’s influence within the region and staunching the group’s recent uptick in terror attacks Somalia has seen in recent months.\n\nAFRICOM’s public affairs office released a statement confirming the raid had in fact occurred and that U.S. advisors were present during the raid and called in U.S. warplanes to conduct several airstrikes on suspected al-Shabaab camps 30 kilometers north of Kismayo. AFRICOM labeled these U.S. close air support missions as “self-defense strikes” due to the U.S. advisors on the ground declaring that their safety was being threatened by al-Shabaab fighters massing in what the advisors assumed was a sizable counter attack force. AFRICOM’s press release provided the justification of the strikes by stating: “During a counter-terrorism operation to disrupt al-Shabaab, the combined partner forces observed al-Shabaab fighters threatening their safety and security. The U.S. conducted a self-defense strike to neutralize the threat, no enemy fighters were killed.” Yet the question remains, who are the Americans?\n\nDue to my time as a Green Beret, when I hear the phrase “U.S. Advisor” in regards to military operations in a country, I immediately assume that these advisors are special operations; which drives me to assume that the Somali and African Union AMISOM forces were also special operations. Somalia’s counter-terrorism special operations unit the Gashaan was reported by SOFREP to have been trained by U.S. Special Operations forces and have been known to accompany Gashaan forces as advisors on raids against al-Shabaab in the past. The Gashaan which falls under the command of Somalia’s CIA-trained National Intelligence & Security Agency(NISA) and is known to have several forward operating bases in the southern region of Somalia. The Ugandan People’s Defense Force(UPDF) southern Somalia contingent which supplies the majority of the African Union troop numbers to the AMISOM mission is also stationed in the south in the city of Barawe with forward operating bases just outside the port city limits of Kismayo.\n\nThe UPDF also has a U.S. trained and advised commando unit within Somalia as well. Only these commandos were trained by a private security company known as Bancroft Global Development. Bancroft who’s ranks are filled with former U.S. and European special operators were hired by the Ugandan government to train its troops assigned to AMISOM in the development and training of UPDF special forces commandos in counterinsurgency operations against al-Shabaab and other extremist groups. AMISOM itself pays for Bancroft’s services through the European Union’s $640 million dollar aid package to the African Union-led United Nations peacekeeping mission in East Africa. AMISOM then submits an invoice to the U.S. State Department for reimbursement for the private security company’s services. It is rumored that Bancroft advisors have gone along on AMISOM raids in the past in a command and control advisory role, coaching Ugandan commanders on the ground during operations targeting al-Shabaab.\n\nBoth AMISOM and NISA have yet to confirm if any of their special operations units were involved in this recent raid and it is highly doubtful that AFRICOM or Bancroft Global for that matter will confirm whether or not U.S. Special Operations or private security contractors were also present. However, the moniker ‘self-defense strikes’ being conducted ring true to the rules of engagement for U.S. Green Berets or Special Operations forces in an advisory capacity as these advisors are authorized to call in an air strike or further U.S. military intervention if they feel their safety is “threatened.” Bancroft contractors could in essence also be afforded the same protections from harm by way of U.S. airstrikes with the loophole that they are in fact working for the Ugandan military and AMISOM itself and therefore technically are a part of the African Union coalition mission in Somalia. Bancroft contractors calling in the defensive strike however feels like a stretch due to U.S. African Command confirming the use of U.S. warplanes in regards to protecting the safety of U.S. advisors accompanying a joint AMISOM raid.\n\nFeature image: Twitter",

  "latent_8680": "Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality in humans, involving a third copy of all or part of chromosome 21. In addition to intellectual disability, individuals with Down syndrome have a high risk of congenital heart defects. However, not all people with Down syndrome have them -- about half have structurally normal hearts.\n\nGeneticists have been learning about the causes of congenital heart defects by studying people with Down syndrome. The high risk for congenital heart defects in this group provides a tool to identify changes in genes, both on and off chromosome 21, which are involved in abnormal heart development.\n\nResearchers at Emory University School of Medicine, with colleagues at Johns Hopkins University, Oregon Health Science University, and University of Pittsburgh, report results from the largest genetic study of congenital heart defects in individuals with Down syndrome in the journal Genetics in Medicine.\n\nThe team found that infants with congenital heart defects, in the context of Down syndrome, were more likely to have rare, large genetic deletions. Those deletions tended to involve genes that affect cilia, cellular structures that are important for signaling and patterning in embryonic development.\n\nThese new findings, along with other recent studies, suggest that the risk for congenital heart defects in Down syndrome can come from several genes and environmental factors, in addition to the substantial risk from the extra chromosome 21.\n\n\"In Down syndrome, there's a 50-fold increase in risk for heart defects, which is enormous,\" says senior author Michael Zwick, PhD, associate professor of human genetics and pediatrics at Emory. \"Studying congenital heart defects in the 'at risk' Down syndrome population can make it possible to reveal genes that impact the risk of heart defects in all children, including those with typical number of chromosomes.\"\n\n\"Understanding the origin of heart disorders in individuals with Down syndrome may reveal aspects of biology that would allow better personalization of their health care, since genetic alterations that affect the heart may also affect other organs, such as the lungs or gut,\" Zwick says.\n\n\"Our partnership with families who have a child with Down syndrome and our investment in a comprehensive clinical data and biorepository will continue to provide resources to study not only heart defects, but also other Down-syndrome associated medical conditions such as cognitive function, leukemia, and dementia,\" says co-author Stephanie Sherman, PhD, professor of human genetics at Emory University School of Medicine.\n\nSherman says the study was a collaborative effort involving participants with Down syndrome, their families and assessment sites across the United States, including those mentioned above along with Kennedy Krieger Institute, Children's National Medical Center and Ohio Nationwide Children's Hospital.\n\nThe first author was Emory postdoctoral fellow Dhanya Ramachandran, PhD, working with Zwick. Emory co-authors included assistant professors Lori Bean, PhD, Tracie Rosser, PhD and David Cutler, PhD, in the Department of Human Genetics, and Jennifer Mulle, PhD, assistant professor of epidemiology in the Rollins School of Public Health. Ken Dooley, MD, associate professor of pediatrics at Emory and pediatric cardiologist at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, reviewed medical records and made definitive diagnoses for all study participants.\n\nThe study included 452 individuals with Down syndrome. 210 had complete atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs), a serious heart defect that is relatively common among those with Down syndrome (about 20 percent). The remaining 242 had structurally normal hearts. The Emory team used high density microarrays to probe more than 900,000 sites across the human genome to detect structural variation, including deletions or duplications of DNA.\n\nAn atrioventricular septal defect means that the central region of the heart separating the atria from the ventricles has failed to form properly. Such defects increase the workload on the heart, and a complete AVSD leads to heart failure: fluid buildup in the lungs and difficulty breathing, requiring surgery in the first year of life.\n\nThe team's results add to evidence for a connection between AVSDs and cilia. Ciliopathies are a class of genetic disorders that include kidney, eye, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Cells in the airways have mobile cilia which sweep mucus and dirt out of the lungs, but almost every cell in the body has a primary (sensory) cilium.\n\n\"The finding that ciliome genes may be disrupted in children with Down syndrome and AVSD may indicate differences in life-time care for these individuals,\" Zwick says. \"This is a suggestive result that needs replication in a larger group.\"\n\nTo confirm and strengthen the findings, Zwick and his team are currently performing an independent study of individuals with Down syndrome, using whole genome sequencing to further delineate alterations in genes that perturb heart development in children.",

  "latent_9065": "Spread the love\n\nThe city of Chicago saw a staggering number of homicides last year, with over 760 murders in 2016. President Trump is combatting the problem by following in Obama’s footsteps, and ramping up the confiscation of “illegal” guns—and he’s using the federal government for assistance.\n\nThe Chicago Crime Gun Strike Force is now made up of both Chicago police and 20 agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Because the federal agents bring their technology and weapons with them, the city now has access to a van outfitted with ballistic testing equipment, specifically devoted to targeting “illegal” guns and repeat gun offenders.\n\nDuring a news conference on June 30, acting U.S. Attorney Joel Levin said prosecutors are working on increasing federal gun prosecutions, and his office has prosecuted “more federal gun cases this year than in all of 2016—and in 2016, his office prosecuted more such cases than it had in a decade.”\n\nAs the homicide rate skyrocketed in summer 2016, Chicago police claim they seized nearly 6,000 guns—making the average rate one gun seizure per every 59 minutes. This practice is nothing new, as a report on the gun confiscations in Chicago revealed that in 2012, police seized 7,624 guns, which was more per capita than New York City and Los Angeles… combined.\n\nAll of the guns Chicago police are confiscating are defined as “illegal guns,” and it raises the question—what exactly is it that makes these guns, and their owners, illegal? As with many things that are prohibited in the United States, the guns are illegal because the government says they are illegal.\n\n“If you had some guns in that club the night that this took place, if you had guns on the other side, you wouldn’t have had the tragedy that you had,” Trump said in a CNN interview after last year’s tragic shooting in Orlando, noting that only good guys with guns can stop bad guys with guns. With the thousands of gun confiscations taking place in Illinois, there are undoubtedly good people losing their means of self-defense to Trump’s gun confiscating army.\n\nTrump has even made note that the strict gun laws in Chicago do nothing to stop gun violence as bad guys will always find ways to get guns.\n\nThe most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago – and look what is happening there! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2014\n\nWhile Illinois doesn’t actually have the toughest gun laws, it is known for having some of the strictest gun laws in the U.S., and it is currently ranked 8th out of all 50 states on the “Gun Law State Scorecard” created by the pro-gun control Law Center to Prevent Violence.\n\nThat ranking is largely due to the requirement for all gun owners in the state to obtain a “Firearm Owners Identification Card” or FOID card from state police. Illinois then passed a law in August 2016, making it a felony for anyone to so much as bring a gun into the state for the purpose of selling, delivering or transferring it, without a FOID card.\n\nBased on a Tweet from President Trump on June 30, in which he said, “Crime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help,” one might think that this was his plan all along.\n\nCrime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help. 1714 shootings in Chicago this year! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2017\n\nHowever, as pointed out above, it should be noted that—as with many things—Trump had vastly different sentiments toward gun violence in Chicago when he was on the campaign trail. During a debate against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, on Oct. 19, 2016, Trump criticized the amount of gun violence in Chicago, despite the strict laws.\n\n“In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence,” Trump said. “I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.”\n\nAs The Free Thought Project reported in August 2015, one group of Chicago moms combatted the level of violence by taking to the streets, and helping those in need. As a result, violence began declining in one of the city’s most dangerous neighborhoods.\n\nThe current tactics used by Chicago police, including the mass confiscation of guns, have been ongoing for years, and even though thousands of guns are confiscated each year, the number of homicides continues to climb. While the addition of the federal government’s agents and their equipment will certainly increase the number of gun confiscations, it will also likely increase the death toll, raising the question of when city and state officials will start looking at the root of the problem, and stop increasing the power of the police state.",
  "latent_9144": "For their size, barnacles possess the longest penis of any animal (up to eight times their body length). However, as one of few sessile animals to copulate, they face a trade-off between reaching more mates and controlling ever-longer penises in turbulent flow. We observed that penises of an intertidal barnacle ( Balanus glandula ) from wave-exposed shores were shorter than, stouter than, and more than twice as massive for their length as, those from nearby protected bays. In addition, penis shape variation was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves, and, on all shores, larger barnacles had disproportionately stouter penises. Finally, field experiments confirmed that most of this variation was due to phenotypic plasticity: barnacles transplanted to a wave-exposed outer coast produced dramatically shorter and wider penises than counterparts moved to a protected harbour. Owing to the probable trade-off between penis length and ability to function in flow, and owing to the ever-changing wave conditions on rocky shores, intertidal barnacles appear to have acquired the capacity to change the size and shape of their penises to suit local hydrodynamic conditions. This dramatic plasticity in genital form is a valuable reminder that factors other than the usual drivers of genital diversification—female choice, sexual conflict and male–male competition—can influence genital form.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nTo cope with a sessile lifestyle and an evolutionary legacy of mandatory internal fertilization (Ruppert et al. 2004), barnacles have evolved a remarkable mechanism for copulating with distant neighbours: penises that can extend up to eight times their body length (Darwin 1854; table 1). However, as one of very few sessile animals to copulate (Ruppert et al. 2004), barnacles face a delicate trade-off. Although longer penises greatly increase the number of potential mates—because the searchable area expands as the square of penis length—the benefits of larger penises may be outweighed by increased drag as water turbulence intensifies, particularly in species that live on wave-exposed shores (figure 5).\n\nCuriously, because most free-living barnacles are simultaneous hermaphrodites (Charnov 1987), they could potentially self-fertilize, yet in most species self-fertilization is rare or non-existent (Barnes & Crisp 1956; Furman & Yule 1990). Instead, most barnacles reproduce by extending impressively long penises (table 1) to find and fertilize distant mates (Klepal 1990). However, such long penises pose a major challenge because many intertidal barnacle species live under a wide range of wave conditions where water velocities can span up to three orders of magnitude (Denny 1988) and reach extremes of up to 20 m s−1 (Helmuth & Denny 2003). Consequently, individuals with penises well suited for mating in quiet waters may be poorly suited for copulating on wave-exposed shores. Indeed, other structures that must extend into flow, like the long feathery feeding legs of barnacles, differ dramatically in form between protected harbours and nearby wave-exposed sites (Arsenault et al. 2001). Furthermore, in one species, these differences in feeding leg form arise primarily due to phenotypic plasticity (Marchinko 2003).\n\nTherefore, because penises of barnacles probably face hydrodynamic constraints similar to those experienced by feeding legs, we predicted that (i) penis size and shape should vary among sites with different wave-force regimes: penises should be shorter (i.e. smaller) on wave-exposed shores owing to more turbulent hydrodynamic conditions, and, for a given length, penises should be stouter at wave-exposed sites to better resist bending in turbulent flow, and (ii) because wave action varies so dramatically in space and time, differences in penis form should arise primarily due to phenotypic plasticity.\n\n2. Material and methods\n\n(a) Artificial inflation of barnacle penises\n\nTo ensure that relaxed penis length was a valid proxy for extended penis length, we mechanically inflated penises of barnacles from an exposed shore (Prasiola Point, 48°49′01″ N, 125°10′02″ W; velocity of breaking waves approx. 5 m s−1; C. J. Neufeld 2006, unpublished data) and a protected shore (Grappler Inlet; 0.05 m s−1; Marchinko & Palmer 2003). To avoid potential density-induced differences in penis form, 25 solitary barnacles—barnacles with plates not touching another barnacle but with an approximately equal number of neighbours within 1–2 cm—were collected in the middle of the Balanus glandula zone at each site on 14 December 2007. After freezing for 24 hours at −8°C, barnacles were thawed in seawater and the soma was removed, photographed under a dissecting microscope at 6–8×, blotted dry and weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg following Arsenault et al. (2001). The soma was then cut between the first and second pair of thoracic legs, inserted onto the tapered end of a seawater-filled plastic capillary tube (1.09 mm in outside diameter, 0.38 mm in inside diameter and approx. 25 mm long) and carefully glued in place (Krazy Glue, Elmer's Products, Columbus, OH) while keeping the penis tissue moist. The capillary tube was then inserted onto the end of a hypodermic needle (0.5 mm in outside diameter and 0.2 mm in inside diameter) and fitted onto a 10 ml plastic syringe filled with seawater. The penis and remaining feeding legs were positioned in seawater under a dissecting microscope. The penis was oriented perpendicular to the field of view, and pressure was applied to the syringe to slowly inflate the penis until (i) the glue failed, (ii) the soma tissue or cuticle ruptured, or (iii) the penis inflated fully. Full inflation was recorded when additional pressure on the syringe failed to extend the penis further and all annulations of the penis cuticle had disappeared. At this point, the penis was photographed again. This process was repeated for approximately 20 individuals per site until we had achieved full penis extension for three individuals from each population.\n\n(b) Field survey\n\nBalanus glandula (Darwin) were collected from eight sites that spanned a wide range of maximum water velocities within Barkley Sound, BC, Canada. Six sites in the order of decreasing wave exposure (Seppings Island, SI, Bordelais Island, Wizard Islets, Kelp Bay, Self Point and Ross Islets, RI) are described in Arsenault et al. (2001) and two additional low-velocity sites (Bamfield Inlet, BI and Grappler Inlet) are described in Marchinko & Palmer (2003). Barnacles were collected between 21 and 24 February 2006, when the majority of individuals in this area are reproductively active (Strathmann 1987) and have fully developed penises (Barnes 1992). Twenty solitary barnacles—barnacles with plates not touching another barnacle but with an approximately equal number of neighbours within 1–2 cm—were collected in the middle of the B. glandula zone at each site. Owing to errors during dissection, sample sizes used to determine site means differed slightly (from n=17 to 20) among sites and analyses. Owing to the difficulty of measuring winter water velocity using standard techniques, we used the known relationship between leg length and maximum velocity of breaking waves (Arsenault et al. 2001) to estimate the maximum water velocity at each site. In addition, we used empirically determined summer velocities at these sites (Arsenault et al. 2001; Marchinko & Palmer 2003) for comparison (figure 1). Figure 1 Relaxed penis length (filled symbols) and corresponding manually inflated penis length (open symbols) of barnacles from an exposed shore (Prasiola Point; squares, solid lines) and a protected shore (Grappler Inlet; circles, dashed lines) in Barkley Sound, BC, Canada. Paired points represent individual barnacles and arrows denote transition from relaxed to inflated penis length (mean proportional inflation±s.e.m.: protected shore=1.82±0.082; exposed shore=1.75±0.044; p=0.77).\n\n(c) Field transplant experiment\n\nTo differentiate between genetic control (differential settlement and/or selective mortality) and environmental control (phenotypic plasticity) of penis form, we transplanted barnacles from two source populations to each of two destination sites. On 25 September 2006, adult B. glandula were collected on mussel shells (Mytilus californianus and Mytilus trossulus) from two source populations chosen for a substantial difference in wave force between sites (Arsenault et al. 2001) and for a sizeable supply of adult barnacles growing on mussels: a protected shore (RI; Arsenault et al. 2001) and an exposed shore (SI; Arsenault et al. 2001) in Barkley Sound, BC, Canada. Mussel shells were cut using a variable speed rotary tool so that one barnacle occupied each mussel shell fragment. Mussel shell fragments were spaced approximately 15 mm apart and glued to two 10×13 cm Plexiglas plates using marine epoxy putty (Z-spar Splash Zone Compound) in a 5×8 grid alternating between protected- and exposed-shore source populations. Plates were kept overnight in flowing seawater and then bolted to the rock in the middle of the B. glandula zone in two outplant locations chosen for a more than fivefold variation in wave force: a protected shore (BI; Marchinko & Palmer 2003) and an exposed shore (SI; Arsenault et al. 2001). On 13 February 2007 (after 20 weeks), during the local reproductive period, intact transplanted barnacles were collected to measure barnacle penis form. During the outplant period, barnacles suffered some mortality at all sites. The final numbers used in the analyses were as follows: protected (site RI) to protected (site BI), n=18; protected (RI) to exposed (SI), n=6; exposed (SI) to protected (BI), n=16; exposed (SI) to exposed (SI), n=13. Furthermore, owing to an omission during dissection, soma mass was not measured for one individual in the protected to exposed group (RI to BI). Consequently, data from this individual were excluded from analyses involving soma mass.\n\n(d) Sample processing\n\nSamples were frozen at −8°C and processed within 30 days of collection. Barnacles were thawed in seawater and the soma was removed, blotted dry and weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg following Arsenault et al. (2001). The penis and the sixth thoracic leg from the left side were removed, wet mounted in seawater and photographed under a dissecting microscope at 15–31×. Photographs were measured to the nearest 10 μm using ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA, USA, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/, 1997–2008). For the field survey barnacles, after being photographed, penises were dried to a constant mass and weighed to the nearest 0.001 mg on a Cahn C-31 analytical microbalance (Thermo Electronic Corporation, Waltham, MA).\n\n(e) Statistical analyses\n\nAll statistics were calculated using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, http://www.R-project.org). Assumptions of equal variance (using Levene's test) and normal distribution (using Shapiro–Wilk test) were met in all cases. To test for differences in extended length and proportional change of artificially inflated penises, we used two-sample t-tests on log-transformed data. For the field survey, least-square means of body size (figure 2a,b) or penis length (figure 2c,d) were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) assuming an equal slope among sites. Regression and ANCOVA analyses were calculated on log-transformed data. Where slopes varied significantly among groups (table S2, electronic supplementary material), we recalculated least-square means at first, second and third quartiles of penis length assuming unequal slopes (table S5, electronic supplementary material). In all cases, the conclusions were not affected (figure S1, electronic supplementary material). For the field transplant experiment, we computed 2 two-way ANCOVAs on log-transformed data with source population and transplant location as factors and soma mass (figure 4a) or penis length (figure 4b) as the covariate.

(error bars are only shown for filled circles for clarity; in some cases, error bars are smaller than the symbol size).\n\n3. Results\n\n(a) Artificial inflation of barnacle penises\n\nRelaxed penis length was a consistent indicator of maximum penis length for both protected- and exposed-shore barnacles (figure 1). Mean proportional inflation did not differ between source populations (p=0.772) and erect penises of protected-shore barnacles remained significantly longer than those of exposed-shore barnacles (p=0.039).\n\n(b) Field survey\n\nWe observed differences in both penis size and shape. When corrected for body size (soma mass), penises from the most wave-exposed site were 25% shorter than those from the most protected bay and penis length was strongly negatively correlated with velocity when compared across all eight sites (figure 2a). Furthermore, penis mass (corrected for body size) was 16% higher in the most exposed site when compared with the most protected site and this trait was positively correlated with water velocity across sites (figure 2b).\n\nIn contrast to the modest differences in penis size, we observed substantial differences in penis shape among the same sites. Relative to penis length, penis basal width at the most exposed site was more than 50% larger than that at the most protected site (figures 2c and 3). Furthermore, penis mass (standardized for penis length) was more than twice as high in the most wave-exposed site compared with the most protected bay (figure 2d). In both cases, water velocity explained a high percentage of among-site variation in penis shape: 96% for penis basal width at standard length (figure 2c) and 95% for penis mass (figure 2d). Figure 3 Relaxed penis form of similar-sized barnacles (Balanus glandula) from Barkley Sound, BC, Canada. (a) Protected shore (Grappler Inlet; maximum velocity of breaking waves=0.75 m s−1, soma wet mass=0.019 g, basal width=8.5 mm). (b) Wave-exposed outer coast (SI; maximum velocity of breaking waves=4.5 m s−1, soma wet mass=0.024 g, basal width=8.9 mm). Scale bar, 2 mm.\n\n(c) Field transplant experiment\n\nWhen corrected for body size, barnacles transplanted to the wave-exposed shore produced 25% shorter (analysis of covariance on log-transformed data, F 1,45 =15.46, p<0.001; figure 4a) and 20% wider (F 1,46 =11.57, p=0.001; figure 4b) penises than counterparts moved to the protected harbour after a period of 20 weeks. In addition, penis length exhibited a disproportionately greater response to the local growth environment in larger barnacles than in smaller ones (F 1,45 =4.59, p=0.038). Finally, regardless of whether barnacles originated from exposed- or protected-shore populations, both penis size (penis length relative to soma mass; F 1,45 =0.39, p=0.534) and penis shape (penis basal width relative to penis length; F 1,46 =1.90, p=0.175) converged to similar values at both transplant sites (figure 4).

All points are mean±s.e.m.\n\n4. Discussion\n\n(a) Adaptive significance of penis form variation\n\nThe remarkably close fit between wave force and penis form (figure 2c,d) suggests that even slight deviations from an optimal shape in a particular environment drastically reduce opportunities to mate. Two lines of argument suggest that the spatial variation in penis form we observed is adaptive.\n\nFirst, in the absence of hydrodynamic effects, longer penises should exponentially increase the number of potential mates because the reachable area increases as the square of penis length (figure 5a). Second, the penis form variation we observed is consistent with two predictions from engineering theory. Beam theory (Vogel 2003) predicts that stouter, heavier penises should better resist bending caused by drag, so stouter penises should enable more successful copulations on wave-exposed shores (figure 5b). In addition, hydrodynamic theory predicts that, under turbulent flow conditions, larger penises should be disproportionately stouter than smaller ones because drag, and hence the overall bending force, increases to the second power of length (Vogel 2003). Indeed, we observed that penis basal width exhibited significant and similar positive allometry relative to body size and penis length at all sites (table S1, electronic supplementary material), and penises of larger barnacles exhibited a disproportionately greater response when transplanted to different flow conditions (table S6, electronic supplementary material). Figure 5 Proposed trade-off between penis form and flow environment. (a) In quiet water, the 25% longer penis of a protected-shore barnacle relative to its exposed-shore counterpart (figure 2a) may increase the reachable area (the area within which to find mates) by as much as 90% (compare the area encompassed by the dotted line with the shaded area). (b) In high flow, a small increase in the ability of the stouter exposed-shore penis form to resist bending due to drag would enable the penis of an exposed-shore barnacle to extend across more streamlines and yield an effective reachable area (shaded region) greater than that of a similar-sized quiet water barnacle with a penis more prone to downstream deflection due to drag (area bounded by the dotted line).\n\nAlthough the observed variation in penis form seems most likely to be adaptive, one non-adaptive explanation that cannot be ruled out is developmental pleiotropy (Ronemus et al. 1996): mechanisms controlling the development of leg length and penis length may not be independent. Nonetheless, pleiotropy could be an elegant developmental mechanism for ensuring that penis form varied appropriately in response to wave action. Because legs are exposed to flow more frequently, they would be a more reliable sensor of flow conditions and could ‘signal’ to the penis to change form. In other words, developmental pleiotropy itself could represent an adaptive evolutionary response that couples the developmental control of leg and penis form.\n\n(b) Is barnacle penis form plastic?\n\nA close fit between penis form and environment could arise in three ways: (i) differential settlement, where genetically different larvae settle in a specific environment appropriate to their genotype, (ii) selective mortality, where larvae of all genotypes settle independent of environmental conditions but mismatched genotypes suffer higher mortality, or (iii) phenotypic plasticity, where different phenotypes are directly induced by different growth conditions. We found that barnacles transplanted to quiet water produced longer and thinner penises than those moved to wave-exposed shores and converged on the same phenotype at a given transplant site regardless of source population; therefore, penis size and shape appear to vary among sites primarily due to phenotypic plasticity, and little if at all due to genetic differences (via differential settlement or selective mortality) among populations.\n\nPhenotypic plasticity in penis form may have arisen as an adaptive strategy to cope with spatial and/or temporal variation in flow conditions that developing barnacles experience. Because barnacles have a long pelagic larval duration (Strathmann 1987) and probably travel long distances from their source population prior to settlement, offspring may end up in a vastly different flow environment than that experienced by their parents. Furthermore, independent of where they end up, barnacles may face significant temporal variation in flow. In addition to seasonal patterns in swell-generating storm events (swell increases dramatically in the winter months at our study sites), the settlement, growth and mortality of other animals may also cause persistent changes in flow between successive years. Therefore, the ability to alter penis form after settlement may be advantageous to cope with aspects of spatial as well as temporal variation in flow conditions.\n\n(c) Constraints on penis length\n\nRegardless of how they develop, longer penises are probably constrained by turbulent flow (figures 1 and 5b). However, at low-flow sites where drag is less likely to limit penis form, several other ‘braking’ effects may also restrict the development of ever-longer penises in barnacles. First, although oversized male genitals are thought to entail few costs (Eberhard 1985; Chapman et al. 2003), oversized reproductive organs may increase susceptibility to predators by significantly reducing escape velocities (Ramos et al. 2004; Langerhans et al. 2005). Given that even the agile feeding legs of barnacles are eaten by fishes (Barnes 1999), barnacles' unwieldy penises are probably even more vulnerable while exposed during copulation. Second, as length increases, the ability to control such a long appendage may become difficult: in one beetle species, a similar cost appears to have promoted an elaborate behaviour to retract its outsized intromittent organ without causing irreversible damage (Gack & Peschke 2005). Finally, beyond a certain length, the benefit of greater reach may be outweighed by the cost of producing and housing the large genitalia and ample sperm necessary to fertilize a growing number of distant mates. Collectively, any number of these effects could reduce the advantage of ever-longer penises and may account for the levelling-off of penis length with decreasing water flow that we observed at the most protected sites (figure 2a).\n\nIn summary, our results suggest that penis size and shape in B. glandula are strongly influenced by a trade-off between length and manoeuvrability that varies with wave force. Through the capacity to grow wider and heavier penises (for their length) on wave-exposed shores, B. glandula may improve their mating success under turbulent flow. This study provides a rare example of conspicuous phenotypic plasticity in animal genitalia and reveals how factors other than the usual drivers of genital diversification—female choice, sexual conflict and male–male competition (Eberhard 1985; Arnqvist 1998; Eberhard et al. 1998; Hosken & Stockley 2004)—can influence genital form.\n\nAll work conducted in this study complied with the current Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.

The effort was aimed largely at proving a point: If Republicans refuse to act, they are simply carrying the water of an administration that has defied decades of conservative policy doctrine on Russia.\n\nThe White House appeared ready to keep up the pressure on House Republicans, apparently undeterred by the controversies surrounding the younger Mr. Trump, the continuing Russia investigations, and fallout from last week’s meeting between the president and Mr. Putin in Germany.\n\n“In the current form, the legislation poses a number of risks to the U.S. government’s ability to conduct foreign policy,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary. But she declined to say whether Mr. Trump would veto the measure. “Until they get further in the process, we’re not going to weigh in any further,” she said.\n\nNumerous administration officials concede privately that, especially in the current political environment, Mr. Trump can ill afford a veto fight with the Republican-controlled Congress over Russia sanctions legislation.\n\nBehind the scenes, administration officials have been trying to persuade lawmakers to reconsider the bill.

But his tendency to fixate on issues also sometimes made it hard for him to get over political attacks, say some of his advisers and colleagues.\n\nSchweich left behind a wife and two children – and a seemingly rising political career – when he died Thursday at age 54.\n\nSign Up and Save Get six months of free digital access to The State\n\nHe said his audits exposed more than 30 “corrupt government officials” who allegedly stole taxpayer money. But his promised gubernatorial campaign against corruption had barely begun.\n\nAnnouncing his candidacy last month, Schweich had vowed to bring a never-before-seen “level of intensity, tenacity, transparency, and rigor” in a quest to root out “rampant corruption in Jefferson City.”\n\nAs evidence of his grit, Schweich touted his work in the U.S. State Department coordinating an anti-drug initiative in Afghanistan.\n\n“Negotiating with Afghan warlords prepared me well for Missouri politics,” he said.\n\nHe took specific aim at the state’s top political donor, retired investment mogul Rex Sinquefield, who largely bankrolled the campaign of his GOP gubernatorial rival Catherine Hanaway, a former state House speaker and federal prosecutor.\n\nSchweich said the $900,000 Hanaway accepted from her “billionaire patron” made her “bought and paid for” by Sinquefield, who employs an “army of mercenaries” to exert his influence over elected officials.\n\n“Nothing is too dishonest for them, and apparently nothing is too petty for them, either,” Schweich said last month. “It’s corrupt, and there’s a lot more corruption going on in that camp that we’ll be talking about in the days to come.”\n\nHanaway generally deflected Schweich’s accusations, and Sinquefield has defended his political endeavors.\n\n“Undoubtedly, rooting out corruption is a very good thing,” Hanaway told reporters and editors at the Capitol in mid-February. “But I have a question: Isn’t that his job now?”\n\nIn the ensuing days, Schweich became increasingly focused on another man – John Hancock, a consultant who did opposition research for Hanaway last year and was elected Feb. 21 as chairman of the Missouri Republican Party.\n\nSchweich, an Episcopalian, told The Associated Press he believed Hancock had been telling Republican donors and activists that Schweich was Jewish, which he perceived as an anti-Semitic statement.\n\nSchweich told the AP that he has some Jewish ancestry, but said he had become increasingly firm in his Christian faith.\n\nHancock told the AP after Schweich’s death that it’s possible he may have told some people Schweich was Jewish, “but I wouldn’t have said it in a derogatory or demeaning fashion,” he said.\n\nSchweich confronted Hancock in November about the alleged comments, but their tension was not resolved. As the date approached for the party chairman’s election, Schweich reached out to other Republicans – including U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt and some state party committee members – to try to rally people against electing Hancock.\n\nSome Republicans declined to get involved in what they viewed as personal spat.\n\nEventually, Hancock’s alleged comments “became some kind of a hurdle” to Schweich, said state Republican Party Secretary Pat Thomas, who was among those to whom Schweich had appealed.\n\nOn Monday, Schweich outlined the whole ordeal to an AP reporter, saying he planned to hold a press conference about it the next day – even though his advisers said it was a poor political move. Schweich described having knots in his stomach for the past week, because he was so worked up over it. He didn’t follow through on the press conference, telling the AP he was still trying to get a prominent Jewish person to stand with him first.\n\nThen, on Thursday morning, Schweich talked twice over the phone with the AP to invite a reporter to his suburban St. Louis home for an afternoon interview, saying he was ready to go public with his accusations. He said he was also inviting a reporter from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\nPolice say authorities received an emergency call about the shooting just minutes after those phone calls.\n\nHancock emailed state Republican Party officials Friday saying he was “sad to have learned that some of (Schweich’s) final moments were spent thinking of an ongoing disagreement with me.”\n\nHancock said he had “mistakenly believed that Tom Schweich was Jewish,” and that Schweich “had mistakenly believed that I had attacked his religion.”\n\n“We may never know what drove Tom to take his own life –but it seems clear that there were deeper and more profound issues than a minor political squabble,” Hancock said.\n\nA memorial service is scheduled for Tuesday at the Episcopal church Schweich attended.\n\nOn Friday, Gov.

The Lansbury transfer tangle involves two players from the same division with Villa, also of the Championship, hoping to sign him.\n\nWhen asked about the Lansbury transfer, ex-Forest player Blackstock said: “Why are you ringing me? I wouldn’t ring you up to ask what you were doing yesterday?”\n\nKennedy did not respond to requests to talk about the issue.\n\nLansbury’s move could still go through, but it will need a licensed agent to sign it off.\n\nThe controversy has caused major unrest in the agent world with them urging the FA to take action.\n\nFA rules are clear that clubs are duty bound to report unlicensed agents.\n\nThe FA state: “If you have any doubts about anyone purporting to be an Intermediary please do not hesitate to contact the Financial Regulation Team for clarification.”\n\nElswehere it has been reported that the takeover of Nottingham Forest is off, which could have implications for the Lansbury transfer.",
  "latent_10144": "Never in living memory has the West been plunged into the kind of hysteria and madness that currently engulfs its political and media establishments.\n\nJust pause to consider where we are for a moment. We have lame-duck US president, in the shape of Barack Obama, threatening Russia with retaliation for alleged Russian cyber-hacking and interference in the US elections, while at the same time the man who is about to replace him in the White House in just a few weeks, Donald Trump, has been refuting those allegations.\n\nWhat does this say about the level of polarization and disunity that has become the new normal in Washington? It describes political paralysis and a political class thrown into disarray by its inability to come to terms with a world that has changed — i.e. one that is no longer theirs to dominate and control. It is a truth, a hard truth, that many in Washington are clearly unable to grasp, plunging normally rational human beings into paroxysms of anguish and despair.\n\nThere is simply no other explanation for the torrent of anti-Russia paranoia that has been unleashed since the US presidential election on November 11. Indeed, it has now surpassed a torrent and to become a full-blown flood, wherein everything from Trump's victory to Brexit to the weather is being blamed on Moscow. It is what democracy looks like when it is tested and fails that test.\n\n© AFP 2018 / Bryan R. Smith Samantha Power Lecturing on War Crimes is Like Quasimodo Lecturing on Posture\n\nNot that this is a defense of Donald Trump. My own preference for president, speaking as a non-US citizen, was Bernie Sanders, the only candidate whose anti-establishment principles on the side of working people are authentic, inclusive, and eminently more credible than Mr Trump's. But then Sanders was denied the nomination by a Democratic Party machine that supported Hillary Clinton's nomination from the outset, and which approached the presidential election as courtiers at a coronation rather than officials running an impartial primaries election process. It is their inability to deal with Clinton's defeat at the hands of a billionaire reality TV star with no prior political experience that lies at the root of the current crisis.\n\nOn the allegations of hacking, a group in the US calling itself Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) publicly disputes them. The group's spokesman, Bill Binney, a former high level intelligence analyst with the United States National Security Agency (NSA), believes that contrary to the claim that the emails released by WikiLeaks came via somebody hacking the DNC, they were instead leaked from within Washington.\n\nIn a recent open letter, six retired US intelligence officials write:\n\n\"The evidence that should be there is absent; otherwise, it would surely be brought forward, since this could be done without any danger to sources and methods. Thus, we conclude that the emails were leaked by an insider — as was the case with Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. Such an insider could be anyone in a government department or agency with access to NSA databases, or perhaps someone within the DNC.\"\n\nBritain's former ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, has also stated that the so-called Podesta (John Podesta, Clinton presidential campaign chairman) emails were leaked from within Washington, and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange maintains that they have not come from Russia or have anything to do with Russia.\n\nThus far the CIA has failed to produce any compelling evidence for its allegations that Russia hacked the DNC and interfered with the US election. However there is a vast trove of evidence that the CIA, throughout its history, has interfered with countless elections, subverted the political systems of other countries, and worked to bring down sovereign governments all over the world. For a comprehensive account of this ignoble history and record, the work of US author and historian William Blum is unsurpassed.\n\nHistory reveals that the decline of empire is a messy affair. The ideological and psychological shock suffered by its proponents is monumental, challenging received truths and cultural values without which they are left rudderless and spiritually bereft. This is what we are witnessing now when it comes to the decline of the empire of our time, emanating from Washington.\n\nAs such, the challenge for the rest of the world is managing that decline, the psychological and ideological damage incurred, to ensure the process of transition from unipolarity to multipolarity is as smooth as it can possibly be under the circumstances.\n\nTrusting not to neoconservatives and their ideological bedfellows but to the American people is key at this point. And it is here where we discern hope. For despite the attempt to blame Russia, China, Iran, etc., for the ills of the world, more and more Americans are waking up to the fact that their enemy does not lie overseas but at home in the shape of a ruling class that collectively has been responsible for obscene inequality and iniquity at home, while at the same time crises, conflict, chaos and instability abroad.\n\nAs the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci wrote:\n\n\"The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born; now is the time of monsters.\"\n\nOutgoing US president, Barack Obama, should take note.",
  "latent_10187": "Jack Doles and 24 Hour News 8 web staff -\n\nDETROIT (WOOD) -- Bora Gulari's name suits a sailor.\n\n\"My parents named me after a wind,\" he explained. \"In the Adriatic (Sea), there is what they call the black bora. It is a type of breeze that is hurricane-force. I've seen videos of up to 100 miles an hour, and it is a diabatic wind that comes down from the mountains and it just blows like stink, and that's what my name is.\"\n\nHe was born in Istanbul in 1975. His parents, both educators, came to the U.S. when he was 11 months old and eventually ended up in the Detroit area. They loved to sail, and by the time he was 5 years old, he did, too.\n\nNow grown, he still finds himself yearning for the water.\n\n\"I get into a little bit of a nervous twitch if I don't get into the water or see it or get on it,\" Gulari said. \"I think when I get ready to sail, I'm excited: Here we go again. It's my favorite activity in the world. I live for it. It's an endorphin rush. That's all it is. It has turned into a drug for me.\"\n\nHe'll get his fix later this summer.\n\nAfter his America's Cup ride pulled the plug on its campaign, he was recruited by U.S. sailing to make a run for the Olympics. He teamed up with Louisa Chafee on a Nacra 17 catamaran. Despite limited time together, they qualified for the games in Rio.\n\n\"I'm extremely patriotic and to be sailing for the USA is important to me,\" he said. \"Wearing the red, white and blue -- lots of pride.\"\n\nHe thinks they can win gold.\n\n\"Hell, yes,\" he said. \"I wouldn't go do it if I didn't believe that.\"\n\nHis confidence is backed up with a record: He has won two Moth world championships. In 2009, he was named Yachtsman of the Year.\n\nThat's the same year he cracked the 30-knot barrier.\n\n\"It is at that point on the verge of control,\" he said of the speed. \"It seems like the thing wants to spin out on you. When you crash at that speed, it feels like a car wreck. I've gotten whiplash bouncing off the water.\"\n\nCrashing and burning, he said, is part of learning.\n\n\"It's a big part of it. You almost don't seem to learn where the limit is or how to push yourself at that limit, and that's also part of the game until you do the crashing and burning,\" he said. \"There's a sick side of me that really enjoys the crashing and burning.\"\n\nWith his affinity for sailing on the edge, it's imperative he and Chafee spend as much time on the water as possible before Rio. But that's easier said than done. Unlike most Olympic sports, where everything are taken care of, sailors have to raise money to cover costs.\n\nThose costs include boats and accompanying trucks and trailers in the U.S., Europe and Rio.\n\n\"We are spending way more money in eight months than I probably have spent in my entire sailing life, on the order of $200,000,\" he said. \"It's staggering.\"\n\nHe and Chafee have a team helping them fundraise.\n\n\"Please be patriotic,\" Gulari said. \"It's a good thing to support your country.\"\n\nYou can donate to Gulari and Chafee's team online at their website.\n\n-----",
  "latent_10189": "Chelsea are playing hardball with Romelu Lukaku by placing a £30 million price tag on the striker and demanding he joins the rest of the squad in Holland on Wednesday.\n\nEverton are hoping to sign Lukaku on a permanent deal and are putting together a £23 million bid plus bonuses to try to land the Belgium international.\n\nLukaku wants to return to Everton, where he spent last season on loan, but Chelsea want £30 million and have instructed him to return to pre-season training in Holland.\n\nEverton must now hope they can negotiate an agreement with Chelsea or convince the Blues to allow Lukaku out on loan for a third successive season. Wolfsburg and Juventus are also interested, while sources in Spain claim Real Madrid are monitoring his situation.\n\nLukaku’s contract is due to expire in 2016, which means Chelsea may be wary of letting him go out on loan again and returning with only a year remaining.\n\nHaving reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup with Belgium, Lukaku and his international team-mates Thibaut Courtois and Eden Hazard were not required to return to pre-season training until Wednesday.\n\nWith Everton stepping up their efforts to sign Lukaku and the player clear of his preference, it had not been certain that he would join the rest of the Chelsea squad in Holland. But Lukaku, together with Courtois and Hazard, has been told to report for duty in Holland, where Chelsea take on Vitesse Arnhem on Wednesday night.\n\nLukaku appears to have been pushed further down the pecking order of Jose Mourinho, the Chelsea manager, by the return of Didier Drogba, who has joined the squad.\n\n“It’s amazing to be back, a great feeling,” Drogba, who will wear the No 15 shirt, said. “I’m happy to be back here and I’m looking forward to seeing the best fans.\n\n“I think the best thing I can bring to this club and team will be to stay the same as I was during my first spell here. I don’t have to change, everybody knows my character, my attitude and my mentality.\n\n“They know if I’m here it’s not just to smile and thank people for welcoming me back. I want to win, I want to share my desire and will to win games. The squad is young, but to get the best results you have to push yourself.\n\n“I’m not coming here to break records, I just want to win trophies. Five years is a long time not to win the Premier League, so I want to win it. To lift the Premier League trophy is a fantastic feeling and we haven’t experienced it for a few years, it’s too long for a club like ours.\n\n“I think the title race is going to be like it has been these last few years, all the big clubs will be involved and fighting until the end. There are more teams capable of winning the league, which makes it interesting in terms of pressure and different scenarios.”\n\nOther than Drogba, Chelsea have signed the striker Diego Costa, the midfielder Cesc Fabregas and the left-back Filipe Luis this summer, while Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard both left.\n\n“It was very important for us to buy these players, they are all good signings,” Drogba said. “To have Cesc with us, I think he’ll understand it’s better to be with us than against us. They are good players and I hope they will bring their talent and experience to the team.\n\n“I’ve been watching Diego play over the last few years and the first time I saw him I really liked him as a player. I like his character, he’s solid, he can score goals and he’s also technically gifted. He likes people to respect him and that’s important.\n\n“This is the first time I’ve had a chance to speak about those two players that left. Ash was the best left-back in the world and I was lucky to have him in my team because when he was at Arsenal he was a difficult player to play against. He became a better player when he came to Chelsea.\n\n“Everyone knows exactly what Frank meant to me. People say I scored a lot of goals, but he was involved in almost all of them. The partnership with him was incredible and he’s a legend at this club. I know he will also come back one day because he belongs to the Blues.”",
  "latent_10317": "An alarming number of young Western women are defying their families — and all logic — to join the ISIS barbarians.\n\nAs many as 550 of the estimated 3,000 Westerners who have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic terrorists are female, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London think tank.\n\nIt’s the sick siren song of the caliphate that appears to have taken hold of three British schoolgirls, who lied to their East London families last week and casually slipped out of the country on a flight bound for Turkey, believed to be a stopover for those heading to Syria, and ISIS.\n\nThe terrified families of Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and another 15-year-old friend, students at Bethnal Green Academy who are all believed to be Muslims, made an impassioned plea to their wayward daughters on Saturday.\n\n“Mum needs you home,” begged Begum’s older sister, Aklima. “You belong at home with us. Syria is a dangerous place and we don’t want you to go there . . . We understand that you have strong feelings and want to help those you believe are suffering in Syria. You can help from home . . . Please don’t cross the border.”\n\nBut why would “straight-A” students from London seek out ISIS, whose brutal MO includes savage beheadings and burning their captives alive?\n\nSome are coerced — but not all, says law professor Jayne Huckerby, head of Duke University’s International Human Rights Clinic.\n\n“Why do they go? In many cases it’s the same reason as men,” Huckerby told The Post.\n\nSome are alienated by harassment or discrimination against Muslims at home, and want to join what they see as a pro-Muslim movement. Some, according to the ISD, enjoy the shocking violence.\n\nThe ISD study, which examined the social-media postings of Western women who joined ISIS, found the women “celebrate the violence of ISIS, unequivocally.”\n\nOne woman called the beheading video of US Army vet and aid worker Peter Kassig “gut-wrenchingly awesome,” while others called the beheadings “beautiful.”\n\nThe women get a sanitized view of life under ISIS via social media, and can be sparked by what Huckerby calls “a sense of adventure.”\n\n“We’re talking constantly about ISIS being brutal, but they’re getting a different story,” she said.\n\nWomen are key to ISIS’s effort to build its own state, she says, whether it’s through fundraising, having children, doing certain kinds of work at checkpoints, or simply recruiting more women.\n\nAnd for some women, there are benefits to joining ISIS. Many are given free housing and food. Few seem bothered by the lack of freedom afforded to women under ISIS rule.\n\nOthers find “a sense of camaraderie and sisterhood . . . in ISIS-controlled territory, in contrast to the fake and surface-level relationships they have in the West,” according to the study.\n\nBut for women who find that life under ISIS isn’t what they expected, there’s little hope to undo their mistake, Huckerby said.\n\n“There are women who are going there and finding the reality is not what they were sold on social media by ISIS, and they want to come back, but government policies at the moment are not encouraging return,” she said.",
  "latent_10338": "Let’s go back to 2012. Mitt Romney lost. But it was NOT game over for Republicans. They maintained dominance in Congress, they blocked Obama from granting statutory amnesty to illegal aliens, not much changed in four years.\n\nNow, a lot of #NeverTrumpers think that the same thing will happen again, and they can run a “true conservative” candidate in 2020. Assuming Republican primary voters will select a “true conservative.” Even if Mitt Romney can be considered a “true conservative,” in 2008 voters selected John McCain (a very moderate pro-amnesty Republican who made deals with Democrats) and of course this year they selected Donald Trump. Primary voters NEVER selected a conservative firebrand like Ted Cruz. George W. Bush was very conservative on Christian issues, but under his presidency we saw massive increases in government spending and government debt, stupid wars in the Middle East that in the long run accomplished no useful goal, and he supported the amnesty bill. The Republican primary process is not capable of selecting a great candidate. Trump is the best we are going to get.\n\n(1) It’s hard to see how the Supreme Court remains conservative or even moderate after Hillary gets to select at least one liberal justice to replace Scalia, and who knows if Kennedy, who is 80 years old, can hang on another four years? Also, Ginsburg is extremely likely to be replaced during the next four years, and it makes a huge difference if she’s replaced by another extreme liberal or by a conservative.\n\nWith a liberal Supreme Court, the liberals can rule by judicial fiat even if Republicans control the other branches of government. We saw how activist the Supreme Court was in the period between Brown v. Board of Ed. (1954) and Roe v. Wade (1973). Expect that activism to return big time.\n\n(2) Republicans will be utterly demoralized and there will be forces saying that the key to the Republican future is to agree to amnesty for Hispanics who are “natural conservatives” and will start voting Republican if only Republicans weren’t so hostile to immigration. I know it didn’t happen that way in 2012, but are you willing to risk that it’s going to be the same this time?\n\nDemocrats don’t merely want amnesty, they want amnesty with a path to citizenship, and if they get that from Congress, or if the liberal Supreme Court says it’s unconstitutional not to give them citizenship, then we are talking about 11 million new voters who I predict will lean more heavily Democratic than current Hispanic citizens. They may be poor and “uneducated,” but collectively they will remember which party had their back. I guarantee it.\n\n* * *\n\nOldTimer writes in a comment:\n\nCan we please stop trotting out this bullshit 11 million figure which has been static for the better half of two decades? Reliable private sector estimates say it is closer to 30 million, which makes much more sense.\n\nIf OldTimer is correct, then amnesty with citizenship would be an even bigger disaster for the future of the Republican Party.",

This type is incompatible with string function foo(num: number): string { if (num > 10) { return 'cool'; } } // nullable type: the one inferred function foo(num: number): string | void { if (num > 10) { return 'cool'; } } // to fix this, we need to check the result const fooed: string|void = foo(100); if (fooed) { fooed.toString(); }\n\nEnter TypeScript 2.x function foo(num: number) { if (num > 10) { return 'cool'; } } // to fix this, we need to check the result const fooed: string|void = foo(100); if (fooed) { fooed.toString(); } // or tell the compiler we know better (in this case we actually do) fooed!.toString(); Important: Only works when strictNullChecks option is checked More Improvements in TypeScript 2.0 Catches up with Flow on control flow analysis (needed to make null checks really useful)\n\nNon-nullable types Types are nullable by default in TypeScript 1.x Non-nullable are still possible in TypeScript 1.x in a limited way Types are non-nullable by default in Flow TypeScript 2.x makes types non-nullable by default using `strictNullChecks` in `tsconfig.json`\n\nCaveat Neither Flow nor TypeScript 2.0 catch this class Person { name: string; constructor() { // why no error? } } const olli: Person = new Person(); // issues error as expected const daniel: Person = { }; At least in TypeScript, this won't be fixed: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8476\n\nGenerics aka Parametric Types\n\nConsider this type hierarchy class Animal { name: string; constructor(name: string) { this.name = name; } } class Dog extends Animal { // just to make this different from cat goodBoyFactor: number; } class Cat extends Animal { purrFactor: number; }\n\nGeneric Type information Types can be parameterized by others Most common with collection types let cats: Array<Cat> = []; // can only contain cats let animals: Array<Animal> = []; // can only contain animals // nope, no cat cats.push(10); // nope, no cat cats.push(new Animal('Fido')); // cool, is a cat cats.push(new Cat('Purry')); // cool, cat is a sub type of animal animals.push(new Cat('Purry'));\n\nUp to this point this pretty much works in Flow and TypeScript the same way ...\n\n... but wait\n\nTypeScript let cats: Array<Cat> = []; // can only contain cats let animals: Array<Animal> = []; // can only contain animals // error TS2322: Type 'Animal[]' is not assignable to type 'Cat[]'. // Type 'Animal' is not assignable to type 'Cat'. // Property 'purrFactor' is missing in type 'Animal'. cats = animals; // wow, works, but is no longer safe animals = cats; // because those are now all cool animals.push(new Dog('Brutus')); animals.push(new Animal('Twinky')); // ouch: cats.forEach(cat => console.log(`Cat: ${cat.name}`)); // Cat: Purry // Cat: Brutus // Cat: Twinky TypeScript allows for birds and dogs to be cats here :)\n\nFlow let cats: Array<Cat> = []; // can only contain cats let animals: Array<Animal> = []; // can only contain animals // ERROR // property `purrFactor` of Cat. Property not found in Animal cats = animals; // same ERROR animals = cats; End of story for Flow\n\nWhy? TypeScript parametric types are compatible if the type to assign from has a more special type parameter seems most intuitive allows for obviously wrong code, though\n\nFlow using generic types you can choose from invariant (exact match), covariant (more special), and contravariant (more common) Array in Flow has an invariant parametric type more expressive harder to understand\n\nAdvanced: Bounds in Generics Both Flow and TypeScript support upper, not lower bounds Both Flow and TypeScript support F-Bounded Polymorphism https://flowtype.org/blog/2015/03/12/Bounded-Polymorphism.html https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What's-new-in-TypeScript#type-parameters-as-constraints\n\nPart III: Are Flow and TypeScript like Java/C++/C#?\n\nNot really Both optionally typed / any built to match common JavaScript programming patterns type systems more expressive type inference control flow based type analysis\n\nTypeScript semantically compatible with JavaScript\n\nFlow just a checker not even a language of its own non-nullability as default\n\nStructural vs Nominal Typing Nominal Typing: types are compatibility when their declared types match\n\nStructural Typing: types are compatibility when their structures match\n\nJava, C#, C++, C all use nominal typing exclusively\n\nFlow classes are also treated as nominal types\n\nTypeScript classes are treated as structural types\n\nEverything else in both Flow and TypeScript uses structural typing\n\nNominal Typing for Flow classes class Person { name: string; } class Dog { name: string; } let dog: Dog = new Dog(); // nope, nominal type compatibility violated let person: Person = dog; // ERROR: Dog: This type is incompatible with Person // same problem let person: Person = { // ERROR: object literal: This type is incompatible with Person name: \"Olli\" };\n\nStructural Typing for TypeScript classes class Person { name: string; } class Dog { name: string; } let dog: Dog = new Dog(); // yes, correct, as structurally compatible let person: Person = dog; // same thing, also correct let person: Person = { name: \"Olli\" };\n\nStructural Typing for both TypeScript and Flow // this is fine as nominal typing only applies to Flow classes let namedObject: NamedObject = dog; // same thing, also fine let namedObject: NamedObject = { name: \"Olli\" }; // not fine in either let namedObject: NamedObject = { firstName: \"Olli\" }; // cool in flow, but TypeScript wants perfect match with object literal // ERROR: Object literal may only specify known properties, // and 'firstName' does not exist in type 'NamedObject'. let namedObject: NamedObject = { name: \"Olli\", firstName: \"Olli\" };\n\nClasses in TypeScript TypeScript has special support for classes Similar features can be found in Java/C++/C# abstract classes and methods\n\nspecial shortcut constructors (combined definition of fields and initialization)\n\ninterfaces\n\npublic, private, protected\n\ndecorators (aka Attributes in C# and Annotations in Java)\n\nreadonly properties (TypeScript 2) like in C# Flow does not feature those or any other syntactic sugar, as it is a checker only\n\nPart IV: Integrations\n\nIntegrations of raw JavaScript files\n\nTypeScript Declaration files Core Declarations come with TypeScript compiler\n\nNeeds External Type Declarations for 3rd party libraries\n\nManaged by Typings tools (typings install dt~mocha --save)\n\nWill be made obsolete by npm (npm install @types/react --save)\n\nIf there are no existing declaration files Bad luck Use allowJs option to include raw JavaScript ( introduced in 1.8) Write a dummy module declaration (vastly simplified in 2.0)\n\n3rd Party Libraries in Flow Core Declarations come with Flow Checker, includes React\n\nOther external declarations are optional\n\nExternal Flow Type Definitions\n\nby far less libraries covered than TypeScript\n\nsome libraries even come with added flow type declarations (e.g. immutable.js)\n\nDeclarations can be added to flow config files\n\nIf there are no existing declaration files: still works, but less powerful\n\nIDE Support\n\nVisual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/\n\nExcellent TypeScript support\n\nDirectly uses Language Service of TypeScript Compiler\n\nWritten in TypeScript\n\nAtom / Nuclide https://atom.io/\n\nhttps://nuclide.io/ (Atom Package)\n\nProbably best Flow support\n\nPart V: Epilogue\n\nWhy did Facebook build Flow? https://twitter.com/ReactEurope/status/763337791489146880\n\nShould I use a type checker? don't be fooled: checkers do not make your programs error free\n\nthere seems to be little or no impact on productivity\n\ninitial effort to introduce a checker is low, though (especially true for flow)\n\nbut a type system is a complex thing, it comes at a cost My recommendation if your project does not live for long: no\n\nif your project is really simple: no\n\nif there is a chance you will need to refactor the thing: yes\n\nif your system is very important or even crucial for the success of your company: yes\n\nif people enter or leave your team frequently: yes\n\nyou have substantial amount of algorithmic code: yes\n\nWhich type checker should you use?

  "latent_10433": "Verizon (NYSE: VZ) is America’s #1 mobile provider and the company just announced finalists for their international Powerful Answers Award which will grant $1 million, $500,000 and $250,000 to the top 3 winning companies in the category Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nTo break things up Verizon has created 3 categories: the two other categories in this year’s prize includes Transportation and Emergency Response with same number of finalists and prize amounts (all the 36 companies can be found here).\n\nI am the founder of one of the finalists in the IoT group with flux – a smart consumer device and software to help people anywhere grow tasty, local food on water, using hydroponics. We’ve just minted our first devices out of production so the timing couldn’t be better!\n\nSee below.\n\nWe’re like the Nest for hydroponics. Go to Home Depot for your pipes and pumps or to one of 3000 American hydroponic stores, put your flux device in the water, and pairing to our app, you are good to grow.\n\nflux simplifies all the hard parts like pH and nutrients needed to go in, so you can grow the tastiest food. Instead of facing high rates of failure, we’re there rooting for you to succeed.\n\nWe’ll be one of this year’s 12 Internet of Things finalist companies heading to San Francisco next week to pitch our product to Verizon.\n\nJust getting to this spot is our prize and vindication that Fortune 100 companies see value for their business in supporting Impact and social good companies.\n\n“The world is facing incredible challenges, but we believe that there are life-changing ideas out there that can provide answers,” said John Doherty, senior vice president of corporate development and Verizon Ventures. “Verizon wants to help find innovators who can leverage Verizon’s products and technology to help solve those problems and help turn their visions into reality.”\n\nGrowing local food using hydroponics can change realities for marginalized populations in the US, or refugees eking out a living in the Middle East. It works without soil, and isn’t dependent on climate meaning you can grow fresh food in the middle of Manhattan, in Alaska in winter, or feed refugees staying in makeshift housing with fresh food. Growing local can slow global warming, produce food with more vitamins, create jobs, and give people a deep sense of satisfaction.\n\nI’ve met mothers in Harlem like Latonya (below) who’ve told me that their kids ate chocolate bars for breakfast. After having a hydroponic farm at school (thanks to NGOs like Harlem Grown), the kid and families started to eat fresh greens every day.\n\nHydroponics is not our invention. NASA uses it to grow space lettuce. But it currently only works really well on a large, industrial scale. Current barrier to entry for every day people isn’t cost. You can set something up with $100 from Home Depot. Growing food well at home this way –– it’s about know-how. There is a lot of chemistry to get right. This is the pain that flux solves.\n\nConsider that food security is at the heart of the refugee crisis in the Middle East. Agriculture continues to be the backbone of livelihoods for the majority of people in conflict and post-conflict situations, says the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nWhy support local agriculture globally?\n\n“Rural development and food security are central to the global response to the refugee crisis. War causes hunger and hunger too, kills and forces people from their homes,” said Graziano da Silva today. “Supporting agricultural based livelihoods can contribute to both helping people stay on their land when they feel safe to do so and to create the conditions for the return of refugees, migrants and displaced people,” added Graziano da Silva.\n\nflux can help by offering a simple solution, with local partners, to get food in the hands of people in need fast.\n\nBut this story isn’t just about us. It’s about a small revolution and 11 other innovators and startups that have the power to change the world. Read below for more about the 12 Internet of Things companies that have world-impact potential. I’ve broken it up for those that like to focus on sectors: agtech, health and smart cities.\n\nVerizon picks 12 companies with Powerful Answers in IoT\n\nAgtech\n\nflux – Smart Agriculture (NY, NY – www.fluxiot.com) To assist consumers in growing food at home, especially those that live in cities, the company has developed a connected device that monitors the growth of vegetables in a hydroponic environment and determines the optimal growing recipe using a global, connected community of people growing food together. flux has also developed a fully-automated robotic system that can turn on lighting and add nutrients.\n\nFarmLink – Smart Agriculture (Kansas City, MO – www.farmlink.com) To assist farmers in improving their crop yields, the company leverage data gathered from farms nationwide and around the world to provide actionable insights on what farmers should do with their specific farming environment. Their data is gathered using a fleet of 200 connected combines taking 150 square-foot snapshots every second.\n\nFarmX – Smart Agriculature (Irvine, CA – www.farm-x.com/ )To assist farmers in improving their crop yields and lowering their water costs, the company combines low cost sensors and high altitude aerial imagery to collect real-time crop data. This data is then used to drive decisions on watering in specific locations.\n\nSmart Barn – Smart Agriculture (Kettering, OH – www.smart-barn.net) To assist farmers with the operation of their farms and monitoring of livestock, the company has developed a series of wirelessly connected equipment to monitor and control the environment condition of their facilities.\n\nChipsafer – Smart Agriculture (Montevideo, Uruguay – http://ieetech.com/) To help farmers monitor their herds of animals such as cattle for higher yield, the company has developed a wearable device that monitors animals’ behavior remotely, autonomously, and in real-time. Using analytics, the farmer can determine if an animal is sick, injured, or lost, and subsequently take remedial action.\n\nHealth\n\nAegle Arc – Connected Health (Baltimore, MD) To help monitor the senior and elderly, the company has developed a wearable pendant device that is equipped with 4G LTE and sensors that monitor ECG, respiration rate, blood oxygen levels, and temperature. Additionally, the person’s location and movement is also monitored. Should sensor data indicate that the person being monitored is experiencing a medical condition or has moved outside of a predefined geo-fence, the appropriate individuals can be contacted.\n\nAira.io – Connected Health (San Diego, CA – www.aira.io) To assist the blind with their daily lives, the company has developed a service that integrates smart glasses with the user’s smart phone such that a virtual personal assistant can help them with tasks using the assistant’s vision. Examples include navigating busy streets or reading a restaurant’s menu. The service integrates and pulls relevant information from various online sources to support the assistant in aiding the blind customer.\n\nOwlet – Connected Health (Provo, UT – https://www.owletcare.com/)To assist parents with newborns, the company has developed a connected smart sock that can monitor a newborn’s vital signs, including heart rate, breathing quality, and skin temperature. In line with the trend for the quantified self, the Owlet sock helps parents understand whether their newborns are experiencing any issues.\n\nSmart Glasses – Connected Health (London, UK –\n\nTo assist the blind in their homes, the company has developed smart glasses that allow the user to be able to live comfortably within their own home. The user can connect to and operate other smart devices in their home using hand and head gestures. And the user can navigate their home, and potentially other public buildings (e.g. airports, train stations).\n\nWound Assessment and Remote Evaluation – Connected Health (Baltimore, MD -https://www.tissue-analytics.com/) To assist individuals who have a wound, the company has developed a smart phone app that allows the injured individual to send photos and video of the wound to a central network of doctors. Combined with a cloud-based analytics platform, the doctors are able to assess the wound remotely and provide recommendations for treatment.\n\nCities\n\nCityTaps – Smart Cities (Ile de France – www.citytaps.org) To assist water utilities in collecting payment for water usage and consumers to pay for water, the company has developed a connected control metering device that connects to the water tap. This allows users to make micropayments for incremental usage of water and guarantees the utility will receive payment for the water used.\n\nZizmos Technology – Smart Cities (Palo Alto, CA – www.zizmos.com) To assist cities detect earthquakes or other seismic activity in advance of actually occurring, the company uses inexpensive MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Sensor) accelerometers attached to used or recycled smart phones that are connected to the Internet to create a low-cost seismic network that monitors earthquake hazards and provides real-time notifications of impending tremors to residents in high-risk areas for a fractional cost of the traditional seismic network.\n\nGet Social!

  "latent_10463": "In interviews on Monday, many people in the district said they were unaware of the special election. Several asked a crowd of reporters and campaign volunteers gathered outside Mr. Weprin’s campaign office what the commotion was about; invariably, they registered a blank look when told about the special election. But some registered voters found the race increasingly hard to avoid, thanks to the barrage of automated phone calls and mailings in recent days. And the race’s national implications have drawn increasing attention from the news media.\n\nIn the final hours of the race, both candidates tried to motivate residents to vote with endorsements from prominent politicians. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and former President Bill Clinton , both Democrats, recorded automated phone calls on behalf of Mr. Weprin, and the Obama re-election campaign sent its supporters text and e-mail messages on Monday asking them to help with get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Turner got help from two former New York City mayors: Edward I. Koch , a Democrat, recorded a phone message for him, and Rudolph W. Giuliani , a Republican, appeared with Mr. Turner at the Long Island Rail Road station in Forest Hills, Queens , in front of a battalion of television cameras.\n\nMr. Giuliani declared the election an opportunity to send a message to Mr. Obama, whose new jobs proposal he described as “warmed-over spit.” Mr. Giuliani compared Mr. Turner to Senator Scott Brown , a Republican who won an upset victory last year in a special election in Massachusetts , and to the Republicans elected in House races across the country last year after campaigning on the promise of cutting government spending.\n\n“The enthusiasm and the emotion is on Bob’s side — the machine politics is on the other side,” Mr. Giuliani said. “So we’re going to see which trumps the other.”\n\nPhoto\n\nBoth candidates had some stumbles as they sought to reach out to voters on Monday. Mr. Turner was turned away when he tried to campaign at a home for the elderly in Forest Hills; an administrator said the home had not been given notice of the candidate’s visit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd Mr. Weprin had trouble getting attention at the Queens Community House Rego Park Senior Center; a chair yoga class was in progress, and the candidate’s remarks were drowned out by the click-clack of shuffling mah-jongg tiles. One woman brushed past Mr. Weprin, whom she did not appear to recognize, to embrace the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn , and tell her that she would be the city’s next mayor.\n\nLater, at his campaign office above a grocery store in Forest Hills, Mr. Weprin said that more than a thousand volunteers would be on the streets in the Ninth District on Tuesday. He was joined by Jon Bauman — a k a Bowzer from the rock ’n’ roll group Sha Na Na — who rolled up his sleeves and said Mr. Weprin’s “army” would do the same.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Mr. Crowley seemed flustered when a reporter asked him why, in a heavily Democratic district, the race was so tight.\n\n“Firstly, this is, you know, it’s an interesting time,” Mr. Crowley said. “We have some very serious questions facing our nation right now, and I think that whenever there’s a special election, it’s called a special election for a reason.”\n\nOther Weprin supporters questioned the usefulness of polls in the race.",

  "latent_10587": "Queens of the Stone Age are playing a one-off Halloween concert on Friday at The Forum in Inglewood, CA, headed as ever by frontman Josh Homme.\n\nKeeping busy, Homme will also star in the final episode of series two of Toast of London, playing a love rival for Steven Toast (Matt Berry) in the comedy.\n\nSo to celebrate all things QOTSA, we've rounded up a few lesser-known facts about Josh:\n\n1. Joshua Michael Homme III was born on May 17, 1971 in Joshua Tree, California and grew up in Palm Desert, California.\n\n2. A young Josh initially wanted to play the drums, but got a guitar instead when his parents banned him from buying a drum kit. He later quipped: \"No parent will buy their 8-year-old kid drums unless they're divorced and trying to get back at their wife.\"\n\n3. Homme began playing the guitar when he was 9 years old. His unique playing style is due to his polka music lessons - he wasn't taught barre chords for the first two years and was not shown a pick until his third year of learning the guitar.\n\n4. Josh formed his first band Katzenjammer in 1987 with his school friends Brant Bjork and John Garcia. After a few name changes, they settled with the name Kyuss. They released three albums before disbanding in 1995.\n\nKyuss reformed in 2010, but Homme decided against joining the reunion. The reformed group called themselves Kyuss Lives! for their first live shows, but had to change their name to Vista Chino when recording 2013 album Peace after a lawsuit from Homme and Scott Reeder. Vista Chino split this year.\n\n5. Josh is well known for his vocal performances and guitar playing prowess, but it is a lesser-known fact that he can also play bass, piano and banjo - and yes, he now plays the drums as well.\n\n6. In 2010, Homme had unexpected medical complications due to asphyxiation while having surgery on his knee. This led him to be bed-bound for three months. He began to suffer from severe depression and considered giving up music entirely. He says surviving this experience helped him greatly when writing of Queens of the Stone Age's most recent album â€¦Like Clockwork, released last year.\n\n7. Josh Homme has a few strange pseudonyms and nicknames. When he played drums, bass, piano or keyboard on Peace, Love, Death Metal or The Desert Sessions Volumes 3 & 4, he adopted the pseudonym \"Carlo Von Sexron\". Homme is also referred to as \"Baby Duck\" by both the members of Eagles of Death Metal and his wife Brody Dalle, while his other nicknames also include \"The Ginger Elvis\", \"J.Ho\" and \"The King of Desert Rock\".\n\n8. Homme has also made his name as a producer, and was behind the desk for the majority of Arctic Monkeys' 2009 album Humbug. He also provided backing vocals for their song 'All My Own Stunts' on their fourth album Suck It and See, and vocals for 'Knee Socks' on last year's AM.\n\n9. Josh Homme got his first car when he was 14 and has never bought another. He also owns a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, but he still owns and regularly drives the silver 1967 Camaro he got in his teens.\n\n10. In 2007 Josh Homme married Brody Dalle, frontwoman of The Distillers and later Spinnerette. They have two children together: a daughter called Camille who was born in 2006, and a son called Orrin, born in 2011. Homme has his daughter's name tattooed across his heart, and his son's name tattooed next to a heart on his right hand.",
  "latent_10589": "Sure, Red Bull may have gotten a lot of attention by sponsoring Felix Baumgartner's space dive, but it's not the only beverage-maker that has made some great accomplishments possible. The Prague-based brewery Staropramen was a sponsor at the recent Webstock 2012 conference, where the folks from Robofun Create showed off this so-called Beer Keyboard built with the brewer's backing. As you can see, it's more beer than keyboard, with 40 cans of Staropramen serving as \"keys\" that just need to be gently pressed to input a letter. To make that actually work, Robofun paired an Arduino board with some capacitive controllers for the base, and connected that to a Raspberry Pi that linked the keyboard to the TV. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the keyboard has since gone missing. Head on past the break for a video.",
  "latent_10649": "Print Article\n\nHELENA  By a slim margin, the House Judiciary Committee has endorsed a bill to abolish the death penalty and replace it with life imprisonment without parole.\n\nThe panel voted 11-10 on Wednesday to send House Bill 370 to the House floor for debate.\n\nIt was a dramatic turnaround to get the bill out of House Judiciary Committee.\n\nIn every legislative session over the past decade, it was the House Judiciary Committee that tabled similar bills to abolish the death penalty. Some of the previous bills had already passed in the Senate before getting tabled in the House committee.\n\nI was shocked, said the bills sponsor, Rep. David Doc Moore, R-Missoula. I didnt expect it to come out of committee. I kind of feel Ive got a tiger by the tail here.\n\nMoore said he figures the odds of the bill passing the House are 50-50.\n\nI know everyone has their own personal beliefs on it, Moore said. I dont think that anything anyone says on the House floor during deliberations is going to sway anyone.\n\nTwo Republicans  Reps. Clayton Fiscus of Billings and Bruce Meyers of Box Elder  joined all nine Democrats to vote for HB370 in committee, while the other 10 Republicans opposed the bill.\n\nOur death penalty is a joke, Fiscus said Thursday.\n\nAfter people are sentenced to the death penalty, he said taxpayers have to spend $3 million or $4 million providing them with public defender attorneys, including one specializing in death penalty cases to say they belong in prison.\n\nAnother reason Fiscus said he voted for the bill is that life in prison without parole is worse than the death penalty for the convicted person.\n\nFiscus said he also opposes the death penalty so the state wouldnt have to worry about executing an innocent person.\n\nMeyers explained his opposition to the death penalty by saying he came from a background of having a Native American father and a mother with a Christian background.\n\nThat was part of my conscience, the way I was raised, he said. Native Americans view all life as being sacred.\n\nFrom a Christian perspective, Meyers said he prefers the New Testament, which calls for mercy and grace over the eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth philosophy of the Old Testament.\n\nMoore recounted what he said in the committee hearing about the death penalty.\n\nYouve got to decide yourself whether you personally could pull a trigger or press that button or pull the lever, he said.",
  "latent_10659": "The administration of President Donald Trump has planned to widen the appearance of America’s trade deficit, measured as total exports minus total imports, by changing the method used to calculate it.\n\nThe new calculation would count items known as “re-exports” — products first imported into the U.S. and then transferred, unchanged, to neighboring countries — as imports, but not exports. That would effectively exaggerate the deficit total, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing “people involved in the discussions.”\n\nThe value and share of re-exports in U.S. trade has grown in recent years to nearly $221.2 billion, or 14 percent of all exports, in 2014 from just over $155.9 billion, or 12 percent, in 2010, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission. Canada and Mexico received 44 percent of goods — most of which were computers, computer parts and telecommunications equipment — re-exported from the U.S. in 2014.\n\nOfficials, such as office of the U.S. Trade Representative Deputy Chief of Staff Payne Griffin, told the Journal the administration was “not even close to a decision on that yet.” Economists expressed worries that the new method would steer trade data away from a preferred level of “symmetry” in the way exports and imports are accounted for, as former Bureau of Labor Statistics Director Steve Landefeld put it in an interview with the paper.\n\nTrump has previously declared himself a lover of debt and “the king of debt,” and suggested that the U.S. should take advantage of rising bond yield rates — which come hand-in-hand with falling bond prices — to “buy back government debt at a discount,” or simply “print the money” needed to cover the deficit.\n\nThe disparity between imports and exports in 2016 rose to more than $587.3 billion in fiscal year 2016 after five straight years of decline, according to figures from the Treasury Department.\n\nTotal government debt, a cumulative measure of yearly deficit amounts — which includes government securities held by the citizens, companies, local and state governments and the Federal Reserve, along with money owed to foreign governments and beneficiaries of federal programs, such as Social Security — has been on track to reach $20 trillion.",
  "latent_10708": "Stunning picture quality\n\nThe Celestron CGEM HD series is the advanced version of the CGEM series. The telescopes of the CGEM HD series are unique in that the lens used has absolutely no chromatic aberration. The light is sent in equal frequencies to the mirrors and eyepiece, making the image sharper because of the absence of colour dispersion. Furthermore, the HD version uses mirror locks to keep the mirrors on the right spot so the image remains stable. The result is an image that is almost three times sharper than that of a standard Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. The Celestron CGEM HD series may therefore rightly be called \"HD\".\n\nCelestron CGEM 925 HD telescope\n\nThe catadioptric Celestron CGEM 925 HD telescope with equatorial mount has been ergonomically designed and has a fresh, bold and attractive appearance. The mount is suitable for astrophotography as well as for \"normal\" observations. The CGEM 925 HD comes with NexRemote software for the telescope which can be used in combination with your PC. Moreover, the telescope is easy to (dis)assemble and transport. The Celestron CGEM 925 HD telescope has a focal length of 2350mm, making it ideal for deep-sky observations.\n\nMirrors and Coating\n\nThe telescope has a primary mirror with a diameter of 235mm. The mirror features the unique Celestron Starbright coating; this coating ensures that the mirror is stronger and reflects more light. Also, it renders the surface of the mirror more even and directs the light more accurately to the secondary mirror. The coating consists of several layers: Celestron have used aluminium, titanium and magnesium.\n\nCGEM database GoTo\n\nThe database of the Celestron CGEM 925 HD telescope contains over 40,000 celestial objects including Messier objects, the Caldwell Catalog, NGC systems, nebulae and planets. A special identification feature tells you where to look, but you can also take a tour through the sky. For example: point the telescope somewhere, let it identify the Messier objects and the CGEM 925 HD will automatically show the five nearest objects; that is GoTo at its best. The GoTo is easy to operate with the included remote control which has a bright LCD display.\n\nAlignment\n\nThe Celestron CGEM 925 HD telescope also features a revolutionary alignment method: All-Star Polar Alignment. Using the software you align the telescope by selecting a bright star; alignment is possible even without seeing the North Star.\n\nSpecifications\n\nNo unwanted chromatic aberration\n\nGreat for astrophotography thanks to the superb image quality\n\nErgonomic design, easy to transport\n\n23mm Axiom LX eyepiece\n\nNexRemote software to use the telescope with your PC\n\nFull GoTo with more than 40,000 objects in the database\n\nPeriodic Error Control; permanently programmable\n\nSteel tripod\n\nEquatorial mount with tracking motor\n\nAstrophotography\n\nWith the right camera adapter and T2 ring the Celestron CGEM 925 HD is ideal for astrophotography. The stunning HD images from the telescope make photographing celestial bodies a lot of fun. Below are some images created using this telescope.",
  "latent_10789": "Canadian soccer has once again come out on the wrong end of the club vs. country conundrum.\n\nThe latest instance occurred on Monday when Canada U-20 men’s coach Rob Gale released his roster for this month’s CONCACAF U-20 Championship in Jamaica. Absent from the Canadian squad was influential midfielder and team captain Dylan Carreiro.\n\nThe Canadian coach had come to an agreement with Carreiro’s pro club, Scottish Premiership outfit Dundee, to release the Canadian for the CONCACAF tournament even though FIFA rules stipulate that teams are not required to let players go for youth tournaments.\n\nGale explained on the day Carreiro was set to fly out and join his Canadian teammates that Dundee changed its mind and decided to keep him, thus denying the Canadian coach of the services of his captain for the U-20 tournament.\n\nSPORTSNET.CA’s Soccer Central podcast, hosted by John Molinaro and James Sharman, takes an in-depth look at the beautiful game and offers timely and thoughtful analysis on the sport’s biggest issues. To listen and subscribe to the podcast, CLICK HERE\n\n“It was a very late decision. I can’t say I was best pleased with the club and the way they handled it. They ended up issuing an apology and their assistant coach ended up accepting a phone call from me and apologized. The club felt a little bit embarrassed about how they handled it,” Gale told Sportsnet.\n\nCarreiro was on loan at Arbroath in the Scottish third division before being recently recalled by Dundee, which had a hand in sealing his fate regarding the CONCACAF U-20 Championship.\n\n“We’ve tried to build relationships with the clubs for the purpose of having the best opportunity to get them when we need them. Dylan returned from his loan and I don’t think that helped our cause,” Gale said.\n\nCarreiro wasn’t the only player whose Scottish club refused to release him to play for Canada. Midfielder Fraser Aird, like Carreiro one of Canada’s brightest prospects, will remain with Glasgow Rangers in the Scottish Championship.\n\nGale contacted Rangers, but couldn’t convince them to release Aird for the CONCACAF competition.\n\n“They’re experienced players… (and) we don’t have many players playing senior football in professional environments,” Gale explained.\n\n“To lose two of them, and a character like Dylan who I’ve known since he was 10 and has been our captain, it’s a big loss. But on the same hand, it’s the reality of under-20s, and thinking long term for Canada you want guys to play first team club football so they can go on and crack the Canadian senior team. That’s the end game.”\n\nGale ended up filling the hole in the roster left by Carreiro by calling up Vancouver Whitecaps youth team member Jackson Farmer.\n\n“Jackson has come in and he gives us great cover (in defence),” Gale says. “The balance of the squad is very good, and we have attacking players who can fill in for Dylan, so we don’t need to dwell on his absence.”\n\nThe 12-team CONCACAF event, scheduled for Jan. 9-24 in Kingston and Montego Bay, will send four teams to the FIFA U-20 World Cup in New Zealand later this year.\n\nCanada has been drawn into Group B with Cuba, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras and defending CONCACAF champion Mexico.\n\nThe other pool includes Aruba, Guatemala, Jamaica, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, and the U.S.\n\nGroup winners advance to the tournament final and automatically qualify for the World Cup. The second- and third-placed teams from each group will square off in playoff games for the other two World Cup berths.\n\nCanada begins play on Jan. 10 against Haiti.\n\nCanada has not qualified for the FIFA U-20 world Cup since 2007 when it hosted the event.

  "latent_10899": "We've seen the Warriors add a player to the rotation -- David Lee -- and change the momentum of the NBA Finals. In the Cleveland locker room, some players feel the same thing could be done, according to ESPN's Brian Windhorst.\n\nThe Cavaliers bench is full of veterans who have played little to none at all this series, including Mike Miller, Shawn Marion and Kendrick Perkins. All three were rotation players on championship teams in the past decade and some Cavaliers players believe they could help, per Windhorst.\n\nGiving minutes to Perkins seems unlikely because he'd be an unmitigated disaster against the Warriors' constant small ball, without a player to guard or any real influence to make defensively. Shawn Marion makes more sense. Even with retirement pending this summer, he can be a versatile defender when he's playing his best and occasionally score a bucket, and he's \"especially itching\" to get a chance, per the report.\n\nMiller has played 14 minutes combined in Games 2, 3 and 4, taking a grand total of one three-point attempts in his time on the floor.

LUCIE — A spectacular case of poor criminal planning played out late Wednesday afternoon inside the western regional police station.A couple of boys, ages 12 and 14, tried to rob two employees behind a protective window, demanding cash, before being handcuffed at gunpoint by about a half dozen officers.\"They were either very brazen or very dumb, but I think the latter,\" Officer Robert Vega, police spokesman, said.The incident happened about 4:30 p.m. at the Rosser Boulevard station after the boys, one dressed in blue and the other red, walked through the glass doors. The 12-year-old sauntered to the records counter and then proceeded to another counter where he picked up a phone to talk to a service aide behind a protective window, demanding her money.\"Not only did he pick up the phone and say, 'Put your hands up and give me your money,' he had his hand in his jacket insinuating that he had a gun,\" Vega said.The boys each face an attempted armed robbery charge.Although only the 12-year-old demanded money, the other boy also is being charged in connection with the incident because he \"knew what was going to happen,\" Vega said.\"He was a willing participant in the entire event,\" Vega said.The 14-year-old also faces a violation of probation charge.",

  "latent_11603": "On January 25, 1905, at the Premier Mine in Pretoria, South Africa, a 3,106-carat diamond is discovered during a routine inspection by the mine’s superintendent. Weighing 1.33 pounds, and christened the “Cullinan,” it was the largest diamond ever found.\n\nFrederick Wells was 18 feet below the earth’s surface when he spotted a flash of starlight embedded in the wall just above him. His discovery was presented that same afternoon to Sir Thomas Cullinan, who owned the mine. Cullinan then sold the diamond to the Transvaal provincial government, which presented the stone to Britain’s King Edward VII as a birthday gift. Worried that the diamond might be stolen in transit from Africa to London, Edward arranged to send a phony diamond aboard a steamer ship loaded with detectives as a diversionary tactic. While the decoy slowly made its way from Africa on the ship, the Cullinan was sent to England in a plain box.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nEdward entrusted the cutting of the Cullinan to Joseph Asscher, head of the Asscher Diamond Company of Amsterdam. Asscher, who had cut the famous Excelsior Diamond, a 971-carat diamond found in 1893, studied the stone for six months before attempting the cut. On his first attempt, the steel blade broke, with no effect on the diamond. On the second attempt, the diamond shattered exactly as planned; Asscher then fainted from nervous exhaustion.\n\nThe Cullinan was later cut into nine large stones and about 100 smaller ones, valued at millions of dollars all told. The largest stone is called the “Star of Africa I,” or “Cullinan I,” and at 530 carats, it is the largest-cut fine-quality colorless diamond in the world. The second largest stone, the “Star of Africa II” or “Cullinan II,” is 317 carats. Both of these stones, as well as the “Cullinan III,” are on display in the Tower of London with Britain’s other crown jewels; the Cullinan I is mounted in the British Sovereign’s Royal Scepter, while the Cullinan II sits in the Imperial State Crown.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

  "latent_11702": "Two decades ago, the only way to book a flight was to call a travel agent, a middleman whose job was to connect you with vendors. That job is now obsolete, replaced by Internet-based services from billion-dollar companies like Priceline (PCLN), TripAdvisor (TRIP), and Expedia (EXPE).\n\nParker Conrad wants to do the same thing to health insurance. Insurance brokers, the middlemen of the $884 billion insurance industry, charge a hefty fee for connecting individuals and businesses with the insurance providers. Conrad believes that service is unnecessary in today’s world, so he built Zenefits, a software startup, to cut them out.\n\nIt has quickly caught on. Eighteen months in, Zenefits has 2000 paying clients and 450 employees. The San Francisco-based company has signed a development deal with Arizona to add 1,300 jobs there in the next three years. A June funding round worth $66 million valued the young company at $500 million. That was just six months after its previous funding round, which investors called “the hottest deal in Silicon Valley.”\n\nZenefits’ software helps small businesses manage all of their human resources functions in one place, such as health insurance, payroll, retirement funds and equity grants. The company gives its software away for free, taking a commission from vendors like insurance providers or brokerages. Zenefits is on track to double its entire revenue in the last four months of this year; monthly revenue is slated to be 20 times higher than last year’s. Conrad says he can’t grow the company fast enough to meet demand.\n\nInsurance providers have no problem with Zenefits, Conrad says, because the company sends them new clients. But the brokers—those middlemen from whom Zenefits is stealing commissions—face an obvious threat. (Zenefits is itself a licensed insurance broker.) One broker recently told the San Jose Mercury News that “every broker in the country is scared now of Zenefits.”\n\nThis week that threat manifested itself in the form of a regulatory fight: Utah has moved to ban Zenefits from offering its software for free in the state. Utah Insurance Commissioner Todd Kiser sent a letter to the company outlining the ways Zenefits is breaking the law by offering free software. Most states, including Utah, do not allow insurance brokers to offer rebates to customers to get them to buy insurance plans.\n\nUtah’s Insurance Department argues that Zenefits’ free software is a rebate, and therefore, illegal. A bulletin issued in June 2013 outlines that brokers cannot offer things like payroll services and data analysis, unless a “fair market value” fee is charged.\n\nThe state has asked Zenefits for a settlement fine of up to $97,000 with 24 months of probation, which would be waived if Zenefits began charging an acceptable fee for its software. A bulletin issued by the department in May outlines fair market value as determined by a survey of service providers in Western U.S. states. Charging a 500-person company $850 per year for full HR services is non-complaint because it is too low, the bulletin says. A more reasonable price for such services, according to the Department, adds up to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nZenefits has stopped taking on new customers in Utah but continues to support existing ones while it makes its case to the Department.\n\n“This whole thing is kind of bullshit,” Conrad tells Fortune. Other states, including Texas, Wisconsin, and Washington, have examined the Zenefits business model and decided it was legal. But Utah’s law regarding rebates is more explicit than other states, “by far,” according to a Utah state regulator who asked not to be named because the investigation is ongoing. For Zenefits to continue offering free software, it will have to get the law changed.\n\nConrad believes Utah’s commissioner Todd Kiser, who founded Kiser Insurance Agency, has been influenced by friends in the industry, and he intends to fight back. “I was picked on in middle school and one thing I learned was, if you’re dealing with a bully you’ve got to fight them and you’ve got to punch them in the face,” he says. “We’re right on the merits here.” Zenefits enlisted some high-profile friends to drum up support. Investor Marc Andreessen, whose firm led the most recent investment round in Zenefits, tweeted his support. So did actor, musician, and celebrity investor Jared Leto.\n\n1/Utah attempting to ban Zenefits = classic example of regulatory capture penalizing consumers to benefit incumbents. http://t.co/fcd52e53VR — Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) December 3, 2014\n\nI just signed this petition to tell @govherbert to save @Zenefits and innovation in Utah. You should too. http://t.co/THAQqINQTo — JARED LETO (@JaredLeto) December 3, 2014\n\nIt is ironic, according to Conrad, that a government agency designed to protect consumers would use its power to make small businesses pay for a free service. “There is something kind of Kafka-esque about it,” he says. “This is just blatant overreaching where the regulator is trying to protect brokers from competition.”\n\nConrad believes insurance brokers should build their own software to compete with Zenefits, rather than try to get it banned. “In 10 years, there’s no way companies are going to be doing this stuff with a fax machine. It’s all going to be done with software,” he says. “All of the existing brokers today are all fucked.”\n\nUpdate: Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert issued a statement regarding Zenefits that hints at a willingness to change the law:",
  "latent_11708": "MedicalResearch.com Interview with:\n\nJoseph M. Braun PhD\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nDepartment of Epidemiology in the Program in Public Health\n\nBrown University\n\nMedical Research: What is the background for this study?\n\nDr. Braun: Perfluoroalkyl substances are a class of chemicals used to produce stain/water repellent textiles, fire fighting foams, and non-stick coatings. Virtually all people in the US have measurable levels of several different perfluoroalkyl substances in their blood. There is concern that early life exposure to these chemicals can increase the risk of obesity by reducing fetal growth or promoting adipogenesis.\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n\nDr. Braun: Pregnant women in our study had perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) concentrations in their blood that were over 2-fold higher than pregnant women in the United States (median: 5.3 vs. 2.3 ng/mL) during the same time period (2003-2006).\n\nChildren born to women with higher serum PFOA concentrations during pregnancy had a higher body mass index, greater waist circumference, and more body fat at 8 years of age compared to children born to women with lower serum PFOA concentrations. In addition, children born to women with higher serum PFOA concentrations during pregnancy gained more fat mass between 2 and 8 years of age than children born to women with lower PFOA concentrations.\n\nMedical Research: What should clinicians and patients take away from your report?\n\nDr. Braun: While the majority of our exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances comes from diet, we are not sure what specific sources are most important. Thus, it is advisable to eat a balanced and healthy diet. There are several things that concerned parents or women of child-bearing age could do to reduce their perfluoroalkyl substance exposure. First they could not use stain/water repellent products or sprays.\n\nSecond, they could use a granular activated carbon water filter in their home, which is effective in removing these chemicals from drinking water. Finally, they could avoid foods that are served or cooked in paper packaging (e.g., microwave popcorn bags).\n\nMedical Research: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this study?\n\nResponse: Additional follow-up at older ages with more sophisticated measures of adiposity to determine if children with higher prenatal PFOA exposure continue to experience increased gains in body fat. In addition, additional research examining the relationship between prenatal PFOA exposure and cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., glucose homeostasis) are necessary.\n\nCitation:\n\nPrenatal perfluoroalkyl substance exposure and child adiposity at 8 years of age:\n\nThe HOME study\n\nJoseph M Braun, Aimin Chen, Megan E Romano, Antonia M Calafat, Glenys M Webster, Kimberly Yolton, Bruce P Lanphear\n\nObesity (Silver Spring, Md.).

But Owens insists that come Sunday evening, he'll have treated each of the three clashes in the same way.\n\n“I think I’ve refereed more games this week than I did the whole of last year,” joked Owens.\n\n“I did the Dewar Shield game between Pontypool and the Rhondda on Wednesday and what a game it was. The kids behaved well on the field and were polite off it.\n\n\"The two captains did a little talk, thanking the referee and these boys are just 14.\n\nPictures: The world's best referees\n\n“I had to go out and referee that game just like I will have to on Saturday. I had to go out there and do my best.\n\n“It took some refereeing because for those 30 players in the Dewar Shield, that was their European Cup final.”\n\nOwens, who will be in charge of his fourth European final this weekend, added: “The preparation was slightly different but I didn’t treat that game any differently to the way I will on Saturday.\n\n“And on Sunday I’m doing a memorial game for Jonathan Evans who sadly died in a farm accident earlier this year.\n\n“I’ll either come back straight after the match on Saturday night or early Sunday morning as I promised I would referee the game.”\n\n'It's now IMPOSSIBLE for a Welsh region to win the Champions Cup' says Gwyn Jones\n\n'I don't expect to go, if I do it's a bonus'... James Hook's startling Wales World Cup admission\n\nThe stand-out referee in northern hemisphere rugby, Owens was an obvious choice to take charge of this weekend’s final in London.\n\nIt will be the latest high profile encounter for a man who has been in the middle of some of the most memorable international clashes in recent times.\n\nAnd Owens has no doubts this weekend’s final will be comparable to a full-on international tussle.\n\n“I’m looking forward to it – I’ve never refereed a final with two French sides in it before,” he said.\n\n“I don’t think anybody can argue on Saturday that the two best sides in the competition aren’t in the final. God knows what type of game it will be but it will be a massive clash.\n\n“Hopefully it will be a great occasion. This game on Saturday will be of Test match intensity, there’s no doubt about that.\n\n“If Toulon win, it’ll be the first time any team has won it three years on the bounce and if Clermont win, it’ll be their first time.\n\n“Whatever happens on Saturday, there’ll be history made.”\n\nClermont and Toulon’s meeting in London is a re-run of the 2013 final in Dublin and regardless of the result, one of either Halfpenny or Davies is guaranteed to become only the tenth Welshman to lift Europe’s premier club competition.\n\nIt means there’ll be Welsh success of sorts with either one of Wales’ star backs in line for silverware.\n\n“It’s nice to have Welshmen involved with one on each side and a guy in the middle as well, I guess,” Owens added.\n\n“It’s a shame we don’t have a Welsh region in the final but hopefully in the next couple of years we’ll get one of them there.\n\n“For now we’ll have to make do with one on each side and the referee.”\n\nSo what chance of the three Welshman involved in the blood and thunder of a final having time for a quick joke?\n\nWell, it’s not totally off the cards, apparently.\n\n“I spoke to Leigh after the semi-final and I didn’t know then that I was doing the final,” Owens said.\n\n“He asked if I was doing it and I said I’d find out in the week.\n\n“He said 'I’ll see you at Twickenham' and I said 'I hope so'.\n\n“And I get on quite well with Jon. He said 'I’ll have a chat with you on Saturday' and I said 'make sure it’s not too much chat!'\n\n“I’m sure there’ll be times in the game where we can have a quick word but what it will be about, we’ll have to wait and see.”\n\nHalfpenny and Davies have enjoyed stellar success in the red of Wales, but both have spoken about their huge desire to translate that to club level.\n\nThe pair will be part of two all-star XV’s at Twickenham with the respective sides packed full of internationals\n\n“Leigh is one of the best full-backs in the world and I remember Jon Davies starting down at the Scarlets,” Owens said.\n\n“They are two great players at the top of their games.\n\n“But more importantly than that, they are two great people.\n\n“If any two Welshmen deserve to be in the final then it’s certainly them.\n\n“I wish them all the best and may the best team win.”",
  "latent_12025": "On the same day that Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he would attempt to revamp the war on drugs, it came to my attention that potentially more important events regarding the war on drugs were taking place in Vermont, the \"freedom and unity\" state.\n\nIt would seem that the state legislature in Vermont has voted to eliminate the war on marijuana in the state for recreational use. This is important, critically so, because all of the efforts to legalize recreational marijuana so far have been done by the processes of voter-sponsored ballot initiatives and referendums. In other words, marijuana legalization is now taking place in at least one state legislature, not just the ballot box.\n\nWhen citizens in a state vote to legalize marijuana it is an act of defiance against federal and international law. When state governments vote to legalize recreational marijuana it raises the level of defiance against federal and international law. While I personally prefer the defiance of citizens, defiance by state legislature could spread to other issues of states versus the federal government and international globalists.\n\nAttorney General Jeff sessions wants federal prosecutors to go after the \"most serious crimes with a high likelihood of conviction and long prison sentences.\" However, this could very easily apply to nonviolent drug offenses, resulting in lengthy minimum mandatory sentences for large numbers of people.\n\nThe attorney general argues that this approach is necessary to be tough on crime and to ensure legal justice.\n\nOpponents argue that the tougher approach will result in many ruined lives, targeting and racial profiling, and would greatly reduce legal justice.\n\nProponents prefer the tough on crime, war on drugs approach, and a roll back of the state legalization measures. Prominently, this group includes such industries as the corporate for-profit prison industry, the alcohol and tobacco industry, and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThe attorney general's \"thinking\" seems to be based on the old gateway theory of drugs. This theory argues that smoking marijuana will lead to heroin addiction, insanity, violent crime, and death. From this perspective, a crackdown on drugs and opposing the state legalization of marijuana movement would somehow address the heroin and opioid addiction/overdose epidemic.\n\nThe gateway theory of drugs has overwhelmingly been debunked by all of the relevant scientific disciplines which have studied it, including medicine, biology, and psychiatry. Statistically, the only connection between marijuana use and heroin addiction is the war on drugs itself. In other words somebody who obtains marijuana in the black market is statistically more likely to later purchase harder drugs in the black market than they were exposed to because of the war on marijuana.\n\nThe only significant connection between marijuana and heroin addiction to my knowledge is that marijuana is considered by many to be a helpful component for overcoming heroin addiction. Marijuana helps addicts deal with the pain, nausea, anxiety, poor appetite, etc. The fact that heroin and opioid overdose deaths have declined in states that have legalized marijuana supports this contention. Legalization states have also seen a decline in the number of prescriptions written for dangerous painkillers and psychiatric drugs.\n\nAttorney General Sessions's announcement can clearly be seen for what it is: a rear guard action in the war on drugs. Such actions take place when circumstances of time and place creates an opportunity to stall an invading force. An example of a rear guard action would be the German military during World War II. Once defeat was obvious the German military retreated out of North Africa and Italy, but occasionally would stop and fight from a defensive position. The purpose of such fighting is not to win a battle or war, but rather to allow more time to evacuate troops and equipment safely.\n\nIt is not clear that the Trump administration has the time or even interest in fighting the war on drugs. In fact, the president's budget called for a 90% cut in the White House office of drug policy, that is, the drug czar. As in so many other areas, the Trump administration has created great uncertainty with respect to its policy agenda.\n\nThere are two things for which there is a good deal of certainty. The first is that the American people support repealing marijuana prohibition, both for recreational use as well as medical uses. A growing number of Americans support reforming prohibition of harder drugs as well. Given demographic factors the percentage of Americans supporting such reforms will continue to grow in the future.\n\nThe second thing that is quite certain is that state legislatures will be necessary to ensure that marijuana legalization goes nationwide. This is because many states do not have voter sponsored ballot initiatives and most of the ones that do have already voted. Otherwise we would need federal action to repeal marijuana prohibition or a federal judicial decision that would uproot marijuana prohibition.\n\nIn the meantime, let us thank our friends in Vermont and let us hope that their freedom-and-unity message and their live-free-or-die mentality is an inspiration to Americans across the country.",

We want to bring it back to where it began, recognizing the game, the community, and the people we’ve met along the way. Our goal is to bring people together, and we plan on doing that via the love of the game and the community that brought us all here. No one’s going to shift a community on their own, nor should they ever expect to, but we do know that one small act can make a monumental impact on the people around it.\n\nWe hope that by participating in this event, you can be inspired to help make a difference as well.\n\nWhy Orlando?\n\nWe chose to host Impact 2016 in Orlando because of its extremely dedicated and passionate Smash scene as well as the extent of amazing venues like the one we found. After we began work on the project in early February, it was announced that a separate charity event, Smash the Record , would be making its return to Orlando as well. We of course hope to reduce any potential confusion between our two events, and we think you’ll agree that what we’re doing is very different in style and presentation from any charity events you’ve seen in the past.\n\nThe major focus of Impact 2016 is very much the central tournaments and the hype and high-level play that result from a full national experience. Whether you’re able to personally support the cause or just want to watch some hype matches, Impact 2016 will have everything you’ve come to love and expect about Smash both for the viewers and players in attendance.\n\nWhen can I find out more?\n\nWe’ll be posting more information in the coming months as we near the event, both here on Melee It On Me and on GameSavers.org .

The Navy flies the seriously ill to military hospitals in the U.S. Navy personnel have converted former nurses’ quarters at the base hospital into a 24-hour assisted-living facility. Government drivers transport the Cuban exiles to doctor appointments, exercise classes, McDonald’s and the all-in-one base store, the Navy Exchange.\n\n“At the time, the Navy offered them safe haven, and we said, ‘Hey, you’re welcome to stay here until this gets resolved,’ ” said the base commander, Navy Capt. John Nettleton. “And here we are half a century later, and they’re still here.”\n\nWith few exceptions, they have never returned home. Many have made their way to the U.S. But a core group chose to stay, even though they acquired U.S. citizenship or residency. The U.S. Navy provides them free housing, utilities and medical care, along with subsidized meals at base mess halls.\n\n“I thought I was only going to be here for six months,” said Mr. Baudin’s neighbor Noel West, 81 years old.\n\nThe ill are treated at the Navy hospital, and the dead buried by the beach in the base cemetery, alongside sailors and Marines who perished in the tropics 100 years ago.\n\nRamon Baudin, 92 years old, is one of the oldest of the 23 Cuban exiles living at the U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\n\nRamon Baudin, 92 years old, is one of the oldest of the 23 Cuban exiles living at the U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. Photo: Brandon Thibodeaux for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFor more than 50 years, the exiles have waited out Mr. Castro, circumscribed by a 17-mile razor-wire fence that separates their present from their past. They have married and divorced, had jobs and children. They have danced at base clubs and drunk at base bars. They play dominoes and listen to singer Celia Cruz. They have also seen their adopted home become synonymous with prisoner abuse since the U.S. housed nearly 800 terror suspects here .\n\nMr. Baudin has been here ever since, part of a small group of Cuban exiles who, in a hot moment of the Cold War, won permission from the U.S. government to stay at the Guantanamo Bay Naval base until Cuba was free.\n\nNAVAL STATION GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba—In 1961, Ramon Baudin got wind that Fidel Castro’s security forces were looking for him. He hid in a bus headed to this U.S. military base, sneaked past a police checkpoint, then pleaded with the American sentry: “Hey, buddy, I’m running away. Open the gate.”\n\nIn the early 1960s, hundreds of anti-Castro Cubans took refuge on the U.S. Naval base in Guantanamo Bay. Half a century later, two dozen of them still live here. Photo: Brandon Thibodeaux for The Wall Street Journal\n\nU.S. troops landed at Guantanamo Bay during the Spanish-American War of 1898, and in their victory over Spain signed a perpetual lease that can only be canceled by mutual agreement between Havana and Washington.\n\nThousands of Cubans once commuted to base jobs. But relations with the U.S. soured quickly after Mr. Castro seized power in 1959, with the countries severing diplomatic ties in 1961.\n\nThe Guantanamo Cubans have been buffeted by the long conflict between the U.S. and Cuba, as well as the personal decisions they made long ago. When Washington and Havana were inches from war in the 1960s, the exiles found shelter on the base but gave up their homes and families.\n\nNow that President Barack Obama has decided to normalize relations with Cuba, their fate is again up in the air. The Navy is unsure whether the easing of tensions means the exiles will have to move out.\n\nFor now, the Guantanamo Cubans are staying put, accustomed to the narrow but easy life on the military base, and skeptical that warmer ties with the U.S. means the Cuban regime would treat them well if they returned home.\n\n“It’s kind of early,” said exile Ramon Romero, who took refuge on the base in 1960, at age 17. “You can never trust Castro because he can say one thing and turn around and do another thing.”\n\nAt 92, Mr. Baudin is one of the oldest of the 23 Cubans—known officially as special category residents—remaining on the base.\n\nHe says he isn’t homesick. But every day after the sun comes up, he settles into a white plastic chair under the roof of his carport and switches on a portable radio. Despite a broken antenna, it picks up a station from Caimanera, a town just outside of the barbed wire. Between news broadcasts and fast-paced guarachas, he listens for obituaries of long-lost friends.\n\n“I can’t go there anymore,” he said of Caimanera, drawing a finger across his throat. “They’d kill me.”\n\nA Cuban government spokesman in Washington didn’t return calls or emails seeking comment on whether the exiles would face legal or political peril if they returned home.\n\nMr. Baudin took refuge on the base when Cold War tension was aggravated by the botched 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban missile crisis a year later.\n\nMr. Baudin was engaged to a woman in Caimanera when he learned that regime security men were after him. He never had a chance to explain his disappearance. He heard she married a milkman.\n\nCarmen Gonzalez fled to the U.S. Naval base on Guantanamo Bay with her mother in 1964. She married, had a daughter, became a widow and grew old all while living within the confines of the 45-square-mile military facility. Photo: Brandon Thibodeaux for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFor work, Mr. Baudin was a caddie on the base golf course, then spent decades pressing uniforms in the laundry. He remembers good times with his Cuban friends here, fishing in the bay and drinking rum on the beach.\n\nMost of them are dead now. Mr. Baudin wakes at about 3:30 each morning and meditates. Then, before dawn, he walks the streets, talking, he says, with the ghosts of his fellow exiles: He sees Gustaff Polica, who raised two children on Guantanamo and whose body is buried in the hills. He spots a woman in white who went home to Cuba to die with her family after decades at Guantanamo.\n\n“I pray for my dead friends,” Mr. Baudin said. “They’re by my side. They watch over me.”\n\nMost of the Cubans live in a neighborhood of flat-roofed concrete houses built in 1960, their pastel blues and greens faded by the sun. From his window across the way, Mr. Romero often watches Mr. Baudin pass under a streetlight on his predawn walk.\n\nAs a boy, Mr. Romero accompanied his grandfather on a 30-foot banana boat, steering it along the shore. They stopped at the base each day to sell fruits and vegetables.\n\nBy 1960, the family’s standing with the Castro government had become precarious. Two of Mr. Romero’s cousins had been killed, and another was languishing in prison, he said.\n\nA home in the neighborhood where most of the 23 remaining Cuban exiles live. Photo: Brandon Thibodeaux for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Romero’s grandfather, who cared for the boy, sent Mr. Romero to live on the base. “My grandfather said, ‘Stay here, otherwise you’ll be in jail or dead,’ ” Mr. Romero, now 71, recalled. “So I’ve been here ever since.”\n\nMr. Romero at first cried himself to sleep on the boat’s wooden seats. He eventually lived with a teacher from the base school, and then with the man who ran the lighthouse. Over the years, Mr. Romero worked as a janitor, firefighter and heavy-equipment operator. His favorite job was running and fixing the projector at the open-air base theater, the Lyceum. He retired with a small pension in 1998.\n\nHe built a dock among the mangroves behind his house and spends hours on a pontoon boat fishing for mackerel and downing cans of Miller Lite. He shies away from other exiles, wary of gossip. “I like to be by myself,” he said.\n\nCapt. Nettleton worries what will become of the Cubans as they grow infirm. One exile was flown to the U.S. for dialysis. “I don’t envision us forcing them to go and leave the island, because of the commitment we previously made to them,” the captain said. “But it may come to that.”\n\nNavy officials can’t find the documents that laid out the Kennedy administration’s original promise. The broad outlines have been passed down from one base commander to the next, reinforced by a 2006 law authorizing the Navy to “provide for the general welfare, including subsistence, housing, and health care” of the Cuban residents.\n\nLife in Pre- and Post-Cold War Guantanamo Bay The gate separating the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay from the Cuban side, probably in the 1950s.

He now shares a room with his third wife in the assisted-living facility the Navy built to care for the aging Cubans.\n\nHis wife, Felicita Gayle, is 95 years old. Her health troubles require round-the-clock aides. “She put light back in my life when my life was dim,” said Mr. Gayle, who is 80.\n\nHe works off his stress at Zumba classes in the base gym. An energetic Spanish-speaking instructor leads the exiles—one of them is in a wheelchair—in dance moves to the song, “I’m Sexy and I Know It.”\n\nMr. Gayle thinks often of the 3-year-old son he left behind when he fled Cuba. His son later joined the Cuban army and fought in Angola when Mr. Castro intervened to support the leftist government there.\n\n“If Cuba is free and I die here, bury me over there,” Mr. Gayle said. “As long as Cuba isn’t free, bury me here.”\n\nPhillip Gayle says the Castro regime pressed him to spy on the U.S. Instead he took refuge on the Naval base on Guantanamo Bay in 1965. Photo: Brandon Thibodeaux for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Naval cemetery is set amid underground ammunition bunkers. Among the hundreds of white-marble gravestones are 21 with the words “Cuban Exile” engraved beneath the names.\n\nThe U.S. continues to write the Cuban government an annual rent check of $4,085 for use of the base, a figure set in 1934. Each year, Havana signals its disapproval of the U.S. presence by refusing to cash it.\n\nAt one point in the 1960s, the Castro regime planted a wall of prickly plants to stop Cubans from seeking refuge on the base. The Americans dubbed it the Cactus Curtain.\n\nIn 1964, the Castro regime cut off water and power to the base. In response, President Lyndon B. Johnson dismissed most of the Cubans who commuted onto the facility. By that time, hundreds of Cubans—opponents of the Castro government—had already secured the Navy’s permission to live on the base indefinitely.\n\nBy 1987, the number of Cuban exiles on the base had dropped to 80. Today, there are 28 special category residents, including five Jamaicans who had won the status through marriage to exiled Cubans.\n\nCapt. Nettleton estimates the Navy spends about $200,000 a year on salaries for civilian aides who assist the elderly Cubans. The Navy said it had no estimate of the cost of providing housing, utilities, medical care and other services for the exiles.\n\nCuban exiles gather for a prayer inside the Cuban Community Center on the base. Photo: Brandon Thibodeaux for The Wall Street Journal\n\nGloria Martinez, an 81-year-old cancer survivor, said she has stayed on the base in part because of the promise of lifetime care. Her late husband was a Cuban army sergeant in the 1950s who fought against insurgents led by Raúl Castro, Fidel Castro’s brother and now Cuba’s president.\n\nIn 1959, Ms. Martinez’s husband, Eduardo Martinez, got a job helping build the base bowling alley. Each night he returned to the Cuban side of the fence.\n\nAs the Castro regime cracked down on opponents, the couple’s house was repeatedly searched, Ms. Martinez recalled. She kept two hand grenades hidden in the house and said she had planned to use them if her husband ever faced a firing squad. She sealed her husband’s army medals in a jar and buried them under the patio.\n\n“I told my husband they were looking for him, and he was never to come back to our home,” Ms. Martinez said.\n\nOne day in 1961, Mr. Martinez went to work on the base—and stayed. Ms. Martinez remained behind for a short time before making her own move. She glued her photo onto someone else’s ID card and headed to the base, repeating her fake name to herself: Jorgelina, Jorgelina.

Photo: Brandon Thibodeaux for The Wall Street Journal\n\nAt a checkpoint, she recalled, the Cuban guard asked her name. Her mind went blank and she held up the ID card. “Ah, Jorgelina,” the guard said.\n\nThat was the last time she set foot on the Cuban side, she said. On the base she worked giving haircuts to Marines.\n\nTheir two children, now in their 40s and living in the U.S., were born on the base. Her husband died in 1988. When she fell ill with kidney cancer the following year, she was treated at a U.S. military hospital in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt the time, she worried if she moved to the U.S. she would lose her subsidized health care. Mostly, she said, she doesn’t want to leave Cuba, whose mountains are visible from her window. She has sisters living in Guantanamo City, an hour’s drive from her house, if such a drive were ever permitted.\n\n“I’m close to my family here,” she said, “even though I don’t see them.”",
  "latent_12465": "The \"grown-ups\" of the Abbott government were big on rhetoric but not so big on delivery when it came to reducing the debt. Freelance journalist Alan Austin runs the numbers.\n\nFigures released Friday night on Australia’s finances are grim reading for anyone seeking respite for the embattled Abbott government. The Coalition that promised in 2012 to reduce Australia’s debt by $30 billion delivered in 2014 an increase of more than $60 billion. Clearly Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Treasurer Joe Hockey have failed spectacularly to reduce Labor’s \"skyrocketing debt\". Outcomes for the full calendar year 2014 are now online at the Finance Department’s website . Commonwealth monthly financial statements show year-to-date net debt and the projection for the full financial year. Hence it is simple to calculate the debt incurred -- or repaid -- each month. Australia’s net government debt -- that is, money borrowed minus money loaned out -- was $239.16 billion at the end of December . This was a hefty increase over the level a month earlier of $224.35 billion. In just one month, the debt rose almost $15 billion, or 6.6%. Compounded, that rate would double the debt in less than a year. Fortunately, the December rise was abnormal. So what was the full-year increase through 2014? At the end of 2013 , the actual net debt was $177.74 billion. Hence the increase over the full year was $61.42 billion ($239.16 - $177.74). That’s a rise of 34.6%. That December 2013 actual figure is pretty close to the level that can reasonably be attributed to Labor. As Crikey explained last October, the best measure of Labor’s debt is the projection for the end of the full year 2013-14 at the September 2013 election. At that time, projected debt at year end was $178.1 billion, although actual debt then was marginally lower. That year-end projection of $178.1 billion was affirmed in Finance’s statements for October and November 2013. It did not shift until well after Joe Hockey had taken control of the levers. So is it possible that debt has peaked and will soon tumble, as promised? No -- Friday’s figures also show a higher estimate for total debt at year end, still six months away. This is now projected to be $244.84 billion. If $178.1 billion is the debt level attributable to Labor, then it can be argued that by the end of this financial year the Coalition will have blown out Labor’s debt by $66.7 billion ($244.8 billion to $178.1 billion) or 37.5%. In one budget. This gets extremely uncomfortable for Abbott, Hockey and their backers when pre-election promises are recalled. Abbott told the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry just a year before the election that the Coalition had “identified $50 billion of savings, for an $11 billion improvement in the budget bottom line and a reduction of $30 billion in net debt”. Had that claim been realistic, the projection for this year would be $148.1 billion ($178.1 billion minus $30 billion), instead of $244.84 billion (assuming the debt reduction could be effected in the first full year, which might not have been the intention). Of course, this debt increase is not of any immediate economic concern. A case can be made that Australia’s borrowings in recent years have been much too low given negative real interest rates and the need for investments in productive infrastructure. Australia’s net debt is only about 15% of its gross domestic product, even with the recent surge under the Coalition. That is well below levels in Switzerland, Canada, Germany and the UK -- all of which have triple-A credit ratings and no problem. Where burgeoning borrowings will impact taxpayers is in the interest payable. Before the election, Abbott told the Economic and Social Outlook Conference in Melbourne that the Gillard government was “spending about $20 million a day just to pay the interest on what it has already borrowed”. The bill now? Friday’s report shows interest paid in December was $1.217 billion for the month, which is $39.3 million per day. How likely, then, are continuing debt blow-outs and further interest increases? Friday’s Finance report reveals that the deficit in the underlying cash balance in December was $98 million worse than estimated in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, released only last month. It attributes this to “higher than expected cash payments”. The December fiscal balance was also worse than predicted just a month ago by $765 million. This, the report said, “is largely due to lower than expected revenue”. If declining revenues and increasing outlays continue, greater debt must be the result. With the government now under unprecedented pressure, can Hockey effect the drastic measures needed to turn this around? If he can, he deserves a knighthood.",

  "latent_12572": "If you’re following my blog on a regular basis, you’ve probably read some of my articles on Docker in combination with vRealize Automation (here and here). As a next step in this series, I thought it would be nice to automate the deployment of a Docker swarm. Docker swarm mode allows you to create a cluster of one or more Docker engines. A swarm consists of one or more nodes: physical or virtual machines that run the Docker engine.\n\nIn a Docker swarm there are two types of nodes: manager and workers nodes. A manager node maintains the cluster state, runs the scheduling service and serves as a HTTP API endpoint. Worker nodes have the purpose of running containers.\n\nA typical Docker swarm consists of 3, 5 or 7 manager nodes (other configurations are possible but not advised) and an amount of workers nodes depending on the required capacity.\n\nDeploying a Docker swarm involves installing a master node (this is the first manager node) and installing additional master and workes nodes. I’m using vRealize Automation to automatically deploy the swarm, let’s have a closer look on what you will need for this.\n\nFirst of all we need host virtual machines to will run the docker engine, in this example I will use CentOS for this. The CentOS VM needs the vRA guest agent (gugent) installed: there are numerous articles available on how to do this.\n\nThe general installation workflow will look like this:\n\nDeploy the VMs; Configure the Docker-CE yum repository; Install the Docker engine; Configure the Docker swarm master; Configure additional manager and worker nodes;\n\nOk, let’s have a look at the required scripts. The first script (and thus software component) adds the Docker-CE yum repository:\n\n#Install yum utils /usr/bin/yum install -y yum-utils #add docker repository /usr/bin/yum-config-manager -y --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo #refresh yum repo and install docker engine /usr/bin/yum makecache fast -y\n\nThe second script installs the Docker-CE engine:\n\n#!/bin/bash #Install docker-ce /usr/bin/yum -y install docker-ce #configure docker service /usr/bin/systemctl enable docker /usr/bin/systemctl start docker\n\nThe following script configures the first Docker swarm manager:\n\n#!/bin/bash docker swarm init --advertise-addr $(hostname -i):$swarmPort --listen-addr $(hostname -i):$swarmPort tokenManager=`docker swarm join-token manager -q` tokenWorker=`docker swarm join-token worker -q`\n\nTo successfully add additional manager and workers we’ll need a token. This token is used in the docker swarm join command on the additional nodes. The tokens are stored in a property that’s part of the vRA blueprint.\n\nNow the scripts to additional nodes, for the additional managers we’ll use:\n\n#!/bin/bash docker swarm join --token $tokenManager $masterIp:$swarmPort --advertise-addr $(hostname -i):$swarmPort --listen-addr $(hostname -i):$swarmPort\n\nAnd for the additional workers:\n\n#!/bin/bash docker swarm join --token $tokenWorker $masterIp:$swarmPort --advertise-addr $(hostname -i):$swarmPort --listen-addr $(hostname -i):$swarmPort\n\nAll the scripts and required virtual machines come together in the following blueprint:\n\nWe can do an actual request of Docker swarm as a service:\n\nAfter the request has been submitted, the required steps are executed automatically. It will take about 15 minutes to deploy a Docker swarm cluster:\n\nA docker node ls will get you an overview of the available nodes in the swarm.\n\ndocker node ls ID HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS 4cawkudzpqnaqmomu6ghxq0r5 dockerhost-055 Ready Active 6s0lu1qh11pk1soxt0dtk4yyq dockerhost-050 Ready Active c42b6i6qbfok8ai7phy7hl0j9 dockerhost-048 Ready Active Reachable ks4bbmxvvt4b7427gbq1n8shg dockerhost-052 Ready Active lqxj4cynhx9lotaq1h81fzyzy * dockerhost-051 Ready Active Leader tm5jpt4fwwy9wocrr1ru3go0a dockerhost-054 Ready Active weskqky69dr3z5q2rslyw7zef dockerhost-053 Ready Active xmcijogmk6kql5e92kr8rb6bx dockerhost-049 Ready Active Reachable\n\nThat’s it for now.

  "latent_12656": "Photo\n\nWhen my 3-year-old daughter told me that she needed something special for Share Day at camp — a sari and a candle dish used for Diwali, the Hindu New Year — I felt surprised and thrilled, and maybe even a little envious. Her pleasure in wearing Indian clothes and celebrating holidays as a young child is very different from what I experienced in my own childhood.\n\nWhen my family and I emigrated in 1977, we didn’t yet know what it meant to be Indian-American. I was raised in upstate New York, among only a handful of South Asian-Americans. As a kid I desperately sought to fit in with the dominant Caucasian community, yet my obviously different name, identity, culture, religion and dark skin made that impossible.\n\nOne January afternoon, I came home from kindergarten sobbing: The other kids said I was a “bad girl” because Santa hadn’t brought me any presents. A belated Christmas arrived that weekend, launching my Hindu family’s annual secular celebration so I could feel as though I belonged. Yet I still had questions. When I was 10, I looked for Santa Claus in the Bible. When I asked where he was mentioned, the school librarian’s aide called me a “heathen” in front of my entire class. I had to look up that word in the dictionary.\n\nWhile I embraced carols, made gifts for teachers and tried to learn about their religious backgrounds, that understanding was never reciprocated. No one asked questions about my family’s religious beliefs or cultural traditions. It never occurred to me to take a day off for Diwali or celebrate it in school. Instead my family shifted our potluck and puja to the nearest convenient weekend, and we celebrated invisibly.\n\nOn the playground, children slung the word “Gandhi” like a slur and made buzzing sounds near me, as if my “curry stench” was attracting flies. To defend myself, I asked my parents for bologna sandwiches on white bread, which I didn’t actually like, and begged my mother to wear pants instead of saris or salwaar kameezes when she picked me up from school. One weekend on a family vacation, I told a girl whom I’d just met that my name was Sarah, not the hard to pronounce Swati. It wasn’t until college, in New York City, that I finally blended in, and felt like myself. Through my new friendships with fellow immigrants, I discovered ways to keep my cultural identity while questioning its traditional assumptions and restrictions. I reclaimed the identity I’d shunned as a child.\n\nNow, this Diwali, I am heartened by how my daughter embraces her Indian-American heritage and by how different my daughter’s America is from mine. Diwali is celebrated at the White House. The television show “The Office” had an entire episode dedicated to Diwali where the non-Indian characters were more knowledgeable than the clueless Indian one played by Mindy Kaling, the writer and actress. And (in true recognition) Diwali has been placed on the coveted New York City Alternate Side Parking calendar.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe changes are also evident in my home. My daughter’s excitement about saris ignited when I read aloud “Mama’s Saris” by Pooja Makhijani — a picture book that my mother had bought me when I was pregnant. In the book, a young girl who is turning 7 is desperate to wear one of her mother’s gorgeous saris, and goes through her mother’s suitcase, remembering the different occasions on which she wore them.\n\nLast year, I asked my daughter’s teachers if we could do a Diwali project. I snipped colored file folders into the traditional shape of candle dishes and made folding tabs to represent the tiny flames that, in India, are ubiquitous during the Festival of Lights. The kids colored the card-stock candle dishes and then took home their Diwali pop-up cards, carrying the conversation into a few dozen Bronx households.\n\nWe are celebrating Diwali at her school again this year. At my daughter’s request, we will do “an art project: saris for my friends to play with, bindis to try on, and then we’ll read the book ‘Mama’s Saris.’” In her preschool, there is room for Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Eid and Diwali — which sounds like an America where there is room for us.",

They have been a great help for us.\n\nAbout bloom BABY Sensitive Wipes\n\nBabies have extremely sensitive skin; between weather, products and even touch, their skins are prone to rashes, acne and eczema. With the human skin being the body’s largest organ, it’s imperative we care for it and understand how outside factors affect it. We took the pure joy of babyhood and made a baby wipe. We started with natural fibers and the purest water we could find (from a glacier!), and then infused it with plant-derived vitamins to nourish baby’s sensitive skin.

  "latent_13079": "What did Historical Swords Weigh? By J. Clements \"never overlay thy selfe with a heavy weapon, for nimblenesse of bodie, and nimblenesse of weapon are two chief helpes for thy advantage\" - Joseph Swetnam, The Schoole of the Noble and Worthy Science of Defence, 1617 Just how heavy were swords from the Middle Ages and Renaissance? This question (perhaps the most commonly encountered in this subject) is easily answered by knowledgeable students of the subject. While understanding of the true weights of Medieval and Renaissance swords is appreciated by serious enthusiasts and practitioners of historical fencing today, in contrast the general public and even specialists are often woefully ignorant on the matter. Finding accurate information on what real historical swords actually weighed can sometimes be difficult, making efforts to convince skeptics and the uninformed a considerable challenge. A Weighty Issue Erroneous statements about the weight of Medieval and Renaissance swords are unfortunately common. It is an issue of the most habitual misinformation and misstatement. This should come as no surprise given the misrepresentation Medieval and Renaissance swordplay continually receives in popular media. Everywhere from television and movies to video games, historical European swords have been depicted as being cumbersome and displayed with wide, exaggerated movements. On a recent national television appearance on The History Channel, one respected academic and expert on medieval military technology even declared with conviction how 14th century swords were \"heavy\" sometimes weighing as much as \"40 pounds\" (!). From ordinary hands-on experience we know full well that swords were not excessively heavy nor did they weigh 10 or 15 pounds and more. There is only so many ways we can repeat how these weapons were not at all heavy or ungainly. Remarkably, while one would think a crucial piece of information as the weight of swords would be of great interest to arms curators and arms historians, there is no major reference book that actually lists the weights of different types. Perhaps this vacuum of documented evidence is part of the very problem surrounding the issue. However, there are a few respected sources that do give some valuable statistics. For example, the lengthy catalog of swords from the famed Wallace Collection Museum in London readily lists dozens of fine specimens among which it is difficult to find any weighing in excess of 4 pounds. Indeed, the majority of specimens, from arming swords to two-handers to rapiers, weigh much less than three pounds. The late Ewart Oakeshott. Despite frequent claims to the contrary, Medieval swords were indeed light, manageable, and on average weighed less than four pounds. As leading sword expert Ewart Oakeshott unequivocally stated: \"Medieval Swords are neither unwieldably heavy nor all alike - the average weight of any one of normal size is between 2.5 lb. and 3.5 lbs. Even the big hand-and-a-half 'war' swords rarely weigh more than 4.5 lbs. Such weights, to men who were trained to use the sword from the age of seven (and who had to be tough specimens to survive that age) , were by no means too great to be practical.\"(Oakeshott, Sword in Hand, p. 13). Oakeshott, the 20th century's leading author and researcher of European swords would certainly know. He had handled thousands of swords in his lifetime and at one time or another personally owned dozens of the finest examples ranging from the Bronze Age to the 19th century. Medieval swords in general were well-made, light, agile fighting weapons equally capable of delivering dismembering cuts or cleaving deep cavities into the body. They were far from the clumsy, heavy things they're often portrayed as in popular media and far, far more than a mere \"club with edges.\" As another source on arms affirmed: \"the sword was, in fact, surprisingly light·.the average weight of swords from the 10th to the 15th centuries was 1.3 kg, while in the 16th century it was 0.9 kg. Even the heavier bastard swords which were used only by second-grade fighting men did not exceed 1.6 kg, while the horse swords known as 'hand-and-a-half' swords weighed 1.8 kg on average. When due allowances are made, these surprisingly low figures also hold good for the enormous two-hand sword, which was traditionally only wielded by 'true Hercules.' Yet it seldom weighed more than 3 kg.\" (Funcken, Arms, Part 3, p. 26). Starting in the 16th century there were of course special parade or bearing swords that did weigh up to 8 or 9 pounds and more, however these monstrous show pieces were not fighting weapons and there is no evidence they were ever intended for use in any type of combat. Indeed, it would not make sense given that there were other far more maneuverable combat models available which were several pounds lighter. Dr. Hans-Peter Hils in his 1985 dissertation on the work of the great 14th century master Johannes Liechtenauer noted that since the 19th century many arms museum collections typically feature immense parade or bearing greatswords as if they were actual combat weapons ignoring the fact they are not only blunt edged, but of impractical size and weight as well as poorly balanced for effective use. (Hils, p. 269-286). Expert Opinions The belief that Medieval swords were lumbering or unwieldy to use has virtually taken on the guise of urban folklore and still perplexes those of us who today exercise with such weapons regularly. It is even something of a challenge to try to find a 19th (and even 20th) century fencing author (and even arms historian) who does not unequivocally declare in their writings that Medieval swords were \"heavy\", \"cumbersome\", \"unwieldy\", \"clumsy\", and (in a complete misunderstanding of the handling, purpose, and application of such diverse weapons) were designed only for \"offense.\" Despite the measurable facts, many are convinced today that these large swords simply are, or even have to be, exceptionally heavy. The view is not one limited to modern times. For example, Thomas Page's otherwise unremarkable 1746 military fencing booklet, The Use of the Broad Sword, exclaimed nonsense about earlier swords that became largely accepted as fact in the 19th (and 20th) century. Revealing something of how much things in that period had changed from earlier skills and knowledge of martial fencing, declared how their: \"Form was rude, and their use without Method. They were the Instruments of Strength, not the Weapons or Art. The Sword was enormous length and breadth, heavy and unwieldy, design'd only for right down chopping by the Force of a strong Arm.\" (Page, p. A3). Page's views were not uncommon among fencers then use to featherweight smallswords and the occasional saber and short cutlass. In the early 1870s, Army Captain M. J. O'Rourke, a little-known Irish-American historian and teacher of the sword, in referring to earlier weapons described them as those \"ponderous blades, in wielding which they required all the strength of both [hands].\" We might also recall pioneer historical-fencing researcher Egerton Castle 's notorious comment about the \"clumsy old fashioned sword.\" (Castle, Schools and Masters of Defence, p. 20 & 22).\n\nWielding a beautiful specimen of a real 14th century arming sword in order to see how it plays and handles. Quite frequently, some well-meaning academician or elderly curator trained in art history who is not an athlete, not a martial artist, and has not trained in handling historical arms since childhood will declare with authority that a knightly sword is \"heavy.\" The same sword properly wielded in well-conditioned hands will typically be found light, well-balanced, and agile. For example, noted British arms curator Charles Ffoulkes in 1938 declared: \"The so-called 'Crusader' sword is heavy, broad-bladed, and short gripped. There is no balance, as the word is understood in swordsmanship, and to thrust with it is an impossibility·its weight made swift recovery impossible.\" (Ffoulkes, p.29-30). Ffoulkes' opinion, wholly without merit yet shared by his military co-author Captain Hopkinson, was derived from his understanding of what could be done only with sporting tools in polite contests. Ffoulkes was no doubt basing his opinion on his understanding of contemporary fencing as conducted with the featherweight foils, epees, and duelling sabers of the modern sport (in the same way a tennis racket might feel \"heavy\" to a ping pong player). Sadly, Ffoulkes in 1945 even stated, \"All the swords from the ninth to the thirteenth century are heavy, ill-balanced, and are furnished with a short and unpractical grip.\" (Ffoulkes, Arms, p. 17). Imagine that, 500 years of professional warriors and fighting men had all gotten it wrong, but a museum curator in 1945 London, who had never been in a real sword fight let alone trained with real swords in any form himself, is able to inform us of the failings of these magnificent weapons. A noted French medieval historian later repeated Ffoulkes' opinion of Medieval swords verbatim as a trustworthy judgment. Respected medievalist and authority on medieval military matters, Dr. Kelly DeVries, writing on military technology of the Middle Ages still referred in a book during the 1990s to \"the thick, heavy, awkward, but finely crafted medieval sword.\" (Devries, Medieval Military Technology, p. 25). With \"authoritative\" opinions such as these, it is no wonder modern students of the subject have been so ill-informed and we today have so much work remaining. Such opinions on \"ponderous old-time swords\" as one mid-19th century French fencing master once called them can perhaps be overlooked as products of the climate of the age and the information then available. But at present, similar views expressed by modern students and fencers are not so easily excused. It is particularly sad when leading fencing masters today (schooled only in the weapons of their modern dueling game) will proudly issue naive statements about how much earlier swords weighed. As I wrote in my 1998, Medieval Swordsmanship, \" It can be quite pitiful when leading sport fencing maestros (experienced only with flimsy foils, epees, and sabers) will reveal their prejudices with laughable statements about how Medieval swords 'weighed 10 pounds' or could only be used for 'clumsy bashing and chopping.'\" For example, the respected 20th century fencer Charles Selberg referred to the \"heavy and unwieldy weapons of early times\" ( Selberg , p. 1). While modern fencing master C. L. de Beaumont declared typically: \"In the Middle Ages, the general use of armour required weapons, such as the battle-axe and the double-handed sword, to be heavy and clumsy.\" ( de Beaumont, p. 143). Armor required weapons to be heavy and clumsy? Additionally, the 1930, Book of Fencing, with great confidence declared: \"With a few rare exceptions, the sword, throughout Europe in 1450, was still a heavy, clumsy weapon and for balance and ease of fence it was about as convenient as an axe.\" (Cass, p. 29-30). Even at our present time this idiocy over sword weight continues. From the recent aptly titled book, Complete Idiot's Guide to the Crusades, we are informed that knights fought in tournament melees by “hacking at one another with heavy (20 - 30 pound) broadswords.” (P. Williams, p. 20). Hefting a superb example of a rare 14th century warsword from the famed Alexandria Aresenal collection.\n\nExamining an authentic 15th century great-sword at the British Royal Armorries, above; and a fine 16th century bastard sword at the Glenbow museum, Calgary, below. Such comments reveal more about the biases and ignorance of the writers than about the nature of real swords and swordplay. I've personally encountered the same kind of sentiments countless times in public conversations and in Internet chats with fencing instructors and fencing students so I've no doubts of its continued pervasiveness. As recently as 2003 one author on medieval knights writing of the longsword stated incomprehensively, \"It was so heavy it could even be used to split armor\" and further described greatswords as weighing \"up to twenty pounds and capable of crushing heavy armor with ease.\" (A. Baker, p. 39). None of this is accurate. Probably the most damning example that comes to mind is Olympic fencer Richard Cohen in his recent book about fencing and sword history stating early on how, \"Swords, which could weigh in excess of three pounds, were heavy and ill-balanced, requiring strength to wield rather than skill.\" (Cohen, p. 14). With all due respect, even when he accurately acknowledges their weight (in the process denigrating the prowess required to wield them) he nonetheless is still able to consider them only in terms of how they compare to the mock swords of his modern sport, even inexplicably describing them as used \"primarily to bludgeon.\" So, according to Cohen we must imagine that real swords designed by real warriors for real life-and-death combat were heavy, ill-balanced, and didn't require real skill? But now toy swords for a pretend game are apparently just right?\n\nHandling a fine specimen of a 16th century Swiss war-sword. Sturdy, light, functional. For some reason, many classical fencers still seem to perpetually fail to grasp that earlier swords, being real weapons, weren't designed to be held at arms length and whipped back and forth by the fingertips. Here we are at the dawn of the 21st century, in the midst of a renaissance of historical European martial arts study, and yet knowledgeable fencers are still perpetuating a 19th century misunderstanding. When you don't understand how a particular sword is used, it's not possible to appreciate what its true capabilities are or recognize why it was designed the way it was. Invariably, you end up interpreting it only through the prism of what you already know.\n\nEven basket-hilted broadswords of the 16th century are easy to wield cut-and-thrust weapons. Oakeshott recognized this problematic mixture of ignorance and prejudice more than three decades ago, writing in his influential, Sword in the Age of Chivalry, he noted: \"Add to this the work of romantic writers in the past, who, seeking to give to their heroes a touch of the Superman, caused them to wield enormous and weighty weapons far beyond the powers of modern man, and complete the picture with the scorn poured upon these swords by lovers of the elegance of the 18th century and it becomes easier to see why so plain a weapon can be accounted crude, ponderous, and inefficient. In fact the average weight of these swords is between 2 lbs. and 3 lbs., and they were balanced (according to their purpose) with the same care and skill in the making as a tennis racket or a fishing rod. The old belief that they are unwieldable is as absurd and out-dated, and dies as hard, as the myth that armored knights had to be hoisted into their saddles with a crane.\" (Oakeshott, Sword in the Age of Chivalry, p. 12). Working-out with a superb example of an actual 15th century estoc. Only by vigorously putting such weapons through their paces can we be sure about their performance. Long-time student of arms and senior fight interpreter at the British Royal Armouries, Keith Ducklin, states: \"From my experience at the Royal Armouries, where I have handled many genuine weapons from different periods, I would personally suggest that a broad-bladed European fighting sword, be it a cutter, cut-and-thruster or thruster, is likely to weigh between two pounds for a single-handed sword and four-and-a-half for a two-handed. Swords specifically produced for other uses, e.g. ceremony or execution, may weigh less or more, but these are not fighting weapons.\" (personal correspondence with the author, April 2004). Mr. Ducklin would certainly know, as he has held and examined literally hundreds of fine swords in this famous collection and considered them from the point of view of a fighter. In a brief article on swords specimens of the 15th to 16th centuries from three major museum collections, including samples from the Stibbet Museum in Florence, Dr. Timothy Dawson noted no single-hand sword weighed more than 3.5 pounds and no greatsword weighed more than 6 pounds. He concludes, “From these examples it can be seen that the ideal that medieval and Renaissance swords were heavy, clumsy objects is far from true.” (Dawson, p. 34 & 35). Subjectivity and Objectivity The fact is, if you know what you are doing, understand the necessity of the fighting style, and the dynamics of the weapon, then Medieval and Renaissance swords can rightly feel agile and robust. Writing in 1863, the sword manufacturer and authority John Latham of Wilkinson Swords mistakenly noted of a fine specimen of a mid-14th century Medieval arming sword that it had “a tremendous weight” because “it was intended for a time when swordsmen had to deal with iron-plated men.” Added, Latham, “They got the heaviest weight they could, and they put as much force behind it as they could possibly give.” (Latham, Shape, p. 420-422). Yet, commentingon the “overweighting” of swords, Latham however noted a 6-pound sword designed at the time by a cavalry officer who imagined it would strengthen his wrist but the result was that “no living man can cut wit hit…The weight is so great that it is impossible to give it any velocity, and it’s cutting power is therefore nil. A very simple test shows this.” (Latham, Shape, p. 420-421). Latham also added that, “The nature of the body cut at, however, affects the result very much.” He then concluded by commenting that the common mistake is to believe a strong man would take a heavier sword so he could do more damage with it. “The weight a man can move with the greatest velocity is that with which he will produce the greatest effect, but the lightest sword is not necessarily the one he can move the quickest. It is possible for a sword to be so light that we feel the resistance of the air in making a cut with it, and this is what we express when we say a sword feels ‘whippy’ in the hand. Such a sword is worse than one too heavy.” (Latham, p. 414-415). A sword certainly had to have enough mass to support an edge and point, parry strikes, and give a blow weight, but at the same time it could not be so heavy as to be slow and unmanageable or else a quicker weapon would fight circles around it. This necessary weight was a factor of what the blade was designed for, whether to cut, thrust, or do both against whatever particular materials it would encounter. Imaginary tales in chivalric fiction often featured massive swords wieldable only by heroic champions or great villains and capable of cleaving through horses and even trees. But these accounts were mythic and allegorical, not literal. In Froissart's Chronicles, when the Scots defeat the English near Melrose we do read of Sir Archibald Douglas who \"wielded before him an immense sword, whose blade was two ells long, which scarcely another could have lifted from the ground, but he found no difficulty in handling it, and gave such terrible strokes, that all on whom they fell were struck to the ground; and there were none so hardy among the English able to withstand his blows.\" The great 14th century fencing master Johannes Liechtenauer himself said, \"the sword is a scale, and it is great and heavy\" and that it is balanced by a suitable pommel, by which he meant that the weapon is itself \"balanced\" and handles well from that balance, not that the sword was weighty. The Italian master Filippo Vadi in the early 1480s instructed, \"You'll take a light weapon and not a heavy one, to easily control all of it, to avoid being hindered by heavy weight.\" Thus, we have a teacher of defense specifically acknowledging there were both \"heavy\" and \"light\" blades to choose from. But again, the word \"heavy\" should not be taken as equivalent with being \"too heavy\" or necessarily awkward and cumbersome. Instead, it should be viewed in the same context as one might, for instance, choose a heavy tennis racket over a light one or a heavier baseball bat over a lighter one. So many fine Medieval and Renaissance swords are so perfectly balanced and weighted, they seem to virtually cry out to the holder, \"Wield me!\" In my experience, having handled in arms museums and private collections well over 200 fine European swords ranging from the 12th to 16th centuries alone, sword weight is something I have paid careful consideration to. I am consistently amazed at the liveliness and balance of virtually every specimen I encounter. The antique Medieval and Renaissance swords I have personally examined in six countries, and in some cases practiced and even cut with, were time and again light and well-balanced. Being accustomed as I am from years of exercise swinging blades and handling weapons, with extremely few exceptions did I ever find a historical sword to be anything other than agile and quite manageable. Few, if any fighting swords, from short blades to bastard variety and rapiers weighed even close to 4 pounds and those which did typically were still well-balanced. Even when I came across a piece I personally found \"too heavy\" or just not balanced for my own tastes, I recognized there might be others with a different build or fighting style who no doubt could find it appealing. ARMA members investigating swords at the Swedish Royal Armory, Stockholm. On an occasion when I worked out with two 16th century war-swords, each weighing just over 3 pounds, they performed beautifully; nimbly cutting, thrusting, guarding, recovering, and arcing around in rapid slashes and fierce full-arm cuts as if they were nearly weightless. There was nothing \"heavy\" about such fearsome and elegant tools. I recall during one wonderful opportunity to floryshe outside for several minutes with an actual 16th century two-handed infantry sword, my being entirely surprised at how easily the immense 6 pound weapon handled so that it readily felt as if it weighed half as much. Even though it was not designed for someone of my stature, I could see its clear functionality and utility because I understand the techniques and methods for such weapons. The reader can take such anecdotes for what they are worth. But the countless times that I have hefted fine antique swords from the 14th, 15th, or 16th centuries, posing in wards and performing stance transitions with them under the watchful eyes of benevolent curators, have left me with the unshakeable conviction as to what real swords weighed (and how they really handled). Measuring and weighing two excellent\n\nspecimens in a private collection. At one time, while inspecting a few select 14th and 16th century swords in the possession of the late Ewart Oakeshott, we even had the opportunity to weigh several fine examples on a digital scale just to confirm and record for ourselves an accurate understanding of their weight. Other colleagues have done similar things and their findings corroborate with ours. It is from such experiences with real swords that ARMA has come to be so critical of the weight and balance problems so widespread in many (certainly not all) modern swords. My experience with real blades makes me all the more disappointed in the current inferior accuracy of many modern versions. Obviously, the more a modern sword handles like a historical one, the more accurate our interpretations of the historical teachings for using it will be. Indeed, it is arguable that appreciation for the true weight of historical swords is prerequisite to understanding their true application. Having handled countless Medieval and Renaissance swords to collect impressions and exact measurements for his work, respected swordsmith Peter Johnsson tells us how they, \"have a feeling of agility about them that can be astounding. In general they are quick and precise and expertly well balanced for their intended use. You get a strong impression of lightness that often belies the actual size and weight of the sword. This is more a result of a careful distribution of mass than just the placing of the point of balance. Finding the weight of a sword and its 'point of balance' is only half way to understanding its 'dynamic balance' (i.e., how the sword handles when put in motion).\" He adds, \"In general, modern replicas are very far from original swords in this respect. Distorted impressions as to what authentic sharp weapons were all about can easily result from enthusiasts today learning only by training with modern weapons.\" Thus, as Johnsson notes, the bottom line is again that real swords are lighter than most people realize. Even then, weight is not the whole story because handling characteristics are a matter of mass-distribution along a blade, which in turn, affects the point of balance. What needs to be understood in regard to modern copies of historical swords is that even when made to closely approximate the weight of an actual historical specimen, this does not guarantee at all that it will feel the same as, or handle identically to, the original model. Unless the geometry of a reproduction matches that of the original (i.e., along its entire length, shape, and cross-section) the balance will not be identical between them. Carefully weighing and measuring some actual 14th & 16th century pieces. The modern piece can easily feel heavier and be less wieldy than the original. Accurately reproducing balance in swords today is an important aspect of their construction. Nowadays, many cheaply made and inferior swords whether historical replicas, reenactment weapons, fantasy-designs, theatrical props, or ornamental pieces are regularly made heavy with poor balance. Part of this problem is due to an unfortunate lack of understanding of blade geometry on the part of the manufacturer. Other times, intentional cost-cutting considerations are to blame. Either way, even if they know, sellers and makers cannot be expected to acknowledge to consumers that their swords may be too heavy or poorly balanced. It's apparently much easier to simply offer statements to the public about how they are \"supposed\" to be that heavy. There is another factor in why modern swords are typically made heavier than historical originals. Out of ignorance many sword makers and their consumers honestly expect that a sword should feel heavy. They have been conditioned by endless displays of lumbering swordsmen with great sweeping blows of slow blades to believe that unless their \"barbarian broadsword\" is hefty and causes strain when lifted, it can't be a \"real\" sword as if sheer mass alone affects a successful sword blow. [When contrasted with the lightening-quick featherweight aluminum swords used in many Asian martial arts displays and choreographed routines, its hard to blame anyone for such misunderstanding.] While the difference between a 3.8 pound and a 5.3 pound blade may not seem like all that much, when trying to correctly perform proper fighting techniques it very much is. Additionally, when it comes to rapiers, which generally weighed between two and two-and-a-half pounds, their weights can be somewhat misleading. Being such slender thrusting blades, rapiers often have the majority of their mass at their hilts, giving them a balance that lends agility to their points despite their weight comparative to much wider cutting swords. Trying out an authentic 16th century two-handed infantrysword. Facts and Myth-conceptions Interestingly, several times I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to compare a modern reproduction side by side with the original sword it was based on. Though there was a difference of only few ounces in weight, the disparity made the new one seem to weigh at least a pound heavier. Two weapons, a fine replica, and an original. Despite being very close in dimensions and weight, there is no comparing the difference in\"feel\" betweeen the two. Two of examples of modern reproductions side by side with their originals. D espite their having the same dimensions, the minute and subtle differences in cross-sectional geometry between them (the mass distribution in the tang, the shoulder, the edge bevel, etc.) was dissimilar enough to severely affect the balance and thus, their \"feel\" when handled. I've also had the remarkable opportunity to examine 19th century forgeries of Medieval swords and in some cases the difference in \"feel\" between these fakes and the real thing were noticeable right away. When showing replica swords in my lectures and presentations over the years, I have repeatedly experienced surprise from attendees who discover for the first time that swords were not nearly as stocky or burdensome as they assumed or expected. Their surprise is often accompanied by questions as to how to enlighten others to this. As well, when teaching beginners I've very often heard comments as to how heavy a particular sword was that, in contrast, senior ARMA students actually considered to be fairly light and well-balanced. Examining historical blades: A 14th century arming sword without handle, a 10th century Viking sword, and a 16th century military field sword. Just how can one respond intelligently when confronted with insistent declarations that swords \"had to be heavy\" or \"weighed 20 pounds?\" How best to go about factually refuting such nonsense statements? I have no sure advice. If you directly answer that Medieval and Renaissance swords were light, agile, and typically weighed around three pounds, you can often expect to be met with a certain disbelief and even argument. All that can be done perhaps, is to suggest that the other party may not fully appreciate the true attributes of real swords, that they may have been misled as to the actual weights of historical pieces, that they might consider whether or not they have ever handled sufficient historical examples, and finally, that they might realize historical fighting men trained hard and kept fit. The many types of Medieval and Renaissance swords were versatile, agile, and highly effective weapons that's why they were around for so long in so many forms. As a tool of self-protection, nothing clumsy or awkward to use would have been continually popular for centuries. Claims that they consisted merely of crude hacking and artless chopping without true skill, insult how versatile and elegant these fighting blades really were. ARMA Members contrasting two pieces, an original and a similar modern reproduction. Good swords were light, agile, well balanced, and though fairly stiff, still flexible and resilient. They were killing tools and their study should be approached from that understanding. A sword's weight cannot be judged just from its size or blade width. Thus, while the weight of Medieval and Renaissance swords can be accurately recorded and compiled, the matter of their being \"heavy\" or not is one of perspective. It is clear that despite the facts, regardless of the objective mass of historical swords, their \"heaviness\" is a subjective matter. The same three-pound weapon is elegant and robust to a skilled practitioner while his desk-bound colleague might think it ungainly and sluggish. The understanding we must have is that to the men who skillfully used these tools, they weighed just right.

Outside the classroom, students can join more than 100 clubs, pledge with about 10 Greek-letter organizations or try out for the Allegheny Gators varsity sports teams, which compete in the NCAA Division III North Coast Athletic Conference. Notable Allegheny alumni include Paul Siple, an Antarctica explorer who developed the wind-chill index factor. William McKinley, the 25th president of the United States, attended Allegheny College in the 1800s, but legend has it that he and his roommate were expelled for shoving a cow into the school’s bell tower.\n\nGeneral Information Private, Coed school type 1815 year founded United Methodist religious affiliation Semester academic calendar Suburban setting $204.5 million + 2017 endowment\n\nSchool Mission and Unique Qualities\n\nContent is provided by the school.\n\nRecognized among Loren Pope's 40 Colleges That Change Lives, Allegheny College is one of the nation's most prestigious and dynamic institutions of higher education, a place where students are encouraged to explore their unusual combinations of interests and talents. Allegheny is one of the only colleges in the country that requires its students to choose both a major and minor, ensuring they develop the skills needed to be analytical, creative, and innovative. At Allegheny, when members of the college community talk about unusual combinations, they mean it as a tremendous compliment, a compliment that recognizes the unique character of each student. When you look around, you'll see a college president who studies decision-making by modern American presidents and then rolls up his sleeves for grassroots community service; an aspiring diplomat singing in the choir and building a bike path; a future physician who edits the college newspaper and pole vaults on an international stage. Unusual combinations, yes, but at Allegheny they are everyday examples of students exploring all of their talents, all of their passions. Allegheny is also a leader in higher education innovation, having been recognized in 2018 by U.S. News & World Report as the No. 6 Most Innovative National Liberal Arts College and in 2016 as the nation's top baccalaureate college for undergraduate research by the Council on Undergraduate Research. Allegheny students don't have to wait behind graduate students for research positions on faculty-led projects but instead are actively engaged as research collaborators. Students follow the guidance of faculty mentors through research, conference presentations, co-authored articles, and faculty-led study tours. Allegheny's faculty members are people who pride themselves on being teachers first. Under the guidance of a faculty advisor in his or her major field, every Allegheny student completes the comprehensive Senior Project, also known as The Comp, a significant piece of original scholarly work with a creative, analytical, or experimental focus. The project mirrors a master's thesis, demonstrating the student's ability to complete a major assignment, to work independently, to analyze and synthesize information, and to write and speak persuasively. Central to the college's focus on experiential learning is the Allegheny Gateway, which helps students connect classroom learning with real-world experience. Since its introduction in 2015, the Gateway has received national attention. It is a central location for collaboration and study in which students can access resume and career services, pre-professional and graduate school advising, research funding and fellowships, internships, service opportunities, and more. Allegheny's experiential learning opportunities, dynamic and diverse community of scholars, and vibrant campus environment set the stage for an amazing college experience, one that leads to extraordinary outcomes. Allegheny ranks in the top 5 percent of schools in the country for graduates who go on to earn a Ph.D. and in the top 4 percent in the sciences. Because of the reputation behind an Allegheny degree, our students are accepted to graduate schools (including medical and law schools) at rates twice the national average. It is this preparation for the global marketplace, and for life, that Allegheny is nationally known for providing.\n\nUndergraduate Information\n\nQuestions and Answers U.S. News has a community of students, alumni, staff and others who can provide additional insight into Allegheny College.

  "latent_13386": "Controversy over a potential widening of Sandy Springs’ Mount Vernon Highway for alternative transportation shifted topics, from a now ruled-out house-takings to transit types, at a Nov. 14 city meeting.\n\nAround 150 people attended the meeting, held at Mount Vernon Presbyterian Church, to hear about the project, which at minimum will add a multi-use path and at maximum, two additional on-street lanes for alternative transportation. Officials from the church’s school and the Sandy Springs Branch Library were among the attendees.\n\nThe still-conceptual idea triggered enormous neighborhood controversy in recent weeks as city officials repeatedly said they could not rule out the eminent-domain taking of houses for a future project. Mayor Rusty Paul definitively ruled out such house-takings at the Nov. 14 meeting, while declining to explain why he could not do so just weeks ago or why he can now, and that situation remains mysterious.\n\n“Look me in the eyes. We’re not taking houses,” Paul told at least three residents while taking them by the shoulders.\n\nWith that issue apparently off the table, residents still had questions about the amount of right of way that might be needed and about the possible types of alternative transportation in the corridor, which is the section of Mount Vernon between the Sandy Springs MARTA Station and Roswell Road. Alternative concepts include adding up to two on-street lanes exclusively for modes other than single-occupancy motor vehicles, such as bicycles, ride-share cars, shuttle buses or streetcars.\n\nSticker-voting on display panels by attendees showed a strong preference to keep Mount Vernon car-centric and strong opposition to mass transit. City-hired consultants said in a presentation that they heard similar results from a Sept. 18 “focus group” meeting and a mailed survey that drew 705 responses. They said that while a majority of respondents still want to drive in the corridor, 20 to 25 percent expressed interest in some type of shuttle service, which could significantly reduce traffic.\n\nAt the Nov. 14 meeting, residents had concerns about whether any such alternative transportation was intended to serve them or outsiders, and smaller land-taking for right of way remained an issue.\n\nThe meeting’s format also drew criticism, with many attendees calling it “insulting” or “disappointing” for lacking a question-and-answer period during a main gathering, which meant that complaints and the mayor’s responses could not be heard by all attendees.\n\nPaul insisted that the meeting was more informative and efficient by holding a presentation and by providing officials at various displays to answer questions. He also stood to the side of a room and spoke directly with about a dozen residents in lengthy conversations, as did City Councilmember Chris Burnett. Also in attendance was City Councilmember-elect Jody Reichel, who said she was still learning about the project and that she believes the “city does a good job listening.”\n\n“We don’t want to give you a final plan and say, ‘Take it or leave it,’” Paul told one attendee, repeatedly assuring residents that their input will count.\n\nMeeting materials are scheduled to be posted on the city website on a dedicated page; click here to see it. Public comments on the current conceptual phase will be taken through Nov. 22 at kwescott@sandyspringsga.gov. Consultants expect to return with draft recommendations in February and finalize a design for City Council consideration in April.\n\nTransportation options\n\nThe Mount Vernon concept is a combination of two items on a transportation special local option sales tax project list approved by voters last year. One is a multi-use trail on Mount Vernon, and the other is a study of creating a Perimeter Center trail network that can double as alternative mass transit routes if funding becomes available. East-west transit in the corridor is also mentioned in the recent “Next Ten” city planning vision document that was developed with community input.\n\nBy law, those TSPLOST projects must be completed within the next six years, so “we have to do it,” Paul said. But, he explained, there is plenty of room for input on what “it” will be and its effects on surrounding property.\n\nWhile the TSPLOST and Next Ten got general community support, a question from Mount Vernon residents is whether alternative transportation is intended to serve them or outside commuters. Consultants at the meeting mentioned Perimeter Center employees wanting to lunch on Roswell Road, for example. Paul said he was concerned their presentation gave a “misimpression” and that he believes the goal is to “add options so people living here can go to City Springs,” the new civic center set to open at Mount Vernon and Roswell Road next year.\n\nAn advantage of adding one or two “multi-modal” lanes to the street is reserving space for possible future transit, Paul said. He said the city cannot afford mass transit systems at the moment, but technology is rapidly changing, such as the innovation of autonomous buses.\n\nBrian Eufinger, a resident who helped to organize a recent homeowners association about the concept, has raised concerns that such lanes would end up being used by single-occupancy cars in the meantime, and perhaps permanently. City spokesperson Sharon Kraun and Steve Tiedemann, the city’s TSPLOST program manager, say that the lanes would be reserved for alternative transportation modes only and could be used by conventional bicycles or shuttles.\n\nProperty-taking concerns\n\nAdding multi-modal lanes would require taking some amount of right of way from yards along the corridor. Early, crude conceptual drawings dating back to January showed possible house-takings. Those drawings became the focus of neighborhood concern in recent weeks, when surveyors began appearing unannounced in local yards and the consultants showed up asking about transit while saying they could not address right of way issues.\n\nCity officials repeatedly said they thought house-taking was unlikely, but could not be ruled out in this early stage. Local HOAs held an Oct. 24 meeting where Burnett repeated that stance to an angry crowd. Yet just two days later, Tiedemann said planners already knew they didn’t need to take houses, and that message was confirmed at the Nov. 14 meeting, which included a new map of maximum potential right of way.\n\nIt remains unclear why the city’s message changed so abruptly, but there are indications it is a combination of politics and a communications disconnect between the city’s political leaders and its planning staff and outside consultants.\n\nAsked why the city didn’t just rule out house-taking to begin with and when leaders were aware of the new map, Paul paused for several seconds and declined to answer.\n\n“I just don’t think I’m going to [answer],” Paul said, adding only that earlier information had been presented by someone in a “misleading” way.\n\nKraun said the possibility of house-taking was effectively dead on arrival when councilmembers greeted it coolly earlier this year. “That was off the table, you could say, in January,” she said, adding half-jokingly that likewise, the possibility is politically dead now “because the mayor said so.”\n\nBut on the technical side, she said, city officials hedged in their recent statements because the consultants were still working. She said the City Council still has not been briefed on the project’s current status and that the new right of way map was delivered by consulting firm KCI to the city only on Nov. 10.",

Doctors there placed her in a medically-induced coma, according to Entertainment Tonight and other reports.\n\nDaughter Melissa flew in from LA with her 13-year-old son, Cooper, to be by Joan’s side. She said her mom is “resting comfortably” and in a statement Thursday night thanked well-wishers for their support.\n\n“I want to thank everyone for the overwhelming love and support for my mother,” she said. “She is resting comfortably and is with our family. We ask that you continue to keep her in your thoughts and prayers.”\n\nThe near-death experience came just hours after Rivers, during a Manhattan comedy show Wednesday night, joked about dying.\n\n“She goes, ‘I’m 81. I could go over at any minute!’ ” said fan Shade Rupe, who was seated down front, just feet from Rivers.\n\n“She pointed to the floor and said, ‘I could go right there.

We somehow managed to record it as 6EST instead of 2EST in both calendars. Whenever we put things in the calendars we double check them and basically re-read and confirm them all to make sure mistakes like this don't happen. I don't do it alone and get additional eyes to check it but ultimately it's my fuckup, so i'm lost for words how this did happen. In 3 years of managing this team we have never turned up late to anything (flight, match etc) and this is something I pride myself on so i'm really disappointed this happened today.\n\nWe were ready to play SK at 6EST we had a practice match lined up before hand to ensure we go into the match warm.

If resistance to the Slave Power was the reserved watchword of your first election, the triumphant war cry of your re-election is Death to Slavery.\n\nFrom the commencement of the titanic American strife the workingmen of Europe felt instinctively that the star-spangled banner carried the destiny of their class. The contest for the territories which opened the dire epopee, was it not to decide whether the virgin soil of immense tracts should be wedded to the labor of the emigrant or prostituted by the tramp of the slave driver?\n\nWhen an oligarchy of 300,000 slaveholders dared to inscribe, for the first time in the annals of the world, \"slavery\" on the banner of Armed Revolt, when on the very spots where hardly a century ago the idea of one great Democratic Republic had first sprung up, whence the first Declaration of the Rights of Man was issued, and the first impulse given to the European revolution of the eighteenth century; when on those very spots counterrevolution, with systematic thoroughness, gloried in rescinding \"the ideas entertained at the time of the formation of the old constitution\", and maintained slavery to be \"a beneficent institution\", indeed, the old solution of the great problem of \"the relation of capital to labor\", and cynically proclaimed property in man \"the cornerstone of the new edifice\" — then the working classes of Europe understood at once, even before the fanatic partisanship of the upper classes for the Confederate gentry had given its dismal warning, that the slaveholders' rebellion was to sound the tocsin for a general holy crusade of property against labor, and that for the men of labor, with their hopes for the future, even their past conquests were at stake in that tremendous conflict on the other side of the Atlantic. Everywhere they bore therefore patiently the hardships imposed upon them by the cotton crisis, opposed enthusiastically the proslavery intervention of their betters — and, from most parts of Europe, contributed their quota of blood to the good cause.\n\nWhile the workingmen, the true political powers of the North, allowed slavery to defile their own republic, while before the Negro, mastered and sold without his concurrence, they boasted it the highest prerogative of the white-skinned laborer to sell himself and choose his own master, they were unable to attain the true freedom of labor, or to support their European brethren in their struggle for emancipation; but this barrier to progress has been swept off by the red sea of civil war.\n\nThe workingmen of Europe feel sure that, as the American War of Independence initiated a new era of ascendancy for the middle class, so the American Antislavery War will do for the working classes. They consider it an earnest of the epoch to come that it fell to the lot of Abraham Lincoln, the single-minded son of the working class, to lead his country through the matchless struggle for the rescue of an enchained race and the reconstruction of a social world.

It strives to do equal and exact justice to all states and to all men and it relies upon the beneficial results of that effort for support at home and for respect and good will throughout the world.\n\nNations do not exist for themselves alone, but to promote the welfare and happiness of mankind by benevolent intercourse and example. It is in this relation that the United States regard their cause in the present conflict with slavery, maintaining insurgence as the cause of human nature, and they derive new encouragements to persevere from the testimony of the workingmen of Europe that the national attitude is favored with their enlightened approval and earnest sympathies.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,\n\nCharles Francis Adams",

Anyone who lived in that era will definitely recognize the tune. Peace and Love, Inc. did pretty well, despite of MTV’s refusal to play the video for the title track.\n\nThe album had something really interesting buried in it. The band managed to do something that nobody else had ever done – they hid a text file in the vinyl of the record.\n\nOne of the tracks was strangely called “300bps N, 8, 1 (Terminal Mode or Ascii Download).” I’m sure to most people, this just seemed like a nonsense name for a “song” that, when played, sounded like a bunch of noise.

  "latent_13934": "Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nPaul van der Bas, a young Dutch man, traveled from Amsterdam to Israel a couple of weeks ago for the sixth time in recent years. But this trip was special. This time he arrived in the Holy Land as a leader of a mission titled “CIJO Fact-Finding Mission,” involving 23 young people, with co-leader Jonathan de Geus.\n\nVan der Bas is a past participant of the 2012 fact-finding mission.\n\nThe pleasant and articulate 23-year-old Van der Bas is currently completing his Master’s degree in crisis and security management at Leiden University in the Netherlands.He is also the chairman of an association of 120 Dutch students who support Israel called CIJO. It is the youth organization of the Center for Information and Documentation of Israel, the main pro-Israel group in the Netherlands.Like many other members of CIJO, Van der Bas is not Jewish.Yet he feels that despite growing up Christian, he is strongly connected to the Jewish faith. Stating he was always very interested in politics, he vividly remembers how he was strongly influenced by the events of 9/11 and the second intifada.“Growing up I did not know any Jews,” he says, recalling that while attending a Christian school, he learned a lot about the Bible, and specifically about the Israelites. “I guess, as a kid, that did make me curious as to what was going on in the news about Israel,” he said. He also explains his connection to Israel and Judaism as “an emotional kind of intuitive response to what’s going on” that is “hard to explain.”Operation Cast Lead (2008- 9) was a turning point for him, the point at which he started paying more attention to events in Israel. He points to the fact that of the 120 members of CIJO, the ratio between Jews and non-Jews is half and half. “Non-Jews have various reasons to sign up – some are part of other political youth organizations and join because of an interest in Middle East politics. Some sign up after joining a trip to Israel.”Other than organizing events for the members of the group such as lectures, debates and meetings, CIJO reaches out to people who are not necessarily involved with Israel, inviting them to debates or lectures at high schools and universities.“We are also regularly invited to share our opinions in lectures or debates... I was even invited by the Muslim student association where I debated the chair of Students for Justice in Palestine,” he added.Van der Bas made it clear that CIJO has made a conscious choice not to receive funding from any government, Dutch or Israeli. “We’re an independent organization,” he said. “If you want to be a real independent organization, you should not receive any government funding.”The name of the annual “CIJO Fact Finding Mission” is meant to show exactly what the organization tries to accomplish.“The goal of the trip is to show a fair and balanced view of Israel, and also a complete view which is difficult to do in seven days,” he said. “I do believe the overall program shows a very nuanced, balanced and as whole and complete picture as possible.”The 23 young Dutch participants, ranging in age from 18 to 30, come from various political, social and religious backgrounds.What they all share is a desire to learn more about Israel, Middle East geopolitics, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Israeli society. They all hope to be better informed before forming an opinion.The itinerary was packed, including visits to Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, the Golan Heights, Sderot, Netiv Ha’asara, Ramallah and Rawabi, as well as lectures by Israeli and Palestinian officials. On one day, the group met with a settler from Shiloh shortly after meeting Palestinian officials from Fatah and Hamas.“Personally, I do think the facts are in favor of Israel” admits Van der Bas. He said that support for Israel would actually increase by exposing the students to the “facts,” although he stated that he always tries to be as balanced as possible.He spoke passionately about the misconceptions surrounding Israel: “I think there are many misconceptions – some people think that the entire country is a war zone. And people think that the Palestinian territories are a big war zone, which perhaps to a limited extent it is, but on the other hand I think seeing the situation there is the only way to have an informed opinion of what is going on.”Van der Bas discussed the impact of seeing the situation first hand.“We went to Jelazoun, which is a refugee camp, and it is shocking to see, but we also went to Rawabi, which is a sparkling, new, a great city, a Palestinian-built city, which is not something people know about or imagine when they hear about Israel and the Palestinian territories.”The success of CIJO’s mission seems undisputed. All 23 tour participants reported that their perspective on Israel had changed following the visit.Most participants also said they now realize the proximity of the dangers Israel faces at its borders, and have gained a newfound understanding of the security challenges as well as the diversity of Israelis.Whether the motive to support Israel is religious, political or just an emotional affinity, it is clear that Israel has many young, promising, passionate and dedicated friends in the Netherlands.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

Basse Road (Suite 183) with a listed first day of sales Aug. 15.\n\nTo top it off, let's call it salsa on the asada, Reata Real Estate, which leases property at the Shops at Lincoln Heights, lists “Torchy's Tacos” in suite 183, formerly La Posada Del Rey, on their most recent site plan for the shopping center. Torchy's Tacos also registered a construction project with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation earlier this month for $300,000 of renovations at the Lincoln Heights location with a start date in June and completion scheduled for August.\n\n“Permits and recruitment tend to slow the process sometimes, but we're hoping for something to be up and running by late fall,” said Brittany Platt, a spokeswoman. “An opening by National Taco Day (Oct. 4) would be a taco dream come true.”\n\nThe company placed an ad on Craigslist for job openings at the San Antonio location three days ago, but did not mention a starting date.\n\nTorchy's Tacos, which has more than 20 locations in Texas and uses the mantra “Damn Good Tacos,” serves classics such as chicken and beef fajita or barbacoa, as well as originally crafted tacos such as Jamaican jerk chicken, or this reporter's favorite: The Trailer Park, which is fried chicken, green chilies, pico and queso. They also serve breakfast tacos and sides such as street corn.\n\nMenu items are priced between $3-$5.\n\nRenovations at the Lincoln Heights location did not appear to have started by Friday.\n\nStaff writer Neal T.

Rob Portman, Ohio, and Mark Kirk, Ill., in supporting same-sex marriage.\n\n\"I am a life-long Republican because I believe in promoting freedom and limiting the reach of government,\" Murkowski wrote in an op-ed explaining her decision. \"When government does act, I believe it should encourage family values. I support the right of all Americans to marry the person they love and choose because I believe doing so promotes both values: it keeps politicians out of the most private and personal aspects of peoples’ lives – while also encouraging more families to form and more adults to make a lifetime commitment to one another.\"\n\nThe president of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights group, hailed the decision.\n\n“We hope other fair-minded conservatives like Senator Murkowski stand up and join her,” HRC President Chad Griffin said in a statement. “Alaska may be nicknamed ‘the Last Frontier,’ but we’ve got to make sure that LGBT Alaskans don’t have to wait to find justice.”\n\nMurkowski had previously said her views on same-sex marriage were “evolving,” using the language President Barack Obama had once used to describe his own views before endorsing marriage rights. She had been one of the few Republicans to support the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”\n\nA veteran GOP senator, Murkowski has become somewhat unmoored from the rest of the Republican conference in the Senate following her re-election in 2010. After having lost the Republican nomination in Alaska to Tea Party favorite Joe Miller, Murkowski waged an unusual, independent write-in campaign, which she rode to re-election – a rare feat in politics. Since returning to the Senate, she has conferenced with the rest of the GOP.\n\nMost other Republicans remain on record as opposing same-sex marriage, though activists who support same-sex marriage hope that the steady trickle of prominent Republicans who have endorsed the rights of gays and lesbians to marry may break the conservative logjam on the issue. An ABC News/Washington Post poll earlier this month found that 33 percent of Republicans support allowing gays to marry, while 65 percent of Republicans oppose it.\n\nAt the same time, activists have also ratcheted up pressure on high-profile Democrats – including a number of centrist senators – to endorse same-sex marriage.",

  "latent_14110": "Erlang (and Elixir) distribution without epmd\n\n2016-10-26 by Magnus Henoch\n\nWhen you deploy a distributed Erlang application, you’ll most likely have to answer the question “which ports need to be open in the firewall?”. Unless configured otherwise, the answer is:\n\nport 4369 for epmd, the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon, and\n\nan unpredictable high-numbered port for the Erlang node itself.\n\nThat answer usually doesn’t translate neatly into firewall rules. The usual solution to that is to use the environment variables inet_dist_listen_min and inet_dist_listen_max (described in the kernel documentation) to limit the distribution ports to a small port range, or even a single port.\n\nBut if we’ve limited the Erlang node to a single port, do we really need a port mapper? There are a few potential disadvantages with running epmd:\n\nWe may want to run epmd under the same user as the Erlang node — but as we’ll see, it can be hard to guarantee that.\n\nWe may want to configure epmd to listen only on a certain interface — again, that relies on us being the first to start epmd on this host.\n\nAnyone who can connect to epmd can list the local Erlang nodes, without any authentication.\n\nConnections to epmd are not encrypted, so even if you use distribution over TLS, epmd connections are not protected, and potentially vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nWhile epmd is very stable, it can happen that it crashes. In that case, any distributed Erlang nodes will keep running but not reconnect to epmd if it comes up again. That means that existing distribution connections will work, but new connections to those nodes cannot be made. It’s possible to fix this situation without restarting the nodes; see Экстренная реанимация epmd (in Russian).\n\nSo let’s explore how epmd works, and what we can do to run an Erlang cluster without it.\n\nHow does epmd get started in the first place?\n\nLet’s have a look at the code! epmd is started in the function start_epmd in erlexec.c. In fact, epmd is started unconditionally every time a distributed node is started. If an epmd instance is already running, the new epmd will fail to listen on port 4369, and thus exits silently.\n\nIn fact, that’s what will happen even if the existing epmd instance was started by another user. Any epmd instance is happy to serve Erlang nodes started by any user, so usually this doesn’t cause any problem.\n\nSo who can connect to epmd?\n\nAnyone! By default, epmd listens on all available interfaces, and responds to queries about what nodes are present, and what ports they are listening on. Hearing this tends to make sysadmins slightly nervous.\n\nYou can change that by manually starting epmd and specifying the -address option, or by setting the ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS environment variable before epmd gets started. This is described in the epmd documentation. That requires that the place where you do this is actually the first place where epmd gets started — otherwise, the existing epmd instance will keep running unperturbed.\n\nWhy do we need a port mapper daemon?\n\nClearly, epmd is just the middleman. Can we cut out the middleman?\n\nWe could make every Erlang node listen on a well-known port — perhaps use the port reserved for epmd, 4369, if we’re going to get rid of epmd. But that means that we can only run one Erlang node on each host (of course, for some use cases that might be enough).\n\nSo let’s specify some other port number. I mentioned inet_dist_listen_min and inet_dist_listen_max earlier. Those two variables define a port range, but if we set them to the same value, we narrow down the “range” to a single port:\n\nerl -sname foo \\ -kernel inet_dist_listen_min 4370 \\ inet_dist_listen_max 4370\n\nThat’s all well and good, but we’d also need a way to tell other nodes not to bother asking epmd about the port number, and just use this number instead. And if we have several nodes on the same host, we’d need some kind of configuration to specify the different port numbers for those nodes.\n\nLet’s use something else\n\nIn Erlang/OTP 19.0, there are two new command line options:\n\nWhen you specify -start_epmd false , Erlang won’t try to start epmd when starting a distributed node.\n\n, Erlang won’t try to start epmd when starting a distributed node. -epmd_module foo lets you specify a different module to use for node name registration and lookup, instead of the default erl_epmd .\n\nThose are the building blocks we need!\n\nI want to use a state-less scheme for this: since the connecting node already knows the name of the node it wants to connect to, I use that as the source of the port number. I pick a “base” port number — why not 4370, one port higher than epmd. Then I extract the number at the end of the “node” part of the node name, such that myapp3@foo.example.com becomes 3 . Then I add that number to the base port number. As a result, I know a priori that the node myapp3@foo.example.com is listening on port 4373. If there is no number in the node name, I treat that as a zero. This means that the nodes myapp3 and myotherapp3 couldn’t run on the same host, but I’m ready to live with that. (Thanks to Luca Favatella for perfecting this idea.)\n\nLet’s write a little module for that:\n\n-module(epmdless). -export([dist_port/1]). %% Return the port number to be used by a certain node. dist_port(Name) when is_atom(Name) -> dist_port(atom_to_list(Name)); dist_port(Name) when is_list(Name) -> %% Figure out the base port. If not specified using the %% inet_dist_base_port kernel environment variable, default to %% 4370, one above the epmd port. BasePort = application:get_env(kernel, inet_dist_base_port, 4370), %% Now, figure out our \"offset\" on top of the base port. The %% offset is the integer just to the left of the @ sign in our node %% name. If there is no such number, the offset is 0. %% %% Also handle the case when no hostname was specified. NodeName = re:replace(Name, \"@.*$\", \"\"), Offset = case re:run(NodeName, \"[0-9]+$\", [{capture, first, list}]) of nomatch -> 0; {match, [OffsetAsString]} -> list_to_integer(OffsetAsString) end, BasePort + Offset.\n\nAnd a module to use as the -epmd_module . One slight complication here is that 19.0 expects the module to export register_node/2 , while from 19.1 onwards it’s register_node/3 . Let’s include both functions to be sure:\n\n-module(epmdless_epmd_client). %% epmd_module callbacks -export([start_link/0, register_node/2, register_node/3, port_please/2, names/1]). %% The supervisor module erl_distribution tries to add us as a child %% process. We don't need a child process, so return 'ignore'. start_link() -> ignore. register_node(_Name, _Port) -> %% This is where we would connect to epmd and tell it which port %% we're listening on, but since we're epmd-less, we don't do that. %% Need to return a \"creation\" number between 1 and 3. Creation = rand:uniform(3), {ok, Creation}. %% As of Erlang/OTP 19.1, register_node/3 is used instead of %% register_node/2, passing along the address family, 'inet_tcp' or %% 'inet6_tcp'. This makes no difference for our purposes. register_node(Name, Port, _Family) -> register_node(Name, Port). port_please(Name, _IP) -> Port = epmdless:dist_port(Name), %% The distribution protocol version number has been 5 ever since %% Erlang/OTP R6. Version = 5, {port, Port, Version}. names(_Hostname) -> %% Since we don't have epmd, we don't really know what other nodes %% there are. {error, address}.\n\nAs you can see, most things are essentially stubbed out:\n\nstart_link/0 is invoked as this module is added as a child of the erl_distribution supervisor. We don’t actually need to start a process here, so we just return ignore .\n\nis invoked as this module is added as a child of the supervisor. We don’t actually need to start a process here, so we just return . The register_node function would normally connect to epmd and tell it what port number we use. In return, epmd would return a “creation” number. The “creation” number is an integer between 1 and 3. epmd keeps track of the creation number for each node name, and increments it whenever a node with a certain name reconnects. That means that it’s possible to distinguish e.g. pids from a previous “life” of a certain node. Since we don’t have epmd, we don’t have the benefit of it tracking the life span of the nodes. Let’s return a random number here, which has a 2 in 3 chance of being different from the previous “creation” number.\n\nport_please/2 gets the IP address of the remote host in order to connect to its epmd, but we don’t care; we use our algorithm to figure out the port number. We also need to return a distribution protocol version number. It has been 5 ever since Erlang/OTP R6 (see the Distribution Protocol documentation), so that’s simple.\n\nFinally, names/1 is called to list the Erlang nodes on a certain host. We have no way of knowing that, so let’s pretend that we couldn’t connect.\n\nSo far, so good — but we need a way to make sure that we’re listening on the right port. The best way I could think of is to write a new distribution protocol module, one that just sets the port number and then lets the real protocol module do its job:\n\n-module(epmdless_dist). -export([listen/1, select/1, accept/1, accept_connection/5, setup/5, close/1, childspecs/0]). listen(Name) -> %% Here we figure out what port we want to listen on. Port = epmdless:dist_port(Name), %% Set both \"min\" and \"max\" variables, to force the port number to %% this one. ok = application:set_env(kernel, inet_dist_listen_min, Port), ok = application:set_env(kernel, inet_dist_listen_max, Port), %% Finally run the real function! inet_tcp_dist:listen(Name). select(Node) -> inet_tcp_dist:select(Node). accept(Listen) -> inet_tcp_dist:accept(Listen). accept_connection(AcceptPid, Socket, MyNode, Allowed, SetupTime) -> inet_tcp_dist:accept_connection(AcceptPid, Socket, MyNode, Allowed, SetupTime). setup(Node, Type, MyNode, LongOrShortNames, SetupTime) -> inet_tcp_dist:setup(Node, Type, MyNode, LongOrShortNames, SetupTime). close(Listen) -> inet_tcp_dist:close(Listen). childspecs() -> inet_tcp_dist:childspecs().\n\nMostly stubs here; it’s just the listen/1 function that sets the inet_dist_listen_min and inet_dist_listen_max variables according to our node name, before passing control to the real module, inet_tcp_dist .\n\n(Note that while inet_tcp_dist is the default module, it only provides unencrypted connections over IPv4. If you want to use IPv6, you would use inet6_tcp_dist , and if you want to use Erlang distribution over TLS, that would be inet_tls_dist or inet6_tls_dist . Adding that flexibility is left as an exercise for the reader.)\n\nAnd we’re ready! Now we can start two nodes, foo1 and foo2 , and have them connect to each other:\n\nerl -proto_dist epmdless -start_epmd false -epmd_module epmdless_epmd_client -sname foo1\n\nerl -proto_dist epmdless -start_epmd false -epmd_module epmdless_epmd_client -sname foo2\n\nSystem working?\n\n(foo2@poki-sona-sin)1> net_adm:ping('foo1@poki-sona-sin'). pong\n\nSeems to be!\n\nOnce more, with Elixir!\n\nOf course, since Erlang and Elixir run on the same virtual machine, there is nothing stopping us from doing all of this in Elixir instead.\n\nIn Elixir, we can put all the code in a single file, and the compiler will compile it into the different modules we require:\n\n# A module containing the function that determines the port number # based on a node name. defmodule Epmdless do def dist_port(name) when is_atom(name) do dist_port Atom.to_string name end def dist_port(name) when is_list(name) do dist_port List.to_string name end def dist_port(name) when is_binary(name) do # Figure out the base port.

  "latent_14267": "Nine years ago, controversy erupted regarding a Christian school in the UK (Emmanuel College, Gateshead), which openly challenged the theory of evolution in its lessons and taught creationism alongside evolution.\n\nOne of the school’s defenders, journalist Melanie Phillips, quoted Emmanuel’s head teacher Nigel McQuoid and the former head John Burns, who stated that ‘the school should teach both evolution and creation theory [my italics], and that both are ‘faith positions [my italics].’[1]\n\nYou may think that this issue is now old hat, a storm in a tea cup that has long subsided. You may well be mistaken; if opinion polls are to be believed, such views appear to be gaining traction in the UK. One recent poll suggested that more than ‘half of [the UK] public believe that the theory of evolution cannot explain the full complexity of life on Earth, and a “designer” must have lent a hand, and one in three believe that God created the world within the past 10,000 years.’[2]\n\nThis article has no intention of rehashing the specifics of the Emmanuel College controversy.[3] But since the views expressed in Phillips’ defence of the school appear to be gaining ground, the misunderstandings and misrepresentation that inform them deserve challenge. We will take Phillips’ article as representative of these views in order to develop a wider critique. In doing so, we will demonstrate that it is totally false to bracket evolution with creationism as a ‘faith position’.\n\nAlthough Phillips has distanced herself from creationism in recent writings, she still defends Intelligent Design (ID), claiming that ID has its roots in science, whereas creationism does not.[4] We will see that such a distinction will not hold up under closer scrutiny, so we will also consider the shortcomings of ID as well as creationism throughout this article, as neither position presents anything like a credible scientific alternative to Darwinism.\n\nBack in 2002, Phillips asked rhetorically:\n\nWhat is wrong with a Christian school encouraging its pupils to debate and question such great matters from different perspectives?[5]\n\nThere is nothing wrong with encouraging debate. But if any school were to teach creationism (or ID) in science classes there would be something seriously wrong with that. It would be like teaching that the Earth is flat in geography classes.\n\nThis didn’t seem to trouble Ms. Phillips:\n\nIt is being said that taxpayers’ money should not be spent on teaching creationism because this runs contrary to scientific fact. But evolution is not a fact. It is a theory with holes in it … In science, teachers and pupils discuss the gaps that Darwin himself acknowledged in his theory of evolution.[6]\n\nPhillips claimed that Darwin himself acknowledged gaps in his theory but she didn’t actually quote Darwin or any other scientist to support her claim. And neither does her claim that Darwinism has ‘holes in it’ invalidate the assertion that ‘creationism runs contrary to scientific fact.’\n\nBut still, let’s turn to the question of whether evolution is a ‘theory’ or a ‘faith position.’ I take theory in this context to mean ‘speculation’ and faith position to mean that the evidence as it stands does not lean toward creationism or Darwinism. Hence, on the evidence there is, it is equally reasonable to opt to ‘believe’ in either.\n\nHere we should introduce Jerry A. Coyne’s excellent recent book, Why Evolution is True,[7] which tackles the misunderstandings about Darwinian theory head-on. Evolution is a theory, but that does not make it speculation. In science a theory is much more than speculation about how things are: it is ‘a well thought-out group of propositions meant to explain facts about the real world.’ Second, for a theory to be scientific, as opposed to mere speculation, it must be ‘testable and able to make verifiable predictions’ and, third, ‘the scientific theories can be tested against other theories.’[8] [author’s emphasis]\n\nBut the theory goes better than predictions: it makes retrodictions, facts and data not necessarily predicted by evolution, but that only make sense in the light of it. We’ll look at examples of these later.\n\nIn other words, the facts about nature support the theory of evolution, and the theory itself makes sense of facts about nature.\n\nWhat facts, then, support the theory of evolution – what predictions does it make that have been confirmed? I will confine myself to a few salient examples Coyne offers.\n\nFirst of all there is the movement from simplicity to complexity. If life has evolved ever greater complexity over eons of time, the theory predicts that the fossil record should show greater and greater complexity over time. The oldest layers of rocks contain simple fossils, younger layers more complex examples. Simple organisms evolved before complex ones, predicted ancestors before descendants, with transitional fossils. Evolution predicts this and these and the fossil record confirms the prediction.[9]\n\nSo take the largest mammal on Earth, the blue whale, the distant ancestor of which was a shallow-water dwelling hippopotamus. Fossil mammals have been found that existed 60 million years ago but no fossil whales exist at this point. These appear 30 million years ago. Therefore the theory predicts that the transitional forms from hippo to whale would appear between 60 and 30 million years ago. The transitional fossils have been found exactly as predicted, appearing between 60 and 30 million years ago.\n\nThen there is remodelling of the old into new: whales are elongated land animals with paddles that used to be forelimbs, and nostrils that have moved to the top of the head. ‘Darwinism predicts, then, that new species will be modified versions of older ones. The fossil record amply confirms this prediction.[10]\n\nIf species didn’t evolve, then there is no way their distribution on Earth would make sense. Marsupials like the platypus are not found outside Australia yet their oldest fossils, over 80 million years old, are not found in Australia but North America. The theory is that marsupials originated in North America and migrated southwards to Australia, reaching the tip of South America 40 million years ago and reaching the Australia around 30 million years ago. But how did they cross the South Atlantic? There was no ocean to cross: the continents were joined. The tip of South America was joined to what is now Antarctica, which in turn was joined to Australia. Marsupials migrated across Antarctica. If this is true, then marsupial fossils should be found in Antarctica, and they should be younger than those in South America but older than those in Australia. Scientists set out to prove just that and indeed did just that and they were of the right age, around 35 to 40 million years old.[11]\n\nPerhaps the greatest anathema to creationists and intelligent designers is the idea that humans descended from ‘apes’. What is the evidence for this? When Darwin made this prediction, in The Descent of Man, in 1871, there was very little fossil evidence around to back this up – just a handful of Neanderthal bones. He made this prediction on the basis of anatomy and behaviour. But since then, starting with the discovery of the ‘Southern Ape Man’ in South Africa in 1924 and ‘Lucy’ in 1974, among others, the evidence has been coming in.\n\nAs the fossils become more recent, we should see brains getting larger, teeth smaller and posture becoming more erect and this is what has been confirmed. It’s not possible with the existing stock of bones and fossils to trace a linear descent and this may never be possible, as all the links may never be found. But, as Darwin predicted, ‘fossils that start off ape-like … become more and more like modern humans as time passes.’[12]\n\nBut evolution doesn’t just make predictions, it explains facts about the natural world, or retrodictions.\n\nThe greatest of these is natural selection, the engine of evolution, which explains why there we see so much complexity and diversity in the natural world. There is no need for a supernatural designer or creator to feature at all in the creation of life. Natural selection does the job sufficiently well to dispense with their services. Selection is the adaptation of traits to enable an organism to better survive its environment and enhance its reproductive fitness. It is a combination of chance (a random mutation) and lawfulness (in that mutations which produce traits suited to survival will persist).\n\nThe hoverfly has black and yellow stripes, ‘imitating’ a wasp and signalling to predators that it is venomous and inedible. It’s not as if the hoverfly has purposely adapted itself. The adaptation is the result of a mutation in a gene, which confers on the hoverfly an excellent survival advantage. No one intended it or designed it. The process of mutation is widely understood and known and can be seen. Ask any dog breeder.\n\nWe know about the alarming tendency of bacteria to develop resistance to drugs.[13] This is a result of random genetic mutation occurring in pathogens, enabling them to survive and replicate, thus producing resistant strains. Creationism and ID cannot explain this phenomenon but evolution via natural selection can.\n\nThen there are the facts of vestiges, atavisms and bad design.[14] The most troublesome vestige for us is the appendix, which may once have served some purpose for our ancestors’ roughage-rich diet but now only serves to generate work for surgeons.\n\nThe presence of atavisms – re-expressions of ancestral traits – confirms that our genetic heritage carries the genes of long-extinct ancestors. One whale in 500 is born with a rear leg that protrudes outside the body wall. Whales still have genetic information to make legs, carried from their landlubber ancestors from millions of years ago. Successive generations of whales still carry these genes, albeit degraded, but, occasionally, these genes flicker back into life to instruct the creation of an utterly useless extra limb.\n\nGenes for redundant traits then do not disappear, they become dormant. Evolution predicts the existence of just such genes. In contrast, creationism would predict that no such genes would exist. If we do not descend from defunct ancestors, we would not be carrying their genes within us. But we do. Of our 30,000 genes, we humans carry a ‘graveyard’ of 2,000 dead or pseudo-genes. ID is hardly a better explanation – what an inefficient way of doing things!\n\nWe share with other primates and guinea pigs a dead gene for synthesising vitamin C. But neither primates, guinea pigs nor humans can synthesise vitamin C – we all have to take it through food. As Coyne writes: ‘if you believe that primates and guinea pigs were specially created, these facts don’t make sense. Why would a creator put a pathway for making vitamin C in all these species, and then deactivate it?[15]\n\nWe also carry the dead genes of viruses that tried to infect our ancestors but now sit safe and inactive. And, crucially, we share identical dead viruses with chimps, strongly suggesting the same viruses infected our mutual ancestor. Some of these sit in exactly the same location of in the chromosomes of chimps and humans. The probability of a dead virus inserting itself independently into the same place in two species is slight. But if the two species had a common ancestor, then this makes sense.\n\nSo when Coyne says evolution is true, he means the major tenets of the theory have been verified. There are controversies and divisions but that this is not the same thing as saying it’s not a fact because some mysteries remain unsolved.\n\nEvolution has not explained everything. Natural selection needs to explain a lot more than specific traits: can it account for complex traits, like the clotting of blood or the development of the human brain? There are complex biochemical processes the evolution of which is not yet entirely understood. And there are gaps in the fossil record that make systematic reconstruction of lineages difficult.\n\nGaps in evolution do not mean that the entire theory has no foundation or is just speculation. Moreover over time the gaps are becoming fewer. We know that birds came from dinosaurs. They were not created out of thin air. We have evidence of the evolution of complexity in the eye, with many types of eye, at various levels of complexity all around us. The precursors of complex biochemical processes such as clotting have been identified in invertebrates[16].\n\nBut still the existence of gaps allows proponents of ID to attempt to refute the theory. If there is complexity, and it is not entirely understood, then this is evidence for supernatural intervention.[17] But this is simply a ‘God of the gaps’ argument and explains and predicts nothing. If you do not have a complete understanding, then you postulate a God or supernatural designer to fill the gap. There is no way that this can be verified. It makes no sense whatsoever to explain facts about nature by appealing to something that is outside nature. This to me is the fatal flaw that undermines all appeals to ID: the idea is incoherent.\n\nFurther observation about the facts of the world undermines the plausibility of ID.\n\nNatural selection is a tinkerer, not a precision engineer. It works with the material it has. So some adaptations maximise reproductive fitness but are otherwise a disadvantage to the organism concerned. The peacock’s tail is fantastically well-adapted for attracting mates but also predators. Female sea turtles dig their nests on beaches with flippers, an arduous process. It would be better if they had shovel-like flippers but this would mean they couldn’t swim very well. Selection involves trade-offs.[18]\n\nAn intelligent designer could resolve this by giving the turtle an extra pair of retractable shovel-like limbs, or maybe giving the peacock a tail it could unfurl away outside mating season. Natural selection cannot do either of these things. It can only work with the existing framework but an all-powerful creator or designer by definition should not be limited by structural flaws.\n\nPercy Bridgman, Harvard Professor of Physics and tutor of Robert Oppenheimer, once remarked: ‘Scientists aren’t responsible for the facts that are in nature. If anyone should have a sense of sin, it’s God. He put the facts there.’[19] How indeed to explain these facts? Not all of them pretty facts, either. We’ve seen how drug-resistance bacteria evolve. Is the creator creating new resistant strains out of nothing or is the designer tweaking microbes’ DNA to develop resistance? How can we explain the existence of parasites like tapeworms? Are these the creations or the design of a benevolent deity? Why have 99% of species gone extinct? Is this really evidence of ID?\n\nIt is sometimes said that scientists are proselytisers and evangelicals for atheism and materialism. This is way off the mark. All scientific proof is provisional. New data may conceivably undermine Darwinism. The theory of evolution would not survive if fossils of Cro-Magnon were found in the same layer of rock as a Tyrannosaurus Rex. If this happened, this would refute the entire theory. But the theory is supported not because of a dogmatic refusal to countenance other possible theories but because the data support the theory.\n\nThe adherents of a literal version of the Christian faith cling to its tenets regardless of the evidence. Creationists hold that the Bible is the inerrant word of God. Therefore, if the sun stood still, as the book of Joshua claims it did, then it’s true. Needless to say, this is a physical impossibility, given that we know that sun does not revolve around the Earth. There are numerous instances in the Bible whereby the laws of nature are irrationally suspended, which modern science shows are simply impossible. Yes of course it is possible to say that this is metaphorical and allegorical. But that is beside the point. It isn’t science. Science is not fable.\n\nIt is therefore false to say that evolution and creationism are both ‘faith positions’, if by this it is meant that it is equally reasonable to believe or teach either position based on the evidence available. The evidence out there does not lean equally either way: it leans one way – and overwhelmingly so.\n\nScientific theory is not about utter, inerrant certainty and absolute truths, but degrees of plausibility. It’s not that one can prove beyond all reasonable doubt that evolution is true and creationism or ID is false: it is that one can show strong reasons for accepting (as opposed to ‘believing’) that evolution is true, while its detractors cannot show any strong reasons for acceptance. You can of course believe that creationism or ID is true if you so desire, but this is an act of will and faith, and cannot be supported by an appeal to evidence.\n\nEvolution is not a theory of everything and it does not have all the answers. Darwin called his book ‘The Origin of Species’, a fairly modest endeavour that set out how life came to be on Earth. He never called it the theory of everything. There are plenty of legitimate questions that evolution cannot answer. But it provides the best answer there is to why Earth isn’t a barren rock, but teems with life.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] All quotes taken from http://www.melaniephillips.com/articles/archives/000756.html (last accessed 27 Feb 2011).

  "latent_14432": "One of Britain's largest private landowners is betting that the London luxury property market is at its peak after warning of a housing bubble that will burst if interest rates rise as expected next year.\n\nThe Duke of Westminster has sold £240m of prime properties in central London over the past 12 months, his property company revealed yesterday, after admitting concern over escalating prices. Such has been the scale of demand for £30m-£50m houses in the capital that members of the globetrotting wealth set including Eric Schmidt, the billionaire chair of Google, have struggled to find a suitable London home.\n\nHowever, the finance director of the Duke's Grosvenor Group admitted that the luxury market could be on a precipice. \"There is a risk that a bubble is developing and that when inevitable interest rate rises occur … equity flows will reverse, placing values at risk,\" said Nicholas Scarfe. He added: \"We do not know when a correction will occur, but our own analysis indicates the prospect of a correction is becoming more likely.\"\n\nGrosvenor's concerns could have repercussions for the wider UK housing market if they spread to the rest of the capital's property stock. The behaviour of the London market has drawn warnings of a \"superbubble\" after posting a 17.7% rise in average prices to £458,000 in the year to February. But top-end housing is in the vanguard. Demand from foreign investors has pushed luxury home prices in London up by 68% since 2009, compared with a rise of 49% for the London market as a whole, according to Knight Frank.\n\nGrosvenor Group, headed by Gerald Grosvenor, one of Britain's richest men, has nonetheless reduced its exposure to luxury homes – as a landlord and property developer – in postcodes such as W1, SW1 and NW1. The properties sold last year include a row of mid-19th-century terraces on Grosvenor Crescent in Belgravia, which was bought by UK property firm Wainbridge for £114m.\n\nMark Preston, Grosvenor's chief executive, said: \"We had concern about the level of pricing at the top end, so we thought it would be prudent to go ahead and sell some developments.\" He added: \"I'm more concerned about it [top-end price growth] than I was last year.\"\n\nThe company is banking on more growth in the lower rungs of the London rental market to catch middle-income professionals who cannot get on the housing ladder. Branching out from its traditional turf, it is venturing south of the river to invest in building more affordable rental homes in Bermondsey.\n\nGrosvenor's top-end central London homes typically cost £1,750 per square foot to rent, which compares with £550-£600 per square foot in Bermondsey.\n\nMatthew Pointon, analyst at Capital Economics, backed Grosvenor's concerns that house price gains in the capital are not sustainable.

  "latent_14628": "For millions of years, the pangolin’s natural reserve had been its best defence. The only mammal with hard, plate-like scales, it looks something like a badger in chainmail – and at the merest hint of danger, the pangolin simply roles up into a tight ball that is nearly impossible for a predator to penetrate. The shell is so tough that it can even resist the teeth of lions, tigers and leopards.\n\nNot that many scientists have even been able to witness this behaviour themselves. There are eight species of pangolin across Asia and Africa, and they are all nocturnal, and notoriously shy, hiding in burrows and hollow trees for most of the day. Even conservationists working extensively in their natural habitats often struggle to catch sight of one. “I don’t think I’ve ever met someone who’s seen a wild pangolin,” says Timothy Bonebrake, a biologist at Hong Kong University (HKU).\n\nThis natural shyness may help the pangolin to hide from a careful conservationist, but it is no match for the more determined poacher. Using its distinctive footprint – the front claw curves inwards as it walks – to identify a local population, the hunter can then use trained dogs to sniff them out of their burrows, or a trap to capture them as they snuffle for food at night. Bonebrake remembers seeing the poachers at the side of the road in Cameroon, holding the pangolins by their tails as they flaunted them for sale.\n\nThe live pangolin is presented at the dinner table before the chef slits its throat in front of the guests - a guarantee of the meat’s freshness\n\nDecades ago, those animals may have just ended up in the local market; today, the majority are exported thousands of miles across the globe. Most consumers come from mainland China and Vietnam, where the keratin scales are an important ingredient for traditional medicines, and the meat is often prized as a delicacy at banquets. Ideally, the live pangolin is presented at the dinner table before the chef slits its throat in front of the guests, as a guarantee of the meat’s freshness. And as the pangolin populations in Asia dwindle, more and more are now being captured in Africa to meet the demand.\n\nIn total, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature estimates that a million pangolins may have crossed international borders in the last decade – making them the world’s most trafficked mammal.\n\nIf this continues, extinction will be inevitable. Natural populations are already half their number at the beginning of the millennium, and a series of large seizures during the past year would suggest that the demand is only increasing. “It’s very difficult to tell, but it seems like trade has crescendoed,” says Alexandra Andersson, an ecology PhD student at HKU and consultant for Humane Society International. “It’s mindboggling how much is coming through.”\n\nEach pangolin is thought to eat 70 million ants and termites a year\n\nThe wider environmental repercussions of this loss are largely unknown. “We’re seeing these declines in pangolins but will it have an effect on the ecosystems? We don’t know,” says Bonebrake. “But it could be that pangolins are really important.” Each pangolin is thought to eat 70 million ants and termites a year, for instance. “That’s pretty critical in terms of the ecosystem turnover.” Without this natural pest control, those areas may soon be overrun with insects.\n\nCompared to the dangers facing elephants, rhinos or tigers, however, the plight of the pangolin has failed to penetrate the public consciousness, particularly in the West. “It’s only in the last year or two that people have started to realise that pangolins are in trouble,” says Bonebrake. As the UK’s Prince William baldly put it, “the pangolin runs the risk of becoming extinct before most people have even heard of them”.\n\nSo how did this elusive, reticent creature become the focus of this billion-dollar industry? And what can be done to save it? To find out, I visited Bonebrake and Andersson in HKU’s “conservation forensics lab” – a group with a unique view of all kinds of animal trafficking.\n\nAs I soon discover, there are few better places to study wildlife crime: for various geographical, cultural, political and economic reasons, Hong Kong is a hub for the trafficking of many different endangered species. The rising threat facing the pangolin only makes sense in this broader context.\n\nI first meet Andersson in the Sheung Wan district, a 30-minute walk from the university. Along the way, she leads me past shop after shop selling shark’s fin and other forms of dried seafood. Like pangolin meat, the shark’s fin soup is often considered the centrepiece of a banquet. Its texture – a kind of “strandy silkiness” with a “gelatinous bite”, according to food writer Fuchsia Dunlop – may be part of the attraction; but so is the sheer expense of hunting and killing the shark, making it a symbol of wealth and power. “Emperors used to eat it as a delicacy, and it’s become popular because people want to demonstrate their status,” says Andersson.\n\nAlthough some shark’s fins are legal in Hong Kong, products from species such as the hammerhead are banned. Unfortunately, it’s currently very difficult to determine a fin's origins – making these shops the most visible front of the city’s illegal wildlife trade. “Short of testing each fin I don’t know what you can do,” says Andersson.\n\nThe trade of one particularly sought-after species of Mexican fish, the totoaba, is apparently as lucrative as cocaine\n\nOther goods are specifically valued for their medicinal properties. Alongside the shark fins we see dried fish bladders – or “maws” – hanging from the shop ceilings. The maws are traditionally used to cure joint pains and ease the discomfort of pregnancy and are even said to be aphrodisiacs. Again, certain species’ maws are legal, while the trade of other endangered species has been banned – but the stratospheric prices mean some traders are willing to take the risk. The trade of one particularly sought-after species of Mexican fish, the totoaba, is apparently as lucrative as cocaine.\n\nThe pangolin’s extinction may arise from similar (scientifically unproven) beliefs. The animal’s scales are simply made from keratin, the same stuff as fingernails and hair, meaning they should have little nutritional value, but practitioners of Chinese medicine believe that they can cure a number of ills. The benefits are thought to arise, in part, from their behaviour in the wild. “The first medical use of pangolin scales was to treat ant stings – because they eat ants,” says Cheng Wenda, a PhD student in Bonebrake’s lab. “And because pangolins dig holes, they believe they can open some blockage in your body.” Perhaps for these reasons, some practitioners claim the scales can improve fertility and that they can even fight cancer.\n\nThese beliefs are deeply embedded in the culture, and many residents in Hong Kong continue to follow the ancient recipes – as Andersson showed with a recent survey. “We found that 85% of the respondents thought that pangolin scales had medicinal value, even though there is no peer-reviewed evidence for this.”\n\nAs with the shark fins, there had been some confusion about which pangolin species could be imported: until recently, it was legal to trade certain quantities ofthe African species, but it was very hard for law enforcers or consumers to verify the source. That changed with a new ruling of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species in late 2016, which now protects all species equally. “That was a very big win – now it’s as clear as day, black and white,” says Andersson. Even so, she suspects that a few of the shops we pass may be trading in the scales, although we would have to work hard to gain their trust before the traders would admit it openly.\n\nIn any case, most of the imported animals pass through Hong Kong to the rest of China. Its status as a ‘free port’ – a legacy of British occupation – has meant that customs regulations are traditionally lax, and its location makes it an easy route to the nearby Guangdong province, where demand is particularly high. The region is famed for its ‘wild flavour’ cuisine, including the use of bush meats – although the use of more controversial ingredients is often sheathed in secrecy. Andersson, for instance, remembers enquiring about the possibility of eating pangolin meat at a restaurant in Guangzhou. “They initially said yeah, we can organise that for you,” Andersson says – only for the waiter to return, pretending that he had no recollection of the conversation.\n\nAfter our walk through the shark fin shops, Andersson takes me to her university department, where her colleagues help to explain why the illegal trade of animals – including pangolins – continues unabated. The primary explanation may be the rocketing Chinese economy, and the resulting consumerism, they say. “Whether it’s for medicinal use, or status – there are different reasons depending on what it is – more people want more stuff, and they’ve got more money to be able to buy it,” says Yvonne Sadovy, who is working on the conservation of threatened marine life.\n\nThis economic boom has also created a backbone of international trading links through China’s increasing investments abroad. Bonebrake witnessed this through his work in Cameroon, where Chinese investors are pouring money into the local infrastructure, in return for increased access to natural resources, like the local timber.\n\nThe cultural and economic connections between the two countries are impossible to ignore, he says. “Where I stay in Yaoundé in Cameroon – in that part of town, there are Chinese hotels, Chinese restaurants – all the writing’s in Chinese,” he says. “And every time you see a new road, you say, ‘where did this come from?’ And it’s the Chinese that built it.”\n\nAll of which allows the traders to slip in their illegal goods along with the legitimate imports. “There’s so much back and forth between these areas – it’s actually not such a big deal if you have some pangolin scales in one of the shipping containers,” he adds. “A lot of these huge pangolin seizures are just a consequence of the natural resources that are being extracted from Africa and coming to China.”\n\nIf you are going to transport 13,000kg of scales – it’s really a job that requires a lot of organisation - Alexandra Andersson\n\nThe sheer size of the latest seizures would suggest that large organised crime networks are masterminding this international trade. “If you are going to transport 13,000kg of scales – it’s really a job that requires a lot of organisation,” says Andersson. “I think there must be massive operations behind it.” Crucially, these criminals are not specialists: in many cases, the same organisations appear to be responsible for trafficking many different species.\n\nUnfortunately, wildlife trafficking in Hong Kong does not receive the same attention as other forms of organised crime. “There were 89 cases of pangolin smuggling between 2010 and 2015,” Andersson says, “and only nine proceeded with prosecution.” Often the penalties amount to a few months in jail, and a fine of a few thousand Hong Kong dollars. Given the value of the goods being traded – worth tens of millions – those penalties are a risk worth taking. “It’s like a business expense.” Alex Hofford, a wildlife campaigner for the charity WildAid who helped to expose Hong Kong’s illegal ivory trade, agrees that the penalties are “shockingly low”. “[The traffickers] know that if they do get caught, it’ll just be a slap on the wrist.”\n\nPerhaps pragmatically, the team at HKU are keen to emphasise that they do not see the government as their adversaries. “It’s quite easy to bash the government when it comes to these things, but the people that I’ve encountered are very passionate about it – but they have very little ability to do anything about it, either because they lack the legal mandate or just the funding,\" says David Baker, who specialises in marine ecology, and who has also examined the trading of various sea creatures. \"The number of personnel working on endangered species is quite low.”\n\nThey hope that by providing the necessary scientific tools, they will help to shape a more effective system. One aim is to demonstrate the existence of large syndicates behind the trading. “When we can really build the evidence to show that it is organised crime, it’ll be taken a lot more seriously,” says Sadovy. They also offer genetic testing to provide further clarity on the species of animals that are being traded, and “isotope analysis”, which can identify chemical traces to pinpoint the animal’s country of origin.\n\nComputational approaches can also build a more detailed picture of the trade. Cheng and Bonebrake recently analysed the data of recent pangolin seizures over the past eight years (amounting to more than 65,000 individual pangolins in total) to better understand the trading networks across China. Their initial analysis, published earlier this year, suggested that there are three particularly crucial hubs for the exchange of these creatures: Guangzhou, Fangchenggang (which borders Vietnam), and Kunming in the Yunnan province, a little farther north.\n\nFor Bonebrake, this kind of nuanced description is a crucial step forward. “One of the nice things is to break it down… to say that yes, it’s demand from China, but it’s these parts of China, where if we put in more effort, not just for law enforcement, but education and other attempts at demand reduction [of pangolins], we can actually have an impact.”\n\nAll of the team agree that greater public awareness of these issues is crucial, though they avoid criticising these ancient beliefs too strongly. “You know, I’m not saying that Chinese traditional medicine is wrong or bad or useless,” says Andersson. “The texts are thousands of years old and they have a strong resonance in the culture – but in the instances when mass consumerism on the industrial scale of these endangered species is happening, we need an alternative, because we don’t want them to disappear.”\n\nHearteningly, opinions are already changing towards some of the trafficked products. Sardovy, for instance, points to the fact that many young people refuse to serve the traditional shark’s fin at their wedding banquets. “To do that they really have to stand up to their parents and the older generation, which is tough,” she says. “It’s an exciting time, I think, to get the right messaging out now.”\n\nBaker agrees. “At this point in time we have a huge rise – almost a tidal wave – of environmentalism, not just in Hong Kong but also in mainland China. People are more educated and more aware of environmental issues and how their decision-making links to those environmental issues.” The pangolin has even attracted a high-profile ambassador, the Hong Kong actress Sharon Kwok, who is now devoted to educating people about its plight.\n\nIf that generation acts quickly, there may still be time to save the pangolin.\n\n--\n\nDavid Robson is BBC Future’s feature writer.

To develop this he had the experimental vessel Turbinia built in a light design of steel by the firm of Brown and Hood, based at Wallsend on Tyne in the Northeast of England.\n\nThe Admiralty was kept informed of developments, and Turbinia was launched on 2 August 1894.[1] Despite the success of the turbine engine, initial trials with one propeller were disappointing. After discovering the problem of cavitation and constructing the first cavitation tunnel, Parsons' research led to his fitting three axial-flow turbines to three shafts, each shaft in turn driving three propellers, giving a total of nine propellers.[2] In trials this achieved a top speed of more than 34 knots (63 km/h; 39 mph), so that \"the passengers aboard would be convinced beyond all doubt Turbinia was Charles Parsons' winning North Sea greyhound\".\n\nThe turbines were directly driven, as geared turbines were not introduced until 1910. Even after the introduction of geared turbines, efficiency of even the largest axial steam turbines was still below 12 percent. Turbinia was even less efficient, with its direct drive turbine moving with a top speed of just 30 metres per second. Despite this, it was a dramatic improvement over predecessors.[3]\n\nDemonstration [ edit ]\n\nTurbinia at the Spithead Navy Review, 1897. at the Spithead Navy Review, 1897.\n\nParsons' ship turned up unannounced[4] at the Navy Review for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria at Spithead, on 26 June 1897, in front of the Prince of Wales, foreign dignitaries and Lords of the Admiralty. As an audacious publicity stunt, Turbinia, which was much faster than any ship at the time, raced between the two lines of navy ships and steamed up and down in front of the crowd and princes, while easily evading a navy picket boat that tried to pursue her, almost swamping it with her wake.\n\nPhotographer and cinematographer Alfred J. West took several photographs of Turbinia traveling at full speed at the Review. He was subsequently invited by Sir Charles Parsons to film and photograph the vessel within the River Tyne and the adjacent North Sea; the pictures captured remain the defining image of Turbinia at speed.[5]\n\nTurbinia lying in dry dock The damagedlying in dry dock\n\nTurbinia alongside RMS Mauretania alongside RMS\n\nTurbinia on display at Newcastle Discovery Museum, 2013 on display at Newcastle Discovery Museum, 2013\n\nFrom this clear demonstration of her speed and power and after further high speed trials attended by the Admiralty, Parsons set up the Turbinia Works at Wallsend, which then constructed the engines for two turbine-powered destroyers for the Navy, HMS Viper and HMS Cobra, that were launched in 1899. Both vessels were later lost but although the loss of these trial ships slowed the introduction of turbines, the Admiralty had been convinced. In 1900 Turbinia steamed to Paris and was shown to French officials and then displayed at the Paris Exhibition.\n\nThe first turbine-powered merchant vessel, the Clyde steamer TS King Edward, followed in 1901. The Admiralty confirmed in 1905 that all future Royal Navy vessels were to be turbine-powered, and in 1906 the first turbine-powered battleship, the revolutionary HMS Dreadnought, was launched.\n\nCrosby incident [ edit ]\n\nOn 11 January 1907, Turbinia was struck and nearly cut in two by Crosby – a ship being launched across-river from the south bank of the Tyne. She was repaired and steamed alongside RMS Mauretania (also a turbine-powered vessel) after the launch of the great ocean liner. However, mechanical problems prevented Turbinia from accompanying Mauretania down the River Tyne to the sea.\n\nAs a museum ship [ edit ]\n\nThe company decided to slow down the deterioration of Turbinia by lifting her out of the water in 1908, and in 1926 the directors of the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company offered the ship to the Science Museum, London.[6] Turbinia was cut in two and the aft section, complete with engines and propellers, was put on display in the South Kensington museum in London, which did not have the space to accommodate the full ship. The fore section was presented in 1944 to Newcastle Corporation and placed on display in the city's Exhibition Park. In 1959, the Science Museum took the aft section of Turbinia off display and by 1961, using a reconstructed centre section, Turbinia was once more complete and on display in the Newcastle Municipal Museum of Science and Industry. In 1983 a complete reconstruction was undertaken.[7]\n\nOn 30 October 1994, 100 years after her launch, Turbinia was moved to Newcastle's Museum of Science and Engineering (later renamed The Discovery Museum) and put on display to the public in March 1996. Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, in 2000, the vessel was the focal point of a year-long £10.7 million redevelopment programme at the Discovery Museum. The gallery around Turbinia was the first area to be refurbished, with the main part of the work involving raising the roof by one storey to create viewing galleries on three levels.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nCoordinates:",
  "latent_15003": "FOXBORO — The Patriots can’t afford to lose Nick Caserio.\n\nThey can absolutely afford to keep him.\n\nCaserio is again a coveted commodity as teams are seeking to fill key voids, and the 49ers are hoping to woo him as their general manager. The Patriots director of player personnel interviewed with the Dolphins in 2014, and he’ll almost certainly continue to receive similar propositions unless he earns a more prominent job title because teams can’t request to interview contracted employees for lateral movement.\n\nCaserio, who is under contract with the Patriots through at least 2020, makes about $2 million per year, according to a source. It’s decent money, but don’t underestimate a team like the 49ers that may covet him so passionately that they would offer double his salary.\n\nThe 41-year-old undoubtedly enjoys his place with the Patriots, but it’d be irresponsible to discount the human element of this process. While the pay raise could be significant, the opportunity to turn around a franchise as rich as the 49ers could be undeniably enticing. It might even be Hall of Fame-worthy depending on the long-term success of such a venture.\n\nRemember, former Patriots vice president of player personnel Scott Pioli was always happy with the organization and his working relationship with Bill Belichick, but the Chiefs reeled him in as their general manager in 2009. The chance to have the final say in a front office was too salivating to ignore.\n\nLike Pioli, maybe the Patriots won’t ever give Caserio the general manager tag. If that remains off the table, a significant salary bump could keep his mind from wandering when opponents request a job interview. Or if the Pats do elevate his title, the symbolic promotion wouldn’t necessarily need to be accompanied by Caserio having final say over the roster, which belongs to Belichick. Just use the Seahawks as an example, as coach Pete Carroll runs the show while general manager John Schneider works in harmony alongside him.\n\nCaserio’s value can’t be undersold. Of course, he takes the lead on negotiations with contracts and trades. Last offseason when the Patriots courted restricted free agent Chris Hogan, Belichick’s sit-down with the wide receiver never touched on money. When they parted, Belichick affirmed to Hogan that Caserio would ensure the deal would be executed, and they struck a creative three-year, $12 million pact.\n\nCaserio also orchestrated recent trades for tight end Martellus Bennett, cornerback Eric Rowe and linebackers Kyle Van Noy and Barkevious Mingo. And Caserio’s pro personnel department properly scouted linebacker Shea McClellin, defensive end Chris Long and Hogan before the offseason signings. To varying degrees, those veterans were discarded by their former employers before fitting in seamlessly with the Patriots.\n\nCaserio’s role has increased substantially since 2013 when Floyd Reese departed, though he has had the same job title since 2008. It took a certain level of on-the-job training to master these negotiating tactics, so the loss of him would serve as a setback from that perspective, even if they elevated their trusted director of college scouting Monti Ossenfort.\n\nThere’s a reason for Caserio’s comfort level within the front office as it has translated to his ability to locate well-suited players for the system. Caserio attends virtually every practice, a Belichick mandate that he picked up from Bill Parcells, and he re-watches every practice tape in his office. Caserio frequently meets with the entire coaching staff and exchanges player evaluations, so he understands precisely what type of player each positional coach wants in his room.\n\nCaserio, who beat out Josh McDaniels at quarterback at John Carroll University, also enjoys the chance to be more actively involved at practice, particularly during positional drills.\n\n“He still thinks he’s a quarterback,” Jimmy Garoppolo laughed. “He gets in there and mixes it up a little bit.”\n\nCaserio’s longstanding bond with McDaniels has served the Patriots well on game days, too. Caserio is wired into McDaniels’ headset so he can relay defensive personnel notes that can help with the Pats’ offensive play calls.\n\nSo again, this is not someone the Patriots should want to lose, even if Caserio has little desire to leave. Former Pats front-office gurus Bob Quinn (Lions), Jon Robinson (Titans), Jason Licht (Buccaneers), Thomas Dimitroff and Pioli (Falcons) all led their franchises to major turnarounds in 2016, and Caserio is as highly regarded around the league as all of them, if not even more so.\n\nThere’s no need for the Patriots to allow another organization to reap the benefits of Caserio’s rapid ascension when they’ve got the means to keep him in place in Foxboro.",
  "latent_15010": "Image by CraftersNews via Flickr\n\nI recently came across a clever but depressing little website called See Your Folks. When you get to the site, you plug in a few simple facts, like how many times you see your parents per year and how old they are. Then See Your Folks calculates for you how many times you’re likely to see them … before they die. It turns out that my number is 252.\n\nThis reality check has reminded me again how absolutely crucial it is to find ways to step outside of the moment and see any business venture for what it is: one part of a life’s work, not your entire reality.\n\nAfter all, for a while now the line between my professional life and personal life has been pretty blurry. Don’t get me wrong: Transforming a tiny startup into a global tech company has been a thrill. But it’s left me with a lot less time to see my parents.\n\nSo, since resolution season is upon us, maybe it’s time I made one. In 2014, I resolve to find more ways to maintain a healthy and holistic perspective on life. If you find yourself checking work emails while you’re out with friends, spending less time with the family and worrying about Monday morning on Saturday afternoon, it might just be time to add that resolution your list, as well.\n\nSo what does a healthy, holistic perspective look like? I don’t have all the secrets, but I think work-life balance is key. For some people that could mean slotting in more yoga, golf or short vacations. For others, it’s more quality time with family and friends. Social media can actually be a useful tool to stay connected, too. Every day, I turn to Twitter and Facebook from my office to commiserate, celebrate and bounce ideas off of friends and colleagues. Use social media and technology to your benefit—take a few minutes out of each day to reach out to people you care about.\n\nHaving a healthy and holistic outlook on life is also about keeping your sights set on the bigger picture and finding a greater sense of purpose beyond the day-to-day (Believe it or not, Russell Brand seems to be doing a lot of this lately.) Earlier this year, we secured a $165 million investment, a number that I couldn’t have imagined 5 years ago. With all that capital, comes a whole new set of responsibilities. For me that could have meant prioritizing my work even more … and putting off that trip to the parents for another few months.\n\nBut I also have bigger goals with my life—like supporting youth entrepreneurship and innovation through The Next Big Thing foundation. These things, I’ve found, keep me focused and grounded through career moments both high and low.\n\n252 times … that really puts things into perspective. Time, and life, wait for no one—no matter how important your job may be.\n\nWhat will you do in 2014 to step outside of your every day and see your life for what it really is?",

Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen – and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack.

  "latent_15256": "After a search that spanned nearly a century, genealogists in Toronto have helped a Scottish family track down the unmarked grave of a relative who died after serving in the First World War.\n\nIan Hector Steven's family knew that he emigrated to Canada from Glasgow in the early 20th century and had married.\n\nThey knew that Hector, as he was known, was wounded fighting with the Canadian military, that he won a medal for his service, and that he died shortly afterwards.\n\n​But for years they didn't know the circumstances of his death, whether he left behind any children, or where he was buried.\n\nThe search for Hector's descendents began shortly after his death. His sisters posted notices in Canadian newspapers, hoping his widow would get in touch, but they never heard back. When the Second World War broke out and Canadian troops were sent to Europe, Hector's family hoped one of his descendents might seek them out.\n\n\"When the war ended in 1945 and no young Canadian had come and rattled the door and said that he was the son of or the daughter of Ian Hector, the matter just went dead within the family,\" said Hector's nephew, Rev. Harold Steven.\n\nNearly giving up\n\nAside from one fruitless visit to the Parliament buildings in Ottawa while he was in Canada visiting his son at McGill University about 10 years ago, Steven had essentially given up on finding his uncle — until about 18 months ago.\n\nBy chance, Steven, now in his mid-80s, came across an article in The Scots magazine about a new history project at the University of Edinburgh. Researchers were looking for the \"war dead who had slipped through the net of recognition,\" as he put it.\n\nA historian at the university put him in touch with another Scottish researcher, who found that Hector had lived in Toronto. When Steven contacted the Toronto city clerk's office, they suggested he get in touch with Mount Pleasant Group of Cemeteries, which could check if Hector was listed on any of their 10 sites.\n\nGraves for thousands of Canadians that fought in the First World War can be found overseas in countries like France. (Lara Chatterjee/CBC)\n\nHe wasn't — but the manager of the cemetery's genealogy team, Sue Henderson, was intrigued. She got in touch with Heather Ioannou, whom she knew from the Toronto branch of the Ontario Genealogical Society. Ioannou, who has lived in Canada for decades but was raised in Scotland, was equally interested. She searched through Ontario's vital statistics archive and found a record of Hector's 1918 death in the York County Death Registry.\n\n\"I sent it to Sue, and we both went to Google Maps, and it was like somebody smacking us over the head,\" she said.\n\nThe address listed as the site of Hector's death was just down the street from St. John's Norway Cemetery in Toronto's east end.\n\n'They found him'\n\nIoannou and Henderson were able to confirm with the cemetery's staff that Hector was in fact buried in St. John's. Finally, Steven had an answer to the question his family had been unable to answer for decades.\n\n\"They found him,\" he said. \"I was thrilled to bits.\"\n\nThat discovery allowed Ioannou and Henderson to rapidly uncover more information: the precise date and location of Hector's arrival in Canada (he arrived in Quebec's Eastern Townships in May 1913), his cause of death (bronchial pneumonia after influenza, sustained as a result of a military injury). War diaries from his regiment, discovered by Ioannou, showed that Hector had fought as part of Canadian expeditionary forces in France.\n\nHector was buried with his wife, an English woman named Evie Lacey, who had died of the Spanish flu 11 days after her husband. The grave was unmarked because it belonged to Lacey's mother, who likely couldn't afford a headstone, and who returned to England shortly after her daughter's death.\n\nBecause the grave's deed was registered to someone outside the Steven family, they weren't legally allowed to set up a headstone. So Steven contacted the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which ruled that because Hector's death was related to his war injuries, he was eligible for a military headstone.\n\nThis afternoon, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission will honour the soldier by placing a headstone on his grave during a ceremony at St. John's Norway Cemetery.\n\nIoannou says her work isn't over. The Ontario Genealogical Society searches for war deaths \"literally every day,\" she said.\n\n\"There are some families who never know what happened to their loved one.\"",
  "latent_15414": "The obvious reason to prevent a tax hike by extending current tax rates is that doing so will prevent further economic harm to an already flat economy. How do we know that tax increases will cause economic harm? Three examples: 1932, 1937 and 1993.\n\nAfter the 1929 stock market crash, the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 raised import prices and more importantly threw a bucket of cold water on global trade flows, helping send the economy into deep depression. The economy had very little chance to recover. Along with gross and ongoing monetary policy mismanagement, President Hoover raised taxes in 1932. The consequences were devastating. As Alan Reynolds points out:\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover asked for a temporary tax increase…in June 1932, raising the top income tax rate from 25% to 63% and quadrupling the lowest tax rate from 1.1% to 4%. That didn’t help confidence or the Treasury. Revenue from the individual income tax dropped from $834 million in 1931 to $427 million in 1932 and $353 million in 1933.\n\nThis caused a “double-dip” recession, sky-rocketing the unemployment rate to well above 20 percent. After 1933, the economy showed glimmers of recovery: unemployment dropped from near 25 percent in 1934 to under 15 percent in 1937, and economic activity was picking up. Contrary to Keynesian conventional wisdom, however, the recovery didn’t come as a result of New Deal spending. Christina Romer, former chief economic advisor to President Obama, makes clear: “Fiscal policy played a relatively small role in stimulating recovery in the United States.” Rather, the initial recovery happened largely because of monetary expansion, the “money supply increased nearly 42 percent between 1933 and 1937,” according to Ms. Romer.\n\nUnfortunately, President Roosevelt made the same crucial mistake President Hoover made 5 years earlier, so the recovery didn’t last. FDR raised taxes sharply in 1937 in an attempt to balance the budget. Once tax increases took effect, the economy collapsed into another recession – the second stage of the double-dip which lasted into WWII.\n\nLate in 1945 under President Truman’s leadership, Congress cut marginal tax rates and rather than sliding back into recession as many had feared, the economy soared toward full-employment.\n\nAs Burt Fulsom writes:\n\nCongress reduced taxes. Income tax rates were cut across the board. FDR’s top marginal rate, 94% on all income over $200,000, was cut to 86.45%. The lowest rate was cut to 19% from 23%, and with a change in the amount of income exempt from taxation an estimated 12 million Americans were eliminated from the tax rolls entirely.\n\nCorporate tax rates were trimmed and FDR’s “excess profits” tax was repealed, which meant that top marginal corporate tax rates effectively went to 38% from 90% after 1945….By the late 1940s, a revived economy was generating more annual federal revenue than the U.S. had received during the war years, when tax rates were higher. Price controls from the war were also eliminated by the end of 1946. The U.S. began running budget surpluses.\n\nThe disastrous mistakes from Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt underscore the importance that Washington not raise taxes in a weak economy. But that doesn’t stop the Left from advancing the notion. They point to Clinton’s record as proof. After all, Congress pushed through a big tax increase under President Clinton, and the economy boomed, right?\n\nWell, the truth is that the real boom didn’t happen until after 1997, the year Clinton cut taxes. From 1993-1996, a time when the economy was recovering from recession so expected growth should be strong, real economic growth averaged 3.2 percent and 11.2 million jobs were added. During the period 1997-2000 real economic growth averaged 4.2 percent and employment increased by 11.5 million jobs.\n\nHeritage senior fellow JD Foster adds:\n\nThe first period, from 1993 to 1996, began with a significant tax increase as the economy was accelerating out of recession. The second period, from 1997 to 2000, began with a modest tax cut as the economy should have settled into a normal growth period. The economy was decidedly stronger following the tax cut than it was following the tax increase.\n\nIn summary, coming out of a recession into a period when the economy should grow relatively rapidly, President Clinton signed a major tax increase. The average growth rate over his first term was a solid 3.2 percent. In 1997, at a time when the expansion was well along and economic growth should have slowed, Congress passed a modest net tax cut. The economy grew by a full percentage point-per-year faster over his second term than over Clinton’s first term.”\n\nThe evidence is in: tax increases are damaging to economic growth and job creation no matter what point of the business cycle. In a weak economy, like ours today, tax increases are especially ill advised, as Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt discovered. But even in a bustling economy tax hikes hurt growth and prosperity, as they did in the 1990s under President Clinton. That we’re having a national debate about this from an economic standpoint at a time of instability and weakness is a sign of deliberate disregard of historical precedence and favor of ideological righteousness over economic concern.",

  "latent_15514": "Not being a racist really isn’t that hard. For most people in the Labour movement, it’s programmed into their DNA. My earliest memories of being a Labour activist are of being the one man in the pub who doesn’t laugh along with the casual racism, of being the canvasser who can’t resist pushing back when people repeat the tabloid guff about immigrants being given free houses and swimming pools, the bloke prepared to start an argument at a football match when someone next to you tries to start a racist chant. A great many other Labour activists have stories like these.\n\nAnd yet undoubtedly we do now have a major problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Why is this? How did we get to here? Why is anti-Semitism – for so long something associated with the Far Right in politics – now something that is increasingly associated with us in the Labour Party? How did we become a Party that a considerable number of British Jews not just distrust, but are genuinely fearful of?\n\nThe answer clearly lies in the politics of the Middle East, and the conflation of support for the Palestinian cause with anti-Semitic attitudes and arguments. The Israel/Palestine conflict is a complex political problem. In my view, for too long people on all sides in the UK have approached it in a binary fashion, shamelessly adopting a stance on the conflict as an identity badge of their wider political positioning. Whether it’s bourgeois red-brick undergraduates donning kufiyahs in an attempt to look a bit more radical, or sharp-suited politicos trying to get into the LFI reception at Conference, there has been a notion for too long in the UK that when it comes to the Middle East you have to pick a side. Furthermore, the side you pick will say quite a lot about you.\n\nAnd so we seem to struggle to reconcile the obvious fact the criticising Israeli policy is not in itself anti-Semitic, whilst acknowledging we know some racists do attempt to use the Israel/Palestine conflict as a means to push anti-Semitic views they wouldn’t otherwise get away with.\n\nYet, given a modicum of serious thought, this really isn’t that hard at all.\n\nI am a supporter of the state of Israel and I am a supporter of the creation of a viable a Palestinian state. I admire Israel as one of the few genuine democracies in the Middle East, a country where Arab Israelis have more rights than Arabs in any other country in the region, and where a considerable proportion of the civilian population live with the understanding that they and their children face mortal danger every day simply going about their lives.\n\nAt the same time, I deplore the continued expansion of illegal settlements, of the ongoing occupation, and of the denial of a contiguous Palestinian state alongside Israel. I would make the case (and I often do) that this is as much against the interests of Israelis as it is the Palestinians. But that’s not really the point. The point is that it’s fairly obvious that criticising Israeli policy is a million miles away from anti-Semitism, and anti-Semites need to stop shamelessly pretending the charge is being deployed against them to limit their own freedom of expression.\n\nBecause mine are not niche positions – they are actually shared by a significant number of Israelis themselves. And once people are prepared to leave behind their binary positions, they can uncover a whole range of people who live in this part of the world whose actions confound this paradigm and who give hope to the rest of the world. On a trip out there with Christian Aid I saw Physicians for Human Rights, a group of Israeli doctors, go into Palestinian refugee camps to provide free healthcare. I was taken around towns by members of Breaking the Silence, who are former and in some cases current reservists in the IDF, and listened to them tell me in very clear terms why they oppose the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nIt seems to me entirely straightforward that criticising current Israeli Government policy is entirely legitimate, but arguing against the right of Israel to exist, or peddling guff about the media being controlled by “Zionists”, or objecting to the University of Birmingham on the basis that it has a large Jewish society, are simply the opinions of unreconstructed racists.\n\nSo how then can we solve this?\n\nThere are several initiatives being presented from various parts of the Labour Party in the wake of this shameful shambles. Most focus on practical ways to increase the speed, rigour and decisiveness with which we root out any whiff of anti-Semitism or other forms of racism or faith-based persecution. Some also look at how we go back to basics and proactively wipe out any culture of bias within the party. Some go further and suggest ways in which we officially recognise representation from the Jewish community within our party structures, so that we can more clearly lead from within on this issue. I unambiguously welcome all these proposals, and hope that the party will show strong leadership by quickly examining and adapting them.\n\nHowever, I would also appeal for something else. I wholly and deeply understand why friends and colleagues who are Jewish have felt they have to leave Labour. In some senses the greater question is actually how can any of us, Jewish or non-Jewish, stand back and sit this debate out. But today I make this appeal: please do not use resigning your membership as the tool by which you raise your concerns. We need all supporters of Labour to have representation in our membership ranks, to have a voice in our policy procedures, and a vote in our rule changes. We cannot fix this thoroughly and lastingly if we further become “us and them”. I stand with the Jewish Labour Party members. Please stay, and stand with me too. Together we can stamp out anti-Semitism and regain our pride as the party of equality and inclusion.\n\nJonathan Reynolds is the Labour and Co-op MP for Stalybridge and Hyde",
  "latent_15597": "July 31, 2014\n\nThe NSA’s Patents, in One Searchable Database\n\nShane Harris\n\nForeign Policy\n\nJuly 30, 2014\n\nWhat do a voice identifier, an automated translator, a “tamper-indicating” document tube, and a supersecure manhole cover have in common? They’re all technologies for which the secretive National Security Agency (NSA) has been granted patents by the U.S. government, giving the agency the exclusive rights to its inventions.\n\nThe four technologies represent a tiny fraction of the more than 270 sleuthy devices, methods, and designs for which the nation’s biggest intelligence agency has been granted a patent since 1979, the earliest year for which public figures are available. As the patent holder, the NSA can license the particular technology – for a fee – to anyone who wants to use it, so long as the patent hasn’t expired.\n\nThe NSA’s cryptologists and computer scientists have been busy over the years inventing methods of encrypting data, analyzing voice recordings, transferring digital files, and removing distortion from intercepted communications – all things you’d expect from the world’s largest and most sophisticated eavesdropping agency. And the digital spooks have patented gadgets straight out of a James Bond flick, such as tamper-indicating envelopes and finely tuned radio antennas.\n\nBut then, inexplicably, is a patent for a new-and-improved child car seat, which can be modified to accommodate both toddlers and older, taller kids.* The national security benefits of this device are neither obvious nor spelled out in the patent. But the car seat’s inventors promise to finally overcome a “well known … measure of inconvenience” plaguing parents across America, who are forced to install new, bigger car seats as their children grow up, the patent states.\n\nForeign Policy obtained the NSA’s list of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. You can download the entire list here or browse the patents by the dates they were filed. We’ve linked each one to the underlying documents, which include plain-language descriptions, the name of the particular inventor, and in some cases diagrams of the device.\n\nList of All Patents Filed by the NSA\n\nScroll through the list to see patents filed by the NSA through the years. Click through on each to see full details from the Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nThe NSA employs tens of thousands of cryptologists, mathematicians, and computer scientists who routinely come up with novel ways to protect – and steal – electronic data. As a rule, the agency tries to claim the legal rights to its employees’ inventions, an agency spokesperson said. But in some circumstances, employees can claim the rights or file a patent on devices they invented on their own time, even if those inventions are based on knowledge that they accumulated while working at the agency.\n\nThat’s the case with former NSA Director Keith Alexander, who told FP in an interview on Monday, July 28, that he will seek as many as nine new patents for a computer security system he’s building at his consulting business, IronNet Cybersecurity Inc. Alexander led the NSA for nearly nine years, and he also served as the commander of U.S. Cyber Command. Those two positions gave him rare and privileged access to some of the most classified information in the government and could give him a leg up on other cybersecurity entrepreneurs.\n\nAs busy as the NSA’s inventors have been, the agency is far from the most prolific patent-filer. That title goes to the Navy, which obtained 383 patents in 2013 – unsurprising since the armed forces are constantly coming up with new weapons, communications, and sensing technologies, patent lawyers said. (The Army, with 155 patents, and the Air Force, with 44, were also big patent holders.)\n\nStill, at the NSA, the last decade has been one for the patent record books. The agency has obtained 127 patents since 2005 – the year that Alexander became director. During his time in office (Alexander retired in March), the NSA obtained almost as many patents as it did in the previous 25 years.\n\n*Correction, July 30, 2014. An eagle-eyed reader (sadly) points out that the NSA did not actually invent a car seat. Becuase of a clerical error, the patent was never changed to refelct the actual asignee, Chrysler Corporation. At the end of this document is a “certificate of correction” from 1993 that was, apparently, never processed. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Web site still lists the NSA as the car seat’s patent holder. (Return to reading.)",

Other government officials and lawmakers proposed additional bans that would have prevented in-flight calls even if the FCC ban was eliminated.\n\nFor example, US Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in December 2013 that his department would consider imposing its own ban on in-flight calls.

  "latent_15785": "(By Jerome Miron / USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThese are heady times for the Redskins and their quarterback, heading into Sunday’s playoff game against the Packers. Just listen to this response from Terrance Knighton, when CSN’s Brian Mitchell asked what needs to happen for Washington to win.\n\n“We play Redskins football,” Knighton said. “And that’s Kirk going out there, controlling the clock, not turning the ball over, us establishing the run game. And on defense us getting off the field, creating three and outs, and putting the ball in our quarterback’s hand. Man, right now he’s a hot shooter. In basketball, get the ball to the hot shooter. So he’s our Steph Curry right now.”\n\nNo, Knighton isn’t saying Cousins is an MVP candidate. Just that he’s a hot shooter. Which he kind of is.\n\nMark Rypien agreed.\n\n“Now he’s to the level where you can’t talk about consistency; you can talk about elite quarterbacks, one of the elite quarterbacks playing right now and going into the postseason,” Rypien said on ESPN 980. “Between him and Russell Wilson and Cam Newton, three of maybe the hottest quarterbacks in the game at this point in time.”\n\nHow is this Cousins better than the Cousins in previous years?\n\n“He’s taking ownership and he’s really kind of propelled himself to an elite quarterback in the game right now,” Rypien said. “Someone that’s still young and very talented and very gifted, throws a good fotoball and is just taking off from a leadership and maturity standpoint, and really you see that each and every week the last six or seven weeks.”\n\nWant more praise?\n\n“Kirk Cousins is doing a great job of taking ownership of this offense,” David Carr said on NFL Network. “He’s a great leader, the intangibles are off the chart really. I mean, you can see how the guys rally around him and kind of give him a hard time for some of his one-liners, but the guy’s a tremendous player, a tremendous competitor, a perfect fit for this offense.”\n\nOf course, before the praise, there was intense skepticism. Here’s Cousins to the Detroit Free Press, on whether he paid attention:\n\n“I don’t remember paying attention a lot to what was said about me at Michigan State, and I certainly haven’t gone out of my way to find it here,” Cousins said. “But it still gets back to you one way or the other at times. And I do find the scrutiny in this market and the NFL in general, it does seem to be more intense, more of a fishbowl. “It’s part of the deal. And I do believe as an NFL quarterback you’ve got to be mentally tough, emotionally tough. You’ve got to block out good and bad. You can’t let praise or criticism get to you. It’s a weakness to get caught up in either one.”\n\nAnd here’s Cousins to CSN’s Chick Hernandez, on whether he ever doubted this would happen:\n\n“I think there were moments certainly where I said I’m not sure how this is gonna turn out. You just don’t know. You kind of have to prove it. You have to go out and play well and earn it. And I think now there have been some moments on the field where I’ve been able to prove to myself, hey, maybe you can do it.”\n\nHow so wacky is this getting now?

  "latent_15925": "FBI documents reveal US rulers’\n\nmotives for spying against ‘Occupy’\n\n(front page)\n\nBY JOHN STUDER\n\nRecently released FBI documents show the extent of its spying against “Occupy” protest activities, as well as the involvement of other police agencies and private cops in these operations, and their special concern about any support among Occupy activists for labor fights and other social struggles in the interests of working people.\n\nAfter a year of stonewalling, the FBI turned over dozens of heavily redacted documents to the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund, a civil liberties law firm, concerning spying and monitoring of Occupy activities.\n\nOn Dec. 21 the government released 99 pages—out of 387 they claim they “reviewed”—in response to a PCJF Freedom of Information Act request.\n\n“This production, which we believe is just the tip of the iceberg, is a window into the nationwide scope of the FBI’s surveillance, monitoring, and reporting on peaceful protestors organizing with the Occupy movement,” Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, PCJF executive director, said in a statement released with copies of the files.\n\n“Domestic Terrorism” was the FBI’s reference on many of the files. “We do not open investigations based solely on First Amendment activity,” FBI spokesman Paul Bresson told the New York Times when asked why the agency had targeted Occupy groups across the country.\n\nThe FBI started generating reports on Occupy in August 2011, the month before the group began its first action in Zuccotti Park near Wall Street in New York City.\n\nThe files turned over to PCJF contain reports of cop spying in 32 cities, including New York; Anchorage, Alaska; Albany, N.Y.; Memphis, Tenn.; Biloxi, Miss.; Portland, Maine; Des Moines, Iowa; and Tampa, Fla.\n\nDozens of federal agencies, state and local cop outfits, university police and security forces for banks and businesses across the country are listed as participating in meetings with the FBI about planned protests and Occupy activists.\n\nThey include FBI-police Fusion Centers and local affiliates of the Joint Terrorism Task Force—both collaborative efforts combining FBI and other federal spy agencies with intelligence or “anti-terrorism” divisions of local police departments; the Domestic Security Alliance Council, which the government calls “a strategic partnership between the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the private sector”; and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which says it is “an elite worldwide federal law enforcement organization” whose “mission is to investigate and defeat criminal, terrorist, and foreign intelligence threats to the United States Navy and Marine Corps ashore, afloat and in cyberspace.”\n\nTargets West Coast port protests\n\nA Domestic Security Alliance Council “Liaison Information Report,” which states its purpose “is to raise awareness concerning this type of criminal activity,” reports that Occupy groups are organizing to hold peaceful protests at ports in Los Angeles; San Diego; Houston; Portland, Ore; and Seattle, Tacoma and Vancouver, Wash.\n\nThe report is particularly concerned about potential cooperation between the protesters and members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. “The Naval Criminal Investigative Service has stated that the actions of the OWS [Occupy Wall Street] Movement may or may not be coordinated with organized labor actions at the affected ports,” the anonymous DSAC author writes.\n\nThe Occupy actions at the ports included slogans in support of ILWU workers in Longview, Wash., who at the time were involved in a bitter fight against a lockout by EGT Development.\n\nDSAC includes recommendations for executives of its business affiliates: “Avoid all large gatherings related to civil issues. Even seemingly peaceful rallies can spur violent activity or be met with resistance by security forces.”\n\nAn Oct. 19, 2011, “Domestic Terrorism” memo warns about the emergence of Occupy chapters in northern Florida. The FBI’s counterterrorism program coordinator there explains his concern that these are “territories” where “some of the highest unemployment rates in Florida continue to exist.”\n\nAn “Intelligence Briefing” issued in Los Angeles Oct. 20 reports on a meeting the FBI organized with local county sheriffs and L.A. Transit Security Bureau cops. The bureau’s special agent notes that there is a rise in confrontations with “verbally abusive” people on mass transit who confront cops about beatings of prisoners in L.A. Sheriff’s Department jails.\n\nThe FBI agent expresses concern for what would happen if “‘Occupy Wall Street’ protesters mix with the more violent individuals upset about the alleged mistreatment of prisoners in the LASD jails.”\n\nAn Oct. 25 document reports the FBI “disseminated two intelligence products from the Campus Liaison Program to sixteen (16) different campus police officials” in the Albany, N.Y., area.\n\nThe authors of these files, whose names are all redacted out, work hard to present some potential for violence that justifies their investigation. Some note the participation of anarchists. One memo says Occupy would provide “an outlet for a lone offender exploiting the movement for reasons associated with general government dissatisfaction.”\n\nThey also strain to give the appearance that the FBI is not running informers or provocateurs inside the Occupy groups.\n\n“The documents indicate, however, that the FBI obtained information from police departments and other law-enforcement agencies,” the Times wrote, “that appear to have been gathered by someone observing the protesters as they planned activities.”\n\nAttorneys for the PCJF say they “will continue to push for public disclosure of the government’s spy files and will release documents as they are obtained.”\n\nRelated articles:\n\nCops, prisons arose to enforce capitalist order\n\nFront page (for this issue) | Home | Text-version home",
  "latent_16009": "Amit Dave / Reuters A vendor sells guar at a vegetable market in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad, April 16, 2012.\n\nWorkers in America’s oil patch pay little heed to the weather. They know for a certainty that down in the South Texas Eagle Ford Shale fields the metal rigs will turn red hot in triple digit summer temperatures, while up north in the Bakken Shale, winter will come with a fury to North Dakota. But these days they do have an eye on the weather forecast 8,500 miles away on the other side of the world in Rajasthan, India, home to a little green bean that is proving vital to the oil and gas industry in the U.S.\n\nOnce utilized as cow fodder and for poor man’s curry, the guar bean is now a key element in the chemical cocktail used to frack wells, the technology that has prompted the oil and gas boom sweeping across North America, and is set to spur a worldwide boost in oil and gas recovery. India produces some 80% of the world’s guar gum, a hydrocolloid — a substance that forms a gel when mixed with water. The powdered gum is produced from the endosperm of the guar or cluster bean, much of it grown in one of the driest and poorest regions of the subcontinent, the northern state of Rajasthan. Neighboring areas of Pakistan also produce a significant export harvest. Demand for guar in the energy industry is running up prices, driving up costs and cutting into profits for the exploration companies, but making Indian subsistence farmers a little less poor in the process.\n\n(VIDEO: The Fuss Over Fracking: The Dilemma of a New Gas Boom)\n\nGuar gum is used in a wide variety of industries including textiles, paper, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, even as a fire retardant. For ordinary consumers, it is the ingredient that makes ice cream silky, salad dressings thick and creamy, and helps maintain the flavor of a beverage in the mouth after that initial gulp. But while a gallon of ice cream calls for just a smidgen of guar gum, to frack a well in a shale formation may take 20,000 pounds of guar beans. At a recent New York capital markets conference, one of the major exploration companies reported using 1,700 tons a month resulting in a first quarter cost of some $40 million. Given that level of demand, prices for guar have jumped from $4 a kilo (about 2.2 pounds) to $30 a kilo in the last 18 months.\n\nThe rising price of the gummy gold was blamed by Halliburton late last month for a decrease in profits so far this year. “The price of guar gum has inflated more rapidly than previously expected due to concerns over the potential for shortages for the commodity later in 2012. As such, the costs have impacted the company’s second quarter North America margins more than anticipated,” the company asserted in its earnings statement.\n\nIn order to extract gas trapped some 6,000 to 10,000 feet beneath the surface, exploration companies use hydraulic fracturing, dubbed fracking, according to NaturalGas.org, an industry educational website, to “make hard shale rock more porous.” Large amounts of water, typically three to five million gallons, are mixed with small amounts of chemical additives, injected deep into the earth, forcing cracks in the rocks, allowing the gas to escape into the wellbore.\n\nGuar gum has several important qualities key to that process, according to Dennis Seisun, head of IMR International, a San Diego-based hydrocolloid consulting company. “It’s a very good suspending agent and it is easy to break,” he says, meaning that when the liquids are withdrawn from the wellbore, the gum helps separate the chemicals from the water. One side benefit, Seisun says, is it’s usefulness in the debate with environmentalists over fracking — “The companies can say: ‘We are using stuff they put in ice cream!’ ”\n\n(MORE: Shale Gas: It’s Not the Fracking That Might Be the Problem. It’s Everything Else)\n\nSeisun spent December visiting Jodphur, Rajasthan, in the heart of guar bean growing country. There, guar bean merchants tell tales of massive buys by U.S. exploration companies, offers to buy thousands of pounds of powdered gum to be air-freighted to well sites in Pennsylvania or Texas, or South Dakota. That has prompted a huge run-up in prices and created “turbulence in the marketplace,” Seisun says. Indian regulators shut down guar futures trading on the commodities market last year, markets that are closed to foreigners, and punished several brokerage companies. Speculation had driven prices up. Nidhi Nath Srinivas, a columnist for India’s Economic Times, reported in May that American companies were distributing seed to farmers, while the regulators pondered allowing the re-listing of guar futures on the exchange after the size and scope of this year’s crop emerges.\n\nLate July is the usual time of year to plant the guar bean seeds so the shrubby plant can get a boost from the monsoon rains. But this year, the monsoon is late and forecasters predict it may produce less rain than normal. Guar is “a poor man’s crop,” according to Calvin Trostle, an agronomist with Texas A&M University’s agricultural programs. It is sown by hand by subsistence farmers on small landholdings and is ideally suited to the poor, dusty soils of northern India. The fresh pods, Trostle says, have a lettuce-like, tart flavor and are eaten whole, stirred into a curry or fried with spices. The guar gum is made by removing the beans inside the pod, splitting them and then extracting the endosperm from the seed.\n\nFor the last 50 years, Seisun says, the guar gum market was dominated by food manufacturers who called the shots on prices. “The small farmer was basically out of the picture,” Seisun says. “How much they got for the crop was how much the food industry offered. That changed with the oil boys.”\n\nThe food industry press started sounding the alarm bells about rising prices and shortages in the summer of 2011. By January, the concern had spread to the pharmaceutical industry. There are substitutes available to the complaining industries, including xanthum and tara gums, Seisun says, but switching ingredients poses problems. “The food industry is very conservative,” Seisun says. “Once they have found a formula and got behind it with a brand name and image, they don’t like to change.” Changes also mean jumping through additional regulatory hoops, not to mention re-packaging and re-labeling costs.\n\n(MORE: Why the Shale Gas Industry Needs Regulations for Fracking)\n\nEnergy exploration companies also are looking at guar alternatives (existing ones for the food industry are either not available in large amounts or are unsuitable). Both Halliburton and Schlumberger are exploring synthetic hydrocolloids. “They have all got something, but nothing works as well as guar,” Seisun says.\n\nTrostle adds: “It is widely known that after all these years that guar gum is still the best at improving the viscosity, or flowability, of the drilling fluid and helping suspend the sand that is needed deep underground, a mile or more away from the surface, to help prop the rock formation open when it is fractured under high pressure. You know, there are a lot of smart people in chemical engineering and petroleum engineering departments on our nation’s campuses, but nobody has come up with something synthetic that works as well.”\n\nAnd so the exploration companies are encouraging more production in India where 10.5 million acres of guar are set to be planted this year, two million more than 2011, Trostle says. Energy companies have invested in Texas research efforts aimed at developing new seed varieties for U.S. production. There is at least one guar production plant in Texas, Trostle says, and guar is being grown by a few farmers in West Texas where it is suited to the “marginal” soils and dry climate. Trostle expects guar gum farming to grow in similar areas in other states, including Arizona, if the price point remains high.\n\nDespite the debate over fracking in the U.S. and Europe and the calls for a shutdown, it is unlikely that will stop the new technology from being utilized in the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), Seisun says. China, for example, is getting a front row look at how fracking works. In November of 2010, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) paid $1 billion for a 33% stake in Chesapeake Energy’s leases in the Eagle Ford Shale project in South Texas. Estimates of China’s shale gas reserves range from 26 trillion to 36.1 trillion cubic meters of shale gas, about 50% higher than those estimated in the U.S., according to the Asia Times. The debate over fracking aside, Trostle says it is “gratifying” to see India’s poor subsistence farmers find gold in those gummy beans.\n\nPHOTOS: New Delhi Demands Water: The Indian Capital’s Annual Shortage",
  "latent_16043": "The Trump White House is all but ignoring Spanish speakers, even though the president has a robust online presence in English.\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to offer a Spanish-language White House website. It has eliminated the position of director of Hispanic media outreach. And its Spanish-language Twitter account is heavy with English text and features sloppy translations.\n\n'Your worst nightmare: a successful Donald Trump presidency' Read more\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said in January the administration had “IT folks working overtime” to roll out a new Spanish-language site after whitehouse.gov/espanol went dark in the hours after Trump took office.\n\n“Trust me, it’s going to take a little bit more time, but we’re working piece by piece to get that done,” Spicer said.\n\nMore than five months later, the site still urges readers: “Stay tuned.”\n\nThe White House’s Spanish twitter account, @LaCasaBlanca, is also far less active in the Trump era. The account has tweeted just 41 times since Trump’s inauguration and more than one-third of those posts came on the day of his address to a joint session of Congress on 28 February.\n\nOf the 41 tweets, about half were written in English. The Spanish tweets are sprinkled with typos – 11 in all. While most mistakes are minor flubs such as missing accents, those accents often change the meaning of words significantly. For instance, they turn “medical” into “medicate” or “is” into “this”.\n\nOne of the first agencies to expand Spanish-language content during the Trump era has been US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, or Ice. The agency is responsible for carrying out deportations. Last month, it announced it was expanding the Spanish section of its website and started a new Spanish Twitter feed, @ICEespanol.\n\nThe White House director of media affairs, Helen Aguirre Ferre, said she expected a Spanish website to launch later this year. She noted the Obama administration took nine months to launch its version, adding that “the priority remains to improve the English-language website”.\n\nShe said there was no plan to hire a press officer solely dedicated to Spanish-language media at this time. She said she and another staffer in the communications operation are bilingual and conduct interviews in Spanish. Spanish-language media are also invited to participate in press briefings, background briefings and other events, along with their English-language colleagues, she said.\n\nJavier Palomarez, president of the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and a vocal critic of Trump during the campaign, said he has been pleasantly surprised by the administration’s other Hispanic outreach efforts.\n\nWhile Spanish-language communication is “important in terms of optics”, he said, “at the end of the day, where the rubber meets the road for us and what matters to us is what kind of policy are you enacting, are you engaged with us”.\n\nHe said his members’ conversations with the White House have been “constant, consistent and ongoing”, with numerous in-person meetings with White House and cabinet officials, including Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and weekly phone calls with Jennifer Korn, deputy director for the White House office of public liaison.\n\n“They have been more than willing to talk to us and engage us,” he said. “This is the same level or more access that we had with the Obama administration.”\n\nGeorge W Bush began the tradition of a Spanish-language website. The Obama administration followed suit. Luis Miranda, director of Hispanic media at the White House during the Obama administration, said the Obama-era Spanish-language website was not just a translation of the English site, but included information geared to Latinos on topics such as immigration, health issues, banking and veterans affairs.\n\n“For us it was important that all of our constituents across the board were getting as much information as possible about what we were doing,” he said.\n\nStill, the Obama White House received some criticism for using Spanglish in its initial website on his health overhaul.\n\nActivists see the lack of Spanish content as part of a larger pattern by Trump and the administration.\n\n“I believe they have written off the Latino vote as, ‘I’m never going to get it, so why should I even bother?”’ said Luis A Miranda Jr, a Democratic strategist who has worked for Hillary Clinton as well as Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump turned off many Latinos with his harsh anti-immigration rhetoric. He criticized rival Jeb Bush for answering a reporter’s question in Spanish, saying the former Florida governor “should really set the example by speaking English while in the United States”.\n\n“We have a country, where, to assimilate, you have to speak English. And I think that where he was, and the way it came out didn’t sound right to me,” Trump said in one Republican primary debate.\n\nTrump still won about 28% of the Latino vote, similar to Mitt Romney in 2012, according to exit polls.\n\nRoberto Izurieta, director of Latin American Projects at George Washington University, said that since Trump began his campaign, his rhetoric has been “very aggressive and very anti-Hispanic.”\n\n“The president decided on day one to stay with his electoral base. It means he will keep his divisive rhetoric and stay with his base, which is anti-immigrant,” he said.",

  "latent_16263": "New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nHe is a sworn enemy of the president.\n\nNew York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, has reportedly been assisting with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. The investigation is one of several criminal spinoffs of Mueller’s larger counterintelligence probe of Russian involvement in the 2016 election.\n\nThe president cannot pardon violations of state law, so Schneiderman could be in a position to squeeze Manafort in ways that Mueller can’t. But Schneiderman’s public comments and civil lawsuits against Trump’s agenda make it impossible for the public to have confidence that he could be impartial on the subject of the president. Precisely because Schneiderman occupies a unique position of leverage, he needs to recuse himself from the probe.\n\nA Prosecutor’s Duty to the Impartial Administration of Justice\n\nLet’s start with first principles. Prosecutors are expected to be fair and impartial in the administration of justice. Standards for the recusal of prosecutors who can’t be impartial rely more on norms than on rules. For example, presidents have the legal power to exercise total control over their subordinates on matters of government policy, but that power is still widely seen as improper when applied to specific criminal prosecutions. That’s precisely why Mueller was appointed, as Schneiderman himself demanded back in May:\n\nAttempts by @POTUS to derail the Russia investigation are a violation of public trust. Today, 20 AGs call for an independent investigation. pic.twitter.com/m5TmtiMDzT — Eric Schneiderman (@AGSchneiderman) May 11, 2017\n\nSchneiderman likewise appealed to New York State norms against the appearance of unbiased law enforcement when he requested (and was granted) authority by Governor Cuomo to take prosecutions of police shootings away from local district attorneys. As Schneiderman said at the time:\n\nNothing could be more critical … than acting immediately to restore trust and confidence in the independence of reviews in any case involving an unarmed civilian killed by a law enforcement officer. … The question in these difficult cases is not whether a local prosecutor … is capable of setting aside any personal biases in deciding whether, or how vigorously, to pursue the case. As the State’s chief law enforcement officer, I know that I and the overwhelming majority of my fellow prosecutors are not only capable of doing so, but are conscientious about our ethical duty to see that justice is done in every case. Rather, the question is whether there is public confidence that justice has been served.\n\nGiven a prosecutor’s broad powers and discretion, New York’s highest court has written:\n\nIt would be simplistic#…#to think of the impact of a prosecutor’s conflict of interest merely in terms of explicit instances of abuse. Even our thumbnail description of prosecutorial power is enough to indicate that resulting prejudice can at least as easily flow from an act of omission as from one of commission, from discretion withheld as from discretion exercised. In this context, whether abuse is express or implied may be difficult to determine. Suffice it to say that any presumption of impartiality tends to be undermined when there is a clear conflict of interest. Indeed, the judgmental nature of much of a [prosecutor’s] conduct will put it beyond effective [judicial] review. And, no matter how firmly and conscientiously a District Attorney may steel himself against the intrusion of a competing and disqualifying interest, he never can be certain that he has succeeded in isolating himself from the inroads on his subconscious. Thus, the practical impossibility of establishing that the conflict has worked to defendant’s disadvantage dictates the adoption of standards under which a reasonable potential for prejudice will suffice. … Nor is the gravity of that potential lessened because it may cut either or both of two ways, against a defendant or against the [prosecution], toward each of whom the discharge of the [prosecutor]’s duties of course should be uninhibited by subjective influences.\n\nWhile rules in this area take a back seat to norms, there are also rules. For example, the New York State Bar Association’s comments to Rule 3.8 of the New York Bar’s ethics rules, addressing the “Special Responsibilities of Prosecutors and other Government Lawyers,” states:\n\nA prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice and not simply that of an advocate. … In the context of a criminal prosecution, a prosecutor’s extrajudicial statement can create the additional problem of increasing public condemnation of the accused. … A prosecutor can, and should, avoid comments that have no legitimate law enforcement purpose and have a substantial likelihood of increasing public opprobrium against the accused.\n\nRule 3.4 also provides that no lawyer may “present, participate in presenting, or threaten to present criminal charges solely to obtain an advantage in a civil matter,” a provision that heightens the ethical responsibilities of a criminal prosecutor who is also engaged in civil litigation with the defendant — as Schneiderman is currently, on as many fronts as he can manage, against the Trump administration.\n\nSchneiderman is an elected Democrat, giving him an obvious motive to wish ill on the fortunes of President Trump. But nearly all of our law enforcement is directed by elected officials or their appointees, so party membership alone has never been viewed as grounds for recusal. However, the District Attorneys Association of the State of New York, while recognizing that most state chief prosecutors are elected members of a political party, has issued ethical guidelines designed to “help District Attorneys maintain a sense of public confidence in the non-partisan nature of the District Attorney’s office,” including prohibitions on many kinds of activity that would be routine for other elected officials. For example, “While attending a political/social function, District Attorneys or Assistant District Attorneys shall not speak at such functions; they shall not publicize their attendance at such functions; nor shall they act in a manner which could be interpreted as lending the prestige and weight of their office to the political party or function. … [They shall not] engage in any political activity during normal business hours or during the course of the performance of their official duties. … [They shall not] misuse their public positions for the purpose of obstructing or furthering the political activities of any political party or candidate.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we shall see, Schneiderman’s activities go well beyond simply being an elected Democratic-party official. He has been engaged in a constant campaign of political #Resistance to Trump.\n\nSchneiderman: Against Trump\n\nA state attorney general picks his cases, and some of them may involve taking sides against the federal government, especially if it’s run by another party. But hardly any state AG in memory has filed more lawsuits against the feds, with more personally vitriolic fanfare against the president, than Schneiderman has. Even a cursory review of his official Twitter feed, for example, reveals that he spends nearly half his time opposing Trump. That opposition is not on one issue, but a broad array of issues, and his grounds for doing so are often strikingly personal and sometimes totally unrelated to anything within his jurisdiction.

And this isn’t just on his Twitter feed. On a radio show back in January, when Trump had been in office for less than two weeks, Schneiderman was bragging about going after the president and musing about which of his investigations could lead to impeachment:\n\nWe have not been shy about going after Mr. Trump’s business ventures. … He has no immunity from conduct prior to his assuming the presidency. I do think that the, the issues related to his university and his foundation are unlikely to constitute the kind of high crimes and misdemeanors that might remove him from office. … There are a lot of reports of egregious acts he’s taken in the course of his business, his sexual assaults and other things — that’s all fair game. And my office has been the most aggressive office in the country about pursuing that.\n\nIn February, NPR reported that Schneiderman might consider revoking Trump’s corporate charter and had “told NPR a charter challenge is indeed part of a broader discussion among Democratic attorneys general about President Trump’s business holdings.” Later that month, a Salon headline blared, “New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman bids to become Trump’s No. 1 enemy.” (Daily Kos had offered the title to Schneiderman before Trump was even inaugurated.) In March, the Wall Street Journal reported that Schneiderman had hired a veteran federal prosecutor “to focus specifically on issues involving the Trump administration.” In May, on the heels of successfully pressing for Mueller’s appointment, Schneiderman told New York magazine — which noted that “his confrontational stance toward Trump has made him a popular figure on the left” — that “if it’s hard to get checks on the presidency from Congress, we’re going to try to fill that space.” In June, speaking of his lawsuits against the travel ban, he crowed,\n\nThat was really the beginning of what I call the legal resistance. … There’s a sense in the legal community of Attorneys General, lawyers for local governments, lawyers for nonprofits, and a lot of the members of the private bar that this order and other things they’ve done since then are offensive in a more fundamental way than mean-spiritedness or bias. It shows a total disregard for the rule of law.\n\nOn his Facebook page, he’s promoted the hashtag #TheResistanceIsLocal.\n\nNo Grudge Match Like An Old Grudge Match\n\nSchneiderman’s feud with Trump predates the latter’s presidential run. While he counted Trump as a five-figure donor to his 2010 campaign, Schneiderman filed a $40 million fraud lawsuit against Trump University in 2013. The same year, Trump accused Schneiderman of trying to shake down Ivanka for donations — perhaps somewhat dubiously, as New York’s ethics commission dismissed Trump’s complaint.\n\nAs Salon noted, Schneiderman “was a target of Trump’s Twitter feed long before the president’s campaign-trail assaults on Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz.” A sampling of Trump’s tweeted insults shows why Schneiderman may have a particularly personal ax to grind:\n\nGovernor Cuomo is right about one thing – Attorney General Eric Schneiderman does wear eyeliner!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2013\n\nOf course, Schneiderman isn’t responsible for Trump’s itchy Twitter finger, but this is yet more reason to view the AG’s efforts now as part of a longstanding and mutual bitterly personal feud.\n\nEvery president has to deal with partisan investigations by Congress; indeed, partisanship is part of legislative oversight by design. And ambitious prosecutors looking to make a name for themselves at the expense of the other party are also an established part of the system. But we expect a man running any part of a criminal investigation touching the presidency to project at least a minimal standard of impartiality. By making himself both a personal antagonist of Trump and a high-profile opponent of the administration’s policy agenda on a wide array of topics, Eric Schneiderman leaves no doubt that he is eager to stop Trump on every front at every opportunity. That is the furthest thing from impartial. He should recuse himself from any criminal probe.",

  "latent_16476": "Among other threats targeting Mexico during his election campaign, President Donald Trump harshly criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement, a 23-year-old tripartite deal that removed tariffs and significantly increased commerce between Canada, the United States and Mexico.\n\nRenegotiation of the deal is likely to start late this year.\n\nRead: Trump reportedly weighing Nafta withdrawal\n\nAs Trump has pointed out, Nafta contributed to a U.S. trade deficit with Mexico reaching $63.2 billion last year. This is the country’s fourth-largest trade deficit, after China, Japan and Germany. America’s deficit with the other Nafta nation, Canada, was slightly over $11 billion in 2016.\n\nBut that’s only part of the story. Remove cars and auto-part imports, for example, and the U.S. deficit with Mexico virtually disappears.\n\nOverall, Nafta has been beneficial to Mexico, Canada and the U.S. alike. Since it was signed in 1994, foreign direct investments in Mexico have averaged 2.6% of GDP (compared to 1% for two decades before Nafta). At present, annual bilateral trade between the U.S. and Mexico is running at $580 billion.\n\nRead: Trump calls Nafta the ‘single worst trade deal’ — but here’s the truth\n\nU.S. agricultural exports to Mexico have surged\n\nMuch of Trump’s outdated protectionist rhetoric hinges on manufacturing, outsourcing of jobs to Mexico and immigration. Agriculture — a key link between the two nations — doesn’t seem to have entered his calculations.\n\nGlobalization may have contributed to manufacturing job losses in the U.S., but it has had significant benefits for the American agricultural sector. U.S. exports of agricultural products to Mexico have increased nearly fivefold since Nafta was signed.\n\nAround 98% of the corn that forms a staple of the Mexican diet comes from the U.S. Mexico also buys 7.8% of all U.S. pork production.\n\nFor the 2014–15 crop marketing year, U.S. corn production was 360 million metric tons, 13% of which was exported. Mexico accounted for 23% of these exports.\n\nIn 2016, Mexico imported $17.9 billion in American agricultural products: $2.6 billion in corn, $1.5 billion in soybeans, $1.3 billion in pork and $1.2 billion in dairy products.\n\nAround 98% of the corn that forms a staple of the Mexican diet comes from the U.S. Mexico also buys 7.8% of all U.S. pork production.\n\nWhat has been good for U.S. farmers has actually hurt Mexican agriculture. Lulled by a steady supply of cheap U.S. farm products and low transportation costs, and assuming that the good times will continue, Mexico hasn’t diversified its agricultural imports. It depends heavily on U.S. farmers to feed its people, endangering Mexico’s long-term food security.\n\nWhere American agriculture is losing ground\n\nThe U.S. is the world’s top exporter of agricultural products, but there are other global breadbaskets, including Brazil, Australia, Russia, Argentina and Ukraine. As these rivals have adopted more modern farming and agricultural practices and improved their transport and product-handling infrastructure in recent years, America’s global export share has been steadily declining.\n\nPolitical decisions have at times accelerated this decline. In 1979, the U.S. banned grain sales to the then-Soviet Union because of its invasion of Afghanistan. This forced the U.S.S.R. to improve its own grain production, and, in 2016, Russia surpassed the U.S. for the first time in wheat exports.\n\nMight Donald Trump’s administration be facing a similar watershed moment for American agriculture?\n\nAs America threatens to close its agricultural export door, it has damaged Mexico’s confidence in the reliability of its major supplier — perhaps permanently. In a January 2017 Washington Post opinion piece, former Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo wrote that it was a “waste of time” to play “Nafta tweaking games with the Trump administration”.\n\nThough Mexico currently has free trade agreements with 45 countries (more than any other country in the world), agriculture has consistently been the most sensitive issue in Mexico’s free trade agreements. Trump has changed that.\n\nToday, the country is accelerating its search for new partners to meet its national agricultural needs. Sensing long-term opportunities, Brazil and Argentina — both major exporters of beef, wheat, soybeans and other prized U.S. agricultural products — are elbowing their way to the front of the queue. Neither currently has a free trade agreement with Mexico.\n\nMexico Deputy Economy Minister Juan Carlos Baker has said that the country is “pretty far advanced with Brazil. Argentina is a few steps behind”, confirming that Mexico could offer South American producers terms similar to those currently enjoyed by American farmers “if it suits us”.\n\nBrazil Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi has announced that the country is “back in the game”.\n\nMexico is also discussing bilateral deals with Australia and New Zealand, two other main food-exporting countries.\n\nIn addition to government-to-government agreements, companies that produce and trade agricultural products are also seeing Mexico’s vast import market with new eyes. One of them is Adecoagro AGRO, +0.00% , which owns and leases some 434,000 hectares of farmlands in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay and harvests two million tons of agricultural products annually.\n\nThe New York-traded Buenos Aires-based firm, whose major shareholders include the Hungarian-American investor George Soros, the Dutch Pension Fund PGGM and the Qatar Investment Authority, currently exports agricultural products such as corn, wheat, soybean and cotton to Africa, Asia and Middle East.\n\nIt sees Nafta-related uncertainties as an opportunity to penetrate the Mexican market, especially if Brazilian and Argentinian products are granted favorable U.S.-style export arrangements.\n\nMexico’s brighter outlook\n\nIn addition to diversifying its trading partners, Mexico is also seeking to stimulate its domestic agricultural production, according to several government officials and advisers.\n\nNew policies currently under consideration would incentivize farmers to produce more, modernize their farms, increase crop yields, and expand cultivable areas. The country is also looking to improve its transportation and storage infrastructure, including ports that could be used for bulk grain imports.\n\nAll of these efforts will help put Mexico on more equal footing with the United States in future Nafta negotiations. So, too, would retaliatory measures against a threatened U.S. border tax. (And, anyway, if the U.S. does decide to implement one, the market is likely to sell off Mexican peso aggressively, making Mexican products cheaper even with new tariffs.)\n\nRead: Dollar advances against Mexican peso, Canadian dollar on reports U.S. may withdraw from Nafta\n\nLike the 1979 U.S. grain ban that helped Russia improve its agriculture, Trump’s vituperation may prove beneficial to Mexico (and bad for the U.S.) in the decades to come.\n\nIn the meantime, Mexico is facing a tough political and social landscape. President Enrique Peña Nieto’s approval rating is nearing single digits and the economy is performing anemically, with 2017 economic growth predicted to be a paltry 1%.\n\nWith a presidential election approaching in 2018, Peña Nieto is unlikely to hard sell to his people a new Nafta that doesn’t appeal to Mexicans. So it would be good politics, too, to play hardball with Trump.\n\nMexico has more policy options than it thinks. And it may have less to lose than its northern neighbor.\n\nIf ending Nafta hurts farmers in America’s Corn Belt, who voted overwhelmingly for Trump, there goes the Republican’s reelection.\n\nNow read: The real reason for the trade deficit?

  "latent_16693": "Can we keep government’s hands off the technology frontier?\n\nI like to think it makes sense that libertarianism—or classical liberal ideas--would resonate in places like Silicon Valley; that techies could and should make a powerful, united case for “Separation of Technology and State.\"\n\nAlas, many are capital-D Democrats.\n\nOf course, libertarians tend to see Democrats vs. Republicans as a battle between the leopards and the ocelots: they're both cats with spots.\n\nNonetheless, libertarians and classical liberals appear to be finding a foothold in Silicon Valley.\n\nI remember attending conservative/libertarian Lead21 events in the Valley years back. The newest effort is the Lincoln Labs ReBoot conference (I’ll attend).\n\nWith Hackathons, policy panels and emphasis on heavy data and outreach to liberty-minded individuals, they're trying to get the right’s social and political data savvy on par with the outreach super-engine the left enjoys.\n\nReboot Keynoter Sen. Rand Paul sees massive potential in the heavily left-wing region. He's cemented attraction to some liberals with his 13 hour talking filibuster against drones and his Berkeley critiques of National Security Agency power drunkenness.\n\nPolitical predation, like that of grabby taxi commissions and politicians attempting to eliminate Uber and Lyft, has also had an impact, offending liberals and conservatives alike nationwide.\n\nWith thousands of rules and regulations with costs approaching $2 trillion annually, the regulatory burden exceeds the burden of taxes and spending in my view.\n\nIn “The Libertarian Vision for High Technology,” Adam Thierer and I argued for a hands-off approach to the Internet and technology.\n\nAnd indeed, the Internet did enjoy a reputation as a freewheeling realm. But regulatory impulses surged from the start.\n\nAttempts past and present to regulate have included:\n\nPorn\n\nLibrary filtering\n\nSpam\n\nMarketing to kids\n\nOnline gambling\n\nPrivacy\n\n“Cybersecurity” (and even a kill-switch for the Net)\n\nNet neutrality (instead of agency neutrality)\n\nBallooning surveillance from Carnivore to the USA Patriot Act to Total Information Awareness to National Security Agency sponging\n\nVarious initiatives for government to fund basic research, to direct private infrastructure decisions\n\nAnd of course antitrust regulatory activism remains very strong. Rivals and regulators seem to think everyone must share wires, code, desktop space or infrastructure with competitors. Indeed the real lesson of the Microsoft case was that government regards even corporate breakup as valid, thus no intervention is off limits.\n\nIt isn't the libertarian position that things don't need \"regulating\" of course; rather what institutions are best suited for the job; it isn't automatically government compulsion. It might be competition; it might be a kid's parents.\n\nI never meant to be all weepy and and utopian about the Net, but I was. I felt it represented a demonstration project for spontaneous order, a chance to show that minimal regulation does work. I've been disappointed in politicians of both parties.\n\nNow, the frontier sectors that define the new economy like robotics and custom manufacturing are even more vulnerable to political predation. Uber was just a sample.\n\nPressures will intensify, especially if the tech sector is further seduced by government \"help\" through federal \"investment\" and \"steering\" like President Obama's \"manufacturing hubs\" announced in North Carolina's Research Triangle and in Chicago.\n\nThe technological geniuses in Silicon Valley and elsewhere help pull America’s economic wagon, but ill-conceived and predatory interventions from the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communication Commission and over 50 other departments and agencies could mangle things with mandates and uncertainties.\n\nFor example, the recent wave of financial regulations makes it harder to raise capital. Nor can one yet say how small tech companies will contend with Obamacare.\n\nOn privacy policy, the question has never been can the market offer degrees of anonymity and degrees of authentication; there have always been exhibitionists and hermits, and entrepreneurs can satisfy both.\n\nThe real question is will the government allow privacy, as opposed to, say, making you walk through a nudie scanner.\n\nIt matters, because as far as the future of marketing and advertising goes, most transactions occur between strangers. Mandates against private information experimentation while government scoops everything will undermine the “Internet of Everything” promise.\n\nIn this respect the automobile \"operating system\" wars between Google's Android vs. Apple's iOS systems hold much promise.\n\nI worry most that unmanned drone and self-driving car policy will morph into a version of public-utility style regulation spearheaded by the largest companies in the space. With roads primarily government-owned, and with Washington and tech utopians ever-infatuated with overarching regulation like net neutrality mandates, blanket cybersecurity rules and federal infrastructure banking and investment, I’m not yet optimistic and foresee cronyism.\n\nThe things really needed are the primacy of contracts and new insurance and liability innovations, such as those evolving in the new sharing economy (Uber, Airbnb), and as is urgent in frontier sciences like nanotechnology, biotech and customized medicine.\n\nIn this respect bans on electronic gadgets and phone calls on airplanes and cars could interrupt innovations that satisfy everyone. If we can't figure out market solutions to such relatively simple things, it's pretty hopeless.\n\nOur choice is never regulation or no regulation, but political discipline vs. competitive discipline.\n\nI tend to see the things regulators think they can magically improve--such as privacy, cybersecurity, safety in nanotechnology and biomedical engineering--as forms of wealth. Like every other kind, these forms of wealth require markets to expand. Regulation can undermine true efficiency and safely and openness, preventing the healthy competitive pressures that grow them.\n\nGovernments can’t mimic competition, and they don't always guarantee fairness and safety. Government failures can be worse than \"market failures.\"\n\nRegulation in advanced technology ends up being worse than government merely picking winners and losers, because government ends up choosing among business models as such, imposing entire sub-optimal frameworks within which all must operate. Big government is a recipe for economic decline.\n\nThat's damaging, because government shouldn’t be in the technology business, anymore than it should be in our healthcare, our retirement, our lives beyond the absolute minimum necessary.\n\nWe are perched at a critical point in business history in terms of the growth of new business models. Failure will cost us decades.\n\nI've heard it said that Congress wouldn't recognize free enterprise if it was on fire and rollerblading naked through the Capitol.\n\nWe need entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, and around the globe to help policymakers appreciate economic liberty. The institutions of freedom need business allies. I'm looking forward to meeting some this week at Lincoln Labs.",
  "latent_17089": "Ahead of the release of SPECTRE this autumn, the Bond Reloaded series takes a weekly look back at each film in the iconic James Bond franchise. It continues with a look at the debut of Blofeld in You Only Live Twice.\n\nProducers Saltzman and Broccoli wanted to adapt On Her Majesty’s Secret Service after Thunderball, but struggled to find the necessary snowy locations for filming. They chose Japan-set You Only Live Twice as the next film, culminating in the first appearance of Bond’s nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld.\n\nMeanwhile, chaos was raging behind the scenes as Sean Connery became even more disillusioned with playing the lead role in the world’s biggest action franchise. The producers also had to deal with an enormous budget for the extravagant sets and a villain who needed recasting at the eleventh hour.\n\nYou Only Live Twice relocates the franchise to Japan and, after Thunderball’s underwater finale, keeps its feet mostly on the ground.\n\nBond goes East\n\nBond (Connery) is apparently assassinated by SPECTRE operatives before the credits even roll. He returns to duty in order to investigate a plot to steal Russian and American space shuttles, igniting tensions between the two countries and inflaming the Cold War. In Japan, Bond allies with secret service boss Tiger (Tetsurō Tamba) and agent Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi).\n\nThe path eventually leads Bond to SPECTRE’s volcano lair and its cat-toting leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Donald Pleasence). Bond must join Tiger’s army of highly-trained ninjas to bring SPECTRE down and prevent war.\n\nYou Only Live Twice marks the beginning of the real decline of the Connery Bond films. It’s got a bizarre, deeply stereotyped, grasp of Japanese culture and goes on just a little too long. That said, it remains an enthralling thriller and it has a genuinely impressive all-action finale.\n\n\"You, I’m afraid, will get into anything. With any girl.\"\n\nRoald Dahl, who would later become a household name as a children’s author, was hired to write the script. Dahl was a friend of Ian Fleming, but called You Only Live Twice his worst book and therefore opted to change almost everything on the path to the big screen. This ignited a trend of originality that would continue throughout the Bond franchise. Many of the future Bond films would be more loosely based on the novels from which they take their name.\n\nDahl worked in collaboration with director Lewis Gilbert, who was also a newbie to the series. Gilbert initially turned down the role, but Broccoli called him to convince him that he would regret the decision. In fact, he would return to take the helm of The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker.\n\nConnery continues to excel in the lead role, even as his enthusiasm for the job waned. His Bond is an old-fashioned sexist, but has charisma for miles and a great way with a quip. He is handed an awful Japanese disguise for the final act of You Only Live Twice, but he finally gets to square off with his greatest enemy.\n\nBlofeld himself is terrifically realised, despite his relatively meagre screen time. Pleasence’s portrayal of the character is immediately iconic and there’s a certain appeal to the Big Bad of the entire franchise being a tiny, disfigured man in a chair who has little in the way of physical capabilities. Compared to Pleasence, subsequent portrayals of the character were lacking in recognition value.\n\nNinjas, cats and volcano lairs\n\nFor most of its running time, the Bond film You Only Live Twice most closely resembles is Dr. No. Dahl’s script pushes Bond’s investigation along in interesting fashion, with betrayals and surprise revelations at every turn. Unfortunately, it’s a little longer than that film and has a slightly saggy middle act as a result.\n\n\"You wouldn’t touch that horrible woman, would you?\"\n\nDahl’s script also gives short shrift to the women in Bond’s life. None of Bond’s romantic entanglements in this film are given any real depth. Kissy Suzuki, played by Mie Hama, is particularly under-written – only introduced at the start of the third act. She goes from turning down Bond’s advances to being hopelessly in love with him in a matter of minutes.\n\nYou Only Live Twice does, however, explode with energy when it enters Blofeld’s hollowed-out volcano lair, beautifully realised by set designer Ken Adam. The final conflict between the SPECTRE forces and Tiger’s ninjas is thrilling, even if it leaves Blofeld himself somewhat sidelined.\n\nSecond life at the box office\n\nWhen You Only Live Twice premiered in Leicester Square in 1967, it was the first of the Bond premieres attended by the Queen. It was one of the biggest films of the year, scoring over $100m at the worldwide box office.\n\nThe film received broadly positive reviews, but there was criticism of its reliance on Bond’s gadgetry rather than his spy abilities. Ken Adam’s set design was universally praised by critics, but many attacked Blofeld’s appearance as something of a letdown.\n\n\"We corpses have no sense of time.\"\n\nYou Only Live Twice may not be the most impressive outing for the franchise, but it’s one that’s worth watching to see Connery continue to strut his stuff and for the sensational climax.\n\nNext week, a new super-spy steps into the tuxedo for On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.\n\nWhat do you think of You Only Live Twice? Where does it stand in the pantheon of Bond films? Is Sean Connery the best lead in the franchise’s history? Let me know in the comments section and keep your eyes peeled for more Bond Reloaded next Monday.\n\nYou can read my look back at Thunderball here and find other Bond Reloaded articles here.",
  "latent_17118": "Pin +1 11 Shares\n\nAs a collector, I don't sell all that often. It seems that, much to the chagrin of my wife and the shrinking space in my house, I'd rather tuck cards away in boxes for years (and decades). Honestly, I don't even think about them. Sounds like a good time to clear some space and sell some cards.\n\nI used to sell on eBay on occasion a while back. But fees, inconvenience, time and a seemingly growing number of scammers out there have deterred me. It's at the point that, except for extreme circumstances, it's not worth it to me as a (very) casual seller.\n\nAfter seeing a deal on listings on their blog, I opted to give COMC a try. I've been using the site to fill in holes in my sets and Expos collection for years. But I'd never given it much thought to try the other side. These are my own personal experiences with selling on the site thus far.\n\nWhat to Sell on COMC\n\nAs much as I would like to send in all of my extra cards, that's not going to happen at this point. Even with the promotional rate I had as part of a limited time offer for Canadians, it could still add up in a hurry.\n\nPlus, this was my first time using the service as a seller, so going all in would be overwhelming.\n\nInstead I aimed to get together 500 cards that I wouldn't miss. The goal was to move those and use the credit to get one really nice card I normally wouldn't be able to afford. The option is there to withdraw the funds, but there are added fees and that doesn't appeal to me.\n\nWhen going through and choosing, I reflected back on what I had used COMC for most as a buyer. I found it most helpful when I was able to track down oddball cards and inserts that might not be totally rare but just don't show up that often.\n\nI took the same approach to my first batch of cards to sell. Through my years of collecting John Jaha I have amassed several team sets from promotional giveaways and local Brewers Police sets. Although I was only looking for the one card, a decade ago it was easier just to get the full set. That left perfect fodder for breaking up and selling.\n\nThe vast majority of what I sent in was of things that I wouldn't have much competition with as far as other sellers. From these oddball cards to O-Pee-Chee Baseball (a perk of being a Canadian) and even some O-Pee-Chee Basketball (they exist), that initial shipment had a lot that I figured would target player and team collectors like myself.\n\nI also went through more than a decade's worth of plain jersey cards and purged. Today, these don't get me excited except when it's a player I like. And even then, the concept of a player-worn jersey from a photoshoot bores me. The purge not only freed up a lot of space in some of my monster boxes but there were enough that even if I averaged a couple of dollars each, I'd be on my way to a slightly off-grade Michael Jordan rookie card or a decent Wayne Gretzky autograph.\n\nGetting Cards Ready\n\nWhen I'd finished going through and picking out what to send in, I had wrangled up about 550 cards. In the grand scheme, that's not a lot, but it's a start. The next step was to prep the cards to send in.\n\nI took the overkill approach, strictly for my own peace of mind.\n\nI could have simply packaged the cards up, added the small bit of paperwork and left it at that. But not having used COMC to sell before I was understandably nervous. What if something went wrong? What if the cards went missing between my post office and COMC headquarters? What if one of the few high-end cards I sent in got lost?\n\nOne of the nice things about selling cards on COMC is that you don't have to list what you're sending in. They take care of it all. But like any human-run business, mistakes can happen.\n\nAlthough unnecessary and a little time-consuming, I took the added step of making a basic spreadsheet of what I was sending in. This way, if the postal system lost it, I knew exactly what to claim. Or if a card wasn't listed for some reason, I'd know. This added some time, but it was worth it.\n\nNow it was time to box things up.\n\nI made sure everything was in a penny sleeve. Shipping in top loaders costs extra so those were left out.\n\nCOMC's submission wizard was simple. Fill in a bit of information, give an estimate of how many cards you're sending and print off the packing slip. That's it. I also found this video from their site to be helpful and made me feel better. Honestly, it seemed too easy and I thought I was missing something.\n\nI wasn't sure if it was better to send one long box or break my cards up into several smaller boxes and pack those into a larger one. I opted for the latter. The cards first went into a few 330-count boxes. I packaged them as I normally might, careful to put some paper around the inside edges to prevent dings as the cards could shift and bang during shipment. Those 330-count boxes were then put into one bigger shoebox where they fit perfectly.\n\nOff to the post office I went and the cards were on their way. Sticking with the peace of mind theme, I ponied up and got the tracking. When I got home, I then entered the tracking details into COMC's system. Like everything else to do with dealing with the site so far for selling, it took a few brief moments and wasn't hard.\n\nListing and Pricing\n\nThe particular promotion I took advantage of said that it could take up to two months for my cards to get listed. That was fine. I'd been sitting on many of them for years. I wasn't in a rush.\n\nWithin a couple of days of COMC receiving my cards, the first few started getting listed. I wasn't sure if all would show up at once or if it would be in batches. It has been something of a slow trickle.\n\nThis works for me as I haven't had to spend hours pricing my cards to sell. Rather it was a few minutes here and there.\n\nThe promotion I used cost $0.20 per card. For that, each card was identified, scanned in and entered into their system. Even without the sale, the regular selling rates ($0.25 for a basic card that's listed for less than $50) seem more than fair. Scanning cards takes up a lot of my time normally. I had to do none of that here.\n\nOne of the nice things I've found about selling sports cards on COMC is that I pick the price. Seeing as how these are all extras, I took a somewhat aggressive approach. In most instances, if others had the same card listed as me, I'd undercut them ever so slightly. Jerk move? Maybe. But that's the nature of a free market. I'm there to sell cards and if you're not the cheapest, you're going to have a hard time moving anything unless it's of a hot player.\n\nWhen you're listing, COMC shows if other cards are listed and at what price. You can also quickly check historical sales data by clicking on the graph icon. Both of these were helpful to me and made it easy.\n\nIn instances where there was no data available, I did a quick search of eBay sales to get in the ballpark. When that didn't give any results, I'll be honest -- I made prices up to see where they went.\n\nFor cards where I had no competition, I went a little higher. As a player collector myself, I have always been willing to pay a little extra for what I need, especially if it's convenient. Potential buyers can also make offers if you enable that option so it makes little sense to go too low.\n\nThere are also fees to take into account. It makes no sense to sell a card for less than your listing fee. On the other end, COMC charges buyers $0.25 when they buy a card. This is built into the price you see on the site. But it's important because if you want to list a card for $5, you actually need to price it at $4.75. When that card sells, you get the $4.75 and COMC gets the $0.25.\n\nThe actual entering of the prices is, like everything else I've encountered, simple. COMC notifies me there are things ready to list, I log in and start typing in what I want. If there's a batch of a few cards, you enter the price, hit ENTER on the keyboard and it takes you to the next card.\n\nLike a lot of COMC sellers, I'm playing a long game with my cards. I'm expecting it to take months for many of these cards to sell. But if things take too long, I'm going to have to pay. After 90 days, there's a $0.01 per month storage fee for every card. With the amount I've got, this isn't a big deal. But it's still something to consider pricing things.\n\nWheeling, Dealing and Annoying Low-Ball Offers\n\nIt didn't take long once my first batches of cards were listed for the offers to start coming in. And it didn't take long to realize that there are buyers on COMC that are counting every single penny.\n\nWhen you sell on the site, you can choose to accept offers. Like eBay, you can have them set to automatically decline if they're too low or auto-accept if they're high enough.\n\nTrying to price my things somewhat aggressively, I want to see as many offers as possible. It doesn't mean I'm going to accept them, but I'll certainly consider them. Those that are reasonable, I've been able to strike deals with quickly.\n\nBut if you're going to accept offers, be prepared to be annoyed. Case in point, I had someone offer me $4.88 for a card, exactly half of what I was asking for an autograph. I'd based my price on a recent eBay sale. I countered with $8, a couple dollars off what already seemed to be a seemingly reasonable price. Their counter to that? $5, a whopping $0.12 up from their original offer. I declined to negotiate further at that point.\n\nThere have been a couple of other instances like that. But I've also made some sales based on fair offers, sales I probably wouldn't have made if I had the offers option turned off or set higher.\n\nAt this point, I have made some sales. They seem to come in bursts and then slow down. I think my approach has been the right one too. The sale of a Brewers Police Angel Miranda proved that there's a collector out there for just about anything.\n\nI'm still a long way from amassing enough to get that one sweet card but that's part of the long game. So far, the simplicity has been what has stood out the most. It really has been a matter of picking cards out, packing them up, shipping them out and a little bit pricing and negotiating.",
  "latent_17167": "FILE - In this Monday, June 12, 2017, file photo, the General Electric logo appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The ambition of new GE CEO John Flannery to pare away everything that could stand in the way of General Electric’s return to its industrial core emerged Friday, Oct. 20, 2017, with plans to expel more than $20 billion in operations over the next couple of years. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — General Electric’s new CEO is starting to lay out bold plans to return the conglomerate to its industrial roots by slashing costs and streamlining its operations.\n\nJohn Flannery said Friday that the company will shed business units worth more than $20 billion over the next year or two.\n\nFlannery, who has been on the job less than three months, is expected to provide more details next month on how he will put his own stamp on the Boston-based manufacturing giant. But he offered plenty of hints after GE’s latest disappointing financial results.\n\nGE drastically cut expectations for the full year after its third-quarter profit fell more sharply than expected due to large restructuring charges. Flannery called the results unacceptable.\n\n“It’s also clear from our current results that we need to make some major changes with urgency and a depth of purpose,” he said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nThe company’s shares slid 6 percent in morning trading but recovered throughout the day. They ended regular trading up 25 cents at $23.83.\n\nFlannery led GE’s health care unit until becoming CEO in August. He replaced Jeff Immelt, who had reshaped GE after taking over from legendary CEO Jack Welch but couldn’t reverse a slump in the company’s stock while the overall market boomed. GE shares are down 25 percent this year, the worst performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.\n\nImmelt also came under fire for executive perks. GE acknowledged that on occasions an empty plane followed the CEO’s jet on trips, and one of Flannery’s first moves was grounding GE’s fleet of six corporate jets. Flannery has replaced several top executives.\n\nOn Friday, Flannery did not mention Immelt by name but said he was focusing on fixing GE’s “culture,” which he said “needs to be driven by mutual candor and intense execution, and the accountability that must come with that.” He mentioned the overhaul of the top executive ranks and the addition to the board of a representative from activist investor Trian Fund Management.\n\n“Things will not stay the same at GE,” Flannery vowed.\n\nThe CEO promised more details on GE’s transformation at a Nov. 13 meeting, but he talked Friday about major cost cuts across the board and the exit from a slew of businesses.\n\nGeneral Electric Co. has been paring businesses for well over a decade now.\n\nThe drive to get lean has come with a big price tag.\n\nDuring the quarter, profit fell 9 percent to $1.84 billion, or 21 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring costs and to account for discontinued operations, came to 29 cents per share, but that’s still far from the per-share earnings of 49 cents that Wall Street had expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.\n\nRevenue jumped 14 percent to $33.5 billion, exceeding the $31.92 billion analysts had expected. Sales in the power unit, GE’s biggest source of revenue, fell 4 percent and the unit’s profitability fell by half. Sales and earnings in the transportation division were off by double-digit percentages.\n\nBut other parts of GE are growing including aviation, the company’s second-biggest business — GE makes jet engines — and health care. Revenue from the oil and gas division nearly doubled on the acquisition of Baker Hughes, which closed in July.\n\nThe company has already surpassed its goal of cutting $1 billion in industrial costs this year. It plans more than $2 billion in cuts next year, double the original target, to go with at least $20 billion in divestments over the next year or two, Flannery said.\n\nGE has many strong areas “but a number of other businesses which drain investment and management resources without the prospects for a substantial reward,” Flannery said. “We will have a simpler, more focused portfolio.”\n\nThe company cut its full-year outlook to between $1.05 and $1.10 per share. That’s well down from a previous per-share outlook of $1.60 to 1.70, and far off the $1.54 per share analysts that had been looking for, according to a poll by FactSet.\n\n“As bad as earnings undeniably are, the focus remains on cash,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe.\n\nFlannery’s focus was also on cash flow in an August letter, and was a big driver in the sell-off early Friday.\n\nIndustrial operating cash flow was $1.7 billion during the quarter, more than a billion short of projections from Morgan Stanley.",

And with one last dusty breath, that archaic medium issues its final sigh, whispering to us all ... something, probably. I'm sure we'll find out when it shows up on Yahoo! News or HuffPo if it's worth hearing.\n\nToday, most people get their news from blogs instead of newspapers, they read their novels on Kindles or tablets, and they get all their sex tips from porn instead of checkout counter magazine racks. The trend has caused the giants in the print industry to close up shop or cut their staff so drastically that their publications look more like community newsletters than beacons of journalistic integrity. This is, of course, a bad thing.\n\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\n\nBut while the print industry collapses as a direct result of our neglect, there's some shockingly good news coming out of the fiasco that I'm sure papers would have loved to report on if they could still afford to pay journalists to do so: The death of print has acted as a massive speed bump for global warming.\n\nComstock/Getty Images\n\n\"Yes! Here's to being dicks, guys!\"\n\nAround 68 percent of the lumber industry in the world is supported by the demand for paper in developed countries, a demand that's now dropped to less that 30 percent in the past seven years alone. As the mills closed down, forested areas that were allocated for clearing were instead thriving, and no one really knew what that would mean for the Earth, at least not until recently. The polar ice sheets that were so good at melting and bringing us that much closer to a Waterworld future just gave up in the last year. The shelves stopped falling into the ocean almost completely, and scientists think they finally know why.\n\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\n\nSee, creating paper wasn't just about cutting down trees; the process of chewing up all that wood into pulp was a huge contributor of methane and greenhouse gases as well, and now that the industry has tanked, we've essentially given Mother Nature a few minutes to catch her breath. The only downside is that now she seems to be a little angry.\n\nExperts predict that this one minor change in our lifestyle is going to have a massive reversal effect on the entire planet. The sudden shift in greenhouse gas ratios will create more severe winters across the Northern Hemisphere, essentially dropping us into a minor ice age. No one is ready to predict how long it will last or how cold it will get or if we'll be able to walk from Alaska to Russia if we want, but regardless, this is probably a good time to invest in Gore-Tex.

You can use soy, almond, hemp, cashew – they all work well.\n\n>>Cook’s tip: When you add the lemon juice it will slightly curdle – don’t worry, that’s what you want to happen! It’s turning the plant milk into buttermilk.\n\nStep 2: Melt the vegan butter (a hard vegan butter or a non-dairy margarine all work) with the syrup.\n\n>>Cook’s tip: You can use any liquid sweetener: golden syrup, corn syrup, agave or maple syrup. Maple makes for a slightly less sweet cake, but it’s still really nice.\n\nStep 3: Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl, then whisk to combine.\n\nStep 4: Mix the wet ingredients into the dry and stir to combine.\n\nStep 5: Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 30-35 minutes or until an inserted skewer (or knife) comes out clean.

But this one doesn’t contain flax or chia to replace the eggs.\n\nThe most unusual ingredient is dairy free milk (soy, almond, oat, rice etc…), but you can pick that up at any shop. Instead of butter, I’ve used a vegan butter/margarine.\n\nI’ve found that vegan spreads/margarine work the same as dairy spreads in baking.\n\nFor my cake I’ve melted some with golden syrup (you could substitute maple syrup) for the cake, and I’ve whipped some straight from the fridge for the fluffy, chocolatey frosting.\n\nI used Flora Freedom vegan spread which has 60% less saturated fat than butter.

  "latent_17300": "Earlier this year, when I moved from Washington, D.C., to Santa Fe, New Mexico, I prepared for most aspects of my life to change dramatically. As a lifelong East Coaster, I’d spent years living mostly in bustling cities, passing hours of my day on public transit while surrounded by the fast-moving, career-driven types of the Northeast—the antithesis of the small, quirky Southwestern community that I now call home.\n\nI feel this change most acutely in my new running routines. In Santa Fe, I can run the trails near town at sunrise or drive up into the national forest after work. On those early morning runs, the desert air is crisp and the trails are quiet and empty, save for the occasional jackrabbit darting between shrubs. I still gawk like a tourist every time the sun edges up over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the east. After work, I’m spoiled with options—a dizzying network of trails spider through the national forest. In Santa Fe, there’s no reason to complain about repetitive road routes or runs spent weaving around groups of tourists or stopping my watch while waiting to cross a busy street.\n\nBut here’s the thing: occasionally, and unexpectedly, I’m hit with a bout of nostalgia for a run through the city.\n\nMost of the time, I specifically long for nighttime city runs. In D.C., where I lived for a year and a half, if I got home late, I could always lace up my shoes and log a few miles before going to bed. In the part of the city where I lived, the streets were well lit and people were around at all hours, unlike in Santa Fe. I hardly ever felt unsafe, regardless of the time. Those nighttime routes were far from my favorites, but the opportunity to loosen up my muscles and work through the day’s stress more than made up for it. (I also admit to feeling a kind of smugness running at an hour when almost everyone else was asleep.)\n\nIt’s not just the night runs that I miss. Before I moved to D.C., I lived in Boston—a city overflowing with running culture and history. Along the Charles River, there’s a palpable sense of camaraderie between runners, even when the path is covered in snow and the wind off the water stings your face. Boston is truly a runner’s city: a place where the marathon feels like its own national holiday. And on those inevitable rough days when the miles inched by and I forgot what it meant to be fast (or that this sport could ever be enjoyable), it felt like I was out running with the rest of the city. All of us feeling tired and hurting and wanting to quit, but still moving along together.\n\nBecause of the crowds and inherent busy nature of the city, living in one also often means returning to a small roster of reliable running routes. I spent one summer during college living and working in New York City, and my hectic schedule and unfamiliarity with the area forced me to run varying distances along the same stretch of the Hudson River nearly every day for three months. At first, this was excruciatingly boring. But as the summer rolled on, I came to appreciate the opportunity for introspection. Every morning, as I passed the same piers, tennis courts, and grassy parks, I was confronted by the same thoughts I’d had while running the identical route the day before—and I could watch as my thoughts slowly evolved for the better. The halfhearted relationship I’d left behind at school felt more distant; the stress I was feeling at work slowly became more manageable. The banality of running the same route over and over turned my attention back toward myself; my surroundings acted as bookmarks for what I’d been thinking at that spot on the previous day’s run. This is something my less-repetitive runs in Santa Fe—where I often focus my energy on enjoying the scenery or ensuring I don’t get lost—rarely allow for.\n\nThe nature of city running also makes any opportunity for a trail run—where you can find it—feel even more precious. The trails I ran in Boston and D.C. are underwhelming compared to those I run now, but I no longer experience that exhilarating feeling of finding refuge in the Fells or Rock Creek Park after running a mile or two on asphalt just to get there. To discover a place within a city where I could hear many layers of old leaves crunch under my shoes was invigorating. I was only a few miles away from a world of metro delays and endless Whole Foods lines, but in that moment, as I was running over a lone bridge across a rushing stream in the middle of the woods, those nuisances were far from my mind. A good trail in a city feels like a well-kept secret—a temporary hideaway from the crowded chaos.\n\nI had earned it.",
  "latent_17332": "Architecture is the setting for how we live and the expression of how we think. It reflects our shaping of the world in order to inhabit it, and the geometry of what we build is far from neutral. The built environment, like the biological and other natural systems that it engages, needs to function reliably in complex and adaptive ways on many different levels. Such adaptive and sustainable systems have similar characteristics that, despite distinct origins, develop in a broadly similar manner.\n\nThe need to provide shelter from the elements and serve everyday needs led to the construction of roofs and walls that defined spaces adapted to human use. Traditional buildings and cities were assemblies of such basic components, put together in ways that had been found to promote particular and overall functioning. The New York row house, the New England village green, and the Mediterranean arcade and plaza all suit the setting and way of life in which they grew up.\n\nMore importantly, going beyond mere function, those structures combined ornament and other details that somehow seemed necessary. Even when structures were designed as a whole, their form and organization followed the evolved principles that had led to successful construction in the past. The results included the great historical styles of architecture, and the most-loved and most functional buildings and cities East and West.\n\nTimes change, and not always for the better. The advent of architectural modernism in the first decades of the twentieth century suppressed traditional styles and complex evolved forms in favor of simple concepts and striking images. The result was an approach to the built environment that lent itself to public relations and propaganda—it played well in manifestos and glossy architecture magazines—but was less functional, less adaptive, and less human and engaging.\n\nWhat happened, why did it happen, and why do people stick with an approach to building and design that evidently does not work to engage our complex faculties? The answer goes to the nature of science and of freedom: whether they have to do with understanding reality and living in accordance with it, or with the imposition of arbitrary will.\n\nOur educated world does not distinguish science from technology, because it confuses understanding with arbitrary control. Modernism had to do with the latter. It was an attempt to liberate technology from reality that took the form of a massive but unscientific application of technology to shape the world into an industrial dream image. Hence the emphasis on unfamiliar invented forms, sharp edges, and gleaming surfaces. The effort was entirely unscientific because no thought was given to discovering how human beings actually interact with their environment, or whether we need certain specific geometrical features just like we need nourishment and air, or to understanding how human beings interact with each other to create a city. Modernist architects just drew forms on paper that looked like machines and those in power built them.\n\nThe motivation was essentially political and oriented toward domination. The revolutionary movements that followed World War I wanted a break with the past, and especially the look of the past. The world revolution would rebuild humanity through industrialization, so these movements embraced buildings that looked like the machines of the time: sleek, white, and metallic. States, both on the left and on the right, loved this depersonalized approach to building, where the individual no longer matters and everything is sacrificed to an imposed utopian vision. Aspects of architectural modernism are prominent in Nazi and Soviet architecture, and the capitalist state also turned the machine into an icon. When Le Corbusier died both Lyndon Johnson and the Soviets expressed their sense of profound loss.\n\nThe modernist architectural pioneers made up wild explanations for why the new designs and materials were supposedly superior, practically and ethically, and were rewarded with commissions, fame, and academic positions. Human checks and balances disappeared, the industrial system took over, and traditional construction techniques and a vast network of local building and craft traditions went out of business.\n\nThe outcome of these developments is something resembling a totalitarian system that unites immense financial and industrial interests with a pseudo-religious fanaticism. There are governments and corporations that wish to flaunt their power through monstrous and arrogant building schemes, industries that produce very expensive high-tech materials, developers who want to make their money work but have no moral constraints, and architects who are willing to do anything to obtain a commission. Politicians get pulled into supporting the ideology by the chance to gain media coverage and campaign contributions. And the gullible public naively believes all it reads in the conformist media.\n\nThere is something profoundly anti-natural about the results. By contradicting traditional evolved geometries, modernist and contemporary architecture and urban planning go against the natural order of things. When an architect or planner ignores the need for adaptation and imposes his or her will, the result is an absurd form—an act of defiance toward any higher sense of natural order. There is no room for God in totalitarian design. What religious believer is helped to greater devotion by a modernist Church? Who can love materials hostile to our touch and sight, surfaces and oppressive spaces that sometimes suggest violation and death? Architectural modernism implies a sort of cosmic rebellion against order and life.\n\nOne lesson of contemporary architecture is that there exists a basic need for religious belief. Ours is not the secular world everyone pretends it to be. Architects tend to follow a cult of images that arose in the early twentieth century from the desire to break with all elements of the past, especially inherited human culture. Contemporary architects professing to be atheistic champions are in fact promoting an ideology with religious overtones. Their buildings, we are told, are “iconic,” and the attempt to reshape the built environment in accordance with pure concept, as Le Corbusier proposed in his plan for Paris, is an attempt to reshape the world in which we live into an expression of will and inhuman rationality.\n\nThe ideology of contemporary architecture is detached from nature and from God. It creates buildings that are dangerously detached from human beings. Traditional religions, despite periodic failings and fanaticisms, arose out of the evolution of human culture, and are thus far more grounded in real human needs. More importantly, they celebrate humans as rich and complex beings, with capabilities far beyond those of a machine. This makes religions more rational, and less divisive, than pseudo-religions based on irrational will. A Greek or Hindu temple, a sixteenth-century mosque, or a Gothic cathedral connects us to each other, to the past, and to the world. A modernist building or urban design does not. Even someone from a different civilization and religious tradition can tell the difference.\n\nFor millennia, houses of worship focused the design and construction talents of the populations onto their love of God. Traditional religious architecture is above all an architecture of life, from the overall form down to the smallest ornamental detail, because God is identified with life and with love. After a cult of alien images supplanted God in the early twentieth century, churches were built to the glory of the cult, no longer to the God of living beings. Today we see merchants of an architecture characterized by a geometry that avoids living structure—the currently fashionable star architects—who are commissioned to build religious buildings totally devoid of humanity and love, and so of God. Is this the suicide of the Great Religions, intentionally suppressing their core values?\n\nThese observations on architecture have implications for social life. Structural rules developed for buildings and urban design cannot be applied directly to human society and political systems, but the same fundamental principles are at work. In general terms, evolved societal complexity needs to be respected. Politically, consideration of the nature of functional and adaptive systems points to traditional social values and the individual freedom to choose, and away from the cult of anti-intuitive expertise in the service of the globalized consumerist system. That means favoring traditional societal structures that grow up from the connections found in daily life and have proven their value over generations. This result is antithetical to the insistence on erasing tradition and creating a brave new society based on industrialized principles and untested utopian ideas that promise progress and liberation but deliver the precise opposite.\n\nSo what to do? Contemporary society has detached people from the real world, and especially from the traditional, spiritual world where a higher sense of order resides. Natural perceptions made concrete in tradition have been replaced by ideology and constructed images. Ordinary good sense and a human grasp of reality somehow must be restored.\n\nNew architectural theories developed by Christopher Alexander and his followers attempt to do so by giving scientific reasons for things, such as the need for small-scale ornament, that in the past were simply assumed. With ordinary people a brief introduction is enough for them to get the point and tune into living structure. The problem is with the educated. Architects in particular have been taught to block their own sensory apparatus so as to support approved products of modernity. That’s necessary because preferring cold, sterile, or absurd forms goes against our need to experience biophilic structures in our immediate environment. This aspect of education in the West is as effective in promoting ignorance as the fanatical indoctrination seen in other parts of the world.\n\nIt is hard to know how it will end. So far the results of our protests and denunciations have been more reminiscent of Cassandra than of the original Alexander and his generals. Perhaps the current situation will end with societal collapse when we run out of cheap energy? Or when the developing world realizes the deception? Already the West is hated through its architectural expressions: You cannot fool traditionally religious people into believing that monstrous buildings hostile to human sensibilities are good.\n\nAll is not lost, of course. Humanity is irrepressible, and thousands of buildings reflecting the human spirit are erected around the world today and in the recent past, even though we never hear about them. They are indigenous, vernacular, modest, many of them self-built, all expressions of human intuition about what a nutritive environment has to be. Even the buildings in third-world favelas have more life in them than prize-winning modernist or postmodernist structures. More formal buildings built in regional traditional styles also abound: Again, you don’t see them in the media. There are also quite a number of contemporary architects working with the classical form language, and many of their buildings are wonderful. Architects who relearn how to design classical buildings free up their intuition to perceive nutritive spaces, forms, and surfaces, and therefore their product is adaptive to human sensibilities.\n\nIn the end, perhaps after horrible upheavals, the defects of contemporary architectural movements will certainly destroy them. In the meantime, those who see the nature and effect of those movements must continue to do battle in season and out of season. They owe that to those who came before, to their fellow citizens, and to their posterity.\n\nThis essay first appeared on Public Discourse: Ethics, Law, and Common Good, the online journal of the Witherspoon Institute of Princeton, NJ, under the title “Against the Architects of Empire” and is adapted from an earlier interview conducted by James Kalb.

First is the Article III double-dipping problem, to which this Essay’s title refers. This problem arises because those parties purport to derive their Article III standing by asserting the governments’ interest in defending the challenged marriage laws. Yet the governments in both cases, via their chief legal officers, have taken the position that excluding same-sex couples from marriage is unconstitutional. To permit this Janus-faced commitment to both sides of the cases would render the concept of the government interest incoherent for Article III standing purposes. The second problem is that Proposition 8’s proponents and BLAG both lack the enforcement powers that give rise to the government’s “direct stake” needed for standing in federal court.",

And yet they stand just one point off the top spot and are also likely to qualify for the knockout rounds in the Champions League.\n\nTheir results this season have been built on solid defensive foundations, as they have conceded just nine goals in the league and have barely put a foot wrong defensively. Yet overall, United are winning matches without playing the exciting brand of football the club is renowned for. Ex-players such as Paul Scholes have held nothing back in their observations about United's somewhat conservative style of play and the club's own fans have been chanting \"attack, attack, attack\" out of frustration over the team's slow tempo.\n\nUnited have the fewest goals of all top-seven clubs in the Premier League, with midfielder Juan Mata leading the team in goals with four, followed by Anthony Martial with three and Wayne Rooney -- whose goal tally reached double figures in each of his last 11 seasons -- only contributing two league goals so far. If United are to get back to the swashbuckling style they enjoyed under the previous manager, Alex Ferguson, then things will have to start clicking up front.\n\nA string of injuries at the forward position certainly haven't helped, and the Dutch manager will be hoping that his top summer signings step up to the plate. But he has also shown great faith in United's youngsters and is willing to take chances by blooding homegrown talent. Could that combination of signings and youth put the smile back on the supporters' faces?\n\nHere's a look at Manchester United's top young forwards -- those 22 years old and under, both first-teamers and those climbing through the youth system -- including a breakdown of each striker's skill set, development areas and outlook.\n\n...",

  "latent_17380": "You can add vacuum cleaners to the list of consumer goods implicated in energy efficiency scandals. According to claims made by Dyson founder James Dyson, Bosch and Siemens vacuums have been cheating EU energy tests in a manner \"akin to that seen in the Volkswagen scandal.\" Dyson has launched legal action against both the companies, reports the Press Association, following his claims earlier this month that European regulations are simply \"a smokescreen for manufacturers to hide behind.\"\n\n\"This behavior is seriously misleading.\"\n\n\"Bosch has installed control electronics into some of its machines to wrongfully increase energy consumption when in use — to cheat the EU energy label,\" said Dyson. \"It seems that industry is rife with manufacturers engineering to find their way around tests, rather than engineering better, more efficient technology. This behavior is seriously misleading customers.\"\n\nHowever, it's possible that regulatory incompetence rather than corporate skulduggery is to blame. Dyson claims that vacuums made by Bosch and Siemens use internal sensors to increase their energy usage from 750W to 1,600W when their bags are full. However, Dyson also claims that the EU's tests are conducted using empty bags. This would mean that the regulators might not even notice the energy increase, leading to the vacuums being awarded their current AAAA ratings.\n\nCorporate skulduggery or regulatory incompetence?\n\nBosch, for its part, has \"strenuously rejected\" the allegations, claiming in a press statement: \"All Bosch and Siemens vacuum cleaners are measured in compliance with European energy regulations. Appliance performance at home is consistent with laboratory performance — and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly misleading.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Dyson is reported to have launched a broadside attack against European regulatory tests in general. \"[There are] fridges tested with no food, vacuum cleaners tested with no dust, and washing machines tested at inaccurate temperatures,\" said Dyson in comments reported by The Telegraph. \"The regulators clearly live in a place that looks nothing like the real world and manufacturers are taking advantage.\"\n\nDyson's allegations follow not only the Volkswagen scandal, but also recent claims that Samsung's TVs have been cheating energy efficiency tests as well. (Something the company strongly denies.) These incidents, though, are part of wider trend which might be dubbed the \"internet of paranoia,\" with previously dumb objects now imbued with the software and connectivity to cheat not only regulatory tests, but consumers as well.",
  "latent_17397": "by Jeff Matthews\n\nFederal Health Insurance Mandates: Why You Canâ€™t Oppose them and Support Federal Marijuana Bans at the Same Time.\n\nIs there any limit to what the Commerce Clause allows Congress to do?Â Â Letâ€™s take a look at the Commerce Clause, which states, â€œTo regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;â€\n\nThough the clause has been extended by the U.S. Supreme Court in an almost continuous fashion since the Constitution was ratified, its 1942 decision in Wickard v. Filburn was a monumental extension.Â In issue in Wickard was the ability of Congress to regulate how much wheat a farmer could grow, when the wheat was not going to be traded in the market and would be used for the farmerâ€™s own consumption.Â Filburn was prosecuted for growing 23 acres of wheat in the face of a federal statute allowing only 11.1 acres to be grown.Â Â Filburn argued Congress had no authority to restrict how much wheat he could grow because the excess wheat he was growing was for his own use on his farm and not for sale on the market.Â Thus, he claimed the excess wheat would never become involved in interstate commerce.\n\nIn holding that Congress did not exceed its authority, the Supreme Court stated:\n\nOne of the primary purposes of the Act in question was to increase the market price of wheat, and to that end to limit the volume thereof that could affect the market. It can hardly be denied that a factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions. This may arise because being in marketable condition such wheat overhangs the market and, if induced by rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price increases. But if we assume that it is never marketed, it supplies a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market. Home-grown wheat in this sense competes with wheat in commerce.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\nAbove, it is seen that regulating commerce has been interpreted to mean regulating things that â€œcould affectâ€ interstate commerce.Â Â The Court ruled that excess wheat â€œtendsâ€ to find its way into interstate commerce, without any proof that the wheat in question actually does â€“ much like assuming that since black markets tend to arise when government limits supply, Filburn was already in that class of persons who trade in black markets.Â Â One would have to ask whether it is an appropriate standard of judicial review for our Supreme Court to assume guilt, rather than innocence.\n\nHowever, the Court partly dodged its assumption of guilt by pointing out that even if Filburn was an otherwise law-abiding citizen, to the extent he grew his own wheat, he would not have to purchase what he needed from the open market.Â Â Thus, the Court concluded, allowing many people to avoid price regulation by supplying their own needs would thwart Congressâ€™ desire to maintain higher wheat prices.Â Â Filburnâ€™s lack of demand for wheat on the market would accordingly â€œaffectâ€ interstate commerce by the simple fact that he would have no need to make purchases from the market.\n\nIncidentally, one can easily speculate that the federal mandate to purchase health insurance might be upheld on this reasoning â€“ i.e., the absence of need for health insurance reduces demand for it.Â Is this not true with respect to every product offered for sale by third-parties?\n\nGonzales v. Raich was a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court opinion which relied heavily on Wickard.Â Raich relied on Californiaâ€™s laws permitting marijuana use for medicinal purposes, which also allowed her to grow marijuana for her personal consumption.Â The federal government refused to recognize that Californiaâ€™s laws afforded her any rights to engage in such activities.\n\nThe Supreme Court wrote:\n\nThe similarities between this case and Wickard are striking. Like the farmer in Wickard, respondents are cultivating, for home consumption, a fungible commodity for which there is an established, albeit illegal, interstate market. Just as the Agricultural Adjustment Act was designed “to control the volume [of wheat] moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses …” and consequently control the market price, id., at 115, a primary purpose of the CSA is to control the supply and demand of controlled substances in both lawful and unlawful drug marketsâ€¦. More concretely, one concern prompting inclusion of wheat grown for home consumption in the 1938 Act was that rising market prices could draw such wheat into the interstate market, resulting in lower market prices. Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128. The parallel concern making it appropriate to include marijuana grown for home consumption in the CSA is the likelihood that the high demand in the interstate market will draw such marijuana into that market.\n\nInterestingly, the issue in Raich was not one of price controls.Â Instead, it concerned an outright ban.Â Â Nobody was arguing the price of marijuana should be higher and Raich should go out on the open market and purchase it.\n\nSo, what remains is the Courtâ€™s observation that regulation by the federal government was proper because of â€œthe likelihood that the high demand in the interstate market will draw such [home-grown] marijuana into that market.â€Â Here, it can be seen that the Courtâ€™s opinion inescapably hinges on its assumption that Raich would turn criminal and begin selling her home-grown marijuana in the interstate market.\n\nIn short, what can be concluded from the similarities between Wickard and Raich is that it is enough to justify federal intrusion into state concerns if something has the potential to become involved in interstate commerce, and not whether it actually does.Â Moreover, Raich makes it clear that in the face of federal regulation of interstate commerce, one who possesses items against the will of the federal government will inevitably become a criminal.Â Â Thus, a personâ€™s potential to become a criminal makes him a criminal.\n\nJustice Thomas vigorously dissented in Raich, stating as follows:\n\nEven the majority does not argue that respondents’ conduct is itself “Commerce among the several States,” Art. I, Â§ 8, cl. 3. Ante, at 22. Monson and Raich neither buy nor sell the marijuana that they consume. They cultivate their cannabis entirely in the State of California â€” it never crosses state lines, much less as part of a commercial transaction. Certainly no evidence from the founding suggests that “commerce” included the mere possession of a good or some purely personal activity that did not involve trade or exchange for valueâ€¦. This Court has never held that Congress can regulate noneconomic activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. Morrison, 529 U. S., at 613 (“[T]hus far in our Nation’s history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature” (emphasis added)); Lopez, supra, at 560. To evade even that modest restriction on federal power, the majority defines economic activity in the broadest possible terms as the “`the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities.'” Ante, at 25 (quoting Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 720 (1966) (hereinafter Webster’s 3d)). This carves out a vast swath of activities that are subject to federal regulation. See ante, at 49-50 (O’CONNOR, J., dissenting). If the majority is to be taken seriously, the Federal Government may now regulate quilting bees, clothes drives, and potluck suppers throughout the 50 States. This makes a mockery of Madison’s assurance to the people of New York that the “powers delegated” to the Federal Government are “few and defined,” while those of the States are “numerous and indefinite.” The Federalist No. 45, at 313 (J. Madison).\n\n(emphasis added).\n\nIn Thomasâ€™ dissent, the emphasized language is the exact language relied upon by opponents of the new health insurance mandates.Â Â Simply put, opponents argue that the insurance mandates are Unconstitutional because the decision not to purchase insurance is not the act of engaging in â€œeconomicâ€ activity; it is merely the act of oneâ€™s existing and deciding not to engage in a particular economic activity.\n\nIn conclusion, Raich involved an issue, legalized marijuana, which a great number of people oppose.Â Â For that reason, it is common to see many advocates for less government who have the opinion that Raich was properly decided.Â Â They advocate for less government but oppose legalizing marijuana.\n\nFor those who are within the foregoing category, a serious conflict arises.Â Â To support the decision in Raich is to admit that the federal government does, indeed, have the authority to force purchases of health insurance and to require compliance with a myriad of mandates with which such people would normally disagree.\n\nSome might argue that Raich actually engaged in behavior, i.e., growing plants, thus, laying the grounds to allow federal regulation over her.Â However, the same could be said for any activity.Â Â For example, consuming alcohol and fast food, as well as working hard, are activities that, under the same logic, should be subject to regulation by the federal government, e.g. â€œAny person who consumes alcohol or fast food, or who works hard, shall be required to maintain health insurance meeting the minimum requirements of this Act.â€\n\nIt seems there are only two plausible ways in which to deal with this conflict in the context of the limits, if any, on the federal governmentâ€™s authority to regulate commerce among the states.Â Â The first is simply not to concern oneâ€™s self with the rules of law and to just argue points based on an inconsistent reasoning.Â The second is to gain a higher appreciation for why the rules of law were crafted as they were and to be willing to concede to proper reasoning.\n\nUsing the principles of law relied on by the federal courts to maintain a federal ban on marijuana use, one cannot be both:Â (1) against the federal governmentâ€™s new health insurance mandates, and (2) against a stateâ€™s right to legalize marijuana use.\n\nJeff Matthews [send him email] is a practicing attorney in Houston.

Costa pleaded guilty to a felony count of health care fraud after an FBI probe into his oral surgery practice found he had charged for procedures he never performed, according to court records. Though the crime carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison, Costa was able to avoid prison time after Carson helped petition a federal judge for leniency. That's different from the position Carson took in 2013 as he prepared to launch his presidential campaign, saying those convicted of health care fraud should go to prison for at least a decade and be forced to forfeit \"all of one's personal possessions.\"\n\nThe attraction of a brilliant neurosurgeon to the dingier precincts of his profession—this guy, Mannatech—is one of the more curious things about him. There are two possible reasons for this, and I think they're both true. The first is that there is something dangerously messianic to his personality that enables him to justify everything he does, including consorting with con-men and thieves, because he's the one doing the consorting, and whatever he does is justified through his brilliance, his biography, and/or his close personal relationship with certain Nazarene carpenters. The second is that he cannot see the flaws of anyone who sees the world the way he does. Make the right mouth-noises about \"values\" and the Bible, and you can be dismembering your grandmother in the backyard with a circular saw, and Dr. Ben will sit down and chat over economic policy with you. Neither of these is a trait we ought to encourage in our public officials.\n\nDoug Watts, the campaign's spokesman, said Wednesday he was unable to immediately respond to specific questions about land deals involving Carson and Costa. The AP contacted Watts on Tuesday and again Wednesday. \"I will confirm they are best friends and that they do hold business investments together,\" Watts said. Costa did not respond to messages seeking comment. The breadth of the two men's business ties has not been previously reported, partly because details can be obscured in property and incorporation records. Costa's company and its affiliates own properties in at least five states and overseas.\n\nNothing suspicious there. Move along, ya heathen bastids.\n\nIn 2007, a few months before Costa was charged, records show that a pair of corporations was established in Pennsylvania called BenCan LLC, and INBS LLC. Carson and his wife are listed as the sole members of the companies.

A vote is expected on Thursday.\n\nBut school boards in the Toronto-area regions of Durham and Peel and the Sudbury-area Rainbow District wasted little time in publicly announcing they would reopen schools Wednesday.\n\nThe labour relations board ordered an immediate two-week moratorium on the strikes to give the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation an opportunity to \"cleanse\" the local strikes of central issues. It does not permanently prohibit local strikes, whereas the back-to-work legislation prohibits strikes in those boards for the rest of the school year.\n\nLabour board chair Bernard Fishbein sided with the school boards in concluding the three local strikes were, at least in part, on the central issue of class sizes. There was no \"smoking gun,\" he wrote, but from the evidence he heard class size was \"certainly\" an issue on the picket line.\n\nIt would not have been enough for a \"scintilla or a whiff of evidence\" that the strike was about central issues, nor would a single picket sign about class sizes \"fatally contaminate an otherwise proper, lawful, local strike,\" Fishbein wrote, saying this kind of decision will have to be on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThis is the first round of negotiations to formally separate local and central bargaining under legislation the Liberal government brought in last year.\n\nLawyers for the three school boards argued that although the law doesn't explicitly ban teachers from staging local strikes on provincial issues, that's what it was meant to do, and Fishbein agreed.\n\n\"If the (act) and its two-tier bargaining is to have any meaning, the parties must respect the central/local split (particularly when they themselves have agreed to it), and take some responsibility to ensure that the (act) is complied with,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I do not believe it too onerous a burden on trade unions that choose to engage in local strikes while central bargaining is ongoing, to say they should be vigilant in ensuring their local strikes cannot be construed as being 'in respect of central bargaining.\"'\n\nFishbein took the opportunity to write in his decision that he heard little to no evidence of communication between the OSSTF and its members in the striking district about what the local issues are.\n\nPremier Kathleen Wynne said Tuesday that once this round of negotiations with teachers is over, she's open to making changes to the process.\n\n\"Right now we're in a difficult negotiation because we're operating in a net zero environment where there isn't new money for compensation and at the same time we are using this new process,\" she said Tuesday in Hamilton.\n\n\"If there are changes we need to make to the process once we're through this, then we can look at that.\"\n\nThe NDP called on Wynne to fire Sandals.\n\nProgressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown called the new negotiating system a \"two-tier disaster.\"\n\n\"It's not working,\" he said, suggesting it's difficult to have both central and local negotiations ongoing at the same time. \"I think it's flawed and frankly the government should go back to the drawing board.\"\n\nSandals said the concept of two-tier bargaining is fairly common.\n\n\"In most provinces there's one process to sort out the money with the province and there's another process to sort out local collective agreement language, so that's not an unusual situation,\" she said.",

  "latent_17496": "Media playback is not supported on this device Watch highlights of the German Grand Prix\n\nThree hours after the German Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton was playing chess with his trainer as he waited for his usual news conference with the British written media.\n\nEven if Hamilton admitted he was no good at the game - \"I've lost eight times out of nine games we've played,\" he said - it was a scene that belied the cliched, and false, image of the Mercedes driver as a sportsman who relies mainly on instinct and puts little thought into his racing.\n\nIt was also appropriate after a race that, for all its excitement and wheel-to-wheel battles, had elements of a chess match to it for the Briton.\n\nStarting 20th on the grid, following a brake failure in qualifying, he knew he had to make up places fast.\n\nThe plan - the requirement - was to get as close to the front as possible by the end of the race to limit the championship damage inflicted by team-mate Nico Rosberg - who, as Hamilton expected, took the almost inevitable win that results from a Mercedes driver starting on pole without the other alongside.\n\nYet at the same time Hamilton knew he could not afford to make a mistake. \"If I'd got caught in a collision with someone and lost points, that would have been really devastating,\" he said. \"But I stayed clear, just about.\"\n\nHamilton had to pick his moves carefully as he fought through the field - far from easy given the frenetic midfield action that characterised a race which was enthralling from start to finish, Rosberg's cruise at the front aside.\n\nLewis Hamilton had a couple of brushes, including this one with Kimi Raikkonen, as he fought his way up from 20th on the grid to finish third in the German Grand Prix\n\nInevitably, with the need to pass so many cars, there were a couple of heart-in-mouth moments for the former world champion.\n\nThe first came on lap 13, when he passed Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari and Daniel Ricciardo's Red Bull three abreast into the tight Turn Five hairpin.\n\nRaikkonen was pincered somewhat with Hamilton on his inside and Ricciardo his outside, and the Finn lost a part of his front wing against Hamilton's wheel, but there was no damage to the Mercedes.\n\nThe next incident almost certainly cost Hamilton second place. Homing in fast on Jenson Button's sixth-placed McLaren heading towards the same corner on lap 30, Hamilton was on the inside and closing, but too far back to attempt a pass.\n\nAs they approached the corner, however, Button ran wide and Hamilton thought his ex-team-mate was letting him through, as he had in a couple of previous races.\n\nHe wasn't. They collided, and Hamilton's front wing end-plate was damaged. \"My bad on judgement there,\" Hamilton said afterwards.\n\nThe incident tore off most of Hamilton's left front-wing end-plate, costing him a chunk of front downforce and probably something like 0.3 seconds a lap.\n\nInitially, Mercedes planned to stick to their pre-race strategy of two stops, but as the laps ticked by it became apparent that the aerodynamic loss was using up the tyres too quickly and they had to change tack.\n\nThat meant a three-stop strategy and two stints on the faster but more fragile super-soft tyres in the last 25 laps of the race.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Nico Rosberg reflects on his German Grand Prix win\n\nThe plan was for an 11-lap stint followed by a final one of 14, but then came Hamilton's next dose of bad luck in a season that has so far been littered with it.\n\nOn lap 49, Adrian Sutil spun his Sauber at the last corner and came to rest in the middle of the pit straight.\n\nIt was the sort of incident that usually triggers the safety car, and Mercedes had no choice but to bring Hamilton in on the next lap - not doing so would have been too big a risk if the safety car had come out.\n\nAs it turned out, though, it did not - a decision Hamilton criticised on safety grounds afterwards - and that left him needing to do 17 laps on a set of super-softs to the end of the race, and still needing to catch and pass both Fernando Alonso's Ferrari and Williams' Valtteri Bottas to claim second.\n\nAlonso was no problem, and after passing him Hamilton was seven seconds behind Bottas with 12 laps to go.\n\nHe had caught the Finn five laps later, but by then the best had already gone from the tyres, and to have any chance of second he had to make the move immediately, before they went completely.\n\nMercedes Formula 1 season so far Nico Rosberg Lewis Hamilton Australia - 1st Australia - Retired Malaysia - 2nd Malaysia - 1st Bahrain - 2nd Bahrain - 1st China - 2nd China - 1st Spain - 2nd Spain - 1st Monaco -1st Monaco - 2nd Canada - 2nd Canada - Retired Austria - 1st Austria - 2nd Britain - Retired Britain - 1st Germany - 1st Germany - 3rd\n\nBottas, though, used the low-drag Williams' strong traction and straight-line speed to coolly hold him off, and there was nothing Hamilton could do.\n\nIt had, nevertheless, been a strong drive, and yet at the end of it he had lost another 10 points in the championship to Rosberg, who is now 14 ahead with nine races remaining.\n\nAfter moving to within four points following his victory and Rosberg's retirement at Silverstone two weeks ago, it was another blow for Hamilton in a season in which he has taken plenty so far.\n\nAnd so, for the third time in 10 races, he is faced with the need to recover points on his team-mate through no fault of his own.\n\n\"I'm happy about fighting hard,\" Hamilton said. \"I'd never want to have it easy. I love the challenge I'm having but it's difficult, I have to say.\"\n\nHis natural speed looked like it might well have resulted in pole and a win in Germany, had it not been for his brake failure midway through the first qualifying session.\n\nHe and Rosberg had been as closely matched as ever through practice, but Hamilton was flying in the few laps he had in qualifying before his crash, while Rosberg was struggling with his brakes.\n\n\"I put on new brakes for qualifying and there was something not right with them the whole of qualifying,\" the German said. \"It was difficult for me to get into it and I didn't feel comfortable all the way through.\"\n\nEven now, with two retirements to Rosberg's one and the brake failure for Hamilton in German qualifying, Hamilton has won five races this season to Rosberg's four.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Formula 1: Murray Walker on the rivalry between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg\n\nThat, along with Hamilton's slight advantage in natural speed, will be some comfort to him. But he will still need the cool head of a chess grand master to cope with these continuing disappointments, something he is doing well so far.\n\nWith the teams arriving in Hungary on Thursday, Hamilton will not have long to wait to try to claw back some of those points, and he could not be going to a better place to do it.\n\nHamilton has won at the Hungaroring four times in seven years and for the last two seasons - and last year he out-qualified Rosberg there by three places and 0.332 seconds. It has almost become his race.\n\n\"I don't really have any secrets there,\" Hamilton said, \"but if I've ever been fortunate it's been at that race.\n\n\"I have great support from the fans and it's a circuit I've really enjoyed.\n\n\"It's a circuit where you can attack so it suits an attacking driver like myself and maybe it suits me more than some others.\"\n\nHe will head there hoping that fortune does not play its tricks on him again and that the battle between the two Mercedes drivers comes down simply to man against man.\n\nFull race results\n\nHungarian Grand Prix coverage details",
  "latent_17546": "Image via Twitter\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE Canada.\n\nCara Louise Ellis was murdered by Canadian serial killer Robert Pickton after her disappearance on January 21, 1997. One of the last places she was seen, the corner of Georgia and Granville right in the middle of downtown Vancouver, is also the location of a bronze plaque meant to honor her—one of 62 markers intended to memorialize Pickton's victims, a project dubbed the \"Living Memorial Stones.\"\n\nDespite paying tribute to one of the victims of Canada's most infamous serial killer, barely anyone notices the memorial; the four-by-four inch bronze square embedded into the ground blends into the exposed concrete sidewalk and hides neatly beneath the shadow of a garbage can. It's almost always covered by the stains of spilled coffee or beer, stepped on by commuters rushing to the bus stop a few feet past it.\n\nToday, Ellis's plaque is the only one left; three others were removed less than a year after their installation in 2013, while the 58 others never went much farther than the workshop where they were made. Though the stones have mostly disappeared from memory, the man behind them has not. The project was conceived by Sean Kirkham, a man who received several thousand dollars in grant money for the memorial but never compensated the people involved.\n\nTo many who knew him, Kirkham was a lifelong scam artist, willing to take advantage of anyone unfortunate enough to cross his path. Even though he often challenged that opinion publicly—usually by suing you—the sheer number of people who say they were ruined by him is staggering. Lori Ann Ellis was one of the last people he disappointed; she was promised $500 for travel to see her murdered relative's plaque installed. Kirkham didn't pay up.\n\nDepending which way you look at it, the memorial stones project was either a final con marking the end of a long career as a sociopathic scammer or an attempt to do the right thing gone totally wrong. The scandal was arguably the quietest chapter of a life story involving New York celebrities, coke dealing stings, a gay porn star working at the UN, a one-eyed club impresario, the FBI, murder, and, eventually, suicide. In January 2016, on a day he was expected to appear in court, Kirkham was found dead in his apartment.\n\n\"Most of us who were most affected by him had a really hard time believing he committed suicide,\" memorial collaborator Francis Brady told VICE, using a pseudonym since, even after his death, he's wary about speaking publicly of Kirkham. \"It was like: 'Show us a body,' right? I mean, faking his own death—that was completely consistent with the type of shit that Kirkham would have done. Finally, when the CBC reported it, I believed it. That was the first time, hearing of his suicide, that I ever, ever witnessed the slightest amount of conscience on his part.\"\n\nTo understand why a man would take from the families of murdered indigenous women, it's worth looking at the many victims who came before. His first was Peter Gatien.\n\n***\n\nKirkham spent much of his early life with his mother in Hay River, Canada, before moving to Montreal with an adopted family. At 16, he ran away from home when his surrogate parents found out he was gay. He moved to New York City in 1990, where he lived on the streets.\n\nAt first, he was able to survive only through a combination of hustling in Times Square and scrounging off strangers. Then he was hired as a busboy at the Gatien-owned Club USA. The nightclub had a reputation for drugs and sketchy dealings. Kirkham fit into the scene perfectly: Almost immediately after starting there, he and a bouncer robbed a drug dealer by pretending to be security and confiscated everything he had. The bouncer kept the coke, while Kirkham kept the money. It was a pattern that would play itself out many times in his future; Kirkham was particularly good at portraying himself as someone who knew what he was doing in order to get people to give him their stuff.\n\nThe Limelight, New York. Photo via Wikimedia Commons\n\nAt Club USA, Kirkham also developed a tendency to blame the bad things that happened to him on his own effort to do the right thing. He claimed he was fired from Gatien's club after trying, unsuccessfully, to report that club employees were paying off the fire department to ignore fire code violations. Like most of his allegations, there was zero proof. He was tossed out, but not before meeting Peter Gatien and Michael Alig, two names he would find himself tied to for the rest of his life.\n\nIt was also because he was fired from Club USA that Kirkham decided to move to Miami, where one of the most unlikely and, frankly, insane decisions in the history of law enforcement was made.\n\nSean Kirkham was hired by the FBI.\n\nIt's not clear why or how Kirkham managed to convince FBI handlers to trust him as an informant, but it was probably due to his ability to pose as a high-roller, and—from his very inconsequential stint in the club scene of New York—get into the parties thrown by the nightlife elite, where high-level criminals also tended to go. And he ended up being pretty good at the job.\n\n\"Unfailingly polite, he easily penetrated the trendiest clubs, where he spent many a night getting bombed on champagne, courtesy of the authorities.\" That's how Frank Owen described him in his book on Gatien published in 2003, Clubland: The Fabulous Rise and Murderous Fall of Club Culture. Owen met Kirkham and Peter Gatien's lawyer, and was the one who really cemented some of the earlier details of Kirkham's life through his interviews with him.\n\nThat said, even though he used Kirkham as a source, Owen said that he never entirely trusted everything Kirkham told him.\n\n\"The guy lied constantly about everything. I mean, literally everything. He was really pathological about it, really sociopathic about it. I liked Sean because he was really charming, but, you know, he was not a good person. I'm sorry to say that, but he was just not a good person. He just did really bad things to people.\"\n\nOwen's book details how a few Club Kid drug dealers, including Kirkham, managed to take down the most popular club in New York in the early to mid 90s—the Limelight—where Andy Warhol used to host parties, and stars like Smashing Pumpkins, Funkmaster Flex, Mary J. Blige, Jay-Z, and Sean \"Puffy\" Combs came to party. Drugs were everywhere, and that made the owner, eye-patch wearing Canadian Peter Gatien, the perfect scapegoat for the newly elected mayor, Rudy Giuliani's, \"tough on crime\" routine. Giuliani wanted to get rid of illicit drug use in New York nightclubs (or at least look like it), and Gatien's club was the perfect place to start. All he needed was proof of drug deals going down inside the club, regardless of whether Gatien or his staff were involved.\n\nThere were three main informants, all working for the DEA. The first, \"Lord Michael\" Caruso, a rave pioneer and employee of Gatien, dropped out as a star witness when he was arrested mid-trial for drug dealing. He later resurfaced as manager of the Wu-Tang Clan, until they found out he was a snitch—one who also testified against former Cosa Nostra associate Chris Paciello—and fired him. The next was Michael Alig, the world famous Club Kids leader who, also during Gatien's trial, was arrested himself for the drug-fueled murder and dismemberment of Angel Melendez over an unpaid debt. That inspired the movie Party Monster. In it, Alig was played by Macaulay Culkin.\n\nThe last was Sean Kirkham.\n\n\"I'd been an informant for almost six years at that point in my life. I'd worked with countless agencies. I'd worked with hundreds of agents. Without question it's physically impossible to prevent people like me from closing down your place of business. All it takes is a simple call to a drug dealer to come to your place of occupation, I'd have to make a drug purchase, and under the Nuisance Abatement laws, your business will be closed.\"\n\nThat's how Kirkham described his role in Gatien's arrest, from the documentary Limelight. The interview is interspersed with a bizarre segment where he compares his own actions in bringing down the club with the actions of Nazis during World War II (\"If you go back to the times of the 1940s when the Nazis were on trial in Nuremberg, they said they were doing a job; that's much how I felt. I was doing a job. I was getting paid for it\").\n\nHe goes on to describe his recruitment as an informant for the FBI in Miami from 1994, saying he had become pretty useful to them during this time, using the knowledge he gained from Club USA both to capture drug dealers and benefit from them. He explains how he would take favors from one and in return rat out others, and often committed his own crimes on the side. In one instance when still working in Miami, he managed to steal Madonna's home phone number from a director's address book, showed it off to fellow club-goers and friends, then sold the entire book to promoters who used it to call celebrities like Bianca Jagger and Liam Neeson, and invite them to their parties. He was a master manipulator and knew how to take advantage of people. It was a skill he would take with him when he moved back to New York in December 1995.\n\nNo one had to entice Kirkham to go after Gatien; soon after he got back, he learned about the investigations and offered up his services to the DEA.\n\nWhat happened next is a \"scam\" in different ways. Through working with the DEA, Kirkham became a huge part of the case against Gatien's Limelight club, and soon ended up as the last star witness left against him. All of his co-witnesses had been arrested for their own crimes outside of the case, something which Kirkham wasn't innocent of; his own handlers had noted his unsanctioned drug deals. Instead of sticking around to see whether he'd be charged too, though, Kirkham wanted out. He started recording meetings with his handlers on tape, and then contacted Gatien's legal team, offering to sell them confidential details of the case to make some money before he fled the country—betting that his Canadian passport would allow him to get out and stay out relatively easily.\n\nIt was a crazy idea, and one that came completely out of left field. There was no benefit, nothing besides notoriety. In Frank Owen's opinion, though, it perfectly described everything about Sean Kirkham. Years later, Owen interviewed Kirkham in 2009 for an article on Craigslist scams. Kirkham had been running them all over Europe, renting apartments he didn't own or live into unlucky tourists. It was so successful, he eventually spread the scam to North America, offering fake apartments to New Yorkers without ever leaving his new home. In the article, Owen introduced him as \"Sean Church,\" a flimsy, half pseudonym that Kirkham came up with himself. Even though he wanted to use his real name, the rest of his background is offered simply as \"international drifter, one-time DEA informant, former jailbird, consummate con man.\" In the end, Owen was the one fighting to keep Kirkham's identity under wraps.\n\n\"I remember talking to him about it, saying, 'Look, Sean, we should just make this completely off the record—we just want to mention a name,'\" Owen said, recalling the interview. \"And he was like, 'No, no, I want people to know.' But I said, 'If they know your real name, you're going to get busted, you don't need that.' That's typically Sean; he wants to be famous… but you can't be a famous snitch! The whole point of being a snitch is that you're undercover. It's not a good idea to be a famous snitch, especially if you're committing crimes on the side.\"\n\nKirkham couldn't help himself. Not only the money drew him in, but so did the action-packed lifestyle. He wanted to be a snitch for the feds; then he wanted to party with celebrities and criminals. Then, he saw a way to get involved in a high-profile criminal case, and when that didn't seem to be working out, Kirkham thought he found a way to switch sides.\n\nBut attempting to turn the tables and double-cross the prosecution backfired entirely. Knowing Kirkham's offer was completely illegal, Gatien's lawyers immediately contacted the prosecution, who set up a sting for Kirkham. They told him Gatien did want to buy the tapes, but would only \"meet\" through a proxy; Kirkham agreed, bringing the tape with him.\n\nNot long after, Kirkham was in handcuffs. The proxy was a federal agent and Kirkham was caught, but he didn't stop there. Instead, he made accusations that led one of the stranger court documents you can find online. Insisting that he was a male escort, Kirkham alleged that one of the prosecutors was his client and had had a sexual relationship with him. This was, it turned out, just about the worst move possible, as the prosecutor immediately charged him with lying to a federal agent.\n\nAfter being found guilty, he fled to Vancouver, was rearrested, and spent 57 months in prison, because his statements \"had undermined the credibility of government employees, negatively affected the careers of the DEA agents, and had caused the prosecutor professional and personal embarrassment.\" Except for a subpoenaed Limelight manager who refused on moral grounds to give testimony—he was the only person involved in the massive Limelight case to actually be convicted of anything and serve time.\n\nEveryone thought Kirkham made up the affair, including Owen. \"I know, from subsequent testimony at Kirkham's trial, that the prosecutor was totally freaked out by this,\" he said. \"It really put them off their game.\" Still, it was an unwinnable accusation and a totally stupid thing to do. Even if he was telling the truth, no one would believe him over the prosecutor, who fought hard to disprove it.\n\nYears later, Owen says Kirkham finally admitted he lied about the whole thing. \"He'd been telling me for years that he did indeed have this affair with this guy—he gave me all of these details, like the size of his penis, marks on his body, and all of this bullshit. Then he flat out says, 'Well, yeah, of course I lied.' That's Sean—I mean, there was something really, really broken about him.\"\n\nRelated video: How to Get Away with Stealing\n\nWhen Kirkham was released from prison, he left America for good. It's no coincidence that the name Sean Kirkham was soon reported all over travel websites for operating rental scams in Hungary, Paris, and the Czech Republic. Here was the mysterious \"Sean Church,\" this time using his real name as he advertised apartments he didn't own, enticing young foreigners to buy or rent them, only to disappear, leaving them—at least temporarily—homeless. It was a lucrative scam, one he could have survived on for quite a while.\n\nAnd then he met the porn star.\n\nDror Barak, a.k.a. Roman Ragazzi, was good-looking, muscular, and well liked by those around him. However, he was hiding a significant part of his life: While making gay porn videos to be distributed worldwide, Barak was also working as an aid in the United Nations' Israeli consulate. No one needed to know, and it's possible they wouldn't have until he decided to quit work at the consulate, until Barak was outed by an anonymous source in a Page Six exposé.\n\nThree weeks later, Barak's agent contacted a reporter for a queer online magazine promising to reveal \"the whole truth about the Roman Ragazzi story,\" claiming Kirkham leaked the story to Page Six. But this version of \"Sean Michael Kirkham\" said he was the son of Baron Graham Kirkham, founder of a multimillion dollar furniture empire. There are even sites still online—put up by someone that wanted people to believe this—that list Sean Michael Kirkham as Graham Kirkham's son, with one even saying that Kirkham Sr. is a resident of Vancouver with \"one adopted son; Sean Michael Kirkham residing in Whistler, Canada.\" A representative for the family said they have no child by that name.\n\nThe reporter was able to access emails between Kirkham and Barak before Barak was outed, and it looks pretty clear from all sides what ended up happening. Kirkham, finding Barak's contact information online, tried to hire Barak to do a modeling gig for his company, \"The World's My Playground LLC.\" Kirkham represented it as a \"boutique diamond brokerage firm that also specializes in special events,\" currently organizing two events in Budapest.\n\nThe company didn't, and doesn't, exist, but that didn't stop Barak from biting. After a few more back-and-forth emails, Barak revealed his current job at the UN. Afterward, Kirkham asked if Barak would be open to doing some \"escort\" work, to which Barak declined. The back-and-forth went on until the porn star's agent discovered it. He was, of course, upset that his client was negotiating without him, but became much more upset when he did even the most casual Google search of Kirkham. Barak terminated all contact with Kirkham, knowing from the stories online what he was capable of doing.\n\nUnfortunately, it was already too late. The story broke, Barak was fired, and ended up receiving taunting messages, messages many suspected were, unsurprisingly, coming from Kirkham. Kirkham, for his part, alleged it was Barak's agent that paid for the Page Six tip, to boost his client's media profile.\n\nTheir back and forth continues even into the comment section of the article, which so often happens with Kirkham. After Kirkham makes wild claims against the porn star's agent, Kirkham ends it with this comment, dated March 20, 2008, over a year after the article's publish date: \"Collin you're a dumb fuck. Come and get me. Waste your ho bills made from the Romans ass and fly to Budapest if thats where you think I am. I cant wait to meet you in person. you'll never leave the room alive.\"\n\nThis is a far cry from the way he presented himself in Vancouver following CBC's report, saying he was being \"painted in an unfair light.\" Again, his collaborator Francis Brady said that he didn't see it that way. \"I told him I read that [Dror Barak] article… you know what he told me? He looked at me in the eyes, and he said, 'That Israeli guy, he killed himself because of me.' And he started laughing.\"\n\nDror Barak did end up killing himself a number of years later, though it's impossible to say exactly why.\n\nWhat it is possible to say is it's another one of the bizarre and often sad situations Sean Kirkham left in his wake. Some are funny, small, or just strange, like insisting he appeared in both the movie Paris Is Burning, and the episode \"Boy Interrupted\" of Sex and the City, or leaving a Jacqui Cohen auction with tickets to Belize paid for with bogus checks and actually going on the trip before they noticed.\n\nBut then there are the darker, more serious events, like the Peter Gatien trial, Dror Barak's suicide, and the trauma felt by Cara Ellis's family. Then there's the nearly uncountable smaller cons he orchestrated against the people he was close to. Details of many of these scams can easily be found online—it's like the internet is a graveyard of the things Kirkham has done.\n\n\"His contention was, 'It's in my past, and it's all in the public, and I haven't changed my name, so I'm obviously a changed man, or else I would have tried to change my name,'\" Brady said on how so many of these stories and comments and blog posts are still floating around, connected by his name. \"Which to us was always so strange, because why did he never change his name? Who would use that fucking name? It's, like, the worst name on the internet.\"\n\nPlaque for Cara Louise Ellis. Photo courtesy of author\n\nIt may just be that Kirkham wanted to be remembered of that he wanted to be thought of without bothering to care how people thought of him. He'd often tell people inflated lies about his accomplishments, that he was the son of a multimillionaire, that he owned a successful diamond company, that he partied with celebrities, in the same breath he talked about going to prison in a high-profile case. He wanted to be notorious.\n\n\"He'd screw you, and then sue you,\" Brady said of Kirkham's tendency to bring legal suits to anyone that challenged him. \"If you called him out, he'd do anything to absolutely destroy your character.\"\n\nWhich is pretty much what he did to the city of Vancouver, to Cara Ellis, and the 61 other women and their families with torn-up or unplaced plaques. After councilor Kerry Jang even suggested that the city couldn't trust Kirkham to finish the project, he sued the city of Vancouver—specifically calling out Jang for defamation of character—but they were right.\n\nHe was just doing what he always did, manipulating people so he could be seen, only this time, it was the families of murdered Indigenous women instead of a club baron or a porn star. It's no wonder he was so hated, so incapable of redemption. Nearly everyone he came into contact with has regretted it, been manipulated, lost their livelihood, or their life. That is, except for one: Michael Alig.\n\nAfter being found guilty for the death of his roommate, Alig served 17 years in prison for manslaughter, regaining his freedom in March 2014. During that time, Kirkham would send him letters, and he'd send them often. Alig told VICE that Kirkham apologized in his letters because he apparently felt it was partly his fault that Alig went to prison. He felt guilty.\n\n\"He wrote me apology letters, apologizing for starting the whole thing, and just saying he wanted to hang out.\"\n\nAnd that, in Alig's opinion, was the nature of Kirkham. He was duplicitous, he was a liar, but he wasn't evil; he was screwed up from a childhood defined by abandonment. He felt real guilt over hurting people, and Alig did forgive him. \"I don't think he was doing it to hurt people,\" he said.\n\nMaybe at the end, it was that bit of guilt Alig saw that made Kirkham set up the memorial. Maybe he didn't want to be remembered as a bad guy, and wanted to finally leave something good connected to his name before he was gone.\n\nBut Kirkham ultimately couldn't escape his scamming reputation. Stories of his past still swirl around the internet, and the plaque at Georgia and Granville only reminds us that he ripped off the families of murder victims. To Owen, it's proof Kirkham could never change. \"People think of sociopaths, they think they're evil people, but Sean wasn't evil, he just really could not help himself,\" he said. \"Ultimately, who did he hurt? For all his victims, he hurt himself more than he hurt his victims.\"\n\nFollow Jackson Weaver on Twitter.",
  "latent_17691": "The Packers reached out to representatives for Steven Jackson, according to an NFL source, but it doesn't appear they are close to signing him. Credit: Associated Press\n\nBy of the\n\nBefore the Green Bay Packers can make a commitment to signing free agent running back Steven Jackson, they have to make sure they're getting him at the lowest price possible.\n\nIf they didn't, it would fly in the face of general manager Ted Thompson's approach to free agency.\n\nThe Packers made contact with the representatives of Jackson to express interest in the former St. Louis Ram, according to an NFL source, but it doesn't appear they are close to signing him. In fact, they may be engaging in a bit of gamesmanship in an attempt to get the best deal.\n\nThe Packers seem to be taking their usual low-key approach, refusing to be used as leverage for a bigger deal Jackson might get from Atlanta, which may be the big running back's preference. Without two teams bidding against one another, however, the price isn't going to rise to a level Jackson's representatives are seeking.\n\nUnwilling to bid, the Packers made a curious move Tuesday when, according to ESPN.com, they made arrangements for free agent running back Peyton Hillis to visit. The Packers definitely have a price they're willing to pay, and the Hillis visit might have been arranged to send a message to the Jackson camp that they'll just move on if Jackson won't take their offer.\n\nThe Packers have liked Jackson for a long time, and he would fit the type of physical back coach Mike McCarthy wants to use next year. But Thompson rarely gets involved in a bidding war unless it's with one of his own.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 250-pound Hillis may be someone the Packers have had their eye on as a power option in the running game, but it probably isn't coincidence that they arranged for him to visit right away.\n\nThere certainly is no hurry for a guy who carried 85 times for 309 yards and a touchdown last season in Kansas City.\n\nHillis was a 1,000-yard rusher in 2010, but he fell off the next two years primarily because of injury and hasn't done much since. Hillis started out his NFL career as a fullback but has played mostly as a lead back since.\n\nHe could be a lower-priced option for fullback than John Kuhn, who doubles as a running back and fullback. Kuhn is schedule to make $2.35 million this year.\n\nThe 6-2, 240-pound Jackson, who turns 30 in July, has rushed for 1,000 yards in eight consecutive seasons, including 1,042 last season. He's also an outstanding receiver, averaging 45 catches a season in his nine years with the Rams.\n\nNo deal: Free agent defensive end Chris Canty, who made a visit to the Packers' facilities last week, signed with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nCanty's agent never heard back from the Packers about an offer and decided to have Canty make a visit to the Ravens. Baltimore did not let him go home, signing him to what multiple reports said was a deal worth $8 million over three years, approximately the same amount free agent end Cullen Jenkins signed for with the New York Giants.\n\nAccording to an NFL source, the Packers never made an offer because they had concerns about Canty's knee and didn't think he would pass a physical. Canty's knee checked out OK with Baltimore, Tennessee and Kansas City, but the Packers decided to pass.\n\nRisky proposition: The Packers decided to roll the dice with tight end Tom Crabtree and let him hit the free agent market.\n\nCrabtree was not extended a restricted free agent offer, thereby making him an unrestricted free agent. The lowest tender offer the Packers could extend was for one year, $1.323 million, which would have given them the right to match any offer.\n\nInstead of making that commitment, the Packers will make an attempt to re-sign Crabtree at a lower number than $1.323 million, but it's very possible he will get a better offer than what the Packers put on the table.\n\nThe Packers did tender restricted free agent cornerback Sam Shields, using the second-round tender worth $2.023 million. That tender sets the compensation at a second-round pick if the Packers choose not to match an offer to Shields.\n\nThe decision to let Crabtree go probably doesn't affect the decision on what to do with tight end Jermichael Finley. From a salary cap standpoint, they're only saving $700,000. Then again, with center Evan Dietrich-Smith getting only the low tender and Crabtree nothing at all, the Packers saved $1.4 million in cap money.\n\nBeyond Finley, the Packers have Andrew Quarless, D.J. Williams, Ryan Taylor and Brandon Bostick. Only Quarless comes close to being the blocker Crabtree is. Quarless missed all of last season because of major knee surgery in 2011, but he is expected to be ready for 2013.\n\nThe Packers like Bostick a lot, but he is more of a receiver-type like Williams. Taylor is an effort player who needs to continue working on his blocking technique.\n\nThe Packers also didn't tender linebackers Robert Francois and Frank Zombo, making them free agents as well. The Packers will likely try to re-sign Francois, but it's unclear if they have interest in Zombo.\n\nJolly takes pay cut: The Packers reached an agreement to reduce the salary of defensive end Johnny Jolly from $2.521 million to $715,000, saving them approximately $1.8 million of cap space.\n\nJolly had received the first-round restricted free agent tender of $2.521 million before he was suspended for violating the substance abuse program in 2010. When he was reinstated, his salary went back on the books and he agreed to sign a minimum deal with a split option that cuts the compensation in half if he winds up on injured reserve.\n\nGiven his history, the Packers weren't going to pay a lot of money to give Jolly another shot, but they have set things up that he could return. By maintaining their rights to him, they now have more time to talk to him and work him out before deciding whether to keep him on the roster.\n\nRoom to maneuver: At the start of free agency, the Packers had almost $18 million in salary cap room, the second most of any team in the NFC North behind Minnesota.\n\nAccording to NFL Players Association data obtained by the Journal Sentinel, the Packers were $19,298,533 under the salary cap before submitting restricted free agent tenders to Shields ($2.023 million) and Dietrich-Smith ($1.323 million).\n\nThose two moves dropped their cap number to $15,952,533 heading into the start of free agency, but with Jolly's reduction that number increased to $17.75 million. About $5 million of that will be devoted to draft picks and another large portion is expected to be used to sign linebacker Clay Matthews and quarterback Aaron Rodgers to long-term extensions.\n\nHeading West: Safety Charles Woodson, released by the Packers in February, will make a free agent visit to San Francisco, his agent, Carl Poston said.\n\nWoodson has received interest from six teams and more visits could be forthcoming, Poston said.\n\nJournal Sentinel writer Tyler Dunne contributed to this story.",
  "latent_17848": "For the first time, researchers have demonstrated what Albert Einstein called \"spooky action at a distance\" using a single particle. And not only is it a huge deal for our understanding of quantum mechanics, it also proves that the physics genius got something wrong.\n\nSpooky action at a distance, or quantum entanglement, in a single particle is a strange form of entanglement that could greatly help to improve quantum computing and communications. Unlike regular quantum entanglement, which involves two particles being defined only by being opposites of each other, single particles that are entangled have a wave function that's spread over huge distances, but are never actually in more than one place.\n\nAs Lucy Ingham explains over at Factor Tech: \"In other words, a single entangled particle can only be in one place at a given time, but it can be located over a very large distance. When the particle is measured, the wave function will instantly collapse to a set location.\"\n\nBut no one had ever managed to see this in action. Now, using homodyne detectors, which measure wave-like properties, a team of researchers from Griffith University's Centre for Quantum Dynamics in Australia and the University of Tokyo in Japan has successfully demonstrated the non-local collapse of a particle's wave function.\n\nPublishing in Nature Communications, the team describe how they managed to split a single photon between their labs in Australia and Japan. They then showed that their choice of measurement in one laboratory really did cause a change in the local quantum state in the other lab - proving Einstein wrong almost 90 years after he first declared that single-particle entanglement was evidence that quantum mechanics didn't work.\n\n\"Einstein never accepted orthodox quantum mechanics and the original basis of his contention was this single-particle argument,\" one of the researchers, Howard Wiseman from Griffith University, explained in a press release. \"This is why it is important to demonstrate non-local wave function collapse with a single particle.\"\n\nInstead Einstein thought the fact a particle could only be detected at one point could be better explained by the hypothesis that the particle is only ever at one point. This seems to make more sense to a non-physics mind like me. But the new research now proves it's way more complicated than that.\n\n\"Rather than simply detecting the presence or absence of the particle, we used homodyne measurements enabling one party to make different measurements and the other, using quantum tomography, to test the effect of those choices,\" said Wiseman in the release.\n\n\"Through these different measurements, you see the wave function collapse in different ways, thus proving its existence and showing that Einstein was wrong.\"\n\nSource: Factor Tech",
  "latent_18024": "Bernie Sanders explicitly wants to start a political revolution in America. Judging from the crowd of 11,000 supporters in Phoenix on Saturday night, that has already taken place. Within a short period, Sanders has become the most electrifying presence on the 2016 campaign trail, attracting bigger crowds than any presidential candidate of either party. He has the grassroots army that he says is the critical component to progressive change. Now the question becomes what he will do with it, immediately, before any primary vote is cast.\n\nAfter some unfortunate tone-deafness dealing with a protest from #BlackLivesMatter activists at Netroots Nation – something the campaign is already working to correct – Sanders rallied audiences in Phoenix, Houston and Dallas over the weekend. At the Phoenix Convention Center, the notably young crowd has gotten to know the democratic socialist’s positions so well (probably from his applause lines being tweeted on the campaign Twitter feed) that they repeated them in real time, like lip-synching at a concert. He has captured the imagination of a segment of the population who feels ill-served by the narrowness of our politics.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAmong liberal millennials in their formative political years, Sanders offers truth-to-power rhetoric that speaks to the disappointments of the Obama years, on issues like Wall Street’s power, the takeover of government by the wealthy and the need for single-payer universal health care. Sanders’ path for sustaining real change is entirely based upon bottom-up organizing. “The key mistake of the Obama Administration,” Sanders said last year to Bloomberg, “was to more or less disband the grassroots network that he had put together to get elected.”\n\nNow Sanders has that grassroots network, or at least a critical mass of people willing to listen to him on the issues of the day. There is no more prominent voice on the American political left today, save for Elizabeth Warren. And Sanders is arguably more visible right now, with news-making rallies and a growing email list (the campaign won’t say how big).\n\nThis gives Sanders an opportunity to show exactly what can happen when politicians use their popularity as an organizing tool. Because there are winnable fights happening right now that could use his attention.\n\nFor example, the federal highway trust fund faces a deadline at the end of the month, with plenty of potential downsides. The House passed a five-month patch setting up a more permanent fix that pays for infrastructure with a misguided tax amnesty for large corporations that park earnings overseas, which has been pushed in recent weeks by Chuck Schumer. Senate Republicans, thinking they may get a better deal with a colleague in the White House, are scrambling to find money for a two-year patch, including making significant cuts to the federal employee retirement program.\n\nThe payment options for infrastructure are pretty awful, compared to simply putting a user fee on the roads that need fixing through a small increase in the gas tax. Liberal Democrats have the power to shape what happens next, and the first stage of the endgame is happening in a matter of days. So where is Sanders on that? What’s he telling his supporters to do about it?\n\nTied up with the highway bill are negotiations around the expired Export-Import Bank. Though most of the Democratic Party now supports Ex-Im, in the past Sanders has been staunchly against it as an example of corporate welfare and outsourcing, earning praise even from the likes of Ted Cruz. Congress will try to resurrect Ex-Im soon. If Sanders still believes it helps ship jobs overseas, is he prepared to ask his new followers to help him stop it?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSimilarly, within two months we will have a Congressional vote on the nuclear deal with Iran. Foreign policy items go completely unmentioned in Sanders’ speeches, but at his Senate website he called the deal “a victory for diplomacy over saber-rattling.” President Obama just needs one-third of either house of Congress to maintain the nuclear deal, again giving power to the liberal bloc. The votes will occur in September. Is Sanders prepared to organize around that?\n\nThere are more short-term issues up in the air, from the fight over the next appointment to the Securities and Exchange Commission to the inevitable battles over the government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which Sanders has already engaged on). What’s his strategy?\n\nThe model for organizing from inside the Senate comes from Elizabeth Warren, who uses her platform to push on short-term issues. She doesn’t always win, such as with the Citigroup-written derivatives loophole snuck into a federal spending bill last year. But she knows how to leverage her power and the citizens who believe in her message. She stopped Antonio Weiss from becoming the number three leader at the Treasury Department and has now apparently stopped Keir Gumbs, a lawyer who actually held seminars with corporations about how to evade taxes, from joining the SEC.\n\nWarren derives her success from picking winnable fights and forcing fellow Democrats to take her side, because of the promise of being aligned with the emergent Warren wing. She is respected on financial reform and issues affecting the working class, and when she speaks up, it matters and can change policy.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSanders has never had this platform for his issues before. But one email to his list (which he reportedly writes himself) or the mention of a particular topic on the stump could have significant organizing value. He has nationwide house parties coming up next week, over 1,500 of them, where he could spread a particular message, if he chooses. Tell Chuck Schumer not to give multinational corporations a bailout. Tell Democrats not to undermine diplomacy. Tell the President that prime regulatory seats should not be sold to Wall Street executives. And then he can supplement that with phone calls and protests. There’s an opportunity to operationalize his candidacy.\n\nMaking change is about more than giving a well-worn political speech. It’s about active engagement, challenging bad ideas pushed by powerful people and demanding something different. Sanders knows this: it’s the entire basis for his candidacy. But he could put it to work before anyone goes to a caucus in Iowa or a voting booth in New Hampshire. Things are happening right now that will impact millions of Americans. If Sanders is making the argument that he will be an organizer as President, he has to show that he can be one as a candidate, too.",
  "latent_18132": "Episode Title: My Name Is Oliver Queen\n\nOriginal Airdate: 05-13-15\n\nSeason 3 is in the books for ‘Arrow’ with the city saved and one surprising death.\n\nI was attempting to figure out why I felt a bit underwhelmed by the season finale and I think in large part I was tired of saying goodbye to Oliver Queen.\n\nPicking up from last week’s excellent cliffhanger, Team Arrow has been left to die — but Oliver had a plan: Malcolm inoculated everyone and Flash zoomed by to break them out of Ra’s al Ghul’s dungeon. Barry’s excitement over the dungeon and hot tub was a nice fun moment.\n\nI liked Oliver teaming with Nyssa for a change as they battled Ra’s men en route to rejoining Team Arrow, who’d already returned to Starling City. I don’t know how they’re getting back and forth so quickly from Nanda Parbat. While most of the team was willing to forgive him, I was glad Diggle still harbored resentment from Oliver’s deceptions. Then again, he was the only one to have their wife kidnapped.\n\nWe got a slight resolution to the Laurel/Quentin storyline as she learned he’s fallen off the wagon, but he thinks he’s able to control his drinking now. The writers have done an excellent job of portraying alcoholism like an addiction that requires a daily struggle especially for those in highly stressful situations.\n\nTeam Arrow raced through the city to stop Ra’s couriers from unleashing the Alpha Omega weapon and Diggle got a little help from Thea, now dressed in Roy’s costume marking Speedy’s first official costume appearance on ‘Arrow.’\n\nThe big final showdown between Ra’s and Oliver wasn’t as epic as their first encounter in part to both men wearing the same outfit making the fight harder to distinguish who had the upper hand. Oliver kills Ra’s fittingly reciting the same incantation Ra’s cited as he killed Oliver.\n\nOliver restates the continued them for the season. He couldn’t have handled Ra’s without Team Arrow’s help, which is why he’s leaving Starling City behind and going to start a new life … with Felicity.I kinda hated that as it just made Felicity such a weak character perfectly willing to forgive Oliver for everything he’d done this season to run away with him. It was like she was on standby all season just for this moment.\n\nOliver made good on his promise to Malcolm in exchange for his assistance and now Malcolm is the leader of the League of Assassins. Looking back on all his machinations this season, Malcolm clearly comes off like the man with the best long-term strategy. Nyssa vows revenge, but for now, she bows before Malcolm, the new Ra’s al Ghul.\n\nRay is tinkering with his suit and theorizes delving into miniaturization could lead to some exciting possibilities, but an explosion wipes out the entire top floor of his building. Don’t worry. Ray is only leaving to team up with Hawkgirl, Rip Hunter, Prof. Stein and Captain Cold and Heat Wave.\n\nAs for Oliver and Felicity, they’re heading down the coast smiling and happy only to have it ruined just in time for Season 4. How crazy is it that Oliver’s storyline was the weakest of the season? Hopefully the writers will commit to Oliver and Felicity as it’s time to advance their relationship or end it for good. All in all, Season 3 was good, not to the excellent standard of Season 2, but let’s hope next season will concentrate less on the romance and flashbacks and more on Arrow’s place in this new world of heroes.\n\nWhat’d you think of Season 3?",
  "latent_18210": "Europe asks Cuba to pick a new government for Venezuela\n\nIt's pretty obvious that the Monroe Doctrine was put there for a reason once Europe's ham-fisted shenanigans in Venezuela come to light. The European Union is asking communist Cuba, Venezuela's ally and mentor, to mediate a transition in Venezuela from the collapsing Maduro dictatorship to, oh, whomever Cuba chooses to serve its interests, apparently. Cuba's going to be the good guy here and persuade Nicolás Maduro to pack his bags and head for Varadero Beach or the private islands of Cuba's Communist Party elite.\n\nNot kidding, here's the Financial Times report, describing the logic: \"At some point the Maduro government will collapse. The questions are when and under what circumstances – a negotiated exit, an internal coup, or default and chaos,\" said a European diplomat close to conversations with Venezuela and Cuba. \"The idea of Maduro seeking exile in Cuba has been discussed, although not yet. But the Cubans will eventually play a critical role.\" As if Cuba, which is Venezuela's effective owner and colonizer, were not at the root of Venezuela's disastrous, Cuba-like conditions in the first place and could actually be an honest broker. As if Cuba didn't have a plain-as-the-nose-on-your-face conflict of interest, given its dependency on subsidized Venezuelan oil and its current role running the place – the power, the electricity, the farms, the passport bureau, the military, and more. Seriously, who thinks Cuba could honestly broker a transition to a democratic government in Venezuela, which is the only thing that will satisfy Venezuela's oppressed people? Cuba is not in the democratic transition business and has never ushered in a democratic government anywhere, starting with its own regime. Cuba is in the Antifa-style revolution business and has wrought havoc on three continents for that history of butchery and barbarism. It's the root of Antifa's violent \"turba\"-style tactics to enact \"change.\" Now it's going to pick a new government for Venezuela? More likely, it will lead Europe on a wild goose chase and use the opportunity to win concessions from Europe, perhaps making Europe, or worse yet, us, Cuba's new sugar daddy in exchange for a new Cuba-sponsored government in Venezuela. You can bet that Cuba will get something for itself out of this. It will also probably put a group of more ruthless communists than Maduro in Caracas, or else use the opportunity to colonize Venezuela even more intensely. You can bet that European bondholders and corporate interests will be protected as a priority, and American ones will be sacrificed. The E.U. diplomats are probably looking to Cuba as an honest broker because they believe the rubbish about Cuba acting as an \"honest broker\" in the recent FARC \"peace\" talks with Colombia, which produced a sweet deal for the armed wing of the Communist Party of Colombia at the expense of Colombia's people and which won Colombia's unpopular President Juan Manuel Santos a Nobel Peace Prize over the man who really brought peace to the country, former President Alvaro Uribe. That Havana-brokered one-sided accord was rejected a year ago by Colombia's angry voters in a shock referendum result, and the result was ignored by the Santos government. Since then, the peace with terrorists deal has fast shown signs of falling apart as the terrorists keep up their terrorism and violate the terms. This is the mentality of the European Union, which continues to view the shambles of raw socialism as a good thing and Cuba's horrid socialist regime as one not unlike their own. This raises questions as to why these guys are here at all. They are utterly unfit for negotiating a proper solution to the Venezuelan hellhole and are going to the wolf who ate the chickens for answers, naive as can be about the realities of the New World. The U.S. needs to sound the alarm about this odious scheme. Neither Europe nor Cuba has Venezuela's or America's best interests at heart here. They are just looking to a new opportunity to feather their nests, throw their weight around and let Venezuela take the awful result. Get them out of there.",
  "latent_18217": "With just a couple of week to go, 2017 is winding down, and sights are beginning to be set on the new year ahead. 2017 was an exciting year for Microsoft. With creators being at the forefront of Windows updates, Microsoft establishing itself in the laptop category with Surface Laptop, and desktop apps coming to the Microsoft Store on a much larger scale; It's been an incredibly busy year. But now it's time to look to the future and predict what 2018 will bring within the Microsoft realm. Microsoft software\n\nLet's start with Windows 10. I suspect that in 2018, Microsoft will focus a lot on being productive within Windows. We already know features like Timeline and Cloud Clipboard will help us be more productive across devices, and I suspect that trend will continue with features like Windows Sets. My first bold prediction is that Microsoft will call Redstone 4 the \"Windows 10 Productivity Update\" given the sudden focus on building features that keep us more productive. On the surface, I anticipate Microsoft will continue to clean-up the UI in Windows 10 throughout 2018. Fluent Design is already well in-effect with the latest Redstone 4 Insider Preview builds, and that trend will only continue throughout 2018. In fact, with Redstone 5, I predict Microsoft will start taking some bolder risks with design; removing older, legacy features and behaviors in favor of a more minimalist approach to certain things. For example, I wouldn't be surprised to see Microsoft redesign the System Tray, giving it a more minimal appearance and moving a lot of the excess stuff into a new Control Center area. This Control Center is something we've written about before, and according to our sources is now part of a much bigger effort. It'll include things like quick-actions, possibly tray icons, a volume slider, and even HomeHub functions that can be configured. I also suspect we'll see some big changes to the Start menu, including improved customization options.\n\nI predict that in 2018 we'll finally see Microsoft separate Cortana from the dedicated search function in Windows 10. Many users dislike how Cortana is integrated with search, and in 2018 I suspect Microsoft will finally do something about this. Microsoft will move Cortana into the Action Center, with quick access to a chat-based Cortana UI directly from the newly designed System Tray, leaving the dedicated search bar for search only. Speaking of Cortana, I suspect Microsoft will finally start focusing on the Windows-based AI assistant in 2018, building new smart-AI features and improvements, and possibly bringing it to new markets. It's been a while since Cortana received any significant updates, so we'll be well-overdue some kind of improvement in 2018. Of course, an obvious one to expect in 2018 is a brand new version of Office, as Microsoft has already announced that Office 2019 will be available in the second half of next year. I suspect Office 2019 will bring an updated design, likely featuring Fluent Design elements and connected animations for a more beautiful user-experience. That's assuming Microsoft can get Fluent Design working within Win32 programs in time.\n\nExisting Windows 10 Mobile handsets will continue to be left on the backburner, with even less support throughout 2018. We're already getting the cold shoulder from Microsoft officials when asked about future updates, and I don't expect this situation to improve in 2018. The platform will continue to fall further behind the rest of Windows 10, and eventually be left in the cold just like Windows RT. Regarding Windows Core OS and CShell, I suspect both of these will be ready in some capacity in 2018. I don't expect to see it on Windows desktop, but I'm relatively confident Windows Core OS and CShell will be ready in 2018 for Microsoft's rumored foldable dual-screened device. The foldable device will likely be Microsoft's first product to ship with a version of Windows 10 built with Windows Core OS and rocking CShell. Microsoft hardware\n\nSpeaking of Microsoft's foldable device, I continue to hear that this device is pegged for launch sometime in 2018. If so, I predict it'll be released in the second-half of 2018, likely towards the end of the year to give Microsoft as much time as possible to perfect the product before launch. The device will be portable, with two screens, pen support, and even telephony capabilities. Also in 2018, I anticipate we'll see a refreshed Surface Studio with updated specifications, and maybe even a SKU that's a little more affordable as to make the product more accessible to a wider audience. To many, the original Surface Studio was just too expensive, so hopefully, Microsoft will create a version that's more affordable in 2018. Also, and this is an obvious one; Microsoft will adopt USB-C in some capacity on all future Surface products. We may also see a new, more powerful Surface Dock in 2018 too. It's possible that we'll also see a new Surface Hub, running a brand new version of Windows 10, utilizing CShell and built with Windows Core OS. In fact, it may even have tie-ins with Microsoft's foldable device. Similarly, this project, like the foldable device, may find itself slipping in 2019, however. I don't expect we'll see any major updates to the Surface Pro, Surface Laptop or Surface Book in 2018, as those products were only just recently updated or announced. I also don't think we'll see any new non-pro Surface 4 device in 2018 either.",
  "latent_18231": "Think the Spanish Inquisition was harsh? Just as intimidating to many men were the French impotence courts of the 16th and 17th centuries, when husbands charged with erectile dysfunction were obliged to prove their virility before witnesses.\n\nA husband’s inability to perform was one of the few reasons that the Church would allow a marriage to be annulled, so disgruntled women who could afford the legal costs would regularly charge their husbands with “injurious non-consummation” before ecclesiastical courts. The legal tradition dated to the 1300s, when theologians agreed that the true aim of matrimony was procreation. Statistics are vague, but by the 1500s, says French historian Pierre Darmon in his detailed account Damning the Innocent, courts were faced with “a tidal wave of accusations.” The onus was placed on the husband to demonstrate his powers of erection before an expert team of priests, surgeons, and midwives. These learned observers would carefully examine his equipment to reach an opinion on its “elastic tension” and “natural motion,” before demanding “proof of ejaculation.” Many men found that their powers would fade on first examination. “Just looking at you makes me shrivel,” one humiliated husband moaned to his tormentors.\n\nAny man who failed this test had only one recourse to avoid becoming a laughing-stock. He could demand Trial by Congress, wherein he would carry out his conjugal duty before the team of experts as 100 percent proof that he could perform. As recounted by a string of contemporary accounts, this astonishing piece of legal pornography would take place in a neutral territory agreed upon by both parties. The married couple were examined by the court to make sure they were not concealing any devices — men were known to smuggle tiny vials of blood onto the scene, which would fool observers into thinking that the wife’s maidenhead had been taken without actual penetration — then ordered to the conjugal bed. The male surgeons and priests repaired behind a partition to enjoy discreet observation, while the female midwives perched by the pillows watching every move like hawks. With the husband and wife long estranged, the wrestling beneath the sheets was far from amiable: There was bickering and harsh words, with one wife crying that her husband had “put his finger theirin (to) dilate and open her by such means alone.” One critic of the trials noted that it would take only a “marvelous determined man and even brutish not to turn flaccid.” After one or two hours, the experts approached the battle scene with candles to establish whether or not there had been penetration and suitable “emissions.” One defeated husband, a certain Monsieur De Bray, although his member had been declared by the doctors “big, stiff, red and long … in place and in good order,” lost his case as he had only scattered “aqueous” seed upon the mattress.\n\nThe women who had the funds to start impotence trials were almost all from the aristocracy, so it is not surprising that each new charge provoked a salacious scandal that was disseminated by Parisian pamphleteers – the predecessors of the modern tabloid press – to a bemused wider audience. By the mid-17th century, a carnival atmosphere was attending the trials, as shown by the case of the handsome young nobleman René de Cordouan, the Marquis De Langey, recorded in detail by the contemporary chronicler of Parisian life, Tallemant des Réaux. Accused of impotence by his wife of four years in 1657, the Marquis appeared to have an open-and-shut case when the first examination suggested that his wife was not a virgin. But there was lingering doubt and innuendo, so the Marquis decided to restore his sullied reputation through Trial by Congress.\n\nIn Paris, bets were laid on the outcome of the trial and dirty songs composed. Society ladies flirted with the Marquis, with a certain Madame d’Olonne declaring openly, “I would so like to be condemned to Trial by Congress.” When the feuding couple appeared at the site, a luxurious bath house, servants had to force a path through the crowd of curiosity-seekers. The mob’s sympathy was squarely with the dashing De Langey, who was thought to have been falsely accused by a harridan. The wife was loudly booed while the Marquis strutted arrogantly before his admirers (“for all the world as if he were already in”). As he slipped beneath the sheets with his wife, De Langey jauntily yelled to the doctors: “Bring me two fresh eggs, that I may get her a son at the first shot.” But disaster struck. The Marquis was heard by the doctors to be grunting, cursing, and finally praying. After two hours De Langey gave up, crying, “I am ruined.”\n\nShock waves rippled through the crowd outside and the female admiration for De Langey turned to scorn. His request for a retrial was denied, and in France his name became a byword for flaccidity. The Marquis retired to the provinces, where he married again – and sired seven children. When De Langey boasted of this to a former enemy, the man archly replied: “But sir, nobody has ever had any doubts about your wife.” •",
  "latent_18250": "Kerry Morrison is a commissioner of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, an organization whose mission statement claims that their purpose is:\n\nTo support, create and sustain solutions to homelessness in Los Angeles County by providing leadership, advocacy, planning, and management of program funding.\n\nOne of these solutions, according to a newly obtained email from Morrison to LAPD Captains Cory Palka, bosom buddy of Hollywood white supremacists, and Peter Zarcone, is evidently to blast classical music at homeless people until they go away:\n\nHi Captains,\n\nThere is a big foyer in front of the Ricardo Montalban Theatre on Vine Street.\n\nFor quite some time, this have [sic] been a favorite sleeping place for homeless individuals in the BID.\n\nAbout a year ago, we encouraged Gil Smith to try an experiment (had heard about this from another BID): play classical music all night long and see if that would drive away the sleepers. Sure enough, it had an immediate impact and cleared them out.\n\nAs anyone with sense could have foretold, this didn’t end well. The people who actually live in the neighborhood, unlike Kerry Morrison and her alien army of occupation, the Hollywood Property Owners Alliance, couldn’t sleep either. They complained, and the music was shut down. But Kerry’s not giving up:\n\nI am going to try to run some interference on this with the property manager over there…because this is a fairly elegant solution…\n\nAnd what’s the property manager supposed to do here? It’s a violation of LAMC 116.01 to play music loudly enough to disturb sleeping people at night. The property manager can’t stop the residents from calling the cops. And why is Kerry Morrison, commissioner of LAHSA and zealous advocate for hyperenforcement of laws much, much more minor and picayune than this one as long as they’re to be enforced only against the homeless, conspiring with the Executive Producer of the Montalban to break the law by playing amplified music at night? Why is she conspiring to cover up these crimes by proposing to get the property manager of 1600 Vine Street to stop his tenants from reporting these violations to the police?\n\nConspiracy is a crime too, friends. In fact, it’s at 182 PC, which states in pertinent part:\n\n(a) If two or more persons conspire:\n\n(1) To commit any crime.\n\n(5) To commit any act injurious to the public health, to public morals, or to pervert or obstruct justice, or the due administration of the laws.\n\n…\n\nThey are punishable as follows:\n\n…by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170, or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.\n\nNotwithstanding the conspiracy to violate LAMC 116.01, obviously playing music in the middle of the night to wake people up, probably even the freaking homeless people count here, is “injurious to the public health.” Just because they’re trespassing doesn’t mean they give up their right not to have their health injured. Otherwise Kerry Morrison could be proposing to just, we don’t know, spray them with anthrax or something as a deterrent. She can’t do that, why should she be able to use musical torture to chase them off?\n\nRunning interference with the property manager, as Kerry Morrison proposes to do here, is “pervert[ing] or obstruct[ing] justice, or the due administration of the law” if the purpose is to get the residents not to call the cops when the law’s being violated or to allow her criminal conspiracy to continue unabated. Finally, right down the street from Ground Zero of the recorded music industry in Los Angeles Kerry Morrison is conspiring to give public performances of what are almost certainly copyrighted works. Has she paid the required royalties? Do Kerry’s buddies (and members of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce) at Capitol Records or their trade industry friends at the RIAA know about this plan? Because they’re famous for their overzealous enforcement of their rights.\n\nWhat kind of zillionaire privilege does it take to email the cops confessing your guilt to a whole litany of crimes like this? And what kind of deeply perverse interpretation of their duties must Palka and Zarcone have to read this spontaneous admission of guilt and do nothing about it? By the way, this is not the first time Kerry has publicly confessed to breaking the law. She remains unarrested, though, so we suppose she knows what she’s doing.\n\nAnd what’s next? Is LAHSA going to solve the homeless problem in Los Angeles County by herding homeless people to the San Bernardino County line using sound trucks playing Mozart? They’re already skating on thin ice with respect to the acceptability of their homeless-criminalizing bullshit tactics as far as their federal funding is concerned. How are they going to explain this one to HUD?\n\nAnd what’s up with using classical music? Obviously if the point is to chase away homeless people who are trying to sleep any noise will do. Well, it turns out that using classical music to deter social undesirables is some kind of weirdo Caucasian zillionaire cultural trope. Kerry Morrison is right in the cultural mainstream of her people. We have neither the time nor the stomach to analyze this smirking smugness in its larger context, but it did make us think we might head over to the Hollywood Property Owners Alliance and play a little repellent music of our own. Maybe we can repel the repellers with a taste of their own damned medicine. And would they call the cops on us? Certainly. Do we care? No. See you there, friends!",

People like Donald Trump, the leading republican Presidential nominee, describe Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers.

Right wing anti-immigration groups like the UKIP and the Greek neo-nazi party are popping up everywhere we look.\n\nAlmost every country in the world is divided on the topic of immigration and welcoming foreigners. And even in the faction that is welcoming of them, we often find a cold selfish political calculus in its heart. Business leaders who simply want cheap labor, and politicians trying to appeal to specific ethnic demographics.\n\nHence why it’s heartwarming to see something so completely contrary, like what’s happening in Germany. As a country, they have nothing tangible to gain from taking in tens of thousands of hungry, impoverished refugees. And yet, not only are they welcoming them, they are fighting for them. They are lobbying for them in the European Union. They are using their political capital to go up against the Eastern European bloc that is resisting their every move. They are confronting their own local xenophobes and budget-tightwads, in order to welcome asylum seekers and provide them with the basic services they need to get back on their feet.\n\nIt’s easy to fall into cynicism when looking at politics and foreign policy theater. After all, the reasons for cynicism are so prevalent. But every now and then, something like this comes along, and it is touching to see a country act, not out of political calculus, but simply out of respect for human dignity.\n\nA few months ago, during the Greek economic crisis, many were drawing unfair parallels between Germans and Nazi domination of Europe. Today, Germany has permanently laid to rest any such inflammatory accusations, and proven that when it comes to moral high ground, no other country in Europe has the right to lecture them. Kudos to you Germany. You have warmed the heart of even this cynic.",
  "latent_18258": "BOISE, Idaho— Western Watersheds Project applauds yesterday’s announcement from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife that the slickspot peppergrass (Lepidium pappilliferum) will remain protected as “Threatened” under the Endangered Species Act. Political meddling from the livestock industry and its friends in the state of Idaho kept this plant from being protected for over a decade.\n\nSlickspot peppergrass is a fascinating desert plant with tiny white flowers. It is endemic to a narrow band across southwestern Idaho where it occurs only in “slickspots” or wet areas in the desert. Only 100 occurrences of the plant are known. A primary land use on its public lands habitat is livestock grazing. Cattle naturally congregate in the wet spots, trampling the plants and its habitat. This trampling, combined with weed invasions and increased fires—both of which are worsened by cattle grazing—have left the plant in dire straits. As one scientist put it, the plant is “at a tipping point in terms of its prospect for survival.”\n\n“The slickspot peppergrass is a rare and sensitive species that merits the protections that only the ESA can provide,” said Ken Cole, Idaho Director of Western Watersheds Project. “We look forward to seeing meaningful protections, including limits on livestock grazing, that truly protect the limited landscapes where this plant occurs.”\n\nShowing that the livestock industry in Idaho still maintains an outsized hoofprint, the new rule fails to consider livestock grazing as a major threat to the species. The Service lists invasive species and wildfires as dominant causes for concern, failing to recognize that livestock grazing and its pervasive negative influence on arid ecosystems increases invasive species infestations and, in turn, fuels the unnatural fire cycles that harm Idaho’s high desert landscape. The Service also identified Owyhee harvester ants’ impact on the seedbank of the plant as an emerging threat in light of the habitat conversion from sagebrush to grasses which increases the ants distribution.\n\n“The land management agencies are going to have to come up with a better plan for keeping livestock off of grazing allotments in slickspot habitat or the plant is doomed,” said Cole. “It’s ironic that we can talk about the impact of ants to the species but not the effects of the sacred cow.”",
  "latent_18292": "In these polarizing times, it is to our credit that we can occasionally find those with whom we both agree and disagree. With that I give you Dr. Marty Nemko’s recent article in Psychology Today titled “The Problem With Boys,” and my commentary on it. It begins:\n\nfour to eight times as likely to be drugged with Ritalin and other stimulants, which pediatrician Leonard Sax, calls ‘academic steroids.’\n\nreading much more poorly than are other students.\n\nthree times as likely to commit suicide.\n\n2 1/2 times as likely to drop out of high school.\n\nseverely underrepresented in college and even more so among college graduates, thereby locking them out of today’s, let alone tomorrow’s professional-level jobs.\n\n[su_quote]What changes would you recommend if you were told that African-American children were:\n\nYou’d likely invoke such words as ‘institutional racism’ to justify major efforts to improve African-Americans’ numbers. All of the above statements are true except for one thing: those statistics aren’t about African-American children. They’re about children of all races, indeed half of all children, half of our next generation: boys.[/su_quote]\n\nThe unsourced data Nemko cites is just a wee bit off, methinks (see here for similar but more accurate numbers which also contain source citations). But this much is true: male students are performing poorer both in educational attainment and psychological well-being.\n\nAlso, as a general practice, I’d caution men’s advocates when directly comparing men and African-Americans as groups. In particular, I would emphasize that although what men and boys experience and suffer is not the same as blacks have historically experienced and suffered in terms of degree, the function of those experiences does at times bear certain similarities.\n\n[su_quote]When a disparity hurts females or minorities, major efforts at redress are implemented. Why not with boys? In our politically correct world, if you point to an inequity against women or a minority, you’re considered heroic, but dare you point out a deficit suffered by males, you’re demonized as a whiner or anti-female.[/su_quote]\n\nOnly in a world in which the normal worldview is that men and boys are not deserving of compassion would a mere voice for compassion for them be deemed “anti-female.” But such is the world in which we live.\n\nAlso, a brief digression on rhetoric: what is political “correctness” anyway?\n\nWe have been calling this culture of anti-male bias political “correctness” for decades. I would recommend not doing that any longer, unless you put the word “correctness” in scare quotes (as I always do, to satirize it). We should not reinforce (even subconsciously or by accident) the idea that such attitudes are “correct,” because they are not.\n\nInstead of calling it political “correctness,” let’s call it what it is: sexism. Let’s go ahead and cross that line. Let’s do away with the notion that these biases we describe are mere “errors in judgment” or procedural errors, but what they really are: moral flaws. It is not just institutional practice, but also institutional attitudes that must change. The fight for educational equity is as much a moral one as it is an academic one.\n\nContinuing with Nemko’s article:\n\n[su_quote]Our schools continue to get ever more feminized. Competition, one of boys’ favorite motivators, has largely been excised in favor of ‘cooperative learning’ (which ends up often meaning hat the bright and dedicated do the dull’s and lazy’s work).[/su_quote]\n\nI agree. Few students like “team” work for those reasons. And students are often happy (or simply happier) to work alone. Also, the relationship dynamics of small groups don’t always favor collaborative learning. If a group of four students contain three students who are close friends, the fourth student may often feel left out of their conversations and may drift away from the academic work.\n\nOf course, navigating relationship dynamics is an essential facet of adult life, and students of both sexes should learn how to do this when young. But during early childhood, at a time when students simply haven’t had time to mature (and that goes for both boys and girls), group work – along with its inherent friend favoritism – may set some kids up for failure.\n\nThis is especially true for boys, given the fact that boys are not only more nonsocial, but also due to the fact that boys tend to develop friendships through competition more easily than girls. Group work, which prizes collaboration over competition, can compound this.\n\n[su_quote]Recess, which active boys desperately seek to release pent up energy is increasingly replaced by yet another round of phonics. [/su_quote]\n\nThis is where Nemko loses me. Recess is certainly being replaced by study hall periods among late elementary and early middle-school students, which is consistent with the mentality of out-of-touch number-crunching administrators. But is Nemko arguing that recess periods are being replaced by phonics instruction at the early childhood (particularly the kindergarten through 2nd grade) level?\n\nPhonics – instruction in the building blocks of language – is critical for boys to develop good verbal skills. Peg Tyre in The Trouble with Boys, Richard Whitmire in Why Boys Fail, and others such as Dr. Michael Gurian in Boys and Girls Learn Differently generally agree with this.\n\nAs the London Evening Standard also reports:\n\n[su_quote]The use of more traditional phonetics-based lessons helps boys catch up with girls – even doing better on some tests – and prevents some children from needing ‘special’ schooling, according to new research findings.\n\nBoys taught using synthetic phonics were able to read words significantly better than girls at the age of seven, with all pupils ahead of the standard for their age. Boys were 20 months ahead while girls were 14 months more advanced than expected. At the end of the study, boys’ reading comprehension was as good as that of the girls, but their word reading and spelling was better.[/su_quote]\n\nYes, young boys do need what educators call “unstructured play” (play where they can run around freely and explore virtually at will), but they also need phonics instruction. I don’t know why they are presented as mutually exclusive, however, and one should not come at the expense of the other.\n\nNemko continues:\n\n[su_quote]The percentage of female K-12 teachers has risen to an all-time high:76.3 percent. In elementary school, it’s well over 90 percent. The main role model boys see in school is the custodian.\n\nAnd when boys get home from school, the male role models get worse. Whether watching a sitcom, movie, cartoon, or commercial, the odds are good that the male is a buffoon or sleazebag while the female is savvy and confident.[/su_quote]\n\nAlright, if you’ve never heard this before, let me prep you for a common deflection of boys’ education issues. When you hear people talk about the lack of male role models in lower education, a common counterpoint is that female teachers have always dominated lower education – so what’s the big deal now?\n\nRichard Whitmire made this argument in Why Boys Fail, but he overlooked two important factors:\n\nNever, since lower education became regarded as a universal human right in the West, has the ratio of female to male teachers been as big as it is now. Given the staggering rise of fatherlessness in the past several decades, never have boys who have lacked male role models at school been simultaneously deprived of male role models at home to anywhere near this degree before.\n\nI also think it is worth inquiring into whether, when the ratio of female to male teachers reaches a high percentage, it reaches a “tipping point” whereby male teachers feel the need to self-censor/suppress their perspectives and teaching styles so as not to bug the female teachers around them.\n\nStudies with such a hypothesis have been conducted concerning racial minorities on juries; if similar studies have been done regarding the tendency of male teachers I am unaware of them. That is not to say they do not exist, but if it is an understudied phenomenon I do think it would be an interesting area of inquiry.\n\nDr. Nemko also provides us with some ominous information:\n\n[su_quote]Over my 29 years as a career and education counselor, I’ve noticed a dramatic shift in the boys and men I’ve counseled. When I started, most of them were confident and ambitious. Now, disproportionately, they’re despondent or angry, while the girls and women much more often feel the world is their oyster.[/su_quote]\n\nYes, I think “despondent and angry” is a good description of young men from the 1990s onward. That’s definitely what I felt when I was that age, and many of my friends as well.\n\nI grew up with the generation of schoolboys whose culture was cast in the shadow of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre – what I would call The Columbine Generation. This was also the age in which two trends – fatherlessness and rampant bullying among schoolchildren – had reached critical mass.\n\nThe 1990s was also the age in which Feminist ideology had arguably its greatest stranglehold on the public discussion on gender, given that internet had not yet been developed to the point of providing dissenting voices the power to speak out. In other words, it was a time in which – one way or another – many young men had internalized feelings of abandonment.\n\nA mere four years after the Columbine High School massacre, this song – which resonated and became immensely popular among boys my age – was released. Go ahead and listen, and read the lyrics:\n\nSounds a lot like what Nemko was describing, doesn’t it?\n\nAlthough I will disagree with Nemko on the phonics part, I agree with his following thoughts on education reform:\n\n[su_quote]Schools claim to celebrate diversity yet insist on providing one-size-fits-all education. Whether in co-ed or single-sex classes, boys need boy-friendly instruction: more male teachers who have not been trained to de-boy boys, more competition, praise for boldness, more active learning (for example, drama and simulation) and less seatwork, less relationship-centric fiction and more stories of adventure and heroism, teachers’ accepting that boys will, on average, wiggle more than girls–and that does not require ongoing criticism, which, not surprisingly, leads to more oppositional behavior, to the school psychologist, to the little yellow bus of special education, and even more often to Ritalin.[/su_quote]\n\nThere is a lot that can be unpacked in that paragraph, but for the sake of space I will leave it there. I’ll certainly be unpacking some of these ideas this fall at the Male Students in Peril conference at KSU.\n\nJoin us, if you can make it.\n\nThank you for visiting Title IX For All.

  "latent_18694": "Using speech in your UWP apps: It’s good to talk By Windows Apps Team Share Share Skype\n\nAs developers, we adapt as technologies move from the realm of Science Fiction into readily available SDKs. That’s certainly, or perhaps especially, true for speech technologies. In the past 5 years, devices have become more personal and demanding of new forms of interaction.\n\nIn Windows 10, speech is front-and-center with the Cortana personal assistant, and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) gives us several ways to plug into that “Hey, Cortana” experience. But there’s much more that we can do when working with speech from a UWP app and that’s true whether working locally on the device or remotely via the cloud.\n\nIn this 3-part series, we will dig in to some of those speech capabilities and show that speech can be both a powerful and a relatively easy addition to an app. This series will look at…\n\nthe basics of getting speech recognized\n\nhow speech recognition can be guided\n\nhow we can synthesize speech\n\nadditional capabilities in the cloud for our UWP apps\n\nIn today’s post, we’ll start with the basics.\n\nJust because we can doesn’t always mean we should\n\nUsing a “natural” interaction mechanism like speech requires thought and depends on understanding users’ context:\n\nWhat are they trying to do?\n\nWhat device are they using?\n\nWhat does sensor information tell us about their environment?\n\nAs an example, delivering navigation directions via speech when users are driving is helpful because their hands and eyes are tied up doing other things. It’s less of a binary decision, though, if the users are walking down their city streets with their devices held at arms’ length—speech might not be what they are looking for in this context.\n\nContext is king, and it’s not easy to always get it right even with a modern device that’s packed with sensors. Consider your scenarios carefully and look at our guidance around these types of interactions before getting started.\n\nText to speech\n\nBack to the code. Let’s get started by writing a short UWP function in C# that gets some speech from the user and turns it into text:\n\nasync Task<string> RecordSpeechFromMicrophoneAsync() { string recognizedText = string.Empty; using (SpeechRecognizer recognizer = new Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition.SpeechRecognizer()) { await recognizer.CompileConstraintsAsync(); SpeechRecognitionResult result = await recognizer.RecognizeAsync(); if (result.Status == SpeechRecognitionResultStatus.Success) { recognizedText = result.Text; } } return (recognizedText); }\n\nNote that the lifetime of the SpeechRecognizer in this snippet is kept very short, but it’s more likely in a real application that we would keep an instance in a member variable and re-use it over time.\n\nIf we build this code into an application that has been configured to allow access to the microphone and then say “Hello World,” then the function above runs for approximately 5 seconds before returning the string “hello world.”\n\nWhat are you listening to?\n\nThat snippet above no doubt raises questions. Likely first among these is how the system decided which microphone it should listen to. This decision going to depend on the type of device and the microphones available to it with the widest choice most likely being on a PC where the audio device configuration is used to select the default device as below:\n\nWhat are you listening for?\n\nYour next question might be around which language the SpeechRecognizer is expecting to come from that microphone, or can it just interpret all the languages of the world in one go?\n\nNo, it can’t. That magic still lives in the future right now, so the SpeechRecognizer will use the default language specified in the PC’s system settings:\n\nThat language is reflected in a static property available from the SpeechRecognizer named SystemSpeechLanguage. Our code then could have constructed the SpeechRecognizer via the equivalent but more explicit snippet:\n\nusing (SpeechRecognizer recognizer = new Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition.SpeechRecognizer( SpeechRecognizer.SystemSpeechLanguage))\n\nOur next call after constructing the recognizer was to SpeechRecognizer.CompileConstraintsAsync and yet, curiously, we didn’t have any other code that mentioned these ‘constraints,’ so that perhaps needs a little explanation.\n\nThe framework here has applied some sensible defaults for us, but it’s usual to constrain speech recognition and that can be done using a ‘topic’ (a pre-defined grammar) or a ‘grammar’ (a custom grammar).\n\nTopics: Includes dictation, form filling, and web search, which can be further guided by providing hints.\n\nGrammars: A word list – e.g. “fish,” “chips,” “mushy peas.” A speech recognition grammar (using the SRGS standard). A voice command definition file (as used with Cortana).\n\nWe will look at these constraints in more detail in the next article but it is intertwined with language support in the sense that the SpeechRecognizer maintains two lists of supported languages that are dependent upon the language packs installed on the system:\n\n// the languages supported for topics (dictation, form filling, etc) List<Language> languagesForTopics = SpeechRecognizer.SupportedTopicLanguages.ToList(); // the languages supported for grammars (SRGS, word lists, etc) List<Language> languagesForGrammars = SpeechRecognizer.SupportedGrammarLanguages.ToList();\n\nWhich list you need to check to ensure support will, therefore, depend on which type of constraints you want to apply to the recognition.\n\nHow long will you listen for?\n\nOur original code ran for around 5 seconds before returning a result, and it would have done so even if we hadn’t spoken to it at all.\n\nHowever, if we’d spoken a longer phrase than “Hello World,” that phrase would still have been captured and returned. How is the SpeechRecognizer making these decisions? It comes down to the Timeouts property, which we can tweak:\n\n// defaults to 5 seconds recognizer.Timeouts.InitialSilenceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10); // defaults to 0.5 seconds recognizer.Timeouts.EndSilenceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5); SpeechRecognitionResult result = await recognizer.RecognizeAsync();\n\nThe behavior is then altered to wait for up to 10 seconds for speech and to wait for 5 seconds after speech, so it’s easy to get this code to run for over 15 seconds by delaying the initial speech.\n\nDoes recognition return a “Yes/No” result?\n\nHaving got a return value back from the SpeechRecognizer.RecognizeAsync method, our original code only checked a single Status property to check for Success, but there are many Status values that can be returned here, including errors relating to audio quality issues or the language used.\n\nThe SpeechRecognitionResult itself can deliver more complex results when working with constraints and can also deliver alternate options along with confidence values. We could add some of this logic into our code such that it builds a formatted string that delivers either a high confidence response or a list of the alternatives when confidence is not quite so high:\n\nSpeechRecognitionResult result = await recognizer.RecognizeAsync(); StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder(); if (result.Status == SpeechRecognitionResultStatus.Success) { if (result.Confidence == SpeechRecognitionConfidence.High) { stringBuilder.Append($\"We are confident you said '{result.Text}'\"); } else { IReadOnlyList<SpeechRecognitionResult> alternatives = result.GetAlternates(3); // max number wanted foreach (var option in alternatives) { stringBuilder.AppendLine( $\"We are {option.RawConfidence * 100:N2}% confident you said '{option.Text}'\"); } } recognizedText = stringBuilder.ToString(); }\n\nWe have to wait for the complete results to come back?\n\nOur original code might have given the impression that the speech recognition engine is a ‘black box’—we make a call to RecognizeAsync and we wait for it to return with little interaction in the meantime. That might prove a real challenge to keeping a user engaged in an interaction.\n\nTo aid with that, the SpeechRecognizer has events for HypothesisGenerated and StateChanged, which we can hook in order to monitor the processing. We can also watch for the RecognitionQualityDegrading event and take action to guide the user. In the snippet below, we’ve attached handlers for the first two events:\n\nusing (SpeechRecognizer recognizer = new Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition.SpeechRecognizer()) { recognizer.HypothesisGenerated += (s, e) => { System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine( $\"Recogniser is thinking about '{e.Hypothesis.Text}'\"); }; recognizer.StateChanged += (s, e) => { System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine( $\"Recognizer changed state to {e.State}\"); };\n\nAnd viewing this output from Visual Studio’s Output window gives something like the following:\n\nRecognizer changed state to Capturing Recognizer changed state to SoundStarted Recognizer changed state to SpeechDetected Recogniser is thinking about 'how' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I want to' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I wanted' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I want to see' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I wanted to see what' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I wanted to see what you' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I wanted to see what you can' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I wanted to see what you could' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I wanted to see what you could read' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I wanted to see what you could wreck' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I wanted to see what you could record' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I wanted to see what you could recognize' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I wanted to see what you could recognize as I' Recogniser is thinking about 'hello I wanted to see what you could recognize I'm' … Recognizer changed state to SoundEnded Recognizer changed state to Processing Recognizer changed state to Idle\n\nIt’s possible to build this into quite a rich UX that shows the user feedback as they are progressing, but don’t necessarily assume that you need to build that UX just yet.\n\nThere’s no UX for this?\n\nOur original code example made use of the SpeechRecognizer.RecognizeAsync method, but the class has a sibling method called SpeechRecognizer.RecognizeWithUIAsync, which displays standard recognition UX for the device family and which can be controlled via the UIOptions property.\n\nIn the code snippet below, we tweak all the available options:\n\nrecognizer.UIOptions.AudiblePrompt = \"Say your bank account number\"; recognizer.UIOptions.ExampleText = \"for example ‘12349876’\"; recognizer.UIOptions.IsReadBackEnabled = true; recognizer.UIOptions.ShowConfirmation = true; SpeechRecognitionResult result = await recognizer.RecognizeWithUIAsync();\n\nAnd the UI displayed reflects our choices:\n\nIt is giving the user the ability to cancel out or complete the flow, showing the speech as it is hypothesized, and also offering the user a chance to retry:\n\nAlong with a confirmation that has an audible prompt, it comes with another option to cancel the flow:\n\nFor fairly ‘standard’ scenarios, there’s an opportunity to make use of what has already been built into the framework here and avoid having to do that custom work and, naturally, that’s true across Windows device families.\n\nGoing beyond a single sentence of speech\n\nIn some scenarios, you might want to put an application into a ‘listening’ mode and have it continuously recognizing speech without having to call the RecognizeAsync method repeatedly.\n\nThe SpeechRecognizer calls this a “continuous recognition session,” and it’s reflected by the property SpeechRecognizer.ContinuousRecognitionSession, which comes with its own asynchronous methods to Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, and Cancel, as well as its own AutoStopSilenceTimeout for controlling when it should give up after not hearing the user for a while.\n\nA session like this will generate a sequence of results (the ResultGenerated event fires) and can be configured to pause for each one or keep on running. The results produced follow the pattern that we’ve already seen, and hypotheses are also generated as part of the process. When the complete session ends, the Completed event fires.\n\nBringing it together\n\nLet’s bring this all together. As an example, perhaps we want a class that records lottery number choices. Here’s a simple example of a class that might do something like that:\n\nclass LotteryNumberRecognizer : IDisposable { private class LotteryOptions { public int Min { get; set; } public int Max { get; set; } public int Count { get; set; } public int? Parse(string text) { int? value = null; int temporaryValue = 0; if (int.TryParse(text.Trim(), out temporaryValue) && (temporaryValue >= this.Min) && (temporaryValue <= this.Max)) { value = temporaryValue; } return (value); } } public LotteryNumberRecognizer(int numberCount = 6, int min = 1, int max = 59) { this.lotteryOptions = new LotteryOptions() { Min = min, Max = max, Count = numberCount }; } public void Dispose() { this.recognizer?.Dispose(); this.recognizer = null; } public async Task<IReadOnlyList<int>> GetNumbersFromUserAsync() { this.resultsList = new List<int>(); this.taskCompletion = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>(); await this.CreateRecognizerAsync(); await this.recognizer.ContinuousRecognitionSession.StartAsync( SpeechContinuousRecognitionMode.Default); bool succeeded = await this.taskCompletion.Task; if (!succeeded) { throw new TimeoutException( \"Failed gathering data, for brevity assuming it's a timeout\"); } return (this.resultsList.AsReadOnly()); } async Task CreateRecognizerAsync() { if (this.recognizer == null) { this.recognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(); this.recognizer.Timeouts.EndSilenceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(250); this.recognizer.Timeouts.InitialSilenceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10); this.recognizer.ContinuousRecognitionSession.AutoStopSilenceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10); this.recognizer.ContinuousRecognitionSession.ResultGenerated += OnResultGenerated; this.recognizer.ContinuousRecognitionSession.Completed += OnCompleted; this.recognizer.Constraints.Add( new SpeechRecognitionTopicConstraint( SpeechRecognitionScenario.FormFilling, \"Number\")); await this.recognizer.CompileConstraintsAsync(); } } async void OnResultGenerated(SpeechContinuousRecognitionSession sender, SpeechContinuousRecognitionResultGeneratedEventArgs args) { Debug.WriteLine(args.Result.Text); if ((args.Result.Status == SpeechRecognitionResultStatus.Success) && (args.Result.Confidence == SpeechRecognitionConfidence.High)) { int? lotteryNumber = this.lotteryOptions.Parse(args.Result.Text); if (lotteryNumber != null) { this.resultsList.Add((int)lotteryNumber); if (this.resultsList.Count == this.lotteryOptions.Count) { await this.recognizer.ContinuousRecognitionSession.StopAsync(); } } } } void OnCompleted(SpeechContinuousRecognitionSession sender, SpeechContinuousRecognitionCompletedEventArgs args) { this.taskCompletion.SetResult( (args.Status == SpeechRecognitionResultStatus.Success) && (this.resultsList.Count == this.lotteryOptions.Count)); } LotteryOptions lotteryOptions; List<int> resultsList; TaskCompletionSource<bool> taskCompletion; SpeechRecognizer recognizer; }\n\nAnd this might be used by a piece of code like the following:\n\nLotteryNumberRecognizer recognizer = new LotteryNumberRecognizer(); try { IReadOnlyList<int> numbers = await recognizer.GetNumbersFromUserAsync(); } catch (TimeoutException) { // TBD. }\n\nWe could then marry with this some UI in order to present it to the user.\n\nWrapping up\n\nWe’ve introduced the idea of the SpeechRecognizer and some of its capabilities for gathering speech from the user. In the next article, we’ll look at how we can further guide the recognition process and we’ll also look at how we can have the device talk back to the user.

Raising further concerns about that is the fact that North Korean ballistic missiles could be armed with nuclear warheads.\n\nThis interest in a sea-based missile capability comes not long after a top US general claimed that North Korea had made progress on miniaturizing its nuclear warheads, which are widely thought to be too large and unwieldy to deliver by the ballistic missiles Pyongyang currently possesses.\n\nIn October, US General Curtis Scaparrotti, the commander of US forces on the Korean peninsula, warned that North Korea had developed \"the capability to miniaturize a device at this point and they have the technology to actually deliver what they say they have.\"\n\nIf North Korea completes its reserve engineering of the Golf-II submarines, the Hermit Kingdom could field a fleet of nuclear-capable submarines that could function as an additional deterrent.\n\nThere's reason for skepticism, though. For the foreseeable future, the threat of nuclear retaliation from North Korea remains isolated to the North East Asian region, and that's assuming its nuclear weapons are small enough to be practically deliverable. North Korea lacks a proven capability of launching a missile that could strike the continental US, although the country could possibly target US forces stationed in bases throughout the Asia Pacific region.\n\nBut even in North East Asia, the threat from North Korean submarines remains low. Pyongyang is years away from creating a fully credible sea-based nuclear fleet, and that's assuming they master nuclear miniaturization. And after construction of this hypothetical fleet, North Korea's submarines would be outdated and potentially easy prey for more advanced submarine hunting equipment. Pyongyang would still be running a North Korean version of an outmoded Soviet model.\n\n\"Because the submarines have been reverse-engineered from the obsolete Golf-class submarine,\" Ghoshal writes for USNI News, \"there is a chance that the submarine could be defeated by modern anti-submarine techniques.\"",

  "latent_19376": "Opinions: everybody’s got one. All too often, people decide to make those opinions mandatory through legislation. Examples range from conservative opposition to marijuana and gay marriage, to leftist opposition to gun ownership and big gulp sodas.\n\nEverybody wants to ban something. It’s human nature that if given power, people will want to use it. And in the state apparatus, that usually means calls for regulation and/or prohibition. So before you go out and vote for the latest piece of legislation, here are five really stupid excuses people use to justify criminalization.\n\n1. Protect the Children\n\nYeah, how original. Ban smoking (to protect the children), ban guns (to protect the children), ban pornography (to protect the children), ban video games (to protect the children).\n\nTo those of you who use this excuse because you happen to be overprotective guardians who can’t bear the idea of a free society in which every aspect of life isn’t child-friendly: could you kindly stop forcing your incessant worrying onto the rest of us? Individuals smoking weed aren't gonna make little Jimmy become a drug dealer and individuals watching porn aren't gonna make little Sally become a prostitute. Well, maybe… So, just invest in some parental control software!\n\nAnd to those of you who are just using children as a tool of emotional exploitation so you can convince a majority to pass a law mandating your beliefs onto others, you’re not a good person.\n\n2. Slippery Slope\n\nEveryone’s favorite fallacy.\n\n• Gay marriage is a slippery slope to bestiality!\n\n• Violent video games are a slippery slope to murder!\n\n• Marijuana is a slippery slope to flakka!\n\nGuess what? Not every action is a first step to a later inevitable consequence that’s ten times worse than the original. Furthermore, if you’re so good at predicting the future, tell me, what about stupid people asking stupid politicians to pass stupid laws to prevent a stupid paranoid future scenario? What would that slippery slope lead to?\n\n3. It’s for Our Safety!\n\nHonestly, if you hear this come from somebody’s mouth, you’re probably listening to a politician or a mobster. Now, we all want laws that offer protection against acts of aggression such as murder, assault, theft, property damage, etc. But damn, people take it too far.\n\nEvery law is backed by an enforcement gun.\n\n“Why are you spying on my emails, text messages, and phone calls?” To protect you from terrorists.\n\n“Why are you groping my genitalia and confiscating my cocoa butter before I get on a plane?” To protect you from bombs.\n\n“Why are you arming the local police with LAV’s, surveillance drones, and selective fire rifles?” To protect you from criminals.\n\n“Why are you preventing me from drinking raw milk, sharing my car or my house with somebody for money, or opening up an unregulated lemonade stand in front of my house?” To protect you from… uh… freedom?\n\nYes, these laws are made to control us and take our freedom. These laws often don’t make us any more safe. In fact, in most cases they add unnecessary threats of danger to our lives since every law is backed by an enforcement gun, which will shoot you down if you dare disobey.\n\n4. Prevent Bad Choices\n\nThe only thing prohibitions do is make these activities more dangerous and vulnerable to criminal influence.\n\nApparently some people believe a huge portion of the population is just waiting to do something self-destructive or vaguely anti-social: drugs, incest, prostitution, masturbation, etc. They cling to this idea that if we decriminalize these activities, more and more people will suddenly feel the urge to partake of them: as if legalizing something is equivalent to the government promoting it.\n\nLook, chances are, if someone wants to do something, they’re going to do it anyway. Regardless of whether there’s a law banning it or not. Conservatives understand this when it comes to obtaining guns, liberals understand this with regard to obtaining an abortion. But somehow, when the question is reversed, they are completely lost. The only thing prohibitions do is make these activities more dangerous and vulnerable to criminal influence.\n\nIf meth is legalized, I’m not gonna go smoke meth. Cigarettes are legal and I don’t smoke those. Weed is illegal and I still smoke that occasionally.\n\nIf drinking beers before 21 is banned, you think that’s gonna stop anyone from doing it?\n\nIf prostitution is legalized, it’s not gonna incentivise me to go become an escort. (Just kidding. $250 an hour. No kissing.)\n\nBottom line: laws that turn peaceful activities into victimless crimes don’t magically stop people from doing those activities. And legalizing them won’t magically make everyone start doing it. I’m gonna do what I wanna do regardless. Why? Because I’m an unapologetic freedom-loving degenerate. And that’s ok.\n\n5. It’s the Law!\n\nThis has got to be the worst of them all. People might know a law is terrible, they might agree that it infringes on individual rights, they might even be a victim of the insane piece of legislation. But they accept it and the resulting bad effects because, “It’s the Law. We just have to deal with it.”\n\nOpinions and force don’t mix.\n\nIf you’re the type of person who sees a victim of government overreach, someone who has done nothing wrong or harmed anyone or anyone’s property in any way but got arrested simply for disobeying a B.S. law and thinks, “It’s you’re fault, you should’ve just obeyed the law, you deserve what you get,” I urge you to reevaluate your principles and decide whether they mean something to you or not.\n\nOpinions are great in a free society. But in an authoritarian democratic state, opinions become laws; a cancer that grows to infect the lives of as many people as possible. So if we agree that opinions and force don’t mix, the logical conclusion is that one has to go.\n\nI tend to like my free speech and that of others, so opinions aren’t something I’d like to get rid of. But this whole system that allows for those opinions to be forced onto me? Maybe we could do without that. Just a thought.",
  "latent_19445": "United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley on Sunday struggled to justify the hypocrisy between President Donald Trump’s claimed humanitarian reason for Syrian airstrikes, and his opposition to admitting Syrian refugees, many of whom are children.\n\nHaley, asked to reconcile Trump’s vehement opposition to refugees with his explanation that he ordered last week’s attack after seeing pictures of “beautiful babies” killed in a chemical bombing, talked about the president’s call for “extreme vetting” of refugees.\n\n“What this president has done is said, ‘Prove to me that you are vetting these people properly. And if you are vetting them properly, then we will resume where we are. But until then, you have to prove to me that these people are being vetted in a way that we’re not putting American citizens at risk,’” Haley told NBC’s Chuck Todd.\n\n“And so what he did was, I think, that there were those countries that we knew that there were problems, that we couldn’t vet. And that’s key,” she continued. “You can’t vet. You don’t know who you’re letting in. You don’t know if there’s any sort of bad intentions there. And so what you’re seeing is the president’s being very cautious with that.”\n\nOn CNN’s “State of the Union,” Haley praised Trump’s “compassionate” military response to the chemical attack, but couldn’t explain why his compassion doesn’t apply to refugee children.\n\n“Certainly you don’t think Syrian children pose a risk to the American people,” host Jake Tapper said.\n\n“Well, Syrian children have to come with Syrian adults. And you don’t know. It’s hard to know based on the vetting process,” Haley answered. “And that’s unfortunate that we can’t find that out. But hopefully we’ll get to the point that we can.”",
  "latent_19558": "Note: This article is also available in French, Farsi, Swedish, Portuguese, Romanian and German.\n\nFrom the second feminists started spawning their “patriarchy” baby, women’s issues in less-developed countries such as middle-eastern ones were presented as proof of “oppression of women as long as human beings have lived.” Western media and feminists in particular look at a society in a difficult condition and do not see people suffering; they see women suffering.\n\nWestern media and in fact eastern media’s handling of the state of affairs is one of adamantly illustrating women as slaves and cunningly displaying men as cruel slave owners. This of course has been only responded to, so far, by some people in these cultures who, in an effort to defend those cultures, usually come up with religious statements explaining the rights of women in Islam and Islamic philosophy, which causes some confusing problems. Among the more evident of the problems lies the question: What if somebody is not religious and does not choose to live with codes of Islamic philosophy?\n\nIran, for instance, seems to have the least religious people among middle-eastern countries. Rejection of long-ingrained religious doctrines invariably leads to less and less obligation. And for the many who dump religious doctrines, it seems like most are keen to consent to any criticism of the culture – even an unfair one. That is why, for many, the ridding of old cultural norms comes as a package deal with feminism. This is the perfect time for feminism to ride on a mind, repelled of the old restrictions.\n\nHowever something is amiss here. Are those restrictions all on women? It is fascinating how from a nonreligious viewpoint, the western eyes have only been catching glimpses of some woman in misery while being completely indifferent to the large and ubiquitous pain of men. Feminists are quick to shout “patriarchy!” and others are quick to find faith in it and judge.\n\nToday we pay a little visit to Iran, in hope of finding patriarchy in a highly misandric, feminist-infested culture. This view of Iranian women as oppressed by men, which has been the bread and butter of Western media and feminists, has been served to the public as a patriarchal feast.\n\nOver the past few decades, eyes and ears were bombarded by the media about Iran’s patriarchy and the slavery of women. Unfortunately, that is a joke nobody is laughing at. Each feminist movie was rewarded by Western festivals and film awards up to a level where feminism is now an element of film-making for every director who is desperate for Western attention. Iranians were told billions of times about women’s issues, usually in a lying propagandist manner, and were fed the lies enough times that they actually started believing in them.\n\nSo, for any blue-pill readers out there, before your reflexive defensive outburst impairs your judgment and reduces you to a shrill screaming feminist or white knight, crying “women’s issues in Iran!”: let me clarify that I am the last person to discard some issues faced by some women in Iran. I do think some of those issues are legitimate causes about which something must be done. In fact, I wouldn’t discard the notion that any class of people might have some issues.\n\nHaving said that, if you bear several paragraphs and put aside the beliefs hammered into your head, you will see how the supposed “Patriarchy” has increased the Quality of Life of women much higher relative to that of most men. In fact, in this part of the world, infantilizing and spoiling women is done to a level possibly unmatched anywhere else. Bear in mind the fact that all the local media, operating under the guidance of their Western counterparts, along with Iranian feminism, are injecting a significant dose of misandry into this society.\n\nWe start by examining the basic rights of men and women in Iran, point out some forms of discrimination against both sexes–and then blow your mind about how the media is misrepresenting this whole matter. Although misandry can be easily spotted under the law, it can in no way express cultural norms and expectations of the gender roles which shoot this country right among the top misandric ones.\n\nKeeping in mind that when moving one step away from the law and into the culture, misandry gets much more evident; this article only gives a fair examination of the laws and leaves the cultural misandry for other writings.\n\nSome forms of discrimination against your average woman in Iran include the following.\n\nIn case there is no will documented by a deceased person and no agreement on the part of the deceased’s family members, the sons will receive twice as much inheritance as daughters.\n\nMarried women need their husband’s signature to get a passport.\n\nWomen must wear rousari (veil) when appearing in public and no, it is nothing like what they showed you on TV (if this is what you saw):\n\nThis is what they actually look like when you walk the streets:\n\nHere are some forms of discrimination against men:\n\nConscription. All males are mandated to do at least two years of service in the military or armed forces. The conscription is not a draft that one may not attend in case there are enough volunteers. The time to join the forces is as soon as males come of age (18 years old) and is allowed to be postponed to after graduation, if they manage to get accepted in Iran’s university entrance exam system within a 1 year period. Unless their full time in the military is served, no adult male is allowed to leave the country, buy or sell anything in their names, get a license to work, use their university degree, etc. The punishment for not enrolling on time, aside from being reduced to a person with no rights, is that the person is to be taken into the military by force wherever he is spotted, with added service time. The mandate of the service is lifted in case a boy is confirmed to have severe disabilities or he is an only son in a fatherless household where he claims to be the provider.The law forbids women from the service, which is a bit different from what it sounds because it is not necessarily about military training per se. Many of the very important, highly dangerous jobs are done by soldiers. Doing extreme specialized and physical work in 120 Fahrenheit degrees in islands with no supply of fresh water (and void of any women), or in -22 Fahrenheit degrees, is a part of service. This especially poses a big problem on athletes. They have to shun their athletic careers for two years at the peak of fitness in their early twenties. Omid Noruzi for instance, the gold medal winner of the 2012 Olympics, was forced to leave his career and not compete in the 2008 Olympics, despite being qualified as he was the world champion in 2007, in order to join the military – which made him suicidal.\n\n“Free” (paid by men) health insurance for women only. Should a single woman choose not to work, she will be covered under her parent’s medical insurance for life even after the death of her parents. Males are covered only up to the age of 21. Married women are automatically covered under their husband’s medical insurance plan (even after the death of the husband). Husbands, on the other hand, are not covered under the wife’s insurance plan if they find themselves out of job. This of course is in a country where medical costs are so unbelievably high that the government subsidizes insurance for medical care. Should an employed woman with her own insurance get fired or choose to leave her job; she will be covered automatically again under her live/deceased father/husband.\n\nPensions for women. Should a husband die, his occupational insurance (his highest salary per day multiplied by the years he worked) will be monthly paid to his wife as a salary for life, regardless of her being employed or not. No such law for men. Just FYI: occupational insurance is mandatory for all jobs.\n\nSupport for divorced women. Should a woman get divorced, in addition to what she gets out of her husband (called Mehrieh – this will be discussed in more detail in another article), her provider is considered to be her father and in case her father is dead, she will get from the government an equal share of her father’s occupational insurance as her salary for as long as she lives. This way, most divorced women do not have to work.\n\nNo compensation for surviving husbands. There is insurance for housewives who choose not to work so that after a certain age they will be paid a salary. The husband who pays for the insurance is not compensated in case of the woman’s death, but the woman’s siblings and parents will receive the lion’s share of the money the husband paid for.\n\nWelfare for women. When it comes to the poor sectors of the society, any woman who claims not to have a providing father and husband and a state-paying job receives monthly paid wages from an association called Kommiteye Imdad that, aside from women of any age, only registers men who in addition to not having any sort of income are severely disabled or are aged.\n\nInheritance after divorce. If a woman divorces an ill husband who dies as a result of that illness within a year from the date of the divorce, his ex-wife still inherits as if they were never divorced.\n\nIran’s other marriage and divorce laws, as well as misandry in education, are left for future articles.\n\nSaddening is the fact that nobody even thinks about these issues – to which must be added some other conditions:\n\nThere are currently 1.7 million children laboring (ages 5 to 15), 92% of whom are boys.\n\n95% of children living in the streets are boys.[1] (Curiously enough this statistic was very hard to find because almost none of the sources concerning child labor mentioned the disparity between the sexes.)\n\nMales make 85% of the homeless.[2] (Interestingly enough you will find that newspaper titles are: 15% of the homeless are women and address concerns regarding that, implying that the goal should be that 100% of the homeless are male. Also, numerous articles, investigations and organizations exist in regards to homeless women.)\n\n100% of battlefield deaths have been and will be men.\n\n100% of battlefield injuries are men.\n\n98.5% of workplace injuries in 2005 were men[3]. (In 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively 98.5%, 98.7% and 98.7%)\n\n60% of rape victims are male[4] (excluding prison rapes).\n\nMales also make up 81.7% of suicides.[5] (Interestingly, it is a piece of cake to find many media outlets openly lying that women have higher rates of suicide.)\n\nThis might give you a general idea for starters as to the state of affairs in Iran. But these so far only deal with discrimination under the law and not cultural standards to which men and women are held. The same cultural inclinations that create a society wherein 67% of university students are female, but most will not have jobs. This is not because they are discriminated against, as feminists will tell you, but because the majority won’t even fill out one job application form during a lifetime. University and jobs are hobbies and ego-boosters to many Iranian women.\n\nThere is a joke going around the country about how women mostly go to universities to have a diploma in their dowry! Their husbands are held responsible and should they not get married, the father is responsible.\n\nBefore I end, here is a typical effort of media at representing Iran as truly proof of gynocentrism rather than patriarchy[6]. This is actually one of the least misandric pieces I have read which does not explicitly attack men, rather it solely concentrates on women. That is why this article you are reading is not tackling the extreme, but rather the typical world we are living in:\n\n“The comparison between modern British girls and modern Iranian girls living less than 3,000 miles apart could hardly be more stark. In Britain, a young woman can wear pretty clothes and makeup in public, talk on her mobile, smoke, go for a drink and have a boyfriend. If she gets pregnant, the state will look after her. If she commits a crime, the worst that can happen to her is imprisonment in a humanely run prison. In Iran, she must cover her head at all times and may not wear makeup or do anything to display her femininity in public. She may not drink alcohol or associate with boys and if she gets caught, she will be flogged. If she gets caught having sex or gets pregnant outside marriage, she can be sentenced to death for adultery or moral crimes. If she commits murder or is involved in drug trafficking, she can expect to feel the hangman’s noose, perhaps in public. It is claimed by feminist and human rights groups that Iran is one big prison for women.”\n\nNow let’s comment on this. Starting with the last sentence is nice to get the perspective of why to criticize:\n\nIt is claimed by feminist and human rights groups that Iran is one big prison for women.”\n\nThere goes your typical gynocentrism; one big prison for women, but for men it is nothing but blow jobs every second of every day. That way it is also implied that men are the prison guards. Getting back to the beginning:\n\nThe comparison between modern British girls and modern Iranian girls living less than 3,000 miles apart could hardly be more stark. In Britain, a young woman can wear pretty clothes and makeup in public, talk on her mobile, smoke, go for a drink and have a boyfriend.\n\nExcept for the drink, a young woman does all of that in Iran.\n\nIn Iran, she must cover her head at all times and may not wear makeup or do anything to display her femininity in public.\n\nActually Iranian women are among the largest consumers of makeup in the world, along with Iran having the highest rate of nose jobs for women in the world, and being among the countries with highest rates of cosmetic surgery fr women. These exceedingly expensive nose jobs and other cosmetic surgeries are – as you guessed it – almost always paid for by men. Even most women in the rather poor sectors of society force their men to pay for cosmetic surgeries usually by exercising guilt trips and shaming. This article provides some insight into this:\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/mar/01/beauty-obsession-iran-cosmetic-surgery\n\nQuoting from the article:\n\n“…Iranian obsession with physical beauty. Far from focusing on internal spiritual values, young people – some aged 14 – are having cosmetic surgery in the hope of attaining “doll faces” to make them look like the actors they see in Hollywood films and satellite television programmes from the west.”\n\nBack to the gyno-minded article:\n\nShe may not drink alcohol…\n\nBoys cannot drink alcohol either; it is illegal in Iran for anybody to drink. It is called prohibition, not oppression of women.\n\n… or associate with boys and if she gets caught, she will be flogged.\n\nShe cannot associate with boys? She will be flogged? Really? Pffffffffftt. Victim mentality and propaganda is one thing but this is a new low, even for feminists.\n\nAsk yourself, what kind of a lunatic tells these kinds of lies? Or worse, why did these liars have everybody convinced that there is a heinous patriarchy in Iran ripping women apart? Or worse, why have people believed them? Male-domination, my patriarchal ass – I assure you, articles won’t stop until this whole pathetic charade comes to light.\n\nShe cannot associate with boys? Iranian girls don’t have boyfriends? Pffftt and pfffft. Perhaps they also think that Iranian boys all have girlfriends. It must be nice to have no logic and be given a platform to dance on the truth. Their key to success is to conflate religionism with sexism. Much more to be said on this later.\n\nIf she gets caught having sex or gets pregnant outside marriage, she can be sentenced to death for adultery or moral crimes.\n\nThis is an outright lie which is constantly repeated all over the western media; here is the truth:\n\nIf a girl has consensual vaginal sex outside marriage in Iran, she can sue the boy and force him to marry her and she will be legally paid Mehrieh, which for now think of it as 150,000 US$. Trust your eyes; you read it right. This will be discussed in another article. Do not miss the upcoming article about Iran’s marriage and divorce laws and again how the media is presenting it.\n\nIf she commits murder or is involved in drug trafficking, she can expect to feel the hangman’s noose, perhaps in public.”\n\nThe rest of that article is dedicated to the death penalties of women over the past several decades, but wait a second.\n\nYes, hanging criminals in public does happen in Iran but here are some facts for you:\n\nIn 2012, 580 people were sentenced to death – some of whom were hanged in public. 9 were women, 571 were men.[7]\n\nActually, it is highly unlikely that Iranian judges make this kind of sentence for women. 76% of the aforementioned hanged cases were sentenced due to drug trafficking – only 3 of whom were women. The bias is too obvious to need further explanation.\n\nMedia’s distorted representations can be traced everywhere:\n\nSo Hitchens says and I quote: “You insult your sisters in Tehran who are being beaten and raped every day when you say they have rights.” When exposing feminist lies and propaganda you just know that rape would come up. Come to think of it, as rape is considered to be a crime of patriarchy; let us study rape statistics in Iran:\n\n900 cases of rape were handled by the police last year in Iran. 60% of victims of rape were men, 40% were women.[8] This shocking fact hides inside it some cultural difficulties that Iranian men and boys face. Also chances of being raped in Iran is pretty much lower than most countries. Suffice it for now to say that in this supposed patriarchy, the punishment for rape is being hanged in public. Same goes for child molestation and being a gay man. Yes, a gay man, not a lesbian.\n\nTo sum up, the (western) Mainstream Media is a mess of gynocentrism and feminism. Gynocentric in that you might find 100 articles in English about the extremely few female taxi drivers in Iran, but not one article in any language about the 2076 male taxi drivers only in Tehran who are aged 71 to 80 (also 234 male taxi drivers in Tehran who are over 81)[9] who still work to provide for their thirty-some year old single daughters – daughters who are confused whether they have yoga class or English class today, whether they tell their boyfriends to get out of work early so as to give them a ride home, or if they should go shopping after class. Go figure.\n\n[1] http://vista.ir/article/351575 [2] http://www.ghatreh.com/news/nn14651670/ [3] Mahmood Bakhtiyari, Ali Delpisheh, Sayyed Mohammad Riahi, Arman Latifi, Farid Zayeri, Masoud Salehi, Hamid Soori; “Epidemiology of occupational accidents among Iranian insured workers”; Safety Science 50; 2012 [4]Editorial note: after publication the original reference to this was questioned, so please see http://salamatnews.com/interview.aspx?ID=692, as well as the original reference that follows. –DE Original ref: http://ahar91.blogfa.com/category/4 [5]http://markaz-ejtemaee15.com/blog/1390/04/07/%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%AF%DA%A9%D8%B4%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88-%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86/ [6]http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/iranfem.html [7]http://www.dw.de/%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B5%DB%8C%D9%84%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84-%DB%B1%DB%B3%DB%B9%DB%B1/a-16720688 [8]http://ahar91.blogfa.com/category/4 [9]http://www.asriran.com/fa/news/197120/35-%D9%87%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D9%85%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%AF",
  "latent_19620": "Submitted on Thu, 02/18/2016 - 5:36pm\n\nRICHMOND, Virginia - February 15, 2016 - Inmates of the Virginia Department of Corrections have called for an end to abusive conditions in a statement released earlier this week. Calling themselves the \"Free Virginia Movement,\" in solidarity with the Free Alabama Movement, the incarcerated workers within Virginia's prison system have joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in hopes to improve living and working conditions throughout Virginia's prisons and to repeal a series of state laws enacted in 1994 which effectively abolished parole.\n\nThe stated goals of the organization include an across the board reinstatement for eligibility of parole, the reinvestment of interests gained from inmates’ funds into rehabilitation, job training, and education programs, and an exemption for those with life sentences from paying 10 percent of their wages into a post-release savings fund.\n\n\"At every stage of the struggle, we have petitioned the courts, filed grievances, and patiently waited for the VA state government to take corrective action,\" the Free Virginia Movement said in their statement, \"But just like the institution of chattel slavery, mass incarceration is in essence an economic system which uses human beings as its nuts and bolts.\"\n\n\"These people live and work in some of the harshest conditions in the country,\" says Emma Rose, a member of the IWW's Incarcerated Workers' Organizing Committee (IWOC), \"If anyone needed to organize today, it's them.\"\n\nIn 2014, the Industrial Workers of the World won wage increases for Whole Foods workers in California, a company that has recently come under fire for their use of prison labor in sourcing their cheeses and fish.\n\nDue to the recent efforts of the IWW's IWOC, approximately one in five members of the union, which welcomes workers in every industry, are currently incarcerated. \"People are joining in droves,\" says a representative of IWOC. \"A formal network is growing out of the informal collaboration between the Free Alabama Movement and the IWW. It's really exciting to see people come together to organize in places where 70 cents an hour is considered good pay.\"\n\nThe union has welcomed incarcerated workers with open arms according to Rose, who says labor may suffer if they leave prisoners behind. “It goes back to the slogan of the labor movement, \"an injury to one is an injury to all,\" these are people fighting to have modern job training and to get paid for the work they do so they aren't completely left behind when they get out. They're paid pennies for work while we're fighting to get $15 an hour for on the outside. Trump is wrong about corporations finding cheap labor in China, they're doing it right under our noses and they're using prison labor to do it.\"\n\nThe full Free Virginia Movement declaration can be read at https://iwoc.noblogs.org/post/2016/02/16/free-virginia-movement-declaration/.\n\nContact:\n\nEmma Rose\n\nwww.iwoc.tk\n\nemmakaiemmakai@gmail.com\n\nPh: 1 (331) 980-7858\n\nAlternate Contact:\n\nStefanie Brown\n\njesterlove17@gmail.com\n\nPh: 612-964-4309\n\nWant to Help?

  "latent_19660": "A human rights group has learned that a woman was forcibly aborted at seven months of pregnancy on June 3 in Shanxi Province, China.\n\nWomen’s Rights Without Frontiers informed LifeNews that a new report from the China-based human rights organization 64Tianwang indicates the woman, Feng Jianmei, was beaten and dragged into a vehicle by a group of family planning officials while her husband, Deng Jiyuan, was out working.\n\nThe officials asked for RMB 40,000 in fines from Feng Jianmei’s family and, when they did not receive the money, they forcibly aborted Feng at seven months, laying the body of her aborted baby next to her in the bed (seen in picture, right). Feng is under medical treatment in Ankang City, Zhenpin County, Zengjia Town, Yupin village.\n\nReggie Littlejohn, president of Women’s Rights Without Frontiers, said, “This is an outrage. No legitimate government would commit or tolerate such an act.”\n\n“Those who are responsible should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity,” Littlejohn said. “WRWF calls on the United States government and the leaders of the free world to strongly condemn forced abortion and all coercive family planning in China.”\n\nRead the original report (in Chinese) about Feng Jianmei here (warning: additional graphic images).\n\nThe report comes after global pressure appeared to have stopped Chinese family planning officials in Changsha, Hunan province from following through with a threatened forced abortion on a woman and her unborn baby in the fifth month of pregnancy.\n\nAs LifeNews reported last week, the human rights group ChinaAid, which worked closely with Chen to help him leave China, learned that a 37-year-old woman, Cao Ruyi (pictured left) , was dragged from her home and beaten on the morning of June 6 by more than a dozen Chinese family planning officials. The mother, pregnant with a five month old unborn child, was accused of violating China’s “one child” policy because she and her husband, Li Fu, already have a six-year-old daughter.\n\nLater, Cao’s husband Li Fu told ChinaAid founder and president Bob Fu that Cao Ruyi was allowed to return home on Sunday and added that the surveillance personnel from the local family planning office had also been called off. Fu said he “expressed their thanks to ChinaAid for exposing the violent manner in which the local family planning officials dragged his wife to the hospital and the threat of performing a forced abortion on her.”\n\n“He said the domestic and international attention and concern that Fu’s publicity efforts elicited was the reason Ms. Cao was allowed to return home,” Fu added.\n\nHowever, before her release from the hospital, Cao was forced to sign a guarantee that she will pay a 10,000 yuan (nearly US $1500) “pregnancy termination deposit fee,” which will not be returned if she insists on keeping her baby. Instead the deposit will serve as partial payment of her fine for giving birth to a baby without government permission. She will also be required to pay a “social burden compensation fee” of US $25,000.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU’RE PRO-LIFE!\n\n“Nonetheless, this is a welcome change,” Fu said. “ChinaAid expresses its thanks for the timely prayers of many brothers and sisters and for the concern expressed by many in the international community, most notably U.S. congressman Chris Smith who contacted the Hunan provincial and Changsha municipal governments directly.”\n\n“Some Chinese netizens have also traveled to Changsha to lodge a formal protest with the procuratorate about Ms. Cao’s illegal detention by local officials. Many house church Christians prayed for Ms. Cao’s unborn child and called the couple to encourage and express support for them,” Fu continued.",
  "latent_19681": "How to Fix Common AR-15 Malfunctions and Stoppages\n\nIf you’re somewhat new to the AR-15 platform you might find things that catch you by surprise. The proper use of gas operated weapons like the AR-15 is a bit more complicated than that of your average hunting rifle or handgun. You may have heard stories of AR-15 jamming, failure to feed, and short stroke and wonder what causes them. Maybe you need to know how to clear a double feed. Let's take a look at the common stoppages and malfunctions of the AR-15 and help you with some of those mysteries.\n\nAt one time, or another, it is likely that you will encounter a situation where your AR doesn't behave as you expect it to. You might squeeze the trigger and find it gives only a little and feels mushy or it might give a click while nothing else happens. Perhaps you’ve just fired one, or maybe several rounds, and now your weapon won’t fire again.\n\nWhen one of these things occurs, what you’re experiencing is a stoppage of your AR system. Simply put, a stoppage is any situation where your AR-15 fails to complete a cycle of operation. Stoppages may be caused by simple human error or by mechanical malfunction. Many basic stoppage situations can be remedied immediately in the field and will not necessarily repeat themselves. If you have ever failed to chamber the first round and pulled the trigger with no results, you have experienced a stoppage caused by human error. Obviously this stoppage is a simple one to resolve, other stoppages may be more complicated and have mechanical roots. These are malfunctions of your AR system.\n\nImmediate Action: “ Tap, Rack, and Reassess ”\n\nThe first attempt to remedy any stoppage of an AR-15 should be what those in the know call Immediate Action: “Tap, Rack, and Reassess.”\n\n“Tap” your magazine to be sure it is properly seated “Rack” pull the charging handle of your AR-15 back swiftly with ample force and release it cleanly “Reassess” This replaces the “Bang” part of the cycle many veterans were taught. Simply said, before firing, be sure that there is still a reason to do so and that it is still safe to fire. Once those conditions are established, feel free to give the “bang” portion a try.\n\nThe Tap, Rack, and Reassess cycle will resolve a great many AR-15 stoppages. In fact, the going estimate is that 90 to 95 percent of all stoppages can be resolved with a quick run through of this process. Most of the stoppages that are cleared in this manner would be considered type 1, simple stoppages that may not have a specific known source. If this doesn’t solve your problem, you may have a more complex stoppage such as the stovepipe jam.\n\nThe Stovepipe Jam\n\nThe stovepipe jam is simply diagnosed. The appearance of a stovepipe jam is the source of its moniker. When this particular type of jam occurs, a piece of spent ammunition, empty brass if you will, is caught in the ejection port, causing an obstruction to the chamber or feed-way. The brass was extracted properly, but did not eject and is pinned in the ejection port by the bolt face.\n\nTo resolve a stovepipe jam that you have visually identified, you may simply be able to sweep across the ejection port and dislodge the offending empty with a simple hand motion. While this may work, you still won’t have a round chambered and ready to fire. It is more efficient to use the “tap, rack and reassess” method, but with the rifle angled with the ejection port down so that you can get a little help from Newton’s friend, gravity. Success with the modified version of “tap, rack and reassess” is easily in the 90 percent range. The other ten percent will require the operator to use his or her fingers to clear the brass by sweeping them though the magazine well. With the stovepipe jam cleared, you may reseat your magazine if you’ve had to remove it, rack the bolt back and release it, readying your system to fire.\n\nThe Double-Feed\n\nThe third and most complicated type of stoppage is the “double-feed.” If you’ve followed proper procedure, you’ve just done a “tap, rack, and reassess” cycle and found that your AR-15 is definitely not ready to fire. In fact, you’ve got something akin to a log jam happening in your receiver. This is a double-feed.\n\nHow to Clear a Double Feed\n\nThe double-feed is only made worse by the fact that your buffer spring is keeping pressure on the problem. The first thing you will need to do is pull the bolt back and lock it in the rearward position. Once you’ve taken the pressure off the stuck round(s) you’ll need to rip out your magazine. While we consider the double-feed a simple stoppage, magazine function often contributes to this type of stoppage. Now, with the magazine out, rack the bolt back, maybe two or three times to ensure you’ve applied the needed force to the situation. If an application of “lock, rip and rack” doesn’t work, you’ll have to dig in the magazine well with your fingers to clear the offending rounds.\n\nDouble-Feeds and the 30-Round Magazine\n\nIf you have frequent double-feeds and you’re a fan of 30-round mags, you just might be creating your own malfunction. Since nothing’s really “wrong,” we’ll deal with it here, as a simple stoppage. If you spend enough time around tactical guys, you’ll find out that the average buffer spring in an AR-15 isn’t as strong as you might think. What happens when you’ve got a tightly loaded 30-round mag is that when the buffer spring isn’t strong enough to push the round all the way into the chamber and you end up with a round halfway out of the mag. Now, the bolt isn’t far enough along to use the forward assist to complete the cycle so what do you do? That’s right, cycle it again. That’s when it picks up the second round and you’ve got a beauty of a double-feed on your hands. Prevention? Yes, prevention is the key to this one. Just don’t load those big mags clear full. There are plenty of guys running 29 rounds in 30-round magazines who never have to figure out how to clear a double feed.\n\nMalfunctions in the AR-15\n\nA malfunction is a failure of the mechanical, or working parts of the AR system or a failure of the ammunition itself. AR-15 malfunctions may be due to an irregularity in the performance of the rifle itself, the magazine used to deliver ammunition to the rifle or a problem with the ammunition itself. There are several common categories of malfunction. The most common AR-15 malfunctions are: failure to feed, failure to fire, short stroke, failure to eject, and failure to extract.\n\nFailure to Feed / Chamber\n\nA failure to feed is a malfunction that can happen as you initially load your rifle or during a firing cycle. A common cause of failure to chamber is that the bolt carrier group has not moved forward with enough force to complete the operation of feeding/chambering ammunition or to lock the bolt in place. In this case, you may be able to resolve your problem with a simple “tap, rack and reassess,” but if the failure recurs with any frequency, it is likely your rifle has a true malfunction that needs to be addressed. There are a number of things that can contribute to failure to feed/chamber malfunctions.\n\nMagazine Problems\n\nIf you are having issues with failure to feed, you may find that you have a common problem with your magazine. Before you go any further, simply be sure that your magazine is loaded properly and solidly seated. If In doubt, rip it out and replace it with another fresh magazine.\n\nThere is a school of thought that believes the proper loading of a magazine is an art of sorts. You need to be sure you are using enough force to properly seat the magazine without being so rough that you dislodge ammunition. You can misalign the ammunition inside the magazine or, if it’s backed by a strong magazine spring, you could even knock loose a round to try to jump into the chamber prematurely. Either of which will inevitably cause AR-15 jamming. Once in place, tug on the magazine to be sure it’s properly engaged with the magazine catch. Using the Tap & Tug loading procedure is second nature to many shooters, and can help the shooter new to the AR platform to avoid a lot of issues that might look like a feeding malfunction at first blush. Categorized as a failure to chamber or feed, the simple problem of an improper lock due to a magazine that is either setting against the ground or influenced by forward pressure will create a malfunction that is easily remedied by using tap and tug and keeping your magazine clear of the ground and other obstacles.\n\nIf you’ve ruled out a routine loading issue, but swapping out magazines resolved your malfunction, there are a few things you can look for when you get back to the suspect magazine. If it is dented or bulged, the magazine may not allow ammunition to move properly into the rifle. Check the function of the magazine spring. A weak spring may not have the force required to push the ammunition into position to be pushed forward into the chamber.\n\nIf there is nothing obviously wrong with the magazine, there are a couple of other problems that are commonly experienced with larger volume magazines. Where 30 round magazines are involved in repeated stoppages and feeding malfunctions it’s not uncommon to find a specific problem:\n\nThere isn’t enough room at the top of a fully loaded 30-round magazine for the magazine catch to take hold of it and the spring is already depressed so far that there is no give. In this case, you might get the first round off, and then the magazine falls away, knocked loose by recoil. The fix for this is the same as the magazine-bred double-feed. Up for a few 29-round mags, anyone?\n\nBuffer Spring Problems\n\nAssuming you’ve ruled out magazine issues, you may have a damaged, worn or completely broken buffer spring. All you can do for this one is head back to the bench, brake the rifle down, and replace that spring with a quality replacement buffer spring like the one offered in Spike’s Tactical AR-15 Buffer Tube Assembly Kit. Drop-in replacement springs are often of a lot better quality than most springs that are original equipment in many builds.\n\nDefective Rounds / Ammunition Borne Feed Malfunction\n\nDefective rounds can cause a number of different versions of the failure to feed family, but there are two ammunition failures that are more common than the rest. Stubbed rounds are no fun. When the bullet has been forced back into a cartridge, it’s likely to hang up on its way forward or go any way but straight causing a jam. Even more fun than Stubbed rounds, are cartridges that have separated on extraction, ejecting a partial cartridge and leaving the balance in the chamber. Assuming you’ve already attempted the “immediate action” routine and you’re up against some resistance you’ll need to do the following:\n\nPull the bolt all the way back and lock it in place. Pull the magazine Clear the chamber of the damaged round.\n\nWhile that sounds simple enough, you need to understand that sometimes these things are really stuck in there. It may take the patience of a saint, more than a few choice words, and smithing tools to extract an ornery piece of brass. After a difficult episode with a piece of damaged ammunition, be sure to check for safe function of your firearm before resuming operation.\n\nBrass Over Bolt (Bolt Override): Everyone’s Favorite Malfunction\n\nWhile this one isn’t as common as some others, it’s one of those malfunctions that spawns a jam that everyone on the range makes out to be a national emergency. Somehow a piece of spent brass (or for variety and excitement, a live round) becomes lodged above the bolt in forward position and immediate action isn’t happening because the charging handle won’t budge. On examination the operator identifies a bolt over brass malfunction.\n\nAttempt immediate action, discover that charging handle won’t move, and identify brass over bolt condition. Drop the magazine. Move the bolt into the rear position by keeping pressure on the charging handle and bumping the butt of your rifle on the ground. It will require fairly aggressive handling to gain the space you will need to clear the stuck round. Reach through the magazine well to push a finger (or a tool) against the bolt face. Apply steady pressure. Take hold of the charging handle and move finger from the bolt. Strike upward against the charging handle taking care not to break it. This should allow the round to come loose. Pull the bolt to the rear position and the round should fall away.\n\nThe correction of a brass over bolt malfunction requires a bit of force, but it really isn’t a dire situation. Be calm and work the problem.\n\nFailure to Feed Due to Dirt, Debris, and Fouling: Short Stroke\n\nAs a gas operated weapon system, the AR-15, operates best when kept clean and well lubricated. Accumulation of “fouling,” soot and debris that are a by-product of firing the rifle itself can cause a failure to feed malfunction by slowing or restricting the movement of the bolt carrier group, causing it to fail to cycle completely rearward. Likewise, excess dirt on the lower receiver extension (buffer tube) or a fouled gas tube may have a negative impact on the ability of the system to function. Many gas system issues will produce a particular malfunction causing a short stroke or “short recoil.” This malfunction of gas management systems creates excess back pressure so that the bolt carrier group is not forced through the full rearward cycle as required to feed subsequent rounds. Simply put, dirty weapons often short cycle, either due to friction or binding of the bolt carrier group or because fouling or dirt increases back-pressure on the gas system to a level that cushions the action of the bolt rather than allowing it to cycle backward to its fullest extent. Gas systems are also at risk of not holding enough pressure to properly cycle when they become fouled. Moral of the story, clean, properly maintained rifles rarely short cycle. Dirt, debris, and soot are an invitation for failure to feed malfunctions.\n\nFailure to Fire\n\nFailure to fire is a fairly small category of malfunctions suffered by the AR-15. If a live cartridge is loaded into the weapon, properly chambered, and the operator has pulled the trigger to release the hammer a round may fail to fire. There are two causes of failure to fire that are at fault in the vast majority of this category of malfunction: Either the ammunition itself is defective or the firing pin has not struck the primer hard enough to trigger the initial explosion that ignites the powder inside the casing.\n\nAs always, perform immediate action to attempt to resolve your stoppage. If the malfunction recurs, you will need to complete troubleshooting and address the problem.\n\nIn order to determine which cause has created your failure to fire malfunction, inspect the round which failed to go off. Looking at the primer of the round in question, note the depth of the mark left by the firing pin striking the primer. It may be helpful to compare the primer to that of an empty cartridge that was successfully fired. If the indentation in the primer appears to be of normal depth, the round is defective and should be disposed of safely. If the primer is unmarked or the indentation is significantly shallower than normal, there is a problem with the function of the firing pin.\n\nDiagnosing Firing Pin Faults\n\nLike many other AR-15 malfunctions, failure to fire malfunctions that are due to a firing pin malfunction are frequently caused by a buildup of by-product from the combustion of propellant, or fouling. If you inspect the firing pin and find no obvious defect, your best bet is to clean the weapon being sure to pay special attention to the firing pin, bolt and bolt carrier, as well as the area of the barrel extension locking lug. Obviously, if you do find damage to the firing pin, it will require replacement.\n\nIf you are shooting and experience a situation in which there is unusually weak recoil or a weak “pop” rather than the weapon’s normal report, you should stop immediately and lock the bolt to the rear. DO NOT try immediate action. Once the bolt is locked back move the safety selector to the safe position and take out the magazine. Once the rifle is secure, look into the barrel to see if the bullet is lodged inside. If you can see that the barrel is obstructed your rifle will need to spend some time on the bench, this isn’t a field serviceable malfunction.\n\nFailure to Extract\n\nWhile failure to fire might seem to be a serious malfunction, failure to extract can have much more serious results if the problem is not readily identified. It is possible that an unfired cartridge could be in the chamber. If you were to feed another live cartridge you could create a catastrophic explosion. That’s almost certain to cause the kind of injury that could end your shooting career. Moral of the story: failure to extract can be serious business and should be treated accordingly.\n\nWhen a failure to extract occurs, the bolt and bolt carrier may short stroke, or they may return completely rearward. In either case, a cartridge is left in the chamber. On the next cycle, a live round may be fed and forced into the base of the case that was left behind. This malfunction can be difficult to resolve. The remedy will depend on whether the cartridge is actually stuck in the chamber and if another round has been fed.\n\nLock the BCG to the rear of the action and change the safety selector to safe. Remove the mag and any loose cartridges. Bump the rifle butt stock on a firm surface to dislodge the remaining round.\n\nIf the case has broken or ruptured, it is likely to be stuck in the chamber. If it is:\n\nPlace a cleaning rod in the barrel from the muzzle end. Tape the casing with the cleaning rod to chase it back out of the chamber.\n\nThere are several causes that may be identified for extraction failures:\n\nShort Recoil – see the section above on short stroke due to dirt, debris, and fouling. Fouled or Corroded Chamber – Inspect and clean, then determine if the chamber is damaged or safe to return to service. If it is damaged, the barrel will need to be replaced. Weak or Broken Extractor Spring – replace spring that is no longer serviceable.\n\nFailure to Eject\n\nThe end of cycle malfunction. The cartridge that should have been ejected does not exit through the ejection port, but either stays part way in the chamber or ends up jammed into the upper when the bolt comes forward. Most of the time this malfunction is caused by short stroking (we covered short recoil earlier) or fouling or corrosion of the chamber which cause friction on extraction throwing off extraction and ejection functions.\n\nResolving Failure to Eject Malfunctions\n\nIn most cases, you will find that a simple pull of the charging handle will free the brass that failed to eject, you need to be sure that live round hasn’t been fed either partially or completely into the chamber. If a live round is present, the magazine and all live cartridges will need to be removed before you can release the charging handle. If the failure to eject malfunction is a recurring problem and it is not resolved by giving your weapon a good cleaning and proper lubrication treatment, it is best to just go ahead and replace the ejector and extractor springs as well as the extractor.\n\nAfter looking at the most common stoppages and malfunctions of the AR-15, you really need to take away two things: The AR-15 functions best when kept clean and lubricated, don’t neglect basic rifle hygiene! Good quality AR-15 parts will save you a lot of trouble. Strong springs, components with quality finishes and parts that fit properly are essential for trouble free operation of the AR-15 weapon system.",
  "latent_19723": "That’s what frustrated Casey Dreier, the director of space policy at the Planetary Society, when he read Obama’s op-ed this week. Dreier told me he was glad to hear from Obama on Mars; he believes it’s “fundamentally important that a president is excited about space.” But the Obama administration’s actions haven’t always jibed with its goals for Mars, he said.\n\n“It’s almost like he’s talking about a different NASA,” Dreier said.\n\nIn his $17.7 billion budget proposal for NASA fiscal year 2013, Obama asked Congress for about $1.2 billion for the space agency’s planetary sciences division, which builds and operates all robotic missions in the solar system, including the orbiters and landers that have gone to Mars. That represented a 20 percent cut to the division’s budget from the year before. The reduction forced NASA to withdraw from a joint project with the European Space Agency that launched an orbiter and a lander to Mars earlier this year. “We are having to make tough decisions, because these are tough economic times,\" NASA chief Charlie Bolden said when the budget request was released in early 2012. \"We are doing all that we can to be fiscally responsible.\"\n\nCongress responded by putting more money back in; the Senate proposed $100 million more than Obama’s request for planetary sciences, and the House proposed over $200 million. The final number came to $1.3 billion. In the years since, Congress has appropriated more than Obama has requested, and lawmakers restored 2013 funding levels by fiscal year 2016.\n\nLawmakers have also appropriated more funds for the Space Launch System (SLS), the rocket Congress told NASA to build in 2010, which is supposed to launch astronauts on a journey to Mars. Experts say the government would be better off using reusable rockets produced by commercial companies instead of pouring millions of dollars into one they can’t use again. The Obama administration has proposed cuts to the SLS, which have faced criticism from Republican lawmakers whose home states support NASA jobs. “This administration cannot continue to tout plans to send astronauts to Mars while strangling the programs that will take us there,” said Lamar Smith, a Texas congressman and the chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, when Obama released his proposal in February. Smith has also criticized the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM)—the administration’s plans to lasso an asteroid and bring it into the moon’s orbit, where astronauts can visit it, by the mid-2020s—calling it a “distraction” from NASA’s Mars goals.\n\nBut Obama’s legacy in space policy will not be the SLS, or even the Mars mission he describes as “the next chapter of America’s story in space.” The president has presided over an unprecedented expansion of partnerships between government agencies and commercial entities over space technology. Obama has requested more and more each year in funds for NASA’s commercial spaceflight program, which invests in private companies that are designing launch systems—like SpaceX and Boeing—to carry astronauts to the International Space Station, a capability NASA lost when the shuttle program ended.",
  "latent_19825": "MANHATTAN — The chandeliers that hang from the ceiling in the Gansevoort Hotel on Park Avenue match David Ortiz’s shirt. Both are very purple, but the color looks better on the retired slugger than it does in the gaudy lobby. Prince might as well have started designing this room and then given up halfway through the process.\n\nIt’s 4:45 p.m. on Tuesday, and Ortiz has just emerged from the elevator after a day spent in one of the hotel’s soulless conference rooms answering reporters’ questions about his new book, Papi: My Story. He looks exhausted. At least that’s the vibe I get from his slumping shoulders; I can’t see his eyes because he has orange mirrored sunglasses on.\n\nAn entourage of suits surrounds Ortiz as he makes his way through the lobby and out the revolving doors, speaking rapid-fire Spanish into his phone. Fans are waiting for him outside, holding out baseballs and pens, yelling his name. His handlers guide him past outstretched arms and into a black SUV that’s waiting on the corner.\n\nThere’s some confusion as Ortiz’s whole team attempts to get into the car at the same time. When everyone is finally situated, Ortiz seems surprised to find me squished between him and a publicist. I wonder if anyone told him I’d be riding along with him to the Barnes & Noble in TriBeCa where he’s about to sign books for two hours.\n\nEither they didn’t or he forgot, because he doesn’t seem thrilled to have to talk to one more person during what he probably thought was going to be 30-minute respite from his media tour. But here we are. He fields the first few questions I ask him about his first year of retirement with short, polite answers.\n\nThen I tell him I’m from Boston.\n\n“Oh, is that right?” His face lights up. At least he smiles big; I can’t see his eyes behind his glasses.\n\nYes, I tell him, and explain that we’ve met before. During the Red Sox’s AL Championship run in 2004, I was a student at a high school down the street from Fenway Park. I skipped soccer one afternoon in October to go down to Yawkey Way with a few friends. We spotted players coming out a back entrance, and I shouted Ortiz’s name through the chain-link fence. He came over, and I realized that while I’d brought a marker, I hadn’t brought anything for him to sign. In a moment of panic I took off my flip flop, shoved it under the fence, and asked him for his signature. He wrote his name on my shoe, and I walked back through Boston barefoot.\n\nOrtiz cracks up.\n\n“That’s probably the weirdest thing I’ve ever signed,” he says. “Though I’ve signed some weird stuff. One time this lady got me signing her leg because she said she was going to get a tattoo. And she did! She tattooed my autograph on her leg! She came back to me the following season and she was like, ‘Look.’”\n\nIt’s almost surprising to me that more people in Boston don’t have Ortiz’s signature on their legs. For Red Sox fans, Ortiz is frozen in time as the guy who helped break the Curse of the Bambino and then stuck around long enough to win two more World Series. He earned god status in New England.\n\nNow, Ortiz spends most of his time filming commercials, promoting his book, teaching his 15-year-old daughter how to drive, planning a move to Miami so his kids can play baseball outside year round, and turning down party invites from his good friend Lil Wayne (retirement is busy).\n\nWhich brings me to the bad news, Sox fans: While you probably miss him at Fenway, he doesn’t really miss being there.\n\n“My teammates and I go a long way back,” he says as we pull onto FDR Drive. “That’s one thing that I miss. That’s the only thing I miss about the game, hanging out with the boys. I played the game for so long that I basically am OK with not playing now.”\n\nOrtiz’s laughs often; it starts with a booming “What?!” or one big “Ha!” and then fades into a low chuckle with a long tail, like a half-life of funniness. He completely cracks up telling me about his recent trip to the Kentucky Derby, where he had the first 11 a.m.-drink of his life (seriously, he swears). Apparently there’s this room near Millionaires Row that’s filled with bottles of fancy bourbon that blew his mind.\n\n“The entry of the secret room is behind this one picture that’s right next to a giant door,” he says. “This lady did something tricky and the door just opened. Boom! I’m like, I need one of those in my house. They tell you before you go in that it’s all-you-can-drink in like five minutes. Everything is perfect in there. They let me stay a little longer because the lady was a fan.”\n\nThat’s the only thing I miss about the game, hanging out with the boys. I played the game for so long that I basically am okay with not playing now.\n\n“Wait, they just put famous people in there and try to get you really drunk?” I ask.\n\n“Yeah, famous people just go in!” He’s laughing again. “There’s no way you can go crazy drinking bourbon, though. Because a couple of them can get you tipsy. But I heard a story while I was there about Sylvester Stallone. He loved the room so much he didn’t wanna leave.”\n\n“Is Sylvester Stallone still in the secret room?” I ask. “Did they just leave him there at the Kentucky Derby?”\n\nOrtiz laughs harder.\n\n“They had to kick him out with security and everything,” he says. “I was like, ‘No way!’”\n\nOnce Ortiz gets going, he doesn’t stop talking — he tells me not to give up on my dreams, that he can’t swim, that he and Daddy Yankee are close, and that it’s good I drink Dunkin’ Donuts (even though I think it’s kind of gross) because I “have to represent my city.” He tells me he’s glad he wrote the book so that he could address questions people ask him all the time — including what playing for Bobby Valentine was like for that disastrous year. He tells me that he doesn’t wear his World Series rings. In fact, he’s not totally sure where they are. He’s pretty sure they’re in a safe.\n\nDo I know that World Series rings are smaller than Super Bowl rings? I don’t, so Ortiz tries to show me by gesturing to his huge, diamond-encrusted watch — which matches his massive diamond earring — to indicate the size of a football players’ rock. He adds that “his boy Brady” (Tom, that is) doesn’t wear his championship rings, either.\n\nSpeaking of his boys, Ortiz talked to another one, Isaiah (Thomas, that is), before the Celtics won Game 7 against the Wizards.\n\n“Isaiah told me this,” Ortiz says. “He says, ‘Papi, I promise you we’re gonna win this. You can put it down: I promise you we gonna win it.”\n\n“It’s hard being a Boston sports fan,” I say sarcastically.\n\n“We know that Boston is a big city of sports,” Ortiz says. “Sports mean a lot to people over there. Boston always pulls the best out of you. That’s how I feel about Boston.”\n\nBut Boston doesn’t always give the best back. Fans at Fenway recently called Orioles outfielder Adam Jones the N-word and threw peanuts at him on the field. Ortiz stops laughing and shakes his head when I bring this up.\n\n“Adam, that’s my boy, man,” he says. “Adam is a very, super nice guy. He’s very emotional, and you get a couple knuckleheads out there trying to be smart-asses, saying things they shouldn’t, and it’s frustrating.”\n\nOrtiz says he never experienced racism when he played in Boston. Maybe that’s because he was Our Guy, a local hero. But he insists that “Boston ain’t like that,” and that most people there are “nice and humble.” He also knows, however, that these experiences other players have are very real and very upsetting.\n\n“Now, you know, I had a couple players saying that’s how they feel when they come to Boston,” he says. “You know they have their reason to say it. I don’t see that in Boston — I never experienced anything like it, but on the other hand, planet Earth is jam-packed with stupid people.”\n\nWe’re pulling up to the bookstore now, where a line of people wearing No. 34 jerseys stretches down the block and around the corner from the entrance. Ortiz grins; he might be used to it, but this never gets old. We drive around to a loading dock entrance in an attempt to sneak the star in undetected, but one wily little kid somehow manages to sneak in behind the SUV.\n\nOrtiz’s people start to shoo the boy away, but Ortiz tells him to come over. He takes a selfie with him.\n\nOne of the guys running the event is almost half Ortiz’s height. They look somewhat similar, so Ortiz starts calling him “Little Papi.” Little Papi and the rest of the entourage follow Big Papi as he swaggers through the underbelly of this New York City mall as though he were walking up to the plate to hit a grand slam.\n\nWe reach the door of the Barnes & Noble. Ortiz takes a deep breath, says he hopes his hand doesn’t cramp up, and enters the room to screams and applause.\n\nEach fan approaches the signing table with a different story. Some thank him for their childhoods. One tells him he’s the reason her son got back into baseball after being diagnosed with type I diabetes, another tells him he inspired her in her fight against cancer. Some ask him to say hi to their parents on the phone. Some cry. At least three fans’ hands are shaking so badly as they try to snap selfies with him that they have to ask the person in line behind them to take the picture.\n\nMany of them say things like, “Thank you for everything you did for Boston.” One guy comes up to the table and tells Ortiz he clerked for the judge who presided over the trial of the Boston Marathon bomber.\n\n“Thank you for speaking for us,” the man says. Ortiz smiles and shakes his hand and tells him of course. An hour before in the car, Ortiz told me that he didn’t realize what he’d said — “This is our fucking city!” — until the clip of his speech at Fenway after the 2013 bombings went viral afterwards.\n\n“I was like oh, ah, did I, ah, really say that?” He laughs again. “But I was angry, man. I can’t tell you right now, I was so mad.”\n\nI watch Ortiz sign books for an hour and 45 minutes. Not once does he show signs of flagging. He’s still wearing his orange shades, but he’s so effervescent that it doesn’t ever seem strange: it’s just what he does. He’s especially happy to talk to little kids and people who come up to him speaking Spanish — “my man!” He spends extra time with a little girl in a wheelchair, with the cancer survivor, with a young man wearing a Dominican Republic World Baseball Classic shirt.\n\nBut he never gives less than all of his attention to anyone in line. He appears to understand that what might be one handshake in a million to him is the greatest grasp of someone else’s life. That a flip flop he forgot he signed 12 years ago becomes a prized possession. That even in retirement, he represents all of baseball and all of Boston to the people who love him.\n\nAside from playing baseball, this — being something bigger than himself, the beating heart inside the memory of a spectacular era — seems to be what Ortiz was born to do.\n\nWith a half hour left, one of the Barnes & Noble employees comes over to him.\n\n“Do you want to stand up and stretch?\" she asks. Ortiz looks at the line of people in front of him, each one clutching the picture of his face that graces the cover of Papi.\n\n“No,” he says, reaching for the next book and readying his pen. “I’m good.”",
  "latent_20000": "The Edward Snowden affair confirms a long held suspicion, that a global estate is real and is here. 2013 = 1984\n\nThe creation of the concept of The State was a response to two key struggles in politics, philosophy and humanity.\n\nFirst, 1200 years of scholasticism (Aristotelian philosophy mixed with Catholic religion), where that in matters of faith, knowledge and science, The Church and the Pope where above every Kingdom, or Lord of the land beliefs. Anything on the contrary was heretic, and in contradiction to our Almighty Lord wishes. Clearly, in this doctrine The Church, had supranational powers, it could dictate and indirectly controlled the knowledge of the world, and the access to it for the individual. It also had an immense apparatus or representation and bureaucracy in all Catholic Kingdoms, in addition to war against the infidels, and conversion to the Catholic faith, all of which needed to be funded by countries outside Rome. Not taxation as such but the closest to it. This was a dark time for humanity and for the faith as well.\n\nSecond, once liberated from the Church through the Reformation, and just before the Enlightenment, Kings were happy to have complete control of their lands with sovereignty even to head the Church of their country, and be the first true head of The State. But, this was too much power on a single person, and as predictable from the past, it turned into Tyranny and despotic government. All not unbearable or new to men history, but this time different in the sense that the Reformation, and the possibility of thinking different, unleashed the creative power of reason over faith, with science philosophy (physics is relatively modern term), mathematics, and logic helping greatly to start taming nature, and creating commerce benefits of a scale never seen before. Here, the Kings (Britain as main example), demanded taxation of these benefits to afford their constant war efforts, however this time the new class of creative citizens demanded government representation in return. Parliament and the modern system of check and balances in the form of three powers was born (KIng, Parliament, Courts).\n\nSo, the struggles that created the modern State were from the Global ideology domination, to a country one, and then eventually to an individual representation in their Government, while allowing for individual freedom in the process. Commerce and science were hand in hand, the State was not as big as a Empire (or supranational Church), but also not as small as a single city-state (Athens, Sparta). Wars were also smaller than crusades (faith against faith) but bigger than local city to city wars, with an escalation in modern times that became quite scary. In a way, the State was the best compromise we could reach at the time to liberate from Church and acquire limited powers of representation. Indirectly, the Enlightenment fathers (Descartes, Locke, Hume), assumed that individual freedom and diversity of thinking was required, for reason to advance, but the State control needed to bound those efforts together for the building of commerce and Empire at a grand scale.\n\nNow back to modern times\n\nTechnological dependent living is reaching critical mass. Once again humanity have two different routes to follow.\n\nThe uncertain one, unproven and probably risky, of a city state interconnected Global collection of governments. Now possible due to advances in communication, logistics, and computational powers. The dream of Athens of a real democracy is closer in the Wikipedia, Linux or Internet examples than ever in history. Uncontrolled by a State, aggregated from the individuals. The compromise will not be necessary anymore, the current State is abolished, the local city ruling is adopted again. Big Global problems tackled from aggregation of localities, many potential to fail but at a smaller scale. Even commerce becomes more democratic as there will be no room for big corporations to lobby big governments (State) as there will be none. Fierce competition, real competition, not the ruling of a few.\n\nThe other one, the current one. A Global State, one we didn’t vote for or even are a citizen of, but still control all of our movements. One where technology is a means to control not to liberate, where on the premise of our defense liberties are enslaved. One where the world becomes a big game, where the citizens are only players but not allow to design or change. Not even close to a democracy, although it calls itself one. Commerce is for the few winner takes all corporations, that diligently supplied the data of the citizens in exchange for protection of the State. This path includes a long period of indoctrination of the new religion of the State, for its protection, and for the risk of war, and protection of big powers of commerce. Similar to the old Church, hey?…maybe this time to be borne more than 1200 years\n\nEdward Snowden, is just the tip of the Iceberg. No one can say anymore they don’t know what’s happening. Many times before humanity has lost the compass of what is good for it, losing the connection between the ends and the means. The State was not an end, just a means for stability and reason of the individual to spread. It seems clearly lost now, can we steer it back?\n\nWe created the State. Uncreate we need now. – Perhaps, that’s what Edward started.",

  "latent_20202": "In September, the United Nations released a report confirming that surface-to-surface rockets carrying sarin gas had indeed struck Ghouta. But it was the shaky, fuzzy videos—carried by almost every Western news channel—that captured the world’s attention. Never before have we been so dependent on courageous citizens, rather than professional journalists, for what we know about a war. The motives of these amateur reporters, though, are varied and complex and often difficult to discern.\n\nSyria is now the most dangerous country in the worldfor reporters: According to the Doha Centre for Media Freedom, at least 114 journalists have died there since the spring of 2011. Among the dead are seasoned correspondents like the American Marie Colvin, who was killed in Homs in 2012, and freelancers like the Frenchman Olivier Voisin, who was wounded in February near Idlib and later died in Turkey. Meanwhile, 16 foreign journalists are officially missing, along with an untold number of fixers and translators. Because of voluntary media blackouts—enforced to avoid encouraging would-be kidnappers—the real number is almost certainly higher.\n\nAs the conflict continues, Syria is becoming more dangerous still. By one estimate, there are now more than 1,000 rebel groups operating in the country, some secular and some—such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIS—decidedly jihadist. Regime forces have pushed back the rebels in key areas, and the Free Syrian Army, or FSA, is often unable to protect reporters as it once did, or ensure safe passage through rebel-held areas. These days, most foreign journalists do only short stints inside Syria—“get in under the radar, get what you need, and get the fuck out before you get kidnapped” is how one photographer put it.\n\nThere are exceptions: The veteran BBC correspondent Jeremy Bowen traveled through Syria for weeks. (He has since left.) And the Turkish border area has no shortage of optimistic freelancers hoping to establish their names. But we are far short of the sustained coverage that informed our understanding of the uprisings in Egypt or Libya.\n\nIn the absence of professionals on the ground, many outlets have been forced to lean heavily on the reports of untrained citizen journalists. The BBC regularly runs photos from activists, as do the Associated Press, Reuters, The New York Times, and CNN. These outlets attempt to evaluate the accuracy of the reports—in Antakya, for instance, Al Jazeera correspondent Anita McNaught assesses amateur video recordings with two Arabic-speaking researchers—or else hedge their veracity.\n\nNot everyone believes such meticulousness is warranted. Kamal Kaddourah, a researcher for England’s Channel 4 News, told me: “I never read anything official. I keep myself pure for the YouTube videos and the Facebook messages.” His voice rose: “I don’t approve of this policy of skepticism—it gets me upset when people try to verify a video of an air strike or a dead child. These are people filming their own tragedies. They didn’t make it for fun. They’re not making it up.”\n\nStill, real videos of real tragedies can be edited, redubbed, and repurposed. A few months ago, a video depicting the chainsaw decapitation of two men began making the rounds online. An Arabic voice-over identified the men as rebels and the executioner as a regime soldier. It later emerged that the video was of the gangland slaying of two Mexican drug cartel members. And in one of the most blatant muck-ups, last year the BBC posted a photograph on its homepage showing hundreds of corpses wrapped in white sheets. The BBC obtained the photograph from unnamed “activists,” who claimed it had been taken in the village of Houla. Although U.N. inspectors later found 92 bodies in Houla, the image had actually been taken in 2003, near Baghdad. “Somebody,” the original photographer, Marco Di Lauro, wrote on his Facebook page, “is using my images for anti-Syrian propaganda.”\n\nThe Syrian media landscape has become a proxy battle for forces throughout the Middle East, just like the conflict itself. In the Turkish border area, there are independent organizations like the one Wassim works for, there are FSA-aligned outlets, and there are deep-pocketed operations backed by foreign interests—all flooding YouTube and Facebook with competing versions of the uprising. “I learned very early on not to immediately trust everything I heard,” said McNaught. “For me, it’s about getting a feel for who is reliable—sussing out who the real bullshitters are. And it’s about constantly cross-referencing. OK, this person tells you this. Well, let’s talk to five other people, and see what facts they have in common, and when you’ve got an overlap, maybe you’ve got something.”\n\nBefore the revolution, Wassim made leather purses, which he sold at a stall in a Homs souk. Like many young Syrians, he was not political; being political only brought imprisonment, torture, or death. Then came the popular uprisings in Libya, Yemen, and Syria itself. Wassim and his friends spent many evenings tracking the latest developments on the radio.\n\nOn March 25, after afternoon prayers, Wassim joined a protest. Swept up in the moment, he held up his Nokia cell phone and took a picture. Later, he was arrested and thrown into jail. “It was useful for me,” Wassim told me. “I started to meet other activists, other journalists.” Upon his release—he served a month—he was introduced to the brother of the leader of the Syrian Media Center, a start-up operation with a presence in Homs; the SMC provided him with a Canon camera. He took to roaming the city, filming crumpled buildings, annihilated schools, and shattered hospitals. Last year, Wassim was one of several Syrian citizen journalists to receive training from a U.S.-based nonprofit. (For security reasons, the nonprofit requested that it not be identified by name.) He was taught how to use time stamps and how to frame photographs with prominent landmarks so they could be verified.\n\nWassim couldn’t stay in one place for long—packing a few changes of clothes and his camera, he moved from apartment to apartment. At one point, masked men stormed his family’s house and, failing to find him, carted his little brother off to jail for a month instead.\n\nIn February, an employee of the nonprofit that trained Wassim received a video from him showing a rocket shrieking up toward the lens, followed by darkness. She thought Wassim was dead. But two months later, he resurfaced, having bribed regime troops to allow him passage out of Homs and paying a second bribe to enter Turkey.\n\nThe SMC survives on the donations of businessmen inside Syria and in the diaspora—enough to fund its activities and stock the pantry, but not enough to pay Wassim. For the foreseeable future, he plans to shack up at the office.\n\nJournalism, it seems, has afforded him a certain prestige. Most of the citizen journalists I met were of a very specific type: early to late twenties, with carefully coiffed or tousled manes, glumly charismatic. Like the rebel fighters who are revered in many parts of Syria and the Turkish border areas, the citizen journalists, too, are viewed as heroes of the revolution.\n\nIn May, a pair of car bombs were detonated in Reyhanli’s main square, which is filled with food stands, banks, and small markets. Fifty-one people were killed, and hundreds more injured. Officially, the Turkish government blamed the attacks on twelve Turks sympathetic to Assad, but most Syrians believe it was a regime operation to warn Turkey against involvement in the war. Reyhanli has little protection against future threats: In five days, I saw only two police officers.\n\nBut the recent chaos in Reyhanli also partly explains its appeal to citizen journalists. They blend in with the deluge of refugees and can cross the border without a passport with relative ease. All the while, they’re able to take advantage of the reliable Internet connection and cheap rent.\n\nOne day, I paid a visit to the four full-time members of the Consolidated Media Centre of the Free Syrian Army (CMCFSA), who live in unmolested squalor on the ground floor of a dingy apartment complex. I was greeted by Fadi, the pompadoured leader of the organization, and shown to a smoky bedroom. This was where Fadi slept and also where most of the organization’s editing was done. On a cluttered desk, alongside a pack of Gauloises-Legeres and a silver Zippo, sat three battered Toshiba laptops; a Nikon hung from the shutters of the only window. A rebel fighter was curled up on the floor, wrapped in a red blanket and snoring loudly.\n\nFadi has 30 reporters in Syria, and I asked how he knew he could trust them. He explained that reporters rarely come to him—usually, he receives recommendations from other activists. These informants are unpaid, which presumably increases their susceptibility to bribes, but Fadi insisted he had never been duped.\n\nThe CMCFSA journalists travel with the soldiers, usually dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, or in camouflage like the fighters. They upload their footage at night, assuming they can find a decent Internet connection. Then Fadi and his colleagues edit the videos and post them to the cmcfsa Facebook page or YouTube channel.\n\nMost of the videos center on the exploits of the FSA. Rebel fighters weave through the dense Idlib brush, Kalashnikovs hanging from their necks. Fadi told me that the media had come to rely on the CMCFSA to help track the rebels’ movements. “I want to show the world what’s happening in my country,” he said. However, CMCFSA's main Facebook page is in Arabic, and since it cannot afford a translator, its audience is necessarily limited.\n\nTaking a hard drag on his Gauloises, Fadi told me that the CMCFSA ad recently received a donation of 40,000 Turkish liras, or $20,000. But instead of upgrading his media equipment, he had channeled the money to the FSA, which had used it to buy new gear.\n\nHe added that, when he accompanied the rebels, the high-zoom lens on his camera had been used to pick out snipers at a regime checkpoint. “We guide the rebels on how to fight,” he said, “or how to make an operation. If they want to storm a regime checkpoint, we give them the video of another successful operation, so they can imitate it.” Fadi described himself as a journalist, but what his organization was doing appeared, in many cases, closer to military intelligence gathering.\n\nI asked if he had been armed during his time with the rebels. He brought his pointer fingers together. “Only with a pistol,” he said.\n\nThe next day, I hopped a southbound bus from the city center. At one point, the man to my right embarked on a long tirade in Arabic, punctuated by the English word “America,” which he spat out like an olive pit. My fixer, a Syrian I’ll call Sami, translated: “America has destroyed the entire world, and now it won’t intervene in Syria, so that will be destroyed, too.” I heard this complaint often in Reyhanli: The United States meddles too much, but in Syria it was not meddling enough. (Sami took these encounters in stride: Once, in a shared taxi to the border, when a man interrogated me about Israel’s influence on U.S. politics, Sami interjected: “What, did you confuse Matt with John Kerry?”)\n\nSami was himself a former citizen journalist. A year ago, he took two sniper bullets, one in the shoulder and one in the eye. He’d traveled to Turkey for surgery, which left his eye intact, but unseeing. Among rebel media groups, the injury was a badge of honor, helping to earn us access to organizations that otherwise might have shut their doors in my face.\n\nThat day, we had arranged to visit the offices of Nashet, one of the best-funded citizen-media organizations. The scene could not have been more different from the one in Fadi’s bedroom—there were flatscreen televisions on the wall, SLR cameras on the desks, and enough Sony camcorders to supply the newsroom of an American daily. Ten young men sat in a white-walled suite, simultaneously monitoring their laptops and the televisions.\n\nNashet—“active,” roughly, in Arabic—is housed in the same building as the Syrian group Ahl Al Athar, a well-known Syrian charity that comprises both religious education and military wings and is a prominent player in the opposition. According to Thomas Pierret, a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and the author of a book on Syria, Ahl Al Athar is funded by a private Kuwaiti association called Renaissance of the Islamic Heritage.\n\nNashet’s spokesman, Bilal Mohammed, told me that Nashet operated separately from Ahl Al Athar. But the separation did not appear to be total. Next door to the media center was a room full of grim-faced, bearded religious educators in white jellabiyas; down the hall, camouflaged revolutionaries were drinking coffee. While I watched, educators and soldiers ducked into the media center to chat with the editors, and vice versa.\n\nMohammed (a pseudonym) forbade the use of a recorder, but he answered my questions in a straightforward manner. He told me that Nashet has 300 reporters in cities across Syria. Nashet often highlights the good deeds of the opposition. Its videos show the distribution of food and milk to starving families, a flour-making factory in Aleppo, rebel-led crews fixing downed electricity wires.\n\nOne of the reporters changed the channel on a nearby television to CNN. “Every Western media organization had an agenda,” said Mohammed. “CNN is always talking about ISIS, Al Nusra, Islamists, Al Qaeda. But they never talk about humanitarian aid.”\n\nEarlier, when I had asked Mohammed what he wished to see in Syria, he had answered quickly: “A modern Islamic state.” But when I pointed out that Nashet also had an agenda, the room grew hushed and tense. “CIA,” a reporter sitting behind me whispered accusingly. Sami motioned me to leave. Outside, he remarked, “You can’t have that kind of place if you don’t have a backer with a big agenda.”\n\nMohammed declined to tell me where Nashet’s money comes from, but it seems likely, given the quality of the equipment and the large staff, that it comes from the same place as the money for Ahl Al Athar: Kuwait, a majority Sunni country, which has an interest in seeing Assad toppled and replaced by a Sunni government.\n\nWhich is why it may be so important to Nashet to highlight the benevolence of the Sunni-led opposition, while playing down its less savory aspects. The same goes for an operation like the Jordan-based Al Hurria, which recently opened a large outpost in Reyhanli.\n\nOne experienced Western journalist told me that because of such influences, she had ceased to rely on citizen journalist reports altogether. “The danger here is that we might start thinking we can trust these videos, though we don’t understand the context in which they’ve been produced.”\n\nOf all the citizen reporters I met, Jameel Salou was the closest to a traditional journalist. He was also the only one to encourage me to use his real name. “I have nothing to hide,” he told me.\n\nSalou, who is 33, had served several stints in jail. In 2000, he and some friends were arrested for running a popular news website, Eye on Syria. They spent five years in Sednaya Prison, where Salou was beaten so badly by the guards that he lost sight in his left eye. Later, he was falsely accused of planting a bomb in a Damascus square and held captive by a branch of the military security services for 40 days. “Before we went to jail, we hated the regime and we hated its corruption,” Salou, who is slouchy and round with thinning black hair, told me. “After being in jail, we wanted to try hard to topple it.”\n\nIn 2010, Salou reopened Eye on Syria, recruiting activists he had met in Sednaya. But in 2011, the office was shelled and all of the equipment was destroyed, so Salou set up a new operation called the Free Syrian News Agency.\n\nHe has since built a large network of unpaid informants. Using cheap Sony Cyber-shot cameras, they have documented the spread of the fighting from Damascus toward Aleppo and Homs. He is perhaps best known for his precise documentation of the Ghouta chemical attack, where he and 13 colleagues were able to identify many of the victims long before the United Nations arrived on the scene.\n\nAlthough many of his colleagues cover the revolution only from the rebel side, Salou insists on broadcasting rebel misdeeds as well those perpetrated by the regime. When a rebel unit was accused of summarily executing Syrian army soldiers, the Free Syrian News Agency carried a report on the alleged crime.\n\nLast year, Salou held a conference for female revolutionaries in the city of Rakka. The site of the conference was controlled by the opposition, but the fact that women were included rankled members of ISIS, who later grew angry with Salou for his efforts to tally the number of regime soldiers killed by rebels. Salou was arrested for the third time in his life, although “kidnapped” may be a more accurate term, since ISIS has no authority to arrest anyone. He was released only when an FSA commander intervened on his behalf.\n\nIn July, Salou fled Syria for the Turkish city of Antakya with his wife and children. He has received death threats, and in Reyhanli, where he travels regularly for work, he said that he has been trailed by ISIS sympathizers. “I’m sentenced to death from both sides,” he said. “By the regime and by ISIS. If either finds me, they will kill me.”\n\nUnlike foreign journalists, who have the option of covering the civil war, many Syrian citizen journalists told me that they felt the war had been thrust upon them—that if they don’t publicize its atrocities, no one will. “Other people might forget, but we can never forget,” Salou told me. “Our duty is to be witnesses.”\n\nOn one of my last afternoons in Hatay, I took the bus back to Reyhanli. The sun had set, and Wassim was beginning his day—sprawled out on his leather couch, smoking his cigarillos and sifting through a glut of incoming videos. Lulu was sitting on his shins.\n\nI asked Wassim if he felt like he was making a difference. He frowned. “In the beginning, I thought that, if I showed people what was happening in Syria, that they’d have no choice but to look,” he said. “And they did. Now there are many videos, every day, of shelling and fighting and sieges and gunfire. It’s too many videos, I think.”\n\nWassim did not exempt himself from blame—after all, he had done his part to flood the market. But he argued that citizen journalists would have to get better at choosing which photographs and videos to run. It was possible, he thought. At the beginning, they had known nothing of journalism—only to point a camera and press upload. “The sad part,” he added, “is that the revolution is so big, and so long, that it is making experts of us all.”\n\nMatthew Shaer is the author of The Sinking of The Bounty.",
  "latent_20269": "The February replacement of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn with Lieutenant General Herbert Raymond McMaster was greeted by the American journalistic and foreign policy establishment with barely restrained glee. In place of the erratic, unsavory Flynn, Donald Trump had chosen “a battle-tested veteran . . . considered one of the military’s most independent-minded officers,” in the words of one report in the New York Times. “McMaster,” wrote Fred Kaplan in Slate, “is widely viewed as the Army’s smartest officer”—someone who “has made a career of speaking truth to power.” McMaster was everything Flynn was not: calm, self-effacing, and, crucially, an intellectual. Here at long last was a true scholar-warrior, a man who rejected the bizarre conspiracy theories and apocalyptic obsessions that were guide and mantra for Flynn, Steve Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, and Trump’s other unsavory foreign policy mediocrities. McMaster’s many supporters in government, journalism, and the nonprofit sector hoped that the decorated veteran could, at last, rationalize Trump’s foreign policy. With McMaster calling the shots, the American Century—and the American empire that undergirded it—could continue well into the future.\n\nUntil earlier this week, it seemed that the advocates of US global dominance had good reason to be reassured. McMaster is a passionate champion of our foreign policy consensus: he believes that the American empire is a force for good in the world and appears ready to do whatever he can to defend its international standing. And he is a talented manager able to synthesize large amounts of information into easily digestible lessons—a useful skill in an administration led by a Twitter-addicted reality TV star.\n\nBut as the furor over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s complicity in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey has revealed, the regime, person, and policy “agenda” of Donald Trump have made it virtually impossible for even dedicated public servants to impose order on chaos. Instead of rationalizing the Trump Administration, people like Rosenstein and McMaster have been sucked into its morass. On Tuesday night, McMaster found himself standing outside the White House, visibly uncomfortable and reading carefully drafted legalese that would be contradicted by the President a few hours later. McMaster had been forced into a position he has been unwilling to occupy throughout his long career: political operative. He is not particularly good at this job.\n\nThat McMaster has been swallowed up by an administration that he was perhaps uniquely suited to reform is an extraordinary irony. Now derided by the very same people who praised his appointment, McMaster is beginning to lose the credibility that got him the job. Slate’s Kaplan recently published an article titled “The Tarnishing of H.R. McMaster”; in Politico, Jack Shafer has claimed that McMaster is now “diminished when measured by his own standards”; the journalist Tom Ricks told Shafer that McMaster might very well have lost the trust of the military, which “may never welcome him back in.” Short of a spectacular reversal of fortune, McMaster’s career, and perhaps even his place in history, has been irrevocably stained.\n\nWhat does H.R. McMaster believe? I’ve spent the last couple of months reading everything he has published since 1991 that I could find; what emerges from these texts is somewhat paradoxical. On one hand, McMaster has been willing throughout his career to critique fellow officers for placing too much faith in military technology. On the other hand, McMaster’s views about the United States’ role in the world are highly traditional: he believes the nation presently confronts existential challenges that, because they threaten the values of “civilized peoples,” must be annihilated. For all his supposed intellectual independence, McMaster clearly and unquestioningly embraces the premises that have supported the American empire since 1945. The fact that such a perspicacious officer could endorse such an outdated vision of the world suggests that not only the Trump Administration, but also the entire culture of the American national security establishment, is broken.\n\nH.R. McMaster first rose to prominence during the Gulf War, when in February 1991 a small armored unit he commanded destroyed astonishing numbers of Republican Guard armored forces in the Battle of 73 Easting. Over the course of two days, McMaster’s unit demolished dozens of Iraqi vehicles, killed scores of enemy soldiers (and captured many more), and suffered no casualties. To many interested observers, the Battle of 73 Easting was a clear demonstration of the power of the post–Cold War American military, whose superior technology would enable the United States to do what it wanted in a unipolar world.\n\nBut McMaster learned a different lesson from the battle. For him it revealed that in addition to technology, one of the most critical combat resources was independence of mind. As his unit pressed the advance against disorganized Iraqi forces, McMaster refused to halt his attack at a previously agreed-upon location, which enabled his unit to annihilate the enemy. A number of his superiors bristled at his insubordination, but it didn’t matter: McMaster had discovered that unorthodox behavior could lead to battlefield success.\n\nNews of McMaster’s victory spread quickly throughout the military. As Alex Roland, a professor of military history at Duke University, put it, by the Gulf War’s end McMaster was seen as a “war hero, the brilliant and daring young captain [who] dominat[ed] the famous Battle of 73 Easting.” But instead of continuing in a command position—the traditional means through which officers rose through the ranks—McMaster chose to pursue the study of military history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. “Promotion boards,” in the words of one retired officer, “were not impressed with doctorates or teaching assignments,” and McMaster must have known that taking time away from troop duties could jeopardize his career. For him the risk was worth it.\n\nMcMaster’s dissertation analyzed the Joint Chiefs of Staff’s failure to speak out against President Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara’s tendentious remarks to the public and Congress regarding the course of the Vietnam War and the military’s support for US strategy. As with the choice to attend graduate school in the first place, McMaster’s dissertation topic suggested that here was an unorthodox—perhaps even transgressive—officer. Within the Army, the JCS’s Vietnam-era mistakes were taboo subjects; one of McMaster’s PhD committee members even advised him not to focus on this topic for fear it would “rui[n] his career.” Nevertheless, McMaster believed that if the Army was to serve as a force for good in the world, it needed to learn from past mistakes—career goals be damned.\n\nDereliction of Duty (1997), the book that emerged from McMaster’s dissertation, is the foundational text of his worldview. In it, McMaster laid out the argument he had intuited in the Iraqi desert: that technological might was not the key to military victory. This critique would animate him for the next twenty years.\n\nThroughout Dereliction of Duty, McMaster took particular aim at McNamara’s strategy of “graduated pressure,” which was premised upon the assumption “that [the North Vietnamese] would respond ‘rationally’ to precisely controlled military stimuli.” McNamara believed that the United States could “communicate” with the North Vietnamese by methodically increasing military pressure. But this strategy, McMaster argued, reflected the dangerous fantasies of “economists, managers, and systems analysts,” whose lack of empathy prevented them from appreciating “that Hanoi’s commitment to revolutionary war made losses that seemed unconscionable to American white-collar professionals” acceptable. Though the US military was able to employ weaponry far superior to the North Vietnamese, it could not win the war at a tolerable cost. McMaster went so far as to claim that McNamara’s love of technology perverted his thinking by encouraging him to confuse tactical with strategic success—that is, to confuse success in battle with success in war. McMaster’s conclusion was that war was to some degree an intellectual problem, in which bad ideas resulted in bad strategy.1\n\nAfter teaching history at West Point from 1994 to 1996, McMaster returned to troop duties. His next major work, Crack in the Foundation (2003), which was released by the US Army War College’s Center for Strategic Leadership eight months after the United States invaded Iraq, applied Dereliction of Duty’s lessons to the modern American military. The paper’s message was simple:\n\nThe intellectual foundation for building tomorrow’s military force rests on the unfounded assumption that technologies emerging from the “information revolution” will lift the fog of war and permit US forces to achieve a very high degree of certainty in future military operations.\n\nMcMaster disparaged the so-called “Revolution in Military Affairs” (RMA) that after the Gulf War had captured the hearts and minds of many military officers and defense thinkers. According to RMA advocates, “American technological superiority . . . made possible a new way of waging war” that was predictable, efficient, humane, and cheap. McMaster rejected this argument as naive, insisting that as long as war remained human—as long as it was informed by culture, politics, will, psychology, and emotion—no one would be able to forecast its course or confidently limit its destruction. War, McMaster affirmed, was not “an engineering or business management problem that will succumb to systems analysis, reasoned judgment, and the application of superior technology.” This was the misapprehension that had doomed the US effort in Vietnam and, due to the advocacy of RMA’s champions (such as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who is not named in the report), now threatened to doom US efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSoon after Crack in the Foundation’s publication, McMaster was provided with the opportunity to put his argument into practice. In 2004, he assumed command of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, which in 2005 was charged with carrying out counterinsurgency (COIN) operations in the small city of Tal Afar in northern Iraq. By this point in the war, anti-western forces had coalesced into an insurgency, and Tal Afar was a critical node in the insurgency’s strategic network. By the time McMaster left the city in 2006, however, he had established an exceptional degree of control over it—a testament to his tactical brilliance.\n\nMcMaster’s theory of counterinsurgency was premised upon the notion that ordinary people desired security, respect, and municipal services above all else. If a foreign military force was able to provide these, it would be possible to reduce sectarian tensions by helping previously warring groups achieve political accommodation with one another. Eventually, US–trained indigenous police and government officials could assume responsibility for a pacified city or region, at which point the US military could withdraw.\n\nMcMaster wrote in a 2008 article titled “Learning from Contemporary Conflicts to Prepare for Future War” that before the innovations he introduced in Tal Afar, COIN had been grounded in the short-term strategy of “defeat[ing] networked enemy organizations through attacking leadership and reducing critical capabilities.” But post-McMaster, COIN had become a long-term strategy. Tal Afar had succeeded because soldiers took the time to develop relationships with ordinary Iraqis, learn the local political landscape, and establish the institutional capacity for self-government. For this reason, McMaster avowed that “until civilian departments within the US government expand deployable capabilities in order to establish local governance and rule of law, develop police forces, improve basic services, build institutional capacity, and set conditions for economic growth and development,” the military would have to be prepared to assume these political responsibilities abroad.\n\nYet this approach, while an intellectual advance over RMA and the blind technologism that had dominated the US military since the fall of the Soviet Union, proved hopelessly naïve in the contemporary American context. McMaster’s version of COIN explicitly relied upon a large and years-long commitment to a given region—an enormous financial, materiel, and human burden unlikely to be supported in a political climate increasingly hostile to prolonged foreign entanglements. But COIN wasn’t simply a hard sell for a fatigued public at home: for it to work, the American national security establishment would have to reconceive its priorities and significantly increase funding for the State Department. Like other empires throughout history, the US has made diplomacy less central to its foreign relations than it might otherwise be. McMaster’s desire to militarize diplomacy—or civilianize war—was a clever response to budget realities, but a doomed one: soldiers are not diplomats, and the military does not have the capacity, knowledge, or experience to establish lasting political solutions without civilian aid. For all the success he and his regiment had in Tal Afar in 2005 and 2006, it didn’t and couldn’t last: in 2014, the city was seized by ISIS.\n\nH.R. McMaster is one of the United States’ most astute theorists of modern warfare. Unlike so many other military thinkers, he understands that history is complex, contingent, and irrational, and that no amount of technological superiority could tame the real world’s unpredictable dynamism. He also rightly feels an ethical responsibility to the people who live in countries the United States invaded. So how could he have gotten it so wrong? Why, in spite of his sophistication, did his solutions to the American disasters in Iraq and Afghanistan ultimately fail to produce even medium-term victory?\n\nMcMaster’s intellectual reputation rests on the quality he displayed on the battlefield in 1991, in Dereliction of Duty in 1997, and in Crack in the Foundation in 2003: his commitment to thinking that goes against the grain and troubles colleagues and superiors. The cheers that greeted his appointment in February were predicated on exactly this notion: that McMaster was a tenured radical, an establishmentarian committed to discarding whatever elements of the establishment that needed discarding. Yet McMaster remains a prisoner of ideas formed over half a century ago. He has never once doubted the underlying premises that have guided American foreign policy since World War II. He is unwavering in his belief that the US must continue to serve as the world’s policeman and retain its permanent military mobilization. He has never considered whether the imperial projects undertaken in Iraq and Afghanistan were illegitimate from the start and destined to fail. He has never questioned how Americans’ obsession with security might affect democracy at home. McMaster would have been an adequate, perhaps even excellent, leader if American imperialism had proven to be an unalloyed good. Recent history, though, has demonstrated that ours is a moment that requires a new, post-imperialist understanding of the US’s role in the world. This is something that McMaster is unlikely to provide.\n\nLike so many of his less perceptive peers, McMaster has embraced the flawed assumptions that have been used to justify any number of unwise recent American entanglements. To McMaster, ISIS, Iran, and other Islamic enemies of the United States are equivalent to the Nazis and Soviets, and he insists that the contemporary geopolitical environment is defined— as it was during World War II and the Cold War—by an existential struggle between good and evil. As he said in a 2010 speech,\n\nWe are engaged, as previous generations were engaged, against enemies that pose a great threat to all civilized peoples. As those generations defeated Nazi fascism, Japanese imperialism, and communist totalitarianism, we will defeat these enemies that cynically use a perverted interpretation of religion to incite hatred and violence.\n\nAt the end of this speech, McMaster approvingly quoted President Barack Obama for affirming that “‘evil does exist in the world.’” “The righteous use of violence,” McMaster wrote in a 2014 book review, was a critical means to defeat barbaric enemies like ISIS and Iran.\n\nMcMaster spent a large portion of the last twelve years deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he often witnessed the brutality of ISIS and the Taliban firsthand. These experiences no doubt led him to see in these enemies echoes of previous groups that committed horrific crimes against humanity. But McMaster’s experiences have distorted his analysis of the real threat these organizations pose to US national security. Unlike the Nazis or Soviets, neither ISIS nor the Taliban (nor associated states like Iran) have the institutional or materiel capacity to overwhelm any western power, let alone the United States. Even if these groups are able to carry out the occasional terrorist attack in the United States or Europe, they are simply not existential threats to the west. In an era in which the United States confronts state and nonstate actors who express allegiance to ideologies that will not be eradicated any time soon, McMaster’s logic of absolute war, in which an enemy is not considered defeated until he is annihilated, is in reality a logic of permanent war.2\n\nThe logic of absolute war has proven disastrous since its inception. Dwight Eisenhower, so often invoked in the contemporary foreign policy context as a sage and sane leader, was convinced that the Soviet Union could not be negotiated with, only defeated. This belief may have prevented the Cold War from ending decades earlier than it did: when Eisenhower participated in the 1955 Geneva Summit, he refused to negotiate with the Soviet Union in good faith, forestalling any chance of an early US-Soviet détente. When McMaster publicly paints Iran or Syria as evil in only slightly more shaded terms than David Frum, who wrote George W. Bush’s infamous “axis of evil” speech, he too forestalls any hope of diplomatic engagement with key rivals. Whatever one might think of Iran, it is not Nazi Germany; it is rather a nation with which the United States must deal in the coming years.\n\nThe human cost of the logic of absolute war has of course been more disastrous than the diplomatic one. The overthrow of democratically elected governments in Iran, Guatemala, and Chile; the bombing of Laos and Cambodia; the support for brutal dictators like Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak; the deployment of drones that have killed scores of innocents; and the dropping of the mother-of-all-bombs on Afghanistan—all of these have been undertaken in service of fighting a Manichean war between good and evil. The “righteous” struggle against “enemies that pose a great threat to all civilized peoples” has unquestionably increased human suffering and done a great deal to engender anti-American fervor throughout the world.\n\nIn all his writings, McMaster has never considered why, exactly, our adversaries might detest us. America’s opponents, he has written, “hate us not for anything we have done, but for who we are.” He has repeatedly insisted that soldiers must study history, like he did, yet he has evaded the well-documented story of how generations of western colonialists seized raw materials from the Middle East and installed or supported leaders who oppressed their populations. McMaster has been most interested in the past for the instrumental purpose of improving America’s war fighting capabilities, which has led him to ignore major historical questions seemingly unrelated to this subject. His history is a circumscribed one, rooted in the belief that US hegemony necessarily makes the world a better place.3 This was untrue in the past, and it is manifestly untrue today. In the Middle East alone, US interventions have engendered a humanitarian disaster in Iraq; the rise of ISIS; military dictatorship in Egypt; and civil war in Syria. The time has come for leaders like McMaster to rethink the United States’ world role.\n\nSome critics might argue that, though regrettable, the United States cannot be held responsible for brutally engaging in what the political scientist Hans Morgenthau referred to as the eternal struggle for power and prestige. Yet there is more at stake than geopolitics; the logic of absolute war harms American democracy. Americans’ fears of terrorism, which were engendered and sustained by the logic of absolute war, have encouraged warrantless wiretapping, illegal detention and torture, and increased government secrecy, all of which surrender the very values for which we are supposedly fighting. Moreover, the enormous cost of America’s national defense effort—which according to the Congressional Budget Office consumes approximately one-sixth of all federal spending—has diverted resources from social programs that might restore Americans’ lost sense of community. If Americans persist in believing that everything must be done to defeat ISIS, Iran, and similar groups, there is little doubt that our democracy will continue to suffer.\n\nThough he may have begun his career as an institutional critic, the constraints of America’s bipartisan imperial vision left McMaster with little space for truly independent thought. One of the starkest examples of McMaster’s limited perspective was displayed in a 2013 essay, in which he and two co-authors commended the US Army for “provid[ing] advice and assistance to the Saudi Arabian National Guard’s military schools, brigades, and headquarters for the past 39 years.” McMaster’s praise of US assistance to Saudi Arabia—a vicious dictatorship responsible for reprehensible human rights abuses—is as stark an example of willful moral blindness (and intellectual incoherence) as is possible. When someone lauds Saudi Arabia, it is hard to take his or her claims about US moral superiority vis-à-vis ISIS or Iran seriously. In fact, the only people who seem to get away with such contradictions are members of the American foreign policy elite.\n\nAfter the United States bombed a Syrian airfield in April, McMaster gave an interview to Fox News in which he offered a series of muddled remarks concerning American strategy in the Middle East. When asked whether the United States intended to defeat ISIS or focus on ousting Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, McMaster responded “that there has to be a degree of simultaneous activity as well as sequencing of the defeat of ISIS first.” McMaster’s inarticulateness reflected the strategic confusion of American policy in the Middle East, which has been compounded by the strategic confusion of an administration led by a doddering 70-year old ill-suited for the position in which he finds himself.\n\nFor his part, McMaster remains fixated on ISIS. In a 2016 book review, he described the group’s “control over territory, resources and populations [as] not only a present-day international security problem, but also a multi-generational threat to all civilized peoples.” He also insisted that Americans must understand\n\nISIS not as the disease itself, but as a symptom of a disease [whose eradication] will require not only military operations, but also a long-term, multinational effort combining political, social, diplomatic, intelligence, communications, law-enforcement and economic projects aimed at both denying ISIS its safe haven and support base, and at healing and strengthening fragmented societies so that ISIS or its next manifestation is unable to regenerate.\n\nIt seems McMaster hopes the United States will, finally, fully commit itself to a Middle Eastern occupation. But one wonders why he would consider this a realistic possibility. The Trump era has not seen an increased appetite on the part of American voters for another war in the greater Middle East, and it has always been difficult to imagine how McMaster could have convinced the President to again invade a sovereign nation, or persuaded the American people to occupy Iraq or Syria as they once occupied Germany and Japan. This is even more true after McMaster’s embarrassing public performance this week.\n\nAny perceptive observer of the Trump Administration could have predicted that H.R. McMaster’s impact as National Security Adviser would have been limited—not only because of the competing power centers in the White House or the pervasive influence of Steve Bannon, but also because the overarching quality of the Trump regime is chaos. Even the most careful manager would have been unable to execute serious, long-term plans in an administration dominated by stops, starts, and profound uncertainty.\n\nOne of the most depressing aspects of the Trump Administration is that, despite Trump’s repeated critiques of recent American military interventions, the project of American empire will likely remain unchallenged and undiminished. During the presidential campaign, a number of critics on the left and right argued that Trump’s isolationist rhetoric should be taken seriously—that his disinterest in foreign adventurism and nation-building were genuine. This was probably always a fantasy, but after the bombing of Syria it became provably false. The President’s world tour is unlikely to mitigate the fact that under Trump, US foreign policy is more of the same, only amateurishly executed.\n\nEven if McMaster is pushed out (and reports in various news outlets suggest that Bannon wants him gone, and that Trump himself is unhappy with his performance—apparently the lieutenant general talks too much in meetings), the core of his worldview will still dominate US foreign policy thinking: ISIS and Iran will continue to be viewed as evil, the United States will continue to dedicate itself to never-ending war, and decision makers will continue to feel that they have the right to do most of what they want on the world stage. We cannot know if a bit more independence of thought might have pushed McMaster to contest United States foreign policy or the very notion of American empire. What we do know is that for all of his iconoclasm and perspicacity, McMaster was never a true reformer, but rather an extraordinarily accomplished product of a corroded system.\n\nIf you like this article, please subscribe to n+1.",
  "latent_20428": "SPOILER ALERT: This story contains details of tonight’s episode of Game Of Thrones.\n\nIf you’re searching for an understatement, rock royalty Queen’s “another one bites the dust” could sum up the events of tonight’s Game Of Thrones. But it wasn’t just anyone who bites the dust: it was a King who was killed on the second episode of the blockbuster HBO series’ fourth season. Granted it was a crazed sadistic boy King whom no one besides his mother/sister loved, but it was a death early in the season that most shows would have saved for a finale. However, as fans familiar with the books by George R.R. Martin on which the HBO fantasy drama are based know, the blood soaked Red Wedding that served as the shocking penultimate episode of Season 3 of GoT was just the opening act for the poisoning of Joffrey at the Purple Wedding in tonight’s episode. Joffrey’s death is quickly succeeded by the accusation that his uncle Tyrion Lannister (played by Peter Dinklage) is the murderer and from that, the fallout will follow for the rest of the season – a season that started on April 6 with record high viewership. In short, intrigue and bloodshed have been taken to a whole new level on a show already drenched in both.\n\nRelated:\n\nSpoiler Alert: Was ‘Game Of Thrones’ TV’s Best Offing Ever?\n\n‘Game Of Thrones’ Draws 6.3 Million Viewers To Shocker\n\nDirector Alex Graves, who helmed tonight’s episode and three others for GoT this cycle, spoke with me about “shaking up” the season with the killing of the odious Joffrey so early on. Graves also teased what EPs David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have planned for the rest of Season 4 and what to expect for the season finale, which he also directed.\n\nDEADLINE: A lot of shows would not kill off a major character the second week in to their new season. Pretty unique way to handle things and not something we’ve really seen before on Game Of Thrones.\n\nGRAVES: Well, David and Dan really made a smart choice which is that while they could have drawn it out to the point where Joffrey died later in the season, they were excited about shaking up the way the seasons normally go and really getting off to a bang of a start. And then so much happens in the latter part of the season that is so massive, there’s no way they would have been able to fit it in and to adjust it.\n\nDEADLINE: How do you think fans are going to react to tonight’s show and the killing of Joffrey?\n\nGRAVES: Well, I hope they enjoyed it. I was really glad after the Red Wedding for the first time to find out that Joffrey was killed because it just seemed fair. But I hope that they are surprised and I hope that they are amazed at how much happened in the episode and I hope they can perceive how incredible all of the work that went in to it was.\n\nRelated: HBO’s ‘Game Of Thrones’ Renewed For Fifth & Sixth Seasons\n\nDEADLINE: Unlike the Red Wedding massacre of last season, there was really only one death at the Purple Wedding – though granted, it was a big death.\n\nGRAVES: I think the Purple Wedding was really meant to be different from the Red Wedding. It was a poisoning and the death was very much about what the result of his death will be in the story, which is expansive. And also the fact that after all of the horrific twisted fireworks of Joffrey, somebody got in to that wedding and poisoned him from the inside. And it’s just that simple and it’s just for that devious. And that also plays in to where things are heading.\n\nDEADLINE: What are we going to see as the aftermath of Joffrey’s death now moving forward for the rest of the season?\n\nGRAVES: I think the thing is that like any death in Game of Thrones and Ned Stark’s being a great example, every death is not an end to a story; it is the beginning of a story. Joffrey’s death turns a new page in the book but oh, what a page it turns to. And the season basically starts there and loses total control.\n\nDEADLINE: That’s a pretty big statement for Game of Thrones where the bodies fall fast and the blood flows frequently.\n\nGRAVES: I think that this season is going to be the most exciting season that they’ve ever done. I will say that as somebody who directed 4 out of the 10 episodes this year, episode 2 is the smallest episode I directed. It’s hard to talk more about it without starting to give away things because the spoilers and the secrets in this season are many and are big.\n\nRelated: ‘Game Of Thrones’ David Benioff and D.B. Weiss Plan ‘Dirty White Boys’ As First Feature\n\nDEADLINE: So EPs David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have more surprises planned in Westeros and Essos?\n\nGRAVES: It’s the largest season and most challenging season that they’ve mounted, not only physically and technically. It’s the first of what happens with the actors and the reason for that is that basically the end of a new season is the turning point in the middle of the story and a lot happened.\n\nDEADLINE: Tonight’s episode once again showed us the power that Tywin Lannister (played by Charles Dance) holds over the Iron Throne, even if he lost a grandson King.\n\nGRAVES: On the one hand the Red Wedding has placed Tywin in a place where he has now pretty much won the war for five kings. The Purple Wedding is meant to be a very in-your-face celebration of that fact and the fact that Joffrey took a hit during the wedding is not going to stop Tywin Lannister from gaining ultimate power if he has any say in it.\n\nDEADLINE: So what are we going to see next with Tyrion Lannister? First humiliated by his nephew the King and then accused of his murder, how long are we going to see Peter Dinklage in prison?\n\nGRAVES: Well, you’re going to see things play out between Mr. Dance and Mr. Dinklage throughout the season until the end.\n\nDEADLINE: And there will be a confrontation between the father Tywin and the son Tyrion?\n\nGRAVES: Yeah, there’s a confrontation between the father and son but that’s in the final episode. Episode 10 of the season is, you know, as David and Dan will tell you, it’s the first true finale they’ve ever done and it’s really the episode to end all episodes. It’s the largest episode they’ve ever made.\n\nDEADLINE: Are we going to see some new characters joining this season?\n\nGRAVES: You’ll see Oberyn (a Prince in the House Martell who appeared in the first episode of Season 4 to attend the Purple Wedding) and there’s several new characters but this season is actually very focused on following through with what’s been going on and heading in to a new direction on a scale that I don’t think the audience has any idea is coming.\n\nDEADLINE: The show is getting close to almost completely catching up to George R.R. Martin’s books. Where can we go for the rest of the season and the other two seasons that HBO has renewed the show for?\n\nGRAVES: I have to be careful how I answer that. First of all the show is still in the books and it won’t be out of the books here for another season and hopefully by then the first of the last book will be done. But I can only say that David and Dan and George have it all very well in hand.",
  "latent_20552": "There's a new star coming to Shondaland.\n\nParenthood and Six Feet Under star Peter Krause has landed the male lead in ABC's midseason drama The Catch, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nThe Catch is described as a thriller about Alice Vaughan (The Killing's Mireille Enos), a fraud investigator who is poised to be the victim of a fraud by her fiancé. Between cases, she's determined to find him before it ruins her career.\n\nSee more Broadcast TV's New Shows 2015-16\n\nKrause will take over the role of Kieran Booth from newcomer Damon Dayoub, who played the role in the pilot. The character is described as a successful, longtime con man who lives the good life with other people's money. He's the best at what he does, but viewers have to wonder if he's met his match in Alice.\n\nThe news comes after prolonged negotiations that saw the actor initially turn down the role before he was offered the part a second time. Falling Skies star Noah Wylie was also said to have been considered for the part.\n\nHannibal's Jennifer Schuur penned the script for the ABC Studios drama and executive produces alongside Shondaland's Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers. JulieAnne Robinson also exec produces and directed the pilot, which will now be reshot.\n\nKrause joins a cast that includes Jacky Ido, Jay Hayden, Elvy Yost, Alimi Ballard and Rose Rollins. The part of Kieran's wife — originally played by One Tree Hill's Bethany Joy Lenz — is also being recast.\n\nFor Krause, the role marks his follow-up gig to NBC's beloved Jason Katims drama Parenthood, which wrapped last season following a six-year run. It also marks a departure for Krause, whose Adam Braverman was the upstanding eldest son of the family. The three-time Emmy nominated actor had multiple pilot offers this past season. He is repped by CAA and Jackoway Tyerman.\n\nThe Catch will debut on Thursdays at 10 p.m. following the second-season finale of Shondaland's How to Get Away With Murder.\n\nEmail: Lesley.Goldberg@THR.com\n\nTwitter: @Snoodit",
  "latent_20557": "Sen. Kamala Harris attempts to question former FBI Director James Comey during a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill on June 8. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Image\n\nLast week, when deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein repeatedly refused to answer a question from Sen. Kamala Harris, both Sens. Richard Burr and John McCain essentially shushed her. As my Slate colleague Christina Cauterucci noted of the Twitter reaction at the time, “two long-serving white male legislators working together to stop a new female senator of color from getting an answer to a simple question was not a good look.” On Tuesday, attorney general Jeff Sessions also tried to filibuster the former California attorney general’s questions without properly answering them. And again, the same two white male Senators essentially shushed her.\n\nMost importantly, yet again, the substance of what Harris was asking was incredibly important. Last week, she was trying to get a “yes or no” answer from Rosenstein on whether he’d reinstate a Bush-era special prosecutor policy that would ensure that President Trump couldn’t fire special counsel Robert Mueller. Rosenstein repeatedly refused to answer “yes or no,” and when Harris pressed him that is when her fellow senators shut her up.\n\nIn this hearing, she asked Sessions what was his legal basis for refusing to answer questions about his communications with President Trump. Sessions had essentially been refusing to assert executive privilege—which could be challenged in court and knocked down—citing a “longstanding DOJ policy” for his decision. Harris asked him straight up: What is that policy and did you actually look at it? Again, the witness filibustered and again the questioner was repeatedly interrupted. You can watch a few of those interruptions here:\n\nAnd here’s exactly how that critical exchange went:\n\nHarris: You referred to a longstanding DOJ policy, can you tell us what policy it is that you’re talking about?\n\nSessions: Well, I think most cabinet people as the witnesses you had before you earlier, those individuals declined to comment because we’re all about conversations with the president.\n\nHarris: Sir, I’m just asking you about the DOJ policy you referred to.\n\nSessions: The policy that goes beyond just the attorney general.\n\nHarris: Is that policy in writing somewhere?\n\nSessions: I think so.\n\nHarris: So did you not consult it before you came before this committee knowing we would ask you questions about it?\n\nSessions: Well, we talked about it. The policy is based –\n\nHarris: Did you ask that it would be shown to you?\n\nSessions: The policy is based on the principle that the president –\n\nHarris: Sir, I’m not asking about the principle. I’m asking –\n\nSessions: I’m not able to answer the question.\n\nHarris: When you knew that you would be asked these questions and you would rely on this policy, did you not ask your staff to show you the policy that would be the basis for refusing to answer the majority of the questions that have been asked of you.\n\nMcCain: The attorney general should be allowed to answer the questions.\n\nBurr: Senators will allow the chair to control the hearing. Sen. Harris let him answer.\n\nHarris: Please do.\n\nSessions: We talked about it. And we talked about the real principle that is at stake is one that I have some appreciation for as having spent 15 years in the department of justice, 12 as United States attorney. And that principle is that the Constitution provides the head of the executive branch certain privileges. And that members—one of them is confidentiality of communications. And it is improper for agents of any of the department of any departments in the executive branch to waive that privilege without a clear approval of the president.\n\nHarris: Mr. Chairman, I have asked—\n\nSessions: That’s the situation—\n\nHarris: Mr. Sessions, I asked for a yes or no.\n\nSessions: So the answer is, yes, I consulted.\n\nHarris: Did you ask staff to see the policy?\n\nBurr: The senator’s time has expired.\n\nIt should be noted that Harris did get Sessions on the record stating that he had consulted the policy and that it is a real thing and not just something he made up. He was asked to produce this policy. Now he will hopefully have to do so. If it’s just executive privilege by another name, then maybe that can also be challenged in court. And if we do ever get an answer to any of those questions, it will be thanks in part to Harris’ doggedness.",

  "latent_20622": "Part 1 of 7\n\nIn continuation of the last submission, regarding the list of 20+ connected domains that spread fake news, I looked further into the characteristics of those domains and those submitters on Voat. I am not sure what to expect with this submission, other than presenting my findings and voice my opinions with the data I have collected at hand. You may notice that the archive dates are spread out across a whole week, that is because it was done in bits and pieces.\n\nNotice that this data may be incomplete, as most of the 20+ domains were already offline or wiped, shortly after the last submission. Because of the number of domains involved, I made minimal effort to archive those sites. Lately, I had to resort to the timestamps from the search engine.\n\ntl;dr: a collection of domains, controlled by a small group of users, could be used to spread fake news, bypass spam rule, or track and dox other users. Use vpn, tor, or anon proxies when possible, especially for high profile users.\n\nLet's start by defining the metrics used to flag a domain, along with the submitters. A domain is flagged as suspicious, along with the users involved, if it exhibits one or a combination of the following characteristics:\n\nFirst submission to Voat being too close to domain's registration date: This strongly suggests that the submitter is directly or indirectly affiliated with the domain involved. This submitter either owns the domain or pushes the domain for its owner. Low traffic site recently been updated, closely followed by a submission to Voat: This suggests a weak but similar condition as #1. Site's wayback activity sparsely archived, with submission too close to the archived date: It suggests that the site showed some recent activity. Site's traffic history, followed too closely to the submission date: When a low traffic or barely active site made a submission on Voat, its traffic increases, followed by its decline back to zero or low traffic steady state. Multiple domains sharing the same set of IPs: Sharing IPs is common in shared hosting, but having those domains coincidentally showed up by a user or a small group of users, is not so common. This technique was probably used to circumvent Voat's spam rule, or possibly to disguise something else, such as repackaging of MSM news behind no-name domains.\n\nStatus of domains been investigated:\n\nDomain1 akniinfo.com , taken offline, short-lived.\n\n, taken offline, short-lived.

First submission to Voat, 8 days dated from site's earliest article.\n\nThis list came from previous submission, where the domains were flagged for sharing a subset of identical articles that contained fake news. These domains also showed very short user engagement, suggesting clickbait nature.\n\nSuspects found, evaluated by timestamps associated with domain registration, wayback archives, and site's traffic profile: Kilroy_1962, RussianIvantheCrazy, GizaDog, Dailytacs, yurisrevenge, nogarbagetrashonly, theoldones, Russianbots, Mogumbo, Sw0rdofDamocles, mattsixteen24, and Kippering. I tried to minimize the number of suspects and usually only flagged the first submitter to the domain.\n\nKilroy_1962\n\nRussianIvantheCrazy\n\nGizaDog\n\nDailytacs\n\nyurisrevenge\n\nnogarbagetrashonly\n\ntheoldones\n\nRussianbots\n\nMogumbo\n\nSw0rdofDamocles\n\nmattsixteen24\n\nKippering\n\nLooking further into the suspects, I dumped all of the domains from their submission histories. There were 900+ domains, first sorted by domain names, then by IP addresses. As it was too much work to look at them individually, I only picked those domains that seemed unusual, or domains that shared similar names and/or with the same set of IPs. Many of the domains that were picked showed very similar characteristics as the ones that were previously investigated. They were relatively new domains made it to Voat, with a spike in their traffic histories. Some were strikingly clear to see that they were pushed by specific user. In one specific case, three domains were cascaded together, af-mg.com forwarded to dc-chronicle.com, with dc-chronicle.com's data on thenarrativetimes.org. Very interesting to say the least!!\n\nList of domains picked up from suspects' submissions, that showed very similar behaviour to those of 20+ domains.

Some of those domains pushed fake news, some pushed low quality contents or other bullshits. Some would circumvent spam rule with collection of domains at disposal. This is something that other goats can point out periodically. I am not too worried or concerned about that. But I am in a way concerned with its implications.\n\nCont to part 2: https://voat.co/v/ProtectVoat/3001782/16431060\n\nEdit: sorry about the amount of data being presented...\n\nEdit2: you can see the rest of the data in this thread https://voat.co/v/ProtectVoat/3001782/16431113/10\n\nUpdate1: new domains https://voat.co/v/ProtectVoat/3001782/16593090, thanks to @Mumbleberry",
  "latent_20673": "After a year and a half, the longest long shot in American politics has been inaugurated as President of the United States. Republican businessman Donald Trump has officially inherited the White House and the executive branch from Barack Obama, a two-term President and former United States Senator.\n\nThe months and years ahead will be a rough ride for America in some ways. Democrats appear unwilling to give the President a chance and Republicans are ready for change.\n\nRegardless of political affiliation, most can admit that the Trump Administration will bring a new course to American politics.\n\nThe election itself shook the political world as President Trump shook the foundation of the mainstream and shattered business as usual. Whether or not his positions are agreeable, it’s undeniable he defied conventional wisdom in regards to American politics.\n\nIn his final days as the President-elect and now as he inherits the office, he bears a promise to reinvigorate a forgotten America. Under the Obama years, the focus was on many liberal and progressive pet projects, while everyday workers were largely forgotten. The middle class isn’t a focal point.\n\nYet. under Obama we were putting the world before our own country. While this may seem noble, a weak America is unable to sustain an entire planet. It’s not feasible, and this was a point that many agree with. It remains to be seen whether President Trump truly understands this and will administer according to the philosophy, but his many supporters believe it.\n\nThe United States has sent billions overseas in foreign aid, while many regular Americans remain homeless and forgotten. They’re not a concern as we send countless dollars to other nations to influence fragile global politics and prop up favorable regimes.\n\nThe United States sends our brave military members abroad to fight undeclared conflicts. Many of these conflicts lack clarify in vision or objective, and ultimately spend our military without gain for them or ourselves as a whole. Many soldiers return home with psychological scars and trauma, others find themselves homeless and hungry.\n\nAs the governments spends money to assist Saudi Arabia in the slaughter of the Yemeni people, our own veterans suffer here at home. Have they been forgotten?\n\nPolitics has long been a game of allegiance to a political establishment. Democratic Presidents such as Barack Obama were more preoccupied with the progressive agenda and his own legacy. Republicans often operated the same way, including with moderate right politics gaining favor above everything else.\n\nPresident Trump called out both sides equally, often hitting at Obama while also targeting George W. Bush over failed wars. Is the rhetoric about a forgotten America truthful? Will President Trump restore a promise with everyday Americans, putting them before the partisan special interests that have long ruled this nation?\n\nA lot remains to be seen and America would be wise to at least give him a chance before passing judgment. There is the potential to be bad, with everything going wrong as many on the left predict. But there is also the potential of a new era in American politics.\n\nThe Trump era has formally begun.",
  "latent_20720": "Both Google and Apple have a presence in the automobile business right now with Android Auto and CarPlay, but the companies are also expected to make a bigger splash in that market in the future. Google has its self-driving car project that’s widely known, and Apple has its own electric car effort that’s unofficial but oft-rumored. Today rumors surrounding the Apple Car continue with a report about the project’s lead.\n\nSources speaking to the Wall Street Journal say that Steve Zadesky, the head of Apple’s car project, is leaving the company. Zadesky has been with Apple for 16 years and has spent time working on the iPad and iPhone in the past. One tipster says that Zadesky has decided to leave Apple for personal reasons. However, it’s not known exactly when he’ll make his exit from Apple.\n\nThe Apple Car project is reportedly codenamed “Titan,” and it’s said to have been in the works since 2014. In September, the team working on Titan was allegedly around 600 people, and Zadesky is said to have been told to make it even larger. Apple is said to be aiming to release its electric car in 2019.\n\nLosing the head of a project is a big deal, but that’s especially true in this case given Zadesky’s history. Not only has he been with Apple for 16 years, but before he joined Apple, he spent time as an engineer at Ford. That said, reports have suggested that Apple has already hired several other automobile industry veterans, and so the company will likely have a replacement for Zadesky ready when he does end up leaving Apple.\n\nAre you interested in the automobile projects from Apple and Google?",

  "latent_21252": "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas charged that a fire that damaged a Palestinian mosque in the Israeli-Occupied Palestinian West Bank was set by Israeli terrorists among militant colonists of the territory. Israeli Trade Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer also said he suspected arson.\n\nHamas, the Muslim fundamentalist party that controls the Gaza Strip, the other territory of the Palestine Authority, said that the terrorist incident demonstrates how unfruitful the negotiations set between Abbas and the Israelis are likely to be.\n\nHaaretz reports that extremist Israeli settlers are planning to set fire in more Palestinian mosques, i.e. planning to engage in further terrorism, as a means of fighting the closure of illegal squatter colonies on the Palestinian West Bank. The Palestinian West Bank is Palestinian territory captured by Israel in 1967. Although in the international law (formulated after WW II to prevent a repetition of the crimes of the Nazis) it is illegal for an occupying Power to import its own citizens into an Occupied territory, the Israeli government has since 1973 been sponsoring large colonies on the West Bank, involving massive theft of Palestinian land and resources, including water.\n\nIn addition, vigilante colonists have set up scattered squatter settlements that are considered illegal even in Israeli law. It is those that the government sometimes dismantles, in part because they are amid Palestinian villages and the colonists are difficult to protect.\n\nThe Israeli government need not worry too much. The militant Israeli squatters are heavily armed and have a vigilante ethos, and have been attacking Palestinians in their villages and preventing them from harvesting their olive groves that lie near Israeli colonies.\n\nHaving often received carte blanche from the authorities to terrorize Palestinians in other ways, they can hardly be blamed for thinking it perfectly natural to now engage in arson against their holy sites.\n\nThe Mideast is on tenterhooks. Jordan is terrified that far rightwing Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman will attempt to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians and displace them to Jordan. They also fear that the Jordan river will be dried up by extensive Israeli siphoning. Lebanon is jittery about another attack on Beirut. Iran has pledged to defend Syria if the Israelis attack Damascus, over the alleged transfer to Lebanese Shiite party-militia Hizbullah of SCUD missiles.\n\nStay tuned.",
  "latent_21376": "A University of Delaware researcher is helping to design instruments for a robotic space probe that will go where no other has gone before: the sun.\n\nWilliam Matthaeus, professor of physics and astronomy at UD, is involved in NASA's Solar Probe Plus project, which is slated to launch by 2018.\n\nThe unmanned spacecraft, the size of a small car, will plunge directly into the sun's atmosphere to help uncover answers to perplexing mysteries about the fiery ball of plasma at the center of our solar system.\n\n\"The experiments selected for Solar Probe Plus are specifically designed to solve two key questions of solar physics -- why is the sun's outer atmosphere so much hotter than the sun's visible surface, and what propels the solar wind that affects Earth and our solar system? We've been struggling with these questions for decades and this mission should finally provide those answers,\" said Dick Fisher, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division, in a NASA news release.\n\nAstrophysicists have been discussing the idea of sending an unmanned mission to the sun for years, Matthaeus says, but the technology to protect a space probe from the star's mega-heat was unavailable until recently.\n\nTo avoid the fate of the mythical Icarus, who flew too close to the sun and melted his wax-and-feather wings, the spacecraft's heat shield must be able to withstand extremely high temperatures and blasts of intense radiation in the solar atmosphere as it makes the nearly 90-million-mile trip from Earth to within 4 million miles of the sun.\n\n\"At the Solar Probe's closest approach, the light from the sun will be more than 500 times as intense as at Earth, and the surrounding gas, although very tenuous, will likely be at hundreds of thousands of degrees,\" Matthaeus notes. \"Fortunately, NASA engineers have developed an effective special carbon-fiber heat shield and thermal control system.\"\n\nThe Solar Probe Plus mission encompasses five investigations totaling approximately $180 million for preliminary analysis, design, development and testing of the spacecraft and the instruments that will fly aboard it.\n\nMatthaeus is the lead theorist on the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISIS) project, which is led by David McComas at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. The team is developing two instruments for monitoring the electrons, protons and ions that are accelerated to high energies in the sun's atmosphere. This continuous stream of outward-flowing particles from the sun is known as solar wind. It causes the northern and southern lights on Earth, and can cause magnetic storms capable of knocking out electrical power grids.\n\n\"The more we rely on satellite technology, such as GPS, the more vulnerable to magnetic storms we become. So we need to understand how they work in order to protect societal assets such as satellites in space, as well as humans who explore or work in space,\" says Matthaeus.\n\n\"The Solar Probe Plus orbit will spiral inward. The spacecraft will eventually get as close to 9-10 solar radii, which is about 20 times closer to the sun than Earth is,\" he notes.\n\nAs the instruments aboard the spacecraft measure magnetic and electric properties, astrophysicists will be able to eliminate some theories for how solar wind is generated and better understand the heliosphere, the vast magnetic bubble that contains our solar system.\n\n\"It is a real mission of discovery, visiting the sun's immediate environment for the first time,\" notes Matthaeus. \"All along its journey into the solar atmosphere, Solar Probe will measure many of the ongoing processes that are responsible for maintaining and controlling the heliosphere.\"\n\nMatthaeus is working to have UD students participate in exchange programs with collaborators from Italy, Great Britain, Thailand and Argentina who are involved in the theoretical research related to the mission.\n\nAdditionally, Matthaeus is a co-investigator on the Plasma Electron And Current Experiment (PEACE) electron instrument for the Cluster mission, an unmanned space mission sponsored by the European Space Agency to study Earth's magnetosphere using four identical spacecraft orbiting the Earth in formation; and on NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission, under development to explore magnetic reconnection, the often explosive mechanism by which magnetic energy is dissipated in the outer layers of Earth's magnetosphere, where Earth's magnetic field meets the solar wind.",
  "latent_21512": "[CentOS-announce] CentOS Project joins forces with Red Hat\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 With great excitement I'd like to announce that we are joining the Red Hat family. The CentOS Project ( http://www.centos.org ) is joining forces with Red Hat. Working as part of the Open Source and Standards team ( http://community.redhat.com/ ) to foster rapid innovation beyond the platform into the next generation of emerging technologies. Working alongside the Fedora and RHEL ecosystems, we hope to further expand on the community offerings by providing a platform that is easily consumed, by other projects to promote their code while we maintain the established base. We are also launching the new CentOS.org website ( http://www.centos.org ). - ------------- The new initiative is going to be overseen by the new CentOS Governing Board. The initial Board comprises of the existing CentOS Core team members : - - Ralph Angenent - - Tru Hyunh - - Johnny Hughes JR - - Jim Perrin - - Karanbir Singh and also sees new members: - - Fabian Arrotin, who comes to the board nominated from the community - - Carl Trieloff, Karsten Wade, and Mike McLean join us, nominated by Red Hat. Please join me in welcoming the new members to the Board. The key operating points of the Board are going to be: Public, Open, and Inclusive. You can find more information about the governance model, the board, and the operating policies we are proposing at http://www.centos.org/about/governance/ Furthermore, some of the existing CentOS Core members are moving to take up roles at Red Hat, as a part of their sponsorship of the CentOS Project, allowing these people to work on the Project as their primary job function. This includes Johnny Hughes Jr, Jim Perrin, Fabian Arrotin, and myself. We will be working with and operating out of the Red Hat Open Source and Standards team in the CTO's Office. - ------------- Some of the things that are not changing: - - The CentOS Linux platform isn't changing. The process and methods built up around the platform however are going to become more open, more inclusive and transparent. - - The sponsor driven content network that has been central to the success of the CentOS efforts over the years stays intact. - - The bugs, issues, and incident handling process stays as it has been with more opportunities for community members to get involved at various stages of the process. - - The Red Hat Enterprise Linux to CentOS firewall will also remain. Members and contributors to the CentOS efforts are still isolated from the RHEL Groups inside Red Hat, with the only interface being srpm / source path tracking, no sooner than is considered released. In summary: we retain an upstream. Feel free to reach out if you have specific concerns about how this change impacts your CentOS story. URLs mentioned at the bottom of this email should be a good starting point. - ------------- Some of the key things that are changing: - - Some of us now work for Red Hat, but not RHEL. This should not have any impact to our ability to do what we have done in the past, it should facilitate a more rapid pace of development and evolution for our work on the community platform. - - Red Hat is offering to sponsor some of the buildsystem and initial content delivery resources - how we are able to consume these and when we are able to make use of this is to be decided. - - Sources that we consume, in the platform, in the addons, or the parallel stacks such as Xen4CentOS will become easier to consume with a git.centos.org being setup, with the scripts and rpm metadata needed to create binaries being published there. The Board also aims to put together a plan to allow groups to come together within the CentOS ecosystem as a Special Interest Group (SIG) and build CentOS Variants on our resources, as officially endorsed. You can read about the proposal at http://www.centos.org/variants/ - - Because we are now able to work with the Red Hat legal teams, some of the contraints that resulted in efforts like CentOS-QA being behind closed doors, now go away and we hope to have the entire build, test, and delivery chain open to anyone who wishes to come and join the effort. The changes we make are going to be community inclusive, and promoted, proposed, formalised, and actioned in an open community centric manner on the centos-devel mailing list. And I highly encourage everyone to come along and participate. - ------------- Contacting us works best via the established community mechanisms. - - Real time chats via IRC ( http://wiki.centos.org/irc ) ; To keep conversation sanity intact, I recommend using the #centos-devel channel to discuss project related activity while #centos is best used for end user conversations. - - The Mailing lists are a great way to interface with the developers, contributors and the community at large ( http://lists.centos.org ). As with IRC, we recommend using the centos-devel list to talk about project related issues while the general centos list is best used for end user conversations. - - The CentOS Forums are another great way to engage in conversation with other users ( http://www.centos.org/forums ), if you prefer that mechanism. All the above mentioned venues are public and open to the community, should you wish to discuss something privately, you can email us at centosdev at centos.org. Press requests should be sent to press at centos.org. Please note that it will take us much longer to reply to private requests as compared to content on the public venues. - ------------- In the coming days we are going to create opportunities for people to come and get involved in more face to face interactions. Starting with a regular scheduled office-hours format hangouts ( http://wiki.centos.org/OfficeHours ) that start early next week. We are trying to split the sessions into two different timezones so as to maximise the number of people who are able to join. The sessions will run live, with #centos-devel on irc.freenode.net being used for conversations alongside. We are also running a CentOS Dojo on the 31st Jan 2014 at Belgium ( http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Brussels2014 ); The event will run two tracks, with lots of opportunities for social interaction between the talks; followed by CentOS in the Clouds Hack sessions. We are limited in the number of people we can accomodate, so I encourage everyone to register early. - ------------- I want to take this opportunity to thank all the sponsors, the contributors and the CentOS team members for all their help over the years, the project is built completely upon those contributions - and I look forward to seeing even more involvement from everyone as we move forward. - ------------- A Request: We are still sorting out content in various places and it might take a day or two to get everything in place. In the mean time if you find something stale and perhaps misleading in the new context ( or the old one! ) please drop in on #centos-devel at irc.centos.org and let us know. - ------------- Some URLS: - - http://www.centos.org/ The CentOS Project - - http://wiki.centos.org/ CentOS Community wiki - - http://community.redhat.com/ RedHat OSAS - - http://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/2014/1/red-hat-and-centos-join-forces - - Red Hat Press Release - - http://community.redhat.com/centos-faq - Red Hat FAQ's about the initiative - - http://wiki.centos.org/FAQ - CentOS FAQ's about the initiative Enjoy! and regards, Karanbir Singh and everyone from the CentOS team, - -- Karanbir Singh, Project Chair, The CentOS Project +44-207-0999389 | http://www.centos.org/ | twitter.com/CentOS GnuPG Key : http://www.karan.org/publickey.asc -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://www.enigmail.net/ iEYEARECAAYFAlLMbQcACgkQMA29nj4Tz1sTnQCgj2fYxYpTjA0KwH7TpCWjE4gg w2cAniQWb/nh6Zn/8daSQ3EAfLIzGNKg =KJOk -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----",

Of course not. We are disappointed. A club like Tottenham has to go through.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n“We have to fight for every game and that is what we said after the game.

  "latent_21654": "RFID technology that allows the remote identification of travellers in moving vehicles is being rolled out at US land border crossings this month. Crossing points with Canada at Blaine, and with Mexico at Nogales, came online last week, with Buffalo, Detroit and San Ysidro to follow, and a total of 39 planned.\n\nThe system uses the US PASSport (People, Access Security Service) card, which is intended to operate within the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) for US citizens entering the US via land and sea ports. Using \"Vicinity RFID\" it can read the cards from a healthy skimming distance of 20-30 feet, but according to the Department of Homeland Security this isn't a problem. The RFID chip on the card doesn't contain any personal information, only a unique identification number, and skimmers wouldn't have access to the data the number matches up with.\n\nThe system is intended to work like this. As a vehicle approaches the border post, the numbers of the cards inside it are read, and pictures and data on the holders are called up from a database. Then, presumably, the immigration officers check the faces of the passengers to make sure they match, and bust any who happen to be flagged as terrorists or loose criminals.\n\nIn addition to the PASSport card, some US states are beginning to issue Enhanced Driver's Licence/ID cards (EDL/ID), which have the PASSport RFID functionality added to a standard driver's license. These can also be used for land or sea entry to the US, but neither variety of card is valid elsewhere, or for WHTI air travel into the US. Obviously, they'd only be of any use at anybody else's border post if there were compatible readers there, and if the US had kindly shared its ID database with the relevant country.\n\nSo it's an internal passport system, one that's entirely incompatible with the biometric ID system that the US has gone to such pains to get the world to adopt. Were they only kidding, then? ®",
  "latent_21702": "A chat with the star about her role as a moody Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse and Kit Harington's secret to perfect pin-curl hair\n\nConsidering that she's best known for making Game of Thrones viewers squirm in sympathy for her agonizing portrayal of Sansa Stark—a damsel regularly subjected to some of the most depraved (and creative?) psychosexual torture on television—it's a relief that Sophie Turner, IRL, is kind of a goober. “Anchorman is my favorite movie in the world,” she says breathlessly, recounting her nervous glee at landing a seat near Steve Carell at the SAG Awards. “I was yelling, like, ‘I love lamp!’ and waiting for him to reply.”\n\nIn X-Men: Apocalypse, the 20-year-old English actress will finally get to dish out some hurt as young Jean Grey, an angsty teenage version of the Lycra-clad telepath Marvel Comics made famous. Turner says she devoted lots of downtime to practicing Grey's mind-control squinch in the mirror: “I was like, ‘I don't want to look like an idiot doing this.’ ”\n\nShe got it down. Time to set her destructive sights on Winterfell.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, how badly do you wanna see Sansa fuck shit up this season?\n\n“Ten! TEN! Obviously. I want her to raise hell.”\n\nGQ: Whose hair takes longer to style on the show: Yours or Kit Harington's?\n\nThat's a good question. If it was up to Kit, as to how long hair would take, he would take longer on those. But it's mine that takes longer. He wakes up and his is terrific naturally. He's got like the perfect little pin curls. He looks amazing. Mine takes a while. I don't wake up looking like Kit Harington.\n\nWhat's his secret? How does he do it?\n\nHe'll kill me for saying this, but if we're on the red carpet, I promise he'll stand in front of the mirror for hours. I've seen him do it. Even though he wakes up perfect, it's never good enough for him. He's gonna absolutely kill me.\n\n\"I don't wake up looking like Kit Harington.\"\n\nDo you ever see Maisie [Williams, who plays Arya Stark] killing people on the show, and think, I can't wait till Sansa gets to do that too?\n\nUgh, yes. Totally. Like the past five seasons, when Maisie is getting to run around with swords and in trousers and stuff, I'm just like, \"Gah. Man that looks like so much fun!\" But Sansa's never gonna be doing that. Her weapon is her mind. Her intellect. She's a sharp one.\n\nDo you ever get scared when you're flipping through a script that Sansa's gonna die?\n\nOh my God, I'm so terrified.\n\nIs that a fear everyone on the show has?\n\nYes, oh my God. Yeah. It's crazy. Almost every day we're on set we're like, \"Who do you think is gonna go next?\" It's almost like living in the Blair Witch project.\n\nWhat happens on set when someone dies?\n\nThere's always a lot of drinks at the bar. But by now we're so used to it. We used to have big things when other people died. But there's so many people who die now, we're like, \"Can't really afford it, man. We've been out every night.\"\n\nWith Sansa it seems like you're always having to tap into this dark, demented place to play her. And then on Twitter and Instagram you're, like, a hilarious teen ray of sunshine. Is this a contrast you're aware of? Something you're perpetuating on some level to show everyone, like, Hey! This is me!?\n\nI don't know if I'm trying my best to be happy when I'm shooting this depressing show. I don't know if it's an intentional or conscious [thing], but I definitely am just a very happy person.\n\nYou do have to go to some headspace to play Sansa. But you leave that at work. I'll never take that home. Especially because—and people don't realize this, but—when you're on set it's a very jolted thing. It's not like you're in that headspace all day. Sometimes you'll have like two hours in between [set ups] where you'll go and sit with the rest of the cast, and you can't just sit there being quiet and miserable all day. It's a headspace I go to for 15 minutes at a time and I hop right back out of it. It never really affects me too much.\n\nSo you're never up at night dreading some horrible scene you're about to film?\n\nNo, I leave that at work. If I did, it would really affect me. But I don't let it linger with me. I brush her off. She's not me.\n\nIn the new X-Men film you're playing a MUTANT. You can control minds. What can we expect from your Jean Grey?\n\nThis Jean Grey isn't the Jean that we've seen in the previous movies, because obviously this is a prequel kind of thing. This is about how Jean became this incredibly powerful mutant. In the first three movies, seeing her was fun because she was herself. She has a career together, she knows exactly who she is, and her morals. She's got a steady relationship, job, everything.\n\nThis movie is about her as like a teen struggling to come to terms with growing up in the world and boys and everything that makes a teenager tick, but she's also a mutant. And a very powerful mutant. But she doesn't know how to control her powers. It's all kind of about her coming to grips with that as well, and at the same time trying not to feel alienated. It's pretty intense.\n\nWas it fun to play someone who gets to dish out hurt?\n\nOh yeah! It was really cool to be able to play a character that gets to do stunts and is kind of like, a hero. A superhero. It was really fun to like explore that side because I've been dying to do that for years.\n\nDid you do your own stunts?\n\nI had a stunt double. But I didn't really have huge stunts because she's telekinetic.\n\nAh! So a lot of squinching your eyes, raising your hand at stuff.\n\n[Laughs] Yeah, exactly.\n\nDid you practice that in your mirror? Your mind control \"look\"?\n\nOh my God, I practiced that in the mirror every day! I was like, I don't want to look like an idiot doing this. I'm really terrible. I really had to learn my body in that movie. I had to learn how to run! Apparently I run really stupidly? They had to teach me how to run well in X-Men. All the shots were so embarrassing because if I was running around, my arms would be flailing everywhere. Apparently I have no motor control.\n\nI mean, have you run much playing Sansa?\n\nI should. Maybe that would help. In the fourth season I felt like I was running in literally every shot. But no, I haven't had to do much. Now all I do is sit and cry. That's, like, my thing. Trademark it.\n\nTelekinesis. Sitting. Crying. You got it down.\n\nThank you. I've had years of practice.\n\nWhat would you do if you weren't an actress? I know that's sort of a boring question, but...\n\nI would want to be at uni. I would want to be studying psychology or history. I'm fascinated by psychology and psychopaths and sociology. I just read The Psychopath Test. Have you read that?\n\nNo I haven't!\n\nOh my God, you have to read it. It's just like mind blowing. I just started on this book called Confessions of a Sociopath as well. My mom thinks I'm crazy. She's like, \"Why are you reading all this shit? This is terrifying. Why are you obsessed with that stuff?\" I just find it so fascinating.\n\nAnything else I forgot to ask you? Anything you wanna plug?\n\nI don't know. Is there anything I have to plug? No. Oh! I really like Nando's.\n\nNando's? I have no idea what that is.\n\nIt's N-A-N-D-O-S. It's a chicken shop in London. It's amazing. It's like the world's best.

  "latent_21859": "Clients were understandably furious when Anthem Blue Cross, the largest for-profit health insurer in California , announced huge rate increases for people who buy their own insurance : an average increase of 25 percent, and a 35 percent to 39 percent rise for a quarter of the purchasers. The move also provided a textbook example of why the nation badly needs comprehensive health care reforms.\n\nThe reform bills stalled in Congress would put a brake on such out-of-scale premium increases by broadening the pools of insured people to keep average premiums low, by setting up competitive insurance exchanges and by starting to rein in the cost of medical care that is driving up premiums everywhere.\n\nPrivate insurers in several other states also have sought and won double-digit increases for policies sold to individuals. In one striking case, a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in Michigan sought a 56 percent average increase in premiums for individually bought policies but settled for 22 percent in a compromise with regulators.\n\nIf the increases go through in California, where regulators have limited powers to control rates, Anthem’s enrollees would have to choose between paying the higher price, moving to lower-cost policies, perhaps with a high deductible, switching to another insurer if they can find one to take them, or dropping coverage entirely.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story",
  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court recently gutted Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, it did so under the theory that there was little evidence of continuing racial discrimination in the states that were required to get preclearance before changing their voting laws. Congress had rather pointedly disagreed when it renewed the VRA in 2006, but no matter. The Supreme Court knew better.\n\nSo how has that theory worked out? Normally we’d have to wait a while to find out. Even Citizens United, which gutted campaign financing law, took a few years before its full effect was obvious. But in this case, a few weeks has been enough. A couple of days ago, the North Carolina Senate voted to approve a Draconian set of changes to its voting laws, and there’s not much question that final passage will come shortly. Check out this astonishing list of changes in the bill:\n\nRequire voter ID at polling places.\n\nReduce the early voting period from 17 days to 10 days.\n\nProhibit counties from extending poll hours by one hour on Election Day even in extraordinary circumstances, such as in response to long lines. (Those in line at closing time would still be allowed to vote.)\n\nEliminate pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds, who currently can register to vote before they turn 18.\n\nOutlaw paid voter registration drives.\n\nEliminate straight-ticket voting.\n\nEliminate provisional voting if someone shows up at the wrong precinct.\n\nAllow any registered voter of a county to challenge the eligibility of a voter rather than just a voter of the precinct in which the suspect voter is registered.\n\nIn the past, all of this would have required preclearance from the Justice Department, and it almost certainly would have been dead on arrival. But with the end of Section 5 there was nothing left to stop them, so the bill turned into a feeding frenzy of provisions designed to suppress voting among blacks, Hispanics, the poor, and the young. “What’s happening in North Carolina,” said Ed Kilgore, “is the product of a gang of ideologues led and funded by gazillionaire Art Pope who stormed the ramparts of a once-progressive state.”\n\nThere is, needless to say, virtually no justification for any of this. “Election integrity” is the stated reason, but examples of voter fraud are vanishingly rare and no one in North Carolina has even bothered to pretend otherwise. They just want to reduce voting among any group that happens to support Democrats. If that means reducing the black and Hispanic vote—something that North Carolina’s own Secretary of State has confirmed will happen—well, you can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, can you?\n\nSo is there any hope of overturning this law? There’s not much in North Carolina itself. But on Thursday, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department would file a suit to halt a new voter ID law in Texas. “My colleagues and I are determined to use every tool at our disposal to stand against such discrimination wherever it is found,” he told an audience in Philadelphia, and a suit to stop North Carolina’s law is likely too. So this is where the fight is headed. Section 5 is dead, and despite some early noises from congressional Republicans about passing a new version, there was never any serious chance of that happening. What’s happening in North Carolina, after all, is part of a broad push by the Republican Party itself throughout the country. So now it’s up to the Justice Department to go in after the fact and take these laws to court one by one. The Supreme Court seemed to think this was a perfectly adequate substitute for preclearance. We’ll soon find out if they were serious when one of these challenges eventually wends its way onto their docket.",

  "latent_22236": "The New York Times led the propaganda behind 9/11 and the 9/11 Wars. It did so by ignoring many of the most relevant facts, by promoting false official accounts, and by belittling those who questioned the 9/11 events. The Times eventually offered a weak public apology for its uncritical support of the Bush Administration’s obviously bogus Iraq War justifications. However, it has yet to apologize for its role in selling the official account of 9/11, a story built on just as many falsehoods. Instead, the newspaper continues to propagandize about the attacks while putting down Americans who seek the truth about what happened.\n\nThe New York “newspaper of record” has published many articles that promote official explanations for the events of 9/11. These have included support for the Pancake Theory, the diesel fuel theory for WTC 7, claims based on the torture testimony of an alleged top al Qaeda leader, and accounts of NORAD notification and response to the hijackings. Since then, U.S. authorities have said that none of those explanations were true. However, the Times never expressed regret for reporting the misleading information.\n\nInstead, the Times continued to sell every different official explanation. When a new government theory for destruction of the WTC was put forth, it was immediately promoted. The newspaper never reported any critical analysis of the official accounts, despite the fact that all of them, including the final reports for the Twin Towers and WTC 7, have been proven to be wrong.\n\nWhen the fourth story arose for how the North American air defenses failed, the one that said U.S. military officers had spent three years giving “false testimony,” the Times pushed it as fact. Its article on the subject simply closed the matter with the statement that “someone will still have to explain why the military, with far greater resources and more time for investigation, could not come up with the real story until the 9/11 commission forced it to admit the truth.” The idea that military officers might have started out telling the truth, thereby leaving very sensitive questions to be answered, and that the 9/11 Commission was now being false, apparently never occurred to the editors.\n\nMeanwhile, the newspaper has made considerable efforts to belittle Americans who question the official account of 9/11.\n\nIn June 2006, the Times published a snarky account of a grassroots conference of 9/11 investigators. The article focused on sensational descriptions of the participants, including what it called “a long­haired fellow named hummux who, on and off, lived in a cave for 15 years.’’ The fact that Dr. hummux was a PhD physicist who had worked on the Strategic Defense Initiative for 20 years was not mentioned. The Times simply distorted his experience living with a Native American tribe and falsely stated that he had lived in a cave. No mention was made of serious, undisputed facts that were presented at the conference.\n\nA few months later, at the fifth anniversary of 9/11, the Times published another propaganda article in support of the politically timed reports from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The article began by declaring that those who questioned 9/11 were “an angry minority,” while minimizing a national Scripps Howard poll, published just a month earlier. The poll showed that “More than a third of the American public suspects that federal officials assisted in the 9/11 terrorist attacks or took no action to stop them so the United States could go to war in the Middle East.” That is, the number of Americans who thought that federal officials were behind the attacks (36%) was on par with the percentage of Americans who had voted for the president. Yet the Times inferred that it was only a small fraction of the population who questioned 911.\n\nThe September 2006 article promoted one Brent Blanchard as a demolition expert, implying that his recent essay refuted any suggestions that the WTC buildings were demolished. As I told the reporter Jim Dwyer, when he interviewed me for the article, “Mr. Blanchard may be a good photographer, but the uninformative bluster that fills the first two and a half pages of this piece, and a good deal throughout the paper, shows that he is not a good writer.” The fact that Blanchard was only a photographer and not a demolition expert was not mentioned by Dwyer, nor was my point-by-point refutation of Blanchard’s limited arguments. Instead, Dwyer purposefully ignored the evidence and ended his article with another quote from Blanchard.\n\nMore recently, perhaps in response to another large billboard posted right outside the Times offices, the newspaper has renewed its 9/11 propaganda efforts. In one new article, reporter Mark Leibovich wonders “why is it good to tell the truth but bad to be a ‘Truther’.” Leibovich turns to former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer for support. Of course, the article does not refer to Fleischer’s curious behavior on the morning of 9/11, which stands among the unresolved questions. Instead, Fleischer’s input is that he uses the term “truther” as an epithet (read “truth nigger”), “floating a notion and letting it hang there to absorb sinister connotations.” Leibovich goes on to portray 9/11 questioning as just another form of ridiculous “trutherism” that is “stranger than fiction.“\n\nLeibovich and his colleagues at the Times continue to suggest that they are unaware of the many incredible facts about 9/11 that call out for critical investigation. At this point, however, that level of ignorance is not believable and the Times’ track record shows that it will never take an honest and objective approach to the events of 9/11. As one former Times reporter stated, the paper’s slogan that it provides all the news ‘fit to print’ really means that it provides all the news that’s fit to serve the powerful. And as long as the needs of the powerful differ from the needs of the people, the truth will be something that is unavailable at the New York Times.",

  "latent_22298": "Legal English is the type of English as used in legal writing. In general, a legal language is a formalized language based on logic rules which differs from the ordinary natural language in vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and semantics, as well as other linguistic features,[1] aimed to achieve consistency, validity, completeness and soundness, while keeping the benefits of a human-like language such as intuitive execution, complete meaning and open upgrade. However, Legal English has been referred to as a \"sublanguage\",[2] as legal English differs from ordinary English. A specialized use of certain terms and linguistic patterns governs the teaching of legal language. Thus, \"we study legal language as a kind of second language, a specialized use of vocabulary, phrases, and syntax that helps us to communicate more easily with each other\".[3]\n\nThe term legalese, on the other hand, is a pejorative term associated with a traditional style of legal writing that is part of this specialized discourse of lawyers: communication that \"lay readers cannot readily comprehend\".[4] This term describes poor legal writing that is cluttered, wordy, indirect, and that includes unnecessary technical words or phrases.[5] Historically, legalese is language a lawyer might use in drafting a contract or a pleading but would not use in ordinary conversation.[6] For this reason, the traditional style of legal writing has been labeled reader-unfriendly.[5] Proponents of plain language argue that legal \"writing style should not vary from task to task or audience to audience...; whatever lawyers write must be Clear, Correct, Concise, and Complete\".[7] These 4 Cs describe \"characteristics of good legal writing style\" in the United States.[7]\n\nThere are different kinds (genres) of legal writing: for example, (a) academic legal writing as in law journals, (b) juridical legal writing as in court judgments, and (c) legislative legal writing as in laws, regulations, contracts, and treaties.[8] Another variety is the language used by lawyers to communicate with clients requiring a more \"reader-friendly\" style of written communication than that used with law professionals.[9]\n\nFor lawyers operating internationally, communicating with clients and other professionals across cultures requires a need for transnational legal awareness and transcultural linguistic awareness.[9][10] Whatever the form of legal writing, legal skills and language skills form a vital part of higher education and professional training.[11]\n\nLegal English has particular relevance when applied to legal writing and the drafting of written material, including:\n\nLegal English has traditionally been the preserve of lawyers from English-speaking countries (especially the U.S., the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, and South Africa) which have shared common law traditions. However, due to the spread of Legal English as the predominant language of international business, as well as its role as a legal language within the European Union, Legal English is now a global phenomenon. It may informally be referred to as lawspeak.[citation needed]\n\nHistorical development [ edit ]\n\nModern legal English is based on standard English. Modern legal English contains, however, a number of unusual features. These features largely relate to terminology, linguistic structure, linguistic conventions, and punctuation, and have their roots in the history of the development of English as a legal language.\n\nIn prehistoric Britain, traditional common law was discussed in the vernacular (see Celtic law). The legal language and legal tradition changed with waves of conquerors over the following centuries. Roman Britain (after the conquest beginning in AD 43) followed Roman legal tradition, and its legal language was Latin. Following the Roman departure from Britain circa 410 and the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain, the dominant tradition was instead Anglo-Saxon law, which was discussed in the Germanic vernacular (Anglo-Saxon, Old English), and written in Old English since circa 600, beginning with the Law of Æthelberht. Following the Norman invasion of England in 1066, Anglo-Norman French became the official language of legal proceedings in England for a period of nearly 300 years until the Pleading in English Act 1362 (and continued in minor use for another 300 years), while Medieval Latin was used for written records for over 650 years. Some English technical terms were retained, however (see Anglo-Saxon law: Language and dialect for details).\n\nIn legal pleadings, Anglo-Norman developed into Law French, from which many words in modern legal English are derived. These include property, estate, chattel, lease, executor, and tenant. The use of Law French during this period had an enduring influence on the general linguistic register of modern legal English. That use also accounts for some of the complex linguistic structures used in legal writing. In 1362, the Statute of Pleading was enacted, which stated that all legal proceedings should be conducted in English (but recorded in Latin). This marked the beginning of formal Legal English; Law French continued to be used in some forms into the 17th century, although Law French became increasingly degenerate.\n\nFrom 1066, Latin was the language of formal records and statutes, and was replaced by English in the Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act 1730. However, because only learned persons were fluent in Latin, it never became the language of legal pleading or debate. The influence of Latin can be seen in a number of words and phrases such as ad hoc, de facto, bona fide, inter alia, and ultra vires, which remain in current use in legal writing (see Legal Latin).\n\nStyle [ edit ]\n\nIn 2004, David Crystal proposed a stylistic influence upon English legal language. During the Medieval period, lawyers used a mixture of Latin, French and English. To avoid ambiguity, lawyers often offered pairs of words from different languages. Sometimes there was little ambiguity to resolve and the pairs merely gave greater emphasis, becoming a stylistic habit. This is a feature of legal style that continues to the present day. Examples of mixed language doublets are: \"breaking and entering\" (English/French), \"fit and proper\" (English/French), \"lands and tenements\" (English/French), and \"will and testament\" (English/Latin). Examples of English-only doublets are \"let and hindrance\" and \"have and hold\".\n\nModern English vocabulary draws significantly from Germanic languages, French, and Latin, the lattermost often by way of French. These vocabularies are used preferentially in different registers, with words of French origin being more formal than those of Germanic origin, and words of Latin origin being more formal than those of French origin. Thus, the extensive use of French and Latin words in Legal English results in a relatively formal style.\n\nFurther, legal English is useful for its dramatic effect: for example, a subpoena compelling a witness to appear in court often ends with the archaic threat \"Fail not, at your peril\"; the \"peril\" isn't described (being arrested and held in contempt of court) but the formality of the language tends to have a stronger effect on the recipient of the subpoena than a simple statement like \"We can arrest you if you don't show up\".\n\nWhereas legal language in the Medieval period combined Latin, French, and English to avoid ambiguity. According to Walter Probert, judicial lawyers, roughly starting in the twentieth century, often manipulate the language to be more persuasive of their campaign ideals.[12]\n\nKey features [ edit ]\n\nAs noted above, legal English differs greatly from standard English in a number of ways. The most important of these differences are as follows:\n\nUse of terms of art. Legal English, in common with the language used by other trades and professions, employs a great deal of technical terminology which is unfamiliar to the layman (e.g. waiver, restraint of trade, restrictive covenant, promissory estoppel ). Much of this vocabulary is derived from French and Latin.\n\n). Much of this vocabulary is derived from French and Latin. These terms of art include ordinary words used with special meanings. For example, the familiar term consideration refers, in legal English, to contracts, and means, an act, forbearance or promise by one party to a contract that constitutes the price for which the promise of the other party is bought (Oxford Dictionary of Law). Other examples are construction, prefer, redemption, furnish, hold, and find .\n\nrefers, in legal English, to contracts, and means, (Oxford Dictionary of Law). Other examples are and . Lack of punctuation. One aspect of archaic legal drafting – particularly in conveyances and deeds – is the conspicuous absence of punctuation. This arose from a widespread idea among lawyers that punctuation was ambiguous and unimportant, and that the meaning of legal documents was contained only in the words used and their context. In some situations punctuation is omitted simply because it can be added undetectably to a document after it comes into effect, altering its meaning, so the view was, and still sometimes is, that a safer course is to omit punctuation altogether so that, if any should appear, it is apparent that it has been added later to change the meaning of the document, possibly fraudulently. In modern legal drafting, punctuation is often used, in the hope that clarifies meaning. [13]\n\nUse of doublets and triplets. As noted above, the mix of languages used in early legalese led to the tendency in legal English to string together two or three words to convey what is usually a single legal concept. Examples of this are null and void, fit and proper, (due) care and attention, perform and discharge, terms and conditions, dispute, controversy or claim, , promise, agree and covenant and cease and desist . While originally being done to help all lawyers no matter which vocabulary they might use (English, French, or Latin) it now sometimes repeats words used mean exactly the same thing, and has become a stylistic standard for other legal concepts ( dispute, controversy or claim , search and seizure ).\n\n, and . While originally being done to help all lawyers no matter which vocabulary they might use (English, French, or Latin) it now sometimes repeats words used mean exactly the same thing, and has become a stylistic standard for other legal concepts ( , ). Unusual word order. At times, the word order used in legal documents appears distinctly strange. For example, the provisions for termination hereinafter appearing or will at the cost of the borrower forthwith comply with the same . There is no single clear reason for this, although the influence of French grammatical structures is certainly a contributory factor.\n\nor . There is no single clear reason for this, although the influence of French grammatical structures is certainly a contributory factor. Use of unfamiliar pro-forms. For example, the same, the said, the aforementioned etc. The use of such terms in legal texts is interesting since very frequently they do not replace the noun – which is the whole purpose of pro-forms – but are used as adjectives to modify the noun. For example, the said John Smith .\n\netc. The use of such terms in legal texts is interesting since very frequently they do not replace the noun – which is the whole purpose of pro-forms – but are used as adjectives to modify the noun. For example, . Use of pronominal adverbs. Words like hereof, thereof, and whereof (and further derivatives, including -at, -in, -after, -before, -with, -by, -above, -on, -upon ) are not often used in ordinary modern English. They are used in legal English primarily to avoid repeating names or phrases. For example, the parties hereto instead of the parties to this contract .\n\nand (and further derivatives, including ) are not often used in ordinary modern English. They are used in legal English primarily to avoid repeating names or phrases. For example, instead of . -er, -or, and -ee name endings. Legal English contains some words and titles, such as employer and employee; lessor and lessee, in which the reciprocal and opposite nature of the relationship is indicated by the use of alternative endings.\n\nand name endings. Legal English contains some words and titles, such as employer and employee; lessor and lessee, in which the reciprocal and opposite nature of the relationship is indicated by the use of alternative endings. Use of phrasal verbs. Phrasal verbs play a large role in legal English, as they do in standard English, and are often used in a quasi-technical sense. For example, parties enter into contracts, put down deposits, serve [documents] upon other parties, write off debts, attend at locations, and so on.\n\nEducation [ edit ]\n\nBecause of the prevalence of the English language in international business relations, as well as, its role as a legal language globally, a feeling has existed for a long period in the international legal community that traditional English language training is not sufficient to meet lawyers’ English language requirements. The main reason for this is that such training generally ignores the ways in which English usage may be modified by the particular demands of legal practice – and by the conventions of legal English as a separate branch of English in itself.\n\nAs a result, non-native English speaking legal professionals and law students increasingly seek specialist training in legal English, and such training is now provided by law schools, language centres,[14] private firms and podcasts[15] that focus on legal language. The UK TOLES examination was set up to teach legal English to non-native English speakers. The exams focus on the aspects of legal English noted as lacking by lawyers.[16] An annual Global Legal Skills Conference was also established as a forum for professors of Legal English and other skills professionals to exchange information on teaching methods and materials.[17]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nBain Butler, D.

  "latent_22654": "The most notable luminaries of our time are wrong to fear AI\n\nElon Musk, Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking and Bill Joy surely know that machines cannot have desires\n\nInput Coffee Blocked Unblock Follow Following Sep 15, 2016\n\nTL;DR\n\nSome of the most respected thinkers of our time have sounded the alarm about the dangers of artificial intelligence. They are wrong because the way we teach machines precludes them from having desires, wants, or ambitions. Their very limited and simple goals prevent them from even wanting to “take over” or “rule over us.”\n\nA number of leading thinkers have publicly discussed the dangers of AI, including Bill Joy, Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates.\n\nWhat is AI?\n\nWikipedia has an excellent definition:\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, an ideal “intelligent” machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term “artificial intelligence” is applied when a machine mimics “cognitive” functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as “learning” and “problem solving”. — Wikipedia\n\nDangers of AI\n\nThe dangers of AI have been well rehearsed in popular culture. They boil down to machines becoming self-aware, developing desires contrary to our own and then asserting themselves.\n\nIn popular culture, these machines are essentially confused super humans. They might want what humans want, but with a bit more confusion and a lot more power. Perhaps they don’t quite know they want what they want, like teenagers just awakening to their free will.\n\nBut more serious leaders have different concerns. Let’s look at their words:\n\nElon Musk\n\nI think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I were to guess like what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that. So we need to be very careful with the artificial intelligence. Increasingly scientists think there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish. With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon. In all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water, it’s like yeah he’s sure he can control the demon. Didn’t work out. — Elon Musk as quoted in the Washington Post\n\nBill Gates\n\nI am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence. First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don’t understand why some people are not concerned. — Bill Gates in his Reddit AMA\n\nStephen Hawking\n\nThe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race…It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete, and would be superseded. — Stephen Hawking in BBC interview\n\nBill Joy\n\nBill Joy wrote an extensive essay on the matter in the April, 2000 issue of Wired Magazine. The essay is long (over 11,000 words), sprawling piece that cites a lot of people in the field, but it reads well.\n\nYou can read it here:\n\nIn this wide-ranging piece, Joy draws opinions of varying lengths from John Searle, Ray Kurzweil, Ted Kaczynski (the unabomber), Hans Moravec, Danny Hillis, Irving Stone, George Dyson, Amory and Hunter Lovins, Greg Easterbrook, Richard Feynman, Eric Drexler, Stuart Kauffman, Carl Sagan, Robert Oppenheimer, John Leslie, Arthur C. Clarke, Aristotle, Nietsche, Thoureau, Jacques Attali, The Dalai Lama, and Woody Allen. He also draws some examples from fiction (Frank Herbert, Isaac Asimov, Gene Roddenberry, and Robert Heinlein).\n\nWhile the piece is a great read, and Joy seems to be leaning towards concern, he rarely explicitly explains the danger himself. He most often quotes others and implies that he may agree with them. This leaves us with a series of opinions about the dangers of AI, with some arguments that are hinted at. This one, of instance, is reminiscent of Stephen Hawking’s concern:\n\nRobotic industries would compete vigorously among themselves for matter, energy, and space, incidentally driving their price beyond human reach. Unable to afford the necessities of life, biological humans would be squeezed out of existence. — Bill Joy summarizing Moravec\n\nNote that in order for these so called robotic industries to complete, they have to, in some sense, “want” matter, energy or space.\n\nIn Joy’s essay, the counter arguments to the dangers of AI are often voiced by Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil has a big idea about the benefits of AI, the singularity. If you believe that the technological singularity will transpire, you believe that AI can deliver, essentially, eternal life. Kurzweil’s optimism and exuberance is the primary foil in the essay. But there is another person in the article who disagrees with Ray, but who also has arguments against the dangers of AI.\n\nRay saying that the rate of improvement of technology was going to accelerate and that we were going to become robots or fuse with robots or something like that, and John countering that this couldn’t happen, because the robots couldn’t be conscious. — Bill Joy describing and encounter with Ray Kurzweil and John Searle.\n\nTypes of AI\n\nPerhaps we can shed some light on the matter by taking a closer look at how AI is implemented under the hood. There are two broad areas of research that result in what we call AI. One is statistical learning, and the other is symbolic logic. So, for instance, if you want to create a program that will pass a Turing test, you generally have one, or the other, or a combination of these tools at your disposal.\n\nThe public opinion of these two styles of artificial intelligence has changed over the years. Symbolic logic was considered much more important for a while, but now the press coverage is dominated by advances in statistical learning, and currently this style seems to have the most promise.\n\nStatistical learning\n\nTom Mitchell’s oft-cited definition of machine learning serves us here:\n\nA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. — Tom Mitchell in Machine Learning\n\nThe experience, E, refers to exposure to inputs, or features as well as some notion of how far the output varies from what was expected. This distance is known as error.\n\nSuch an algorithm can learn to classify examples of items under various categories, or it can learn to predict future values based on current inputs. It must essentially provide a mapping from an input, or feature.\n\nAn example of such a task might be diagnosing an underlying medical condition based on the patient’s symptoms, predicting what a potential customer might purchase based on information about the potential customer, or predicting the direction in which a stock moves based on what people on Twitter say.\n\nThe important point to note is that while machine learning can be very clever, it is limited to inferences that can be drawn by the feature set. For instance, if Twitter activity regarding a certain company doesn’t actually have much predictive value regarding the stock price, there is nothing the algorithm can do. And, of course, the algorithm can be mistaken: Spurious correlations can assert themselves, and confuse the most well-intentioned algorithm.\n\nSymbolic logic\n\nSymbolic logic is what we may choose to call the more classical form of AI where you use various forms of predicate logic to represent, and reason about, the world. This often requires a large set of propositional facts that represent the world.\n\nFor instance, one fact might be that people don’t like to be wet. Another fact is that rain causes people to be wet. The AI might conclude that people want to get out of the way of the rain given those facts.\n\nNotice that the AI is able to make inferences, but doesn’t have a particular desire. You have to ask it questions and make it answer you.\n\nSearle and the Chinese Box Computer\n\nWe know that a computer is “just” a machine that moves data around. The appropriate model for thinking about these actions is either manipulating symbols or applying probabilities to inputs. However, we have a tendency to anthropomorphize the actions of the machine.\n\nJohn Searle has a famous thought experiment that serves to illustrate the point.\n\nJohn Searle\n\nIn his paper, Minds, Brains, and Programs (Brain and Behavioural Sciences, 1980, the draft is available here), Searle asks us to engage in a thought experiment:\n\nSuppose that I’m locked in a room and given a large batch of Chinese writing. Suppose furthermore (as is indeed the case) that I know no Chinese, either written or spoken, and that I’m not even confident that I could recognize Chinese writing as Chinese writing distinct from, say, Japanese writing or meaningless squiggles.\n\nSearle extends the thought experiment by giving himself a set of instructions on how to manipulate the to-him-meaningless squiggles. The outcome of his manipulations is perfectly comprehensible Chinese to someone who knows Chinese. Of course, for Searle, the output continues to be meaningless:\n\nTo me, Chinese writing is just so many meaningless squiggles. Now suppose further that after this first batch of Chinese writing I am given a second batch of Chinese script together with a set of rules for correlating the second batch with the first batch. The rules are in English, and I understand these rules as well as any other native speaker of English. They enable me to correlate one set of formal symbols with another set of formal symbols, and all that ‘formal’ means here is that I can identify the symbols entirely by their shapes. Now suppose also that I am given a third batch of Chinese symbols together with some instructions, again in English, that enable me to correlate elements of this third batch with the first two batches, and these rules instruct me how to give back certain Chinese symbols with certain sorts of shapes in response to certain sorts of shapes given me in the third batch. Unknown to me, the people who are giving me all of these symbols call the first batch “a script,” they call the second batch a “story. ‘ and they call the third batch “questions.” Furthermore, they call the symbols I give them back in response to the third batch “answers to the questions.” and the set of rules in English that they gave me, they call “the program.”\n\nSearle then takes the perspective of those outside the room. To them the Chinese answers are indistinguishable from those of an actual Chinese speaker. In other words, the instructions he has been given have helped him pass the Turing test in Chinese.\n\nNow just to complicate the story a little, imagine that these people also give me stories in English, which I understand, and they then ask me questions in English about these stories, and I give them back answers in English. Suppose also that after a while I get so good at following the instructions for manipulating the Chinese symbols and the programmers get so good at writing the programs that from the external point of view that is, from the point of view of somebody outside the room in which I am locked — my answers to the questions are absolutely indistinguishable from those of native Chinese speakers. Nobody just looking at my answers can tell that I don’t speak a word of Chinese.\n\nFinally, he also answers questions in English. This lets Searle distinguish the distinct ways in which Searle prepares the two answers and the differences between them. In one case he understands the questions and in the other he does not.\n\nLet us also suppose that my answers to the English questions are, as they no doubt would be, indistinguishable from those of other native English speakers, for the simple reason that I am a native English speaker. From the external point of view — from the point of view of someone reading my “answers” — the answers to the Chinese questions and the English questions are equally good. But in the Chinese case, unlike the English case, I produce the answers by manipulating uninterpreted formal symbols. As far as the Chinese is concerned, I simply behave like a computer; I perform computational operations on formally specified elements. For the purposes of the Chinese, I am simply an instantiation of the computer program. — John Searle in ‘Minds, Brains, Programs’\n\nJohn Searle makes his point in a number of ways, some of which might strike the casual reader as specialized, which they are. To summarize it one way, he says that intentionality is a “product of causal properties” of brains and not programs. Or, to do so another way, “John Searle argued for this position with the Chinese room thought experiment, according to which no syntactic operations that occurred in a computer would provide it with semantic content.”\n\nBut Searle’s example itself best clarifies the underlying intuition: you can re-arrange the bits of paper so it looks like you know Chinese, but it doesn’t follow that you actually know Chinese. And when you re-arrange the paper, you are doing what a program does, not what a brain does.\n\nIntentionality, Semantics and Free Will\n\nSo what does it mean that a computer doesn’t have intentionality? We might infer some corollaries to this proposition: that a machine cannot have subjectivity, or interiority, or a sense of self (“qualia”), or free will or desire.\n\nSearle himself implied his belief in some of these corollaries. Recall that in his original conversation with Bill Joy, he said something along those lines:\n\nwith Ray saying that the rate of improvement of technology was going to accelerate and that we were going to become robots or fuse with robots or something like that, and John countering that this couldn’t happen, because the robots couldn’t be conscious.\n\nAnd why it matters that they can’t be conscious — that they are essentially shuffling bits of paper around in a box — is because then they cannot want things. They don’t desire to take over the world, or consume more resources, or anything else for that matter.\n\nA machine needs to at least have an analog of a desire to do something before it does it. For a biological system, it “wants” to live. This desire emerges from several millennia of evolution. A machine doesn’t want food, of course, but it has no direct reason to “want” to live.\n\nSuch machines are not moral or immoral any more than a falling rock is moral or immoral.\n\nIt is for this reason that Elon Musk need not fear the demon because it is a demon without a will. And Stephen Hawking need not fear that robots will supersede us. Even if they do — when they do — it won’t mean they will want to take our resources. They will essentially be shuffling pieces of paper in the box.\n\nThe unknown unknowns\n\nTo be perfectly fair to Musk, there is another component to his argument. Musk argues, about the stand-in for humanity, that “he’s sure he can control the demon. Didn’t work out.”\n\nOn this view, the primary danger is not that the AI will take our resources, or compete with us, but that we don’t really know what may happen. This is a more general kind of concern that applies equally to, say, nuclear weaponry or genetic modification.\n\nThere is a symmetry to the argument that AI will evolve so that we won’t be able to understand or control it. The singularity argument, made primarily by Ray Kurzweil, goes something like this: the exponential increase in machine intelligence will continue beyond our human ability to comprehend them, and eventually AI will improve themselves leaving humans far behind. We won’t be able to fathom what they can do, or how they do it.\n\nThe argument is almost identical in form to Musk’s, except that in this case the results are benign, and serve human ends. Kurzweil believes AI will create breakthroughs in medicine, extend and improve our lives.\n\nFrom both perspectives, the point seems to be that we cannot imagine the changes that super-intelligent AI will bring about. Strictly speaking, we should not be able to comment on the issue after that point. If the whole point of the technological singularity is that it is beyond our ability to understand it, how can we have an opinion on it?\n\nBut of course opinions abound, and reproduce the earlier arguments. Even though we may not know what will happen, Musk gives us the example of the demon-summoner, and Kurzweil is confident that our life spans will be increased.\n\nPerhaps the answer is also the same as the one Searle presents. However computers change, they won’t have innate desires. They will be programmed by people. It still won’t be in their nature to want things.\n\nBut perhaps not, if they become truly knowable. I can only bring up another philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein: whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent.",

  "latent_22915": "Then a younger man appeared with a walkie-talkie. He said to Honnold: “You can’t do that here. If you’re going to do that, go somewhere else, O.K.?” Chastened and blushing again, Honnold walked away.\n\nIn November, Clif Bar, a major sponsor of Honnold and Potter, said it would no longer support them because of discomfort with their extreme risk-taking. Honnold responded with an Op-Ed article in this newspaper, accepting the company’s decision but declaring his intention to keep free-soloing. “If I have a particular gift, it’s a mental one,” he wrote. “The ability to keep it together where others might freak out. . . . Whether or not we’re sponsored, the mountains are calling, and we must go.”\n\nTwo months later, Tommy Caldwell’s Dawn Wall free-climb — in which he was roped up and securely protected, risk kept to a bare minimum — received international media attention and was widely hailed as the hardest rock climb ever done. I spoke to Honnold by telephone shortly afterward and asked how he thought about his free-soloing heroes nowadays. Honnold pointed out that Bachar, the original Yosemite free-soloist, remained bitterly committed to purist forms of climbing, even after he fathered a son. Bachar free-soloed until 2009, when he fell to his death from an easy climb near his home in Mammoth Lakes, Calif. Honnold claimed to feel much greater admiration for Peter Croft, “a happily married man” whose “eyes still light up like a child’s when he talks about climbing,” although he does it mostly with ropes these days.\n\nBut when I called Honnold on another occasion, he was lying in the meadow below El Capitan, looking up. “I feel kind of directionless,” he said. “Like, what’s my Dawn Wall?” I asked if a free-solo of El Capitan was still on his mind. Honnold admitted that it was the final unclimbed item on his private shortlist of dream free-solos. In 2013, he spent eight days at El Sendero Luminoso, in the desert of northern Mexico, dangling from ropes, memorizing hundreds of discrete movement sequences on tiny holds, before free-soloing it in January last year. This winter, Honnold free-soloed the second route on his list: Romantic Warrior, a 1,000-foot climb up a remote cliff in the southern Sierra Nevada, which had been free-soloed only once, in 2005, by a climber named Michael Reardon, who died two years later when he climbed without ropes down an Irish sea cliff and was swept away by a wave. The third challenge was University Wall, a notoriously difficult climb just north of Vancouver, a route that Peter Croft was the first to free-climb but never climbed without a rope. A young, up-and-coming free-soloist named Marc-Andre Leclerc, who lives near University Wall, was getting good enough to free-solo it. Honnold, who had been eyeing it for years, seized that prize for himself on his most recent trip last August.\n\nBut El Capitan is substantially bigger than any of these climbs, and it presents unique logistical challenges. The hardest part is 2,000 feet up, in a feature known as the Teflon Corner. “Anything called the Teflon Corner is not sweet for free-soloing,” Honnold said. He told me that he would consider an El Capitan free-solo only in the autumn, when the summer heat fades, the rock cools and Teflon Corner becomes less slippery. But the days are short then, and Honnold would still want to climb the Teflon Corner before the sun hit it; that would require starting well before dawn and free-soloing perhaps a thousand feet in the dark. If he decided to do it, he would need to spend days or even weeks roped up, climbing the Teflon Corner dozens of times in advance, mastering every move. Meanwhile, the world would be watching. “That would be so much pressure,” he told me. “All my friends would be texting me, like: ‘What are you doing? Don’t be stupid!’ Then some random guy would see me in the grocery store and be like, ‘When are you going to free-solo it?’ ”",

  "latent_23178": "Many smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa farm on communal land. Land tenure rights are a critical step in incentivizing farmers to invest in long-term solutions that will ultimately end hunger and poverty. Photo by: Fintrac\n\nEnding extreme hunger and poverty within a generation is an ambitious but achievable goal.\n\nProperty systems that offer insufficient protection for small-scale farmers are just one of the major challenges we face to reach this goal. To have any hope of incentivizing behaviors — whether adopting good agricultural practices, new innovative agricultural technologies, or investments in improved inputs — we must have a legal and institutional framework that ensures farmers will have confidence in realizing a return on their investment.\n\nA growing body of academic literature supports the notion that agricultural productivity increases often occur when land users perceive improvements to their property rights. Whether offered through a formal, state-managed tenure system or a customary system, farmers must be confident in their rights to access, use, and reap benefits from their land. When smallholder farmers believe that their rights will be recognized and enforced, they can and often do make important investments such as installing raised beds, investing in simple irrigation systems, or purchasing improved inputs. Property rights protections grant farmers the ability to begin thinking and operating their farms with a long-term, business-minded perspective, beyond todays’ land access, and beyond a single growing season. When farmers have little faith that their land rights will be honored, limited investment and short-term planning is logical behavior. Across much of sub-Saharan Africa, farmers face considerable limitations on obtaining clear property rights.\n\nSmall farmers on formally titled land face notoriously complex administrative burdens and costs when securing their interests in rural land parcels. In Bangladesh, agricultural landowners in peri-rural locations reported that the cost of registering rural land required eight distinct administrative procedures over a 218-day period and at an astonishing cost equal to 228 percent of annual gross domestic product per capita. In Zambia, farmers must pay an average cost of 225 percent of annual GDP per capita to register their property interest for rural agricultural land, placing the benefits of rural land tenure protection out of reach for the average citizen. This data does not even take into consideration unofficial costs that farmers may face on top of formal expenses. Property protections available only to the richest citizens of a country are insufficient protections for an effective agricultural system.\n\nMuch has been written about the unpredictability inherent in the dynamic interplay between customary land tenure system and formal land tenure systems, and for good reason. In countries that have yet to fully recognize and offer equal weight to customary land claims, agricultural lands with no clear formal title are often listed as simply “government land” or “public land” with no recognition of claims by the users of land. For the majority of sub-Saharan farmers, rights to the land are established through a customary land tenure system, with lands often owned in common with members of a tribe or community, and with use rights distributed through a system presided over by a tribal chief or a set of community leaders.\n\nThis unpredictability has increased as agricultural land scarcity attracts greater numbers of investors seeking access to large tracts of agricultural land, generally within the customary land system. Non-recognition of customary claims has enabled instances of property transfers without just compensation for land rights or the value of crops on the land, and without even notice and an opportunity for dialogue. Some positive examples show a possible way forward: Mozambique and Papua New Guinea stand out as countries that have undertaken significant steps toward reconciling customary land tenure systems with the formal tenure system to lead to a modern, integrated tenure system. However, these still remain the exception rather than the rule. For many countries, the separation between formal and informal systems has resulted in stifling unpredictability for investors and rural communities alike.\n\nTo aid in this effort and to offer a vision for a way forward, in 2012 the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization introduced the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of Tenure, providing policymakers and donors alike with guidance reflecting international best practices on the governance of tenure. Many of the guidelines laid out in this important document directly address sources of uncertainty in land tenure. Perhaps most importantly, corporations are starting to take notice. Both Coca-Cola and PespiCo have formally announced their support and have announced intentions to ensure compliance with the voluntary guidelines throughout their supply chains.\n\nJoin the conversation with our LinkedIn group! How can efforts to formalize customary land rights balance local customs with international best practices?\n\nPolicymakers and local stakeholders must move forward with renewed efforts to address the systemic uncertainty facing producers and rural land tenure rights, particularly through more meaningful implementation of the voluntary guidelines. To set a proper trajectory for the elimination of extreme hunger by 2040, we must prioritize today policies and institutional reforms to help farmers see the benefits from their own investment into their lands. Land tenure reforms must be a top priority to ensure we will indeed feed our world’s future.\n\nWant to learn more?

Brazil won 2-1, but Colombia got their revenge a year later in Chile, with a 1-0 victory in the 2015 Copa America. This, too, was a highly intense affair. Indeed, Neymar was sent off and handed a four-game ban.\n\nBrazil Brazil Colombia Colombia 2 1 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nThat match remains the only time Neymar has been on the losing side for Brazil in a competitive game at senior level (pedants at this point might be tempted to bring up the 2011 Copa America quarterfinal against Paraguay, but that was on a penalty shootout and counts in the records as a draw). The key to the result -- Colombia's first victory over Brazil in more than 20 years -- was Carlos Sanchez's superb marking job on Neymar, which drove the then-Brazilian captain to heights of frustration he was unable to control.\n\nTuesday's game becomes a fascinating match up once more, because Brazil's task is very different from the one they faced -- and carried out extremely well -- in Thursday's 3-0 win away to Ecuador. In Quito, new coach Tite's side set out to annul the Ecuadorians. The game was still goalless with 20 minutes to go, but after opening the scoring and seeing the opposition have a man sent off, Brazil broke out to give the scoreline an emphatic look with two more goals in the closing stages of the match.\n\nAgainst Colombia, Brazil will be expected to take the initiative, to play their way through Sanchez and Co. It may prove a hard task for a team that have had such little time on the training ground together, but if he has had next to no time to work with his players, Tite has had plenty of opportunity to study the opposition. He brought his intelligence to bear identifying Ecuador's strengths and working out how to counter them, which explains the otherwise strange decision to recall Paulinho -- who performed an important marking role, especially in closing down Ecuador's playmaker Christian Noboa. But will Paulinho be retained for the game against Colombia? Or might Tite opt for a midfielder who offers more elaboration, such as Lucas Lima?\n\nIt is worth dwelling on that 1-0 Colombia victory a little over a year ago, because it was the team's only bright moment in a deeply disappointing Copa America campaign. Not only was it their only win, the goal scrambled home by centre-back Jeison Murillo was their only one in four games.\n\nWhat was apparent then was that Colombia had become a team without a lot of midfield elaboration, strange for a side coached by Argentine manager Jose Pekerman. There seemed to be very little link between the defensive unit and holding midfielders on one hand and the attacking unit on the other. Some progress has since been made, but the same characteristic was evident in the recent Copa Centenario, when Colombia played all of their best football on the counterattack and struggled mightily -- as in the goalless quarterfinal against Peru -- when asked to impose themselves on the game.\n\nMacnelly Torres scored Colombia's second goal in the 2-0 win over Venezuela.\n\nThe response for last Thursday's 2-0 win at home to Venezuela was the recall of midfielder Macnelly Torres, one of South American football's great enigmas. 'Mac' Torres is a wonderful supplier of the surprise pass, but he is not a natural athlete. He missed the 2014 World Cup after a move to the Middle East to join Al-Shabab robbed him of some of his fitness, but he has since found form at Atletico Nacional of Medellin, most recently in their run to becoming Copa Libertadores champions. He is looking fit and sharp, highlighted by his burst into the area to score Colombia's second goal against Venezuela.\n\nWill Pekerman keep him in the starting lineup for the game against Brazil? He is already without one of his defensive midfielders -- Daniel Torres is suspended -- and so there might be a temptation to play it cautious, get men behind the ball and go on the break. It is here that Colombia have some potent weapons, with a quick attacking trident of Carlos Bacca flanked by James and Luis Muriel. James will likely float infield from the right, making space for right-back Santiago Arias, back after suspension, to make some well-judged forward bursts. On the left, Muriel looked strong and threatening vs. Venezuela and could well give Brazil right-back Daniel Alves some problems. Pekerman can also call on Juan Cuadrado and Marlos Moreno from the bench.\n\nThis time, then, the boot might be on the other foot. If the game is still goalless with 20 minutes to go, Brazil might fear a Colombian break out. These are the kind of challenges that test a team and leave the South American squads that qualify for the World Cup well prepared to give a good account of themselves.\n\nTim Vickery covers South American football for ESPN FC.

  "latent_23283": "Now that the last American combat soldier has walked across the desert out of Iraq, and the Obama administration seems poised to end our military involvement in Afghanistan over howls from the military’s brass and war machine manufacturers, the question returns: What now for the men and women who fought those wars in our name?\n\nOlder combat veterans know, and younger veterans and their loved ones are finding out, that the battle for how to live out the rest of your life begins after you’ve come home and taken off your uniform for the last time, with your wounds, memories of your fallen comrades, and the agitation that makes a full night’s sleep difficult without drink or drug long after the last firefight.\n\nSo the veterans who gathered at the California Democratic Party‘s Veterans Caucus meeting last week in San Diego were eager to find out what California’s political leaders might do about the alarming rates of homelessness, unemployment, suicide, and disability among the state’s veterans.\n\nLA’s the Homeless Capital for Veterans, Too\n\n“We have unprecedented levels of homeless veterans in California,” acknowledged California State Assembly Speaker John Perez, who convened the Democratic Party’s meeting and who represents an impoverished district near downtown Los Angeles. “My district has among the highest levels of homelessness in California.”\n\nNationwide, an estimated 76,000 veterans are homeless on a given night, with 130,000 spending at least one night in a homeless shelter, a growing number of them women veterans, according to David Zucchino of the Los Angeles Times:\n\n“Veterans make up 8% of the U.S. population, but almost 16% of homeless adults. Half of all homeless veterans suffer from mental illness, and two-thirds are substance abusers.”\n\nIn Los Angeles County, about 7,400 veterans are homeless, including “about 1,415 veterans considered to be chronically homeless, meaning they have been homeless for at least a year and suffer from a serious health issue, mental illness or addiction.”\n\nIn San Diego County, home to a huge US Navy presence and just down the road from the Marine Corps Camp Pendleton, 35%, or 3,000, of the county’s 8,500 homeless are veterans.\n\nSpeaker Perez announced that the Assembly has taken $2 million out of its operating budget to help returning veterans, especially those from the California National Guard, admittedly a drop in the bucket with so many veterans living on our streets.\n\n“We’re also integrating discussions about veteran homelessness and what to do about it in all our committees, not just the Veterans Committee,” continued Perez, who had been invited by Caucus Chair Rick Reyes to keynote the meeting. “Those dealing with housing, education, and labor need to be part of the conversation, too.”\n\nDeveloping LA’s National Home for Veterans\n\nDuring the Veterans Caucus meeting, Joe Halper of the Pacific Palisades Democratic Club presented a resolution calling for the Department of Veterans Affairs to devote its 387-acre compound in West Los Angeles for its intended purpose of serving disabled veterans, which might then put a dent in the County’s homeless veterans property. The resolution was overwhelming approved and quickly gathered endorsements by a number of elected Democrats representing West LA.\n\nThe resolution attempts to resolve an ongoing battle to return the sprawling hospital campus and renovate its dilapidated buildings for their originally intended use of rehabilitating and housing veterans, rather than being leased for use as “a public golf course, a college baseball stadium, a theatre and practice fields for the exclusive private Brentwood School.”At one point, 4,000 veterans were housed at that facility, but are now barred from entering it.\n\nA Veteran Commits Suicide Every 80 Minutes\n\n“More Vietnam veterans have committed suicide than the 55,000 who were killed in combat,” said Bob Filner, the 10-term congressman who capped the evening’s meeting. “The same is true for today’s two wars, which haven’t even completely ended.”\n\nAccording to Filner, who is running to be San Diego’s mayor, “The official count is more than 5,000 service members killed and more than 40,000 wounded in the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars. But more than 1 million veterans have come to the VA for help -— mostly with traumatic brain injuries. That’s not a rounding error.”\n\nCompounding the problems veterans face is the difficult job market, as studies indicate a strong correlation between joblessness and suicide.\n\nCurrently, for younger veterans aged 18 to 24, who have recently returned from Iraq and Afghanistan, their unemployment rate is 30.4%, up from 18.4% a year earlier, compared to 15.3% for non veterans of the same age.\n\n“When soldiers leave the military, they lose what service provides: purpose, focus, achievement, responsibility and…“belongingness,”” according to Peter D. Kramer, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Brown University. “The workplace can be stressful, but especially for the mentally vulnerable, there is no substitute for what jobs offer in the way of structure, support and meaning.”\n\nTo deal with these issues, Filner had advocated for a GI Bill for the 21st Century to get today’s veterans into the workforce the way their fathers and grandfathers did after earlier wars.\n\n“Millions of World War II veterans went to college on the GI Bill and millions more bought houses with VA loans. That created the middle class in America,” Filner said. “Why can’t we do the same thing for today’s veterans?”\n\nFilner also said that, if elected mayor, he would open a veterans’ office right in city hall and advised the Veterans Affairs Department to grant relief to the 100,000 Vietnam veterans who have applied for Agent Orange care, rather than letting them die off, as seems to be the plan.\n\nPledging to focus the Veterans Caucus on jobs, housing, and homelessness this year, Caucus Chair Rick Reyes concluded the evening on a hopeful note.\n\nBut the outcome of the battle over the National Veterans Home in Brentwood will be a bellwether. If something good comes out of that controversy for veterans, we’ll know the meeting was worth the drive down to San Diego. If not, we’ll know it’s just more politicos running up to the microphone boasting how much they “support the troops.”\n\nUntil, you know, something else comes along.\n\nDick Price\n\nEditor, LA Progressive",
  "latent_23449": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nSome 50 years ago, Njord, the mythological Norsk god of wealth, smiled on the hardworking fishermen and lumberjacks, and presented Norway with the gift of oil. In financial terms, this was a handsome gift indeed, currently translated into a natural bounty worth $740 billion.\n\nSuccessive Norwegian governments pledged to save this wealth for the welfare of future generations. Yet, half a century after this windfall began, questions increasingly arise of whether Norway’s handling of its oil wealth has even withstood the test of the past, much less the future.\n\nThe country’s 2013 election campaign spawned a debate about the government’s management of the massive Norwegian Oil Fund. Norwegian citizens, however, have been trapped within a virtual bubble: Far from raising and discussing serious concerns, the debate in which the country has been engaged is fundamentally flawed. Behind the rosy picture that Norway’s leaders have painted of the country’s economy lie some difficult truths. We have only to chip away a little at this bright facade to realize that a far less glittering reality lies beneath the surface.\n\nFirst, the oil fund is a mathematical artifice. At three-quarters of a trillion dollars, the Norwegian Oil Fund appears to provide plenty for a country with scarcely 5 million citizens. Yet the country has accumulated a foreign debt that, at $657 billion, is almost as massive. Subtracting the debt from the fund’s $740 billion leaves a balance of only $83 billion. In other words, there is a treasure chest, but it is almost empty: Njord’s prize for future generations is only a little more than 10 percent of its putative value.\n\nEven if we take the fund’s worth at face value, its future is not guaranteed. In a 2011 analysis, “What Does Norway Get Out Of Its Oil Fund, if Not More Strategic Infrastructure Investment?” University of Missouri economist and Wall Street financial analyst Michael Hudson offered a stark assessment: The Norwegian oil monies are invested mainly in the unstable economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, or in volatile real estate in the West.\n\nAlthough the fund records short-term profits from its holdings of bond and stocks, its strategy is one of “speculate and diversify.” It is based on the hope that spreading the risk widely enough can hedge against a catastrophic collapse in a particular region or sector. Yet in today’s turbulent economic environment, this seems to be a strategy for multiplying exposure to speculative risks rather than protecting against them. Thus, not only does Norway’s massive debt render the fund’s true value largely illusory, the future of the fund itself is highly precarious.\n\nThe second awkward fact Norwegians have yet to confront is that their country’s disproportionate dependence on oil hangs like an economic sword of Damocles above its head. In August, the Economist predicted that following improvements in shale-gas technologies and the development of electric cars, a significant decrease in the demand for oil is rapidly approaching. Although marginally referenced in the Norwegian Finance Ministry’s most recent self-congratulatory white paper, “Long-term Perspectives on the Norwegian Economy 2013,” Norway’s administrators chose to gloss over this glaring issue, preferring the relative safety of a somewhat theoretical and speculative prognostication about the country’s economy in 2035-2060.\n\nIf technical improvements in the field of alternative energy indeed continue, and if forecasts of an imminent and substantial drop in demand for oil is correct, the consequences for Norway could be catastrophic. Its gross domestic product (GDP), today concentrated on oil and its derivatives, could collapse. Its exports will crash, and with its current massive levels of public-sector spending, the important ratio of public debt to GDP — currently at around 30 percent — will spiral, bringing the country close to default. Norway could, very quickly, find itself in a much worse economic state than it was before the discovery of oil.\n\nThe flip side of this dependence on oil provides the third major structural weakness in the Norwegian economy: The country’s non-oil industrial infrastructure has been seriously neglected. Although the election campaign yielded talk of improving it, such plans may be too little and too late. Oil and its related industries drain the labor force, driving up labor costs as relatively few hands are available for more productive sectors.\n\nMoreover, the accountants and bankers who manage the oil fund claim that spending too much on domestic infrastructure and investments in industrial production would overwhelm the small local economy and cause inflation. Incredibly, only 4 percent of the fund may be utilized for such purposes. This compares with the 60 percent that Mr. Hudson recommends be used for direct investments in domestic and regional enterprises to ensure that the Norwegian economy is viable after the oil wells run dry.\n\nThe Norwegian people are understandably proud of the massive nest egg they think they possess. The truth hidden from ordinary Norwegians is that much of the country’s oil bounty has already been squandered. If Norway is to avoid being drawn inexorably into the abyss, it must fundamentally reassess its policies and learn the lessons of the global developments that have affected the world of finance and real estate since the 1960s.\n\nAfter 50 years of complacency, time is now working against the Norwegian people. Njord is no longer smiling on them, but will they notice?\n\nJerome Vitenberg is an international political analyst.

  "latent_23700": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three months after a team of international law enforcement officials raided the digital currency firm Liberty Reserve, cyber experts say criminals are increasingly turning to another online currency called Perfect Money.\n\nPreet Bharara, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, describes charges against Costa Rica-based Liberty Reserve, one of the worlds largest digital currency companies and seven of it's principals and employees for allegedly running a $6 billion money laundering scheme at a news conference in New York, May 28, 2013. REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nIdan Aharoni, the head of cyber intelligence at EMC Corp’s RSA security division, said that some online scam artists and thieves are using Perfect Money’s digital currency to launder money and conceal profits in much the same way they allegedly did with Liberty Reserve’s currency.\n\nOn behalf of their clients, which include major financial institutions, Aharoni and his team monitor Internet forums that hackers use to sell stolen credit card information. After Liberty Reserve was taken down in May, activity on these forums initially slowed and then picked up again, with some hackers saying they would accept Perfect Money for payments, he said.\n\n“We expected a large migration to another e-currency, and that has happened,” said Aharoni, whose RSA unit sells security services to 30,000 corporations and government agencies, including the popular Secure ID tokens that protect access to computer systems.\n\nPerfect Money, which has been in operation since at least 2007, could not be reached for comment. A request submitted through its website failed to elicit a response, and the company does not list a phone number for its offices or identify any management or employees.\n\nReuters could not determine who owns Perfect Money. Its website says it is based in Panama, but the Panamanian government said in a statement in January that Perfect Money does not have offices in the country and has not been issued any licenses by securities regulators to operate there.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in the United States and around the world have expressed concerns that digital currencies, which are not tied to any particular government, are emerging as vehicles for hackers, cyber criminals and drug dealers to launder money.\n\nCurrencies like Perfect Money are governed by a single company or entity that administers the transfer of units between customers. Once a user obtains an account, he or she can transfer Perfect Money units to other users inside the system. These units can be redeemed for cash or bank credit by third-party exchange services, which are separate businesses not under control of the currency’s operator.\n\nOnline vendors of all kinds can choose to accept digital currencies like Perfect Money as payment for their goods and services. But the feature that makes some digital currencies ideal for money laundering is anonymity. User identities can be kept hidden, both from each other and, with varying degrees of effort, from the currency operator itself through false names and locations.\n\nU.S. prosecutors in May accused Liberty Reserve’s Costa Rica-based operations of laundering some $6 billion in illicit profits over about seven years. Authorities arrested Liberty Reserve’s principals and shuttered the firm.\n\nSeth Ginsberg, a lawyer for former Liberty Reserve principal Mark Marmilev, who has pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges, said it is not fair for the authorities to punish his client because some customers use Liberty Reserve to hide their illicit activities.\n\n“It’s my understanding that Liberty Reserve was designed to compete with mainstream financial providers. The fact that it may have been misused by various customers should not reflect on the company,” said Ginsburg.\n\n“There is a legitimate need for alternatives to the mainstream financial market, so the fact that there’s another company out there filling the void left by Liberty Reserve is not surprising.”\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. law enforcement agency that focuses most closely on cyber attacks on financial institutions, declined to comment.\n\nVIRTUAL MONEY\n\nVenture capitalists and free market advocates have voiced strong support for online currencies such as Bitcoin, saying they are alternatives to conventional monetary systems that can burden the poorest people in the world with transaction fees.\n\nThe more due diligence that currency operators perform on their customers, mostly by verifying the personal information they submit when signing up for an account, the harder it is for criminals to use them to launder money.\n\nAccording to its website, Perfect Money performs an identity check on each customer to try to identify the computer used to enter the account. It said the company collects information about each customer’s online activity and monitors transactions for signs of suspicious activity.\n\nPerfect Money is not the only payment system that cyber criminals use, experts said. Stefan Savage, a computer science professor at the University of California, said he had observed several different currencies, including Bitcoin, being used by people selling stolen credit cards in Internet hacker forums.\n\n“Perfect Money is certainly one that comes up a lot,” Savage said. “There are tons of these payment systems out there.”\n\nPatrick Murck, general counsel for The Bitcoin Foundation, declined to comment. The Foundation is a non-profit group of software developers and entrepreneurs that helps promote the use of Bitcoin as a currency. Bitcoin exists through an open-source software program and is not managed by any one company. Its supply is controlled through a computer algorithm.\n\nA Reuters review of postings on Internet message boards for digital currencies found hackers offering to sell stolen credit cards are open about accepting Perfect Money as payment.\n\n“If it was expected at first that the Liberty Reserve takedown would have a long-lasting, substantial effect on the level of fraud, that’s not true,” Aharoni said.\n\nTyler Moore, an assistant professor at Southern Methodist University, said a 2011 study he conducted with two other academics found that Liberty Reserve and Perfect Money were two of the most widely accepted digital currencies for online Ponzi schemes. Of 1,000 websites that linked to Perfect Money, they found 70 percent that were Ponzi schemes.\n\n“Perfect Money seems to be a very popular choice among this subculture,” Moore said.",
  "latent_23723": "Two summers ago I had the great opportunity to visit the town of Trinidad, California - a rugged and eroding bay with a quiet seaside charm. One of the shots I had in mind was a night view of the Trinidad Pier, stretching out 550 feet past the massive Little Trinidad Head and into the rocky harbor. The pier lit up in a string of lights at night, which I imagined would illuminate the rock and create a soft contrast against the blue-dark of night.\n\nIt was quite the cloudy/overcast day, so I got down there from a sunset shoot at Luffenholtz Beach just as the residual yellows were fading away on the opposite horizon (this view faces southeast):\n\nAbout 30 minutes later the ambient lighting was just about perfect. Now would be fantastic timing for them to flick on...\n\nAfter hanging out for nearly an hour, the pier finally came to life:\n\nThanks for taking into account the photogenic potential of your public works, Trinidad Bay Tourism Bureau.\n\nBut all was not lost! Seasoned long exposure photographers know of a technique called dark frame subtraction, used to remove repeating noise patterns. After taking a noisy image, one can take a second image with the lens cap on, eliminating all ambient light and capturing only the repeating noise pattern. This \"dark frame\" can then be applied as a straight up subtraction on the original image, eliminating the noise pattern.\n\nWith the last image of the lights, it had gotten late enough that the ambient lighting had essentially become zero'd out, and I had a dark frame containing just the pier lights. Rather than subtracting, I could apply this as an addition (linear dodge in Photoshop) to my original exposure, adding in the lights to the ambient scene as if pier was lit up at that time.\n\nTrinidad Pier A composite image of the lit-up pier after it failed to light up after sunset. See my blog post for details on the technique.\n\nVoila! I did have to do some masking to exclude the restaurant lights and the very left end of Trinidad, since this was lit the same in both frames and would have essentially resulted in a double-exposure. But other than that it's a very simple and accurate compositing technique for those situations where the cityscape doesn't quite light up on the same schedule as your fading sunset.\n\nHere's a little animation showing it all together:\n\nDark Frame Addition demonstration\n\nTags",

  "latent_23869": "In one frame of the video, a masked fighter for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) brandishes a knife, with a beheaded American journalist just beyond view. In another, the Mosque of the Prophet Jonah disappears into a cloud of dust. A crowd of masked gunmen hold Kalashnikovs aloft. Dramatic music plays in the background. But this isn’t a recruitment video for ISIL. It’s a campaign ad for Allen Weh, who is running against Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., in the Nov. 4 midterm elections. Since Aug. 28, when President Barack Obama told reporters, “We don't have a strategy yet” for Syria, ISIL has been a major topic in congressional races across the country. The extremist group controlling a large chunk of Iraq and Syria features in at least 17 campaign ads in 13 races, from New Hampshire to Arizona and Alaska. Most have been aired by Republican hopefuls facing Democratic incumbents. “National security has emerged as one of the top issues in this election, and as with other issues, Americans are not confident in the competence of the Obama administration to keep them and their families safe,” Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said. Poll numbers bear out that assessment, at least in part. In a Pew Research Center poll conducted in September, 75 percent of registered voters surveyed said that \"terrorism\" was “very important” for their vote in the congressional elections. Also last month, a CBS News/New York Times poll found that 57 percent of Americans surveyed thought Obama has been too soft on ISIL. Those numbers shot up quickly this fall as footage of ISIL fighters bheading Western journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff began circulating online. According to Alec Tyson, a senior researcher at Pew, ISIL has driven a shift in Americans’ views on how directly engaged the U.S. should be in world affairs.\n\nAbove, a campaign ad featuring ISIL video footage, released by the campaign of Allen Weh, U.S. Senate candidate from New Mexico. “Relatively high percentages [previously] thought the U.S. was too involved in the world, but ISIL has changed that,” said Tyson. “ISIL is changing the public’s view of how involved the U.S. needs to be in the world.” Now some Republicans are going out of their way to tie their Democratic opponents to Obama, who many voters feel has mishandled the situation in Iraq and Syria. That has some comparing this election with the 2006 midterms, when George W. Bush’s unpopular foreign policy contributed to a Democratic wave that unseated Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate. “People are very concerned about their security,” irrespective of party affiliation, said Scarpinato. However, polls show that Democratic and independent voters may not share Republicans’ level of concern about ISIL. One Pew poll found that terrorism was “very important” to 87 percent of Republican voters surveyed, compared with 67 percent of Democratic voters. In another, 82 percent of Republicans said they were “very concerned” about \"Islamic extremism\" around the world, compared with 60 percent of independents and 51 percent of Democrats. However, rallying their base may be enough for Republicans in these elections, when many Democrats and independents appear likely to stay home. “To the extent that it is activating one party’s base more during a midterm that’s about turnout, I think Republicans are more focused on this,” Tyson explained. Many campaign ads focus on the menace ISIL poses to the United States. “America is under a new threat of terrorism,” says one National Republican Congressional Committee ad, aimed at Rep. Rick Nolan, D-Minn. Another ad, from Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is contesting Sen. Mark Pryor’s seat, warns that “in the Middle East, radical terrorists are on the march, destabilizing our allies, beheading Americans and crucifying Christians.”\n\n‘Relatively high percentages thought the U.S. was too involved in the world, but ISIL has changed that. ISIL is changing the public’s view of how involved the U.S. needs to be in the world.’ Alec Tyson Pew Research Center\n\nUntil recently, many analysts warned that fears about the group attacking the U.S. were misplaced. At the time, it seemed that ISIL’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was focused on building a caliphate across Iraq and Syria rather than attacking Western countries. “He wants to redraw the map,” said Imran Khan, Al Jazeera’s Iraq correspondent, who has reported extensively on ISIL. But on Sept. 22 in a new ISIL video, the group’s spokesman, Abu Mohammed Ali al-Adnani, calls on its supporters to attack soldiers and civilians in the U.S. “This is the moment when a declaration of war was made against the U.S. and its allies,” Khan said. “ISIL gets their message out, and they want to be talked about. They want to be turned into a group that strikes fear into the hearts of the American people,” he explained. “And inadvertently, that’s exactly what the Republicans are doing.” Wendy Rogers, who’s running for a House seat against Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., had to cut footage showing Foley and his executioner from a campaign ad after it sparked controversy. But several other ads that show the ISIL fighter who beheaded Foley without showing Foley himself have not drawn wide criticism. Almost all the ads that mention ISIL use footage of fighters showing off captured U.S. weapons, detaining Iraqi security forces or brandishing the group's flag.\n\nLast week’s other headlines certainly didn’t ease fears about extremism. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, reportedly a convert to Islam, is suspected of opening fire in the Canadian Parliament building after killing a soldier at the National War Memorial. That came just two days after another man with suspected extremist sympathies ran his car into two Canadian soldiers in Quebec, killing one. Both incidents are likely to fan fears of such attacks in the U.S. But as American political campaigns turn fears of ISIL into poll number boosters and attack ads, the group’s own public relations wing is working to shape its image among the American public. “They know exactly what they're doing,” said Amanda Rogers, a scholar of Middle Eastern media at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. “They're absolutely brilliant at it.” ISIL has distinguished itself with media savvy, high production value propaganda and clever use of social networks. It has Twitter accounts, a digital magazine and high-quality recruiting videos that feature native English speakers. According to Rogers, ISIL carefully designs its videos and publications to spread fear and gain recruits. When political campaigns turn those images into ads, Rogers said, they’re amplifying ISIL’s message. “There is no difference between the political and entertainment, and that is the biggest force multiplier of all time for ISIL,” she said. “A selfish politician will take the opportunity to scare you so you get behind him, on all sides,” said Rogers. “[ISIL is] really well aware of how the Western media operates.”",

  "latent_23909": "President Trump, Mexico trade barbs over who's going to pay for the wall\n\nCLOSE Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement the country will not, \"under any circumstances,\" pay for Donald Trump's proposed border wall. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nPresident Trump insisted Monday that Mexico would indeed pay for his proposed barrier along the U.S.-Mexican border, a day after the country said in a strong statement that it would not.\n\n\"One way or another, Mexico is going to pay for the wall,\" the president said during a press conference. \"It may be through reimbursement, but one way or another, Mexico will pay for the wall.\"\n\nHe later added that the initial funding may come from the United States, but that Mexico would \"ultimately\" pay for it.\n\nNever mind that Mexico wants nothing to do with it.\n\n\"As the Mexican government has always stated, our country will not pay, under any circumstances, for a wall or physical barrier built on U.S. territory along the Mexican border,\" Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement released Sunday. \"This statement is not part of a Mexican negotiating strategy, but rather a principle of national sovereignty and dignity.\"\n\nThe Mexican statement followed tweets from the president the president on Sunday, which included the same ideas he emphasized during the press conference.\n\nWith Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world, we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2017\n\nMexico also addressed the president's assertions about its crime rates, saying that it was a \"shared problem.\" The only way to end it was to address its causes: high demand for drugs in the United States and supply from Mexico and other countries.\n\n\"Transnational criminal organizations have killed thousands of Mexicans, including members of the Armed Forces and police officers, and thousands of Americans,\" the ministry wrote. \"Only on the basis of the principles of shared responsibility, teamwork and mutual trust will we be able to overcome this challenge.\"\n\nThe president's response on Monday: to continue insisting that \"we need the wall very badly\" because of crime and drugs.\n\n\"Tremendous drugs are pouring into the United Sates, at levels no one has ever seen before,\" he said. \"The wall will stop much of the drugs from pouring into this country and poisoning our youth.\"\n\nThe president also suggested via Twitter that the United States could pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he criticized long before he took office.\n\nWe are in the NAFTA (worst trade deal ever made) renegotiation process with Mexico & Canada.Both being very difficult,may have to terminate? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2017\n\nHe doubled down on this Monday, calling NAFTA was one of \"the worst trade deals ever signed.\"\n\nMexico said it would not renegotiate the deal over social media or other platforms. The second round of renegotiation talks are set to take place in Mexico City later this week.\n\n\"Mexico's position at the renegotiation table of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will continue to be serious and constructive, always putting our national interests first, and seeking a beneficial result whereby the three North American countries win,\" the ministry wrote.\n\nMexico's Sunday statements are in line with what has already been publicly stated by the country several times before. A recently leaked phone conversation between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto revealed Trump had asked Mexico's leader to soften public opposition to the wall back in January. Peña Nieto retorted that his country wouldn't pay for the barrier.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2wMwNS7",
  "latent_24196": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nAug. 11, 2016, 2:22 PM GMT / Updated Aug. 11, 2016, 2:22 PM GMT By Chris Francescani\n\nAs athletes from around the globe arrived in Rio last week to compete for Olympic gold, Brazil’s notorious hacker underground was lurking just out of sight, competing to rip off as many of the hundreds of thousands of sports fans as possible during the games.\n\nTourists flocking to Rio are descending into what security experts describe as one of the most potent cybercrime hotspots in the world, where a new generation of young hackers is perfecting and unleashing a spectrum of online attacks in and outside of the country.\n\nBrazil is now second only to Russia as home to the world’s most sophisticated and innovative financial fraud gangs, according to the international software security group Kaspersky Labs, and ranked number one in the first quarter of 2016. Brazilian cyber gangs that once purchased the most cutting-edge hacking tools from Eastern Europe are now increasingly building their own.\n\nPurported Brazilian hackers use social media to brag about their alleged exploits and flaunt their profits and riches. Kaspersky Labs\n\n“It’s the equivalent of an industrial revolution in Brazil with respect to cyber capabilities,” said Tom Kellermann of the data security firm Strategic Cyber Ventures, who recently completed a major study of cybercrime in Latin America.\n\nThe Brazilians are especially proficient in online attacks on bank accounts and cloning of U.S. credit cards, which were an attractive target because until recently most did not contain the vital security “chip.” In a warning issued earlier this year, the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security called financial cybercrime in Brazil an “epidemic.”\n\nBrazilian banks lost more than $550 million U.S. dollars to internet fraud in 2015, according to the Brazilian Federation of Banks.\n\nNBC News made numerous unsuccessful attempts to contact a dozen individuals identified by Latin American security analysts as known Brazilian hackers. During this time, an NBC News reporter’s personal bank account was hacked and more than $1000 was stolen.\n\nDespite enormous efforts on the part of the Brazilian government and Olympic organizers, cyber security experts have been warning for months about the possibility of a blitz of internet fraud.\n\nFresh data collected by the security firm Fortinet from more than 2 million sensors worldwide detected the creation of at least 3,800 bogus malicious website URLs containing the Brazilian government designation “gov.br” between April and June, the firm said last week.\n\nThat’s an 83 percent spike in newly created “phishing” malware aimed at Brazil, compared with an average 16 percent increase in such malware worldwide. Malicious URLs masquerade as legitimate web addresses to steal online customers’ private information.\n\n“You Lose, Playboy”\n\nWhat’s unique about Brazil’s underground is how openly its gangs flaunt their crimes because, experts say, the country’s lax cybercrime laws generally protect hackers from serious consequences.\n\nThroughout the slums or “favelas” that surround big cities like Rio and Sao Paulo, teenage hackers parade their riches in the streets, brag on social media platforms, write Robin Hood rap songs about their exploits, and spend their proceeds on prostitutes. There are even brick-and-mortar hacker schools that advertise their addresses and pinpoint the locations on Google Maps.\n\nSecurity analysts said that Brazilian cyber-gangs, which use street names like PrimeSuspectz, CodeCash and Silver Lords, have developed a well-earned reputation for audacity. In a 2015 Kaspersky Labs report, senior security researcher Fabio Assolini cited two examples of hackers bragging about their exploits in videos posted to YouTube.\n\nFavelas in Rio de Janeiro on July 31, 2016. Chris McGrath / Getty Images\n\nIn one video that’s garnered more than 250,000 YouTube views since 2013, the thieves rap, “I’m a virtual terrorist, a criminal; on the internet I spread terror, have nervous fingers; I’ll invade your PC, so heads up; you lose, ‘playboy’, now your passwords are mine”.\n\nIn another popular video, hackers chant: “You work or you steal, we cloned the cards…I’m a professional fraudster and cloner, we steal from the rich, like Robin Hood.”\n\nCybercrime only became a criminal offense in Brazil with the 2013 passage of the Carolina Dieckmann Law, named for a Brazilian actress whose nude pictures were hacked and posted online. That law carries only modest penalties of fines and up to a year in jail.\n\n“The police do their job, they make the arrests,” said Assolini, who last fall published a five-year study on cybercrime in Brazil\n\n“But the law is so soft that it’s very rare for a bad guy to go to jail. They have money so they are able to hire very good lawyers to defend them. The bad guy lands in jail [in Brazil] sometimes, but only after doing a lot of bad, bad things.”\n\nKellermann told NBC News that Brazil’s best cybercriminals have become so skilled so fast in the past couple of years that they’ve drawn the attention of Latin America’s feared drug lords.\n\n“The Brazilian underground, unlike the Russian or German undergrounds, are only partially submerged [into the ‘dark web’ online],” said Kellermann.\n\n“Much of it is on the surface web,” he said. “The Brazilians are more brazen -- and now there’s evidence that they are endowing or selling their capabilities to major narco-trafficantes in the region, as well as being forced to do so.”\n\nWhile the majority of online fraud committed by these gangs has been aimed at Brazil’s banks and citizens, about seven years ago they turned their attention to financial fraud in the United States, Kellerman said.\n\n“Chupacabras”\n\nResearchers from Kaspersky Labs and other security firms directed NBC News to Brazilian hacker social media profiles and how-to websites like Hacker Xadrez (“Hacker Chess”), where anyone with a few hundred dollars can buy online tools – known as “exploit kits” –- to hack banks, businesses and individuals, hold data ransom, clone credit cards, steal e-wallets with RF scanners, and install “skimmers.”\n\nThe skimmers, which thieves attach to ATM machines to capture customers’ banking data, are known in Brazil as “chupacabras” –- a reference to a mythical Latin American beast called the “goat-sucker.”\n\nOne popular Brazilian hacker class that Assolini has identified, which has been around since at least 2012, costs about $75 and promises each graduate a bonus of 60 million stolen email addresses to exploit.\n\n“Nowadays the virtual world is increasingly competitive, making it harder for new users to compete with advanced rivals in an ever-growing marketplace,” a course description reads. “That inspired us to create the Kit Spam, where we include 60 million email addresses divided into separate categories: professionals, individuals and companies, executives, businessmen, politicians.”\n\nNBC News reviewed several of the Portuguese language Hacker Chess online courses.\n\nLax Laws Insulate Many Brazilian Hackers\n\nBrazilian authorities have been cracking down on cybercrime for months in anticipation of the Rio Olympics, Assolini said.\n\nIn June, the Brazilian Army’s Center for Cyber Defense (CDCiber) announced that it had recruited 200 security experts to combat hackers and cybercrime. A spokesperson for the Brazilian government did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhile Brazil’s military is responsible for national cyber security, the security firm Atos safeguards the Olympic systems themselves.\n\nAtos “has provided secure, reliable IT systems for the Olympic Games since we began working with them in 1989,” a spokesman for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said, adding that the IOC is “confident in the measures [the Brazilian government has] put in place.”\n\nSome analysts fear that with limited resources, Brazilian authorities have been more fixated on cyber terrorism than cybercrime.\n\n“Instead of focusing on international and domestic cyber-criminality, which constitutes by far the gravest risk, the state is doubling down on strengthening cyber war-fighting and anti-terrorism capabilities,” Dr. Robert Muggah, a security specialist with the Latin American think tank the Igarape Institute, wrote in an analysis published last year.\n\nBrazilian cybercrime gangs openly advertise the locations of hacker \"schools\" that are turning out a new generation of online thieves. Kaspersky Labs\n\n“This is not to suggest that cyberterrorism and cyber warfare are not real threats. Rather the government is overemphasizing broader issues of national security rather than addressing the most pressing challenges confronting citizens—that is cyber-crime.”\n\nMuggah’s concerns were borne out recently when Assolini and his team spent two days identifying and monitoring about 4,500 Wi-Fi access points near three Olympic locations – the Brazilian Olympics Committee building, Olympic Park and a trio of stadiums.\n\nThe analysts reported that about a quarter of the access points appear to be insecure – either because they were transmitting data without encryption, or operating on an easily hackable algorithm.\n\nBrazil’s Booming Internet Culture\n\nBrazil’s emergence as a cybercrime hotspot has been years in the making. Since at least the 1980s, Brazil has been at the forefront of electronic banking, and it was among the first nations to adopt anti-hacking “chips” in credit cards in 2003, Assolini said.\n\nIt’s home to the world’s second-largest ATM market, according to one study. More than 96 million people - 55 percent of the population – are online. Cyber-attacks within Brazil jumped 197 percent in 2014 and 274 percent in 2015, according to U.S. and Brazilian security analyses.\n\nAs internet access has spread in recent years, Brazilians have embraced the medium like no other Latin American country, but often without the security sophistication needed to protect themselves.\n\nBrazil is second only to the United States in registered Facebook users, and fifth globally in registered Twitter accounts. Nearly half of all banking transactions in Brazil are conducted digitally.\n\nMuch of the nation’s internet usage, including banking, occurs on mobile phones and in internet cafes and public libraries, making it harder to detect fraud, experts said.\n\n“More Difficult Than We Ever Imagined”\n\nThe challenges facing authorities in Brazil and other countries have been exacerbated by the growing use of end-to-end encryption, anonymous web-hosting and the growth of peer-to-peer online currency like Bitcoin, and what Kellermann described as the inability of most online security to thwart hacker attacks before they proliferate.\n\n“This is more difficult than we ever imagined before because of the infrastructure of the criminal enterprises that use anonymous payments and bulletproof [web] hosts,” he said. “It’s not just Bitcoin being used. They’re using Webmoney, Bitcoin and Litecoin. The fundamental reality is that most cyber security tech is ineffective in stopping the attacks. The average criminal no longer has to be a software engineer to distribute these attacks as they are easily purchased. That’s the harsh reality of cybercrime.”\n\nBrazil’s top cyber-gangs are now pushing past even the Russians in an imminent new epidemic – mobile malware, a type of ransomware which attacks your cell phone, and can freeze the contents until you pay a ransom, Assolini said.\n\n“This is something new in the Brazilian underground. They are offering mobile malware kits. Can you imagine how interesting that will become?” he said, sarcastically.\n\nBrazilian cyber-criminals also have developed a singular reputation for bold revenge measures, including threats to specific researchers.\n\n“They don’t like us,” Assolini said with a laugh. “It’s very common for white hat [researchers] to receive threats and bad words in the code of the malware. I was reading some malware I discovered and [a hacker known as] Codecash –- he sends me messages -- in the code of the malware! They say ‘leave [hackers] alone, they need the work’ and things like that.”\n\nYet for all of their technical proficiency, some Brazilian cyber criminals may not be rocket scientists.\n\nFollowing revelations in 2013 from former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden that the agency spied on Brazil’s president, hackers retaliated by infiltrating what they thought was the NSA’s website, and leaving messages imploring the U.S. to “stop spying on us.”\n\nApparently due to a typo, they infiltrated the website of NASA, America’s space agency.",
  "latent_24217": " A bizarre incident in Conway led officers to a man on the Hendrix College campus who believed he was being chased by a werewolf.\n\nJames Anderson Jr., 27, of Conway, was taken into custody Saturday after running through the north side of Conway and the Hendrix College campus, fleeing from what he described as a \"werewolf.\"\n\nAnderson told his story to Conway police officers, who arrived at the scene after public safety officers at Hendrix called dispatch.\n\nAccording to a report released by the Conway Police Department, the incident began when Anderson was in the local Wal-Mart and noticed a \"strange red light\" that Anderson said caused his body to start smoking. Anderson said that the red light forced him to \"tell the truth and be full of energy\".\n\nAnderson said he then ran from the Wal-Mart to where he had been sleeping, the alleyway by the Coin Laundry, 1065 Clayton Street, the report said. When he arrived, Anderson claimed that a \"large beast began to talk to him\" and that he believed the beast was a werewolf. He also claimed that the werewolf told him to \"get rid of the odor,\" only Anderson didn't know what he meant.\n\nAnderson then ran to Carrington Apartments at 2010 Cleveland Ave. and kicked in the door – Anderson stated that the werewolf would harm him if he didn't kick in the door — to an apartment in the complex. He then took off all his clothes and dumped them into the dryer with the resident's clothes, pouring a gallon of bleach into the dryer. Anderson then put on another set of clothes and \"decided to scare the werewolf off\" by attempting to light the bleached clothes on fire, but was unsuccessful, according to the report.\n\nAnderson told officers he was scared for his life, ran upstairs and \"flew off the balcony.\"\n\nAfter being apprehended, Anderson became nervous when anyone tried to approach him, became aggressive and asked if the police were going to kill him. Anderson only calmed down after the officers advised him that the handcuffs were made of silver and the werewolf couldn't hurt him as long as he had them on.\n\nAnderson was arrested on charges of residential burglary, two counts of first-degree criminal mischief and drunk insane, according to the report.",

TO ALLOW FULL STRENGTH MARIJUANA TO BE DISPENSED AS MEDICINE. SUPPORTERS UNDER THE NAME YES ON 2 ARE RUNNING ADS WITH STORIES OF PATIENTS DESPERATE FOR PAIN RELIEF. >> ALL THEY COULD DO IS TRY TO MAKE HER FEEL BETTER >> I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD CHOOSE TO DENY HER RELIEF BY DENYING HER ACCESS TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

ADRIAN: JOINING US HERE TONIGHT TO TALK ABOUT AMENDMENT 2 ARE OUR GUESTS. DR. JESSICA SPENCER. DR. SPENCER IS A SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION SPECIALIST. SHE IS ALSO THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR NO ON 2. ALSO WITH US THIS EVENING. JOHN MORGAN. MR. MORGAN IS A NOTABLE ATTORNEY WHO'S FOUGHT FOR THE PASSAGE OF AMENDMENT 2 FOR YEARS NOW. WELCOME TO YOU BOTH. BEFORE WE BEGIN YOU'LL EACH HAVE 90-SECONDS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. REBUTTALS AND FOLLOW-UPS WILL BE AT MY DISCRETION. TOWARD THE END OF THE DEBATE, WE MAY MOVE TO A LIGHTNING ROUND WHERE RESPONSES MAY NEED TO BE SHORTER AND MORE CONDENSED. WE WANT TO START OFF BY GIVING YOU BOTH THE CHANCE TO MAKE A BRIEF OPENING STATEMENT. YOU'LL EACH HAVE ONE MINUT MR. MORGAN YOU WON THE DRAWING , BEFORE THE DEBATE AND YOU CHOSE TO GO SECOND. DR DR. SPENCER: THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT MARIJUANA AS A PLANT WORKS AS MEDICINE. WE HAVE MEDICATIONS AVAILABLE AND THREE LAWS THAT PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO USE MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR WHATEVER AILS THEM. WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR VOTERS TO UNDERSTAND IS THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, THIS IS NOT A BILL WE CAN WORK THROUGH OUR LEGISLATURE WITH. WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT THEY ARE PERFECT. THIS IS NOT PERFECT. OUR VIEWERS AT OUR STATE AND PEOPLE NEED TO GO AND EDUCATE THEMSELVES ON WHAT IS HAPPENING. MR. MORGAN: THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. TWO YEARS AGO WE WERE DEBATIN -- A LOT HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE SUPREME COURT APPROVED OUR LANGUAGE 4-3. THIS TIME 7-0. YOU HEAR ABOUT THESE SUPPOSEDLY PULLS. OUR NEW LANGUAGE CLOSED THOSE LOOPHOLES. LAST TIME A BRIEF WAS FILED AGAINST US. YOU DON'T SEE HER HERE TODAY. YOU DON'T SEE THAT BRIEF. LAST TIME WE HAD PEOPLE TELLING US THAT THIS WAS THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA, AS DR. SPENCER JUST SAID. IT IS NOT THE LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. WHAT THIS IS IS A CURE, A HELP FOR REALLY SICK PEOPLE. YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE. IT IS GOING TO BE IN CANDY FORM FOR OUR CHILDREN, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN CANDY FORM. THE LEGISLATURE SAYS NO TO THAT. THERE WILL BE A POT SHOP ON ANY CORNER? THAT'S NOT TRUE. ANY MUNICIPALITY CAN BAN FROM THEIR COUNTY OR CITY. ONE THING TO CLARIFY, I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HER, BUT REMEMBER SHE IS NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR, SHE IS AN EDUCATOR. I HAVEN'T FOUND A MEDICAL DOCTOR WILLING TO DEBATE WITH ME. ADRIAN: WE WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE POLL WESH 2 COMMISSIONED. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED OF THE 503 LIKELY VOTERS STATED IN PART, IF THE ELECTION WERE HELD TODAY, WOULD YOU SUPPORT OR OPPOSE THIS AMENDMENT? 69% SAID THEY WOULD SUPPORT IT. 24% SAID THEY WOULD OPPOSE. WHILE 7% WERE UNDECIDE I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH YOU DR. SPENCER YOUR RESPONSE TO WHAT , SEEMS TO BE AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL OF SUPPORT THAN 2014. DR. SPENCER: I THINK THAT IS COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE. I SAID THIS IN THE PREVIOUS DEBATE, THIS IS A PREDATORY AMENDMENT. IT PREYS ON OUR COMPASSION TO NOT WANT INDIVIDUALS TO SUFFER. IF YOU SIMPLY LOOK AT THE BALLOT SUMMARY, THE MAJORITY WOULD VOTE YES. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SAYS WHEN YOU GET INTO THE MEAT. THIS ALSO PRAISE -- ALSO PYS ON FAMILIES LOOKING FOR THE LAST HOPE. THAT IS SIMPLY NOT HOW WE DO MEDICINE. THIS ISN'T AND HOW WE DO MEDICINE. THIS IS TO FACTOR LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA. AND THEIR LANGUAGE SAYS SO. MR. MORGAN: JUST BECAUSE YOU SADIST A FACTOR LEGALIZATION, IT IS NOT. IF IT WAS IT WOULD SAY IT IS THE DO FACTOR LEGALIZATION. THAT IS HER BEST ARGUMENT. WHEN YOUR BEST ARGUMENT IS JUST A PLACE IN -- JUST A BLATANT FALSEHOOD, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU -- A GREA MAN, A GREAT SHERIFF USED TO DEBATE ME. HE SAI, \"I'M FOR THE LEGALIZATION OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA, I JUST WANTED TO BE DONE IN TALLAHASSEE. HE DIDN'T WANT A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS I THOUGHT HARD TO GET IT DONE IN TALLAHASSE ONE YEAR THEY BROKE EARLY, THEY COULDN'T EVEN AGR WITH THEMSELVES. WHEN OUR LEGISLATURES WON'T DO THE JOB WE SENT THEM TO DO, THIS IS WHEN THE POWER OF THE CONSTITUTION HANDS THE POWER BACK TO THE PEOPLE, AND WE GET TO HAVE REAL CHANGE. ADRIAN:IF DR. SPENCER SAYING THIS IS A FACTOR LEGALIZATION, ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE DANGER OF MARIJUANA USE FOR THE LARGER POPULATION? IF THERE IS GOING TO BE MORE MARIJUANA OUT THERE THAN MORE PEOPLE WILL BE USING MARIJUANA. MR. MORGAN: YOU LOOK LIKE A YOUNG GUY TO ME. IF YOU WANT TO GET MARIJUANA, YOU CAN HAVE IT IN FIVE MINUTES AND I'M AN OLD FAT GUY, AND IF I WANTED I CAN HAVE IT IN FIVE MINUTES. GETTING MARIJUANA IS NOT A PROBLEM IN FLORIDA. ADRIAN: THIS WAS SOMETHING WE ASKED IN OUR POLL, MARIJUANA IS SOLD IN OTHER STATES TO HELP PATIENTS REDUCE PAIN, OXYCODONE, FENTANYL, HIDE YOUR CODE OWN -- HYDROCODONE AND OTHER OPIOIDS. WHAT GIVES YOU MORE CONCERN, THE POTENTIAL FOR OPIOID ABUSE OR THE POTENTIAL FOR MARIJUANA ABUSE? 67% SAID OPIOID ABUSE GIVES THEM MORE CONCERN. 16% SAID MARIJUANA. AND 18% WEREN'T SURE. I START WITH YOU MR. MORGAN. YOU TOOK A PERSONAL APPROACH IN ONE AD FOR PASSAGE BUT IT ALSO MAKES A VERY POINTED CLAIM. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. >> WHEN MY BROTHER AND I WERE LITTLE BOYS, WE RAN AND PLAYED TOGETHER FOR HE WAS PARALYZED FROM THE CHEST DOWN WHEN HE WAS 18, THE WORST A OF MY LIFE. HIS PAIN AND SPASMS ARE UNBEARABLE AND NO DRUG HAS EVER HELPED HIM. DRUGMAKERS ARE TELLING US LIVE TO KEEP BILLIONS FOR THEIR COMPANIES. MANY SICK PEOPLE WILL BENEFIT IF YOU VOTE YES. THIS IS FOR MY HERO. COMPASSION IS COMING. >> THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN TALK ABOUT. WE PUT THIS OUT ON FACEBOOK, CRYSTAL AGREED WITH ONE CLAIM ON THAT AD. SHE SAID PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES DON'T WANT TO TO HAPPEN, BUT I PRAY FOR ALL OF THOSE THAT NEED AND USE IT. DR. SPENCER, ONE OF THE ISSUES IS PEOPLE ARE WONDERING IF BIG PHARMACEUTICAL ARE HELPING TO FUND THIS CAMPAIGN SO THEY CAN KEEP MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS AND SET OF GETTING MONEY TO HELP FOR LEGALIZE MARIJUANA. DR. SPENCER: UNFORTUNATELY THAT THIS -- THAT IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE FOR IT I DON'T RECEIVE MONEY FROM BIG PHARMA. IF THEY PHARMA WANTED TOTAL CONTROL OVER THIS THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT ALREADY. WE ALREADY HAVE CANADA SPACED MEDICATIONS -- CANNABIS-BASED MEDICATIONS. THAT IS ANOTHER WAY WE CAN CONVOLUTE THE ISSUE AND TAKING THE FOCUS AWAY FROM THE ISSUE OTHER STATES ARE DEALING WITH. AND TRY TO PUSH THEM OVER TO THE OPIOID ISSUE. WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THE LEGALIZATION OF MEDICAL MARIJUAN DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF THE OPIOID CRISIS. COLORADO, THEY ARE SECOND IN THE COUNTRY FOR OPIOID OVERDOSES. WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE OPIOID OVERDOSES RISE IN THE STATES. AT LEAST THE PHARMACEUTICALS WE HAVE IN THESE OPIOIDS HAVE KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS. THE LANGUAGE DOES SPECIFICALLY ALLOW FOR EDIBLES. UNPREDICTABLE SIDE EFFECTS, THIS IS NOT GOOD MEDICINE, THIS IS NOT GOOD PRACTICE AND THIS WILL NOT FIX YOUR OPIOID PROBLEM. AGENT: I ASSUME YOU DISAGREE. MR. MORGAN: WHAT SHE SAID WAS TOTALLY FALSE. OUT IN ARIZONA THERE IS A BALLOT INITIATIVE RIGHT NOW. THE MAKER OF SENTINEL -- OF SENTINEL -- OF FN ENTANYL PUT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THAT CAMPAIGN. THE HEIRESS TO THE FORTUNE WHO SELLS A LOT OF OPIOIDS, SHE POURED IN $800,000. THAT IS WHERE YOU GET YOUR OPIOIDS FROM. I AM IN THE BUSINESS OF LITIGATING MANUFACTURERS FOR THESE DRUGS. THESE COMPANIES ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF PREMEDITATED -- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE HOOKED AND FAMILY MEMBERS ARE AFFECTED. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE EVER DIED FROM USING MARIJUANA IN ANY FORM? SHE WILL SAY SOMEBODY JUMPED OFF A BALCONY. GOOGLE THAT. NO ONE HAS EVER DIED FROM INGESTING MARIJUANA. AS FAR AS EDIBLES GO, THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO SCARE YOU TO DEATH. THERE IS CANDY FOR KIDS. THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE SAYS THE EDIBLES CANNOT BE IN CANDY FORM. ADRIAN: THAT IS NOT IN THE AMENDMENT. MR. MORGAN: WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT CANDY, THAT IS NOT IN THE AMENDMENT BUT THAT IS IN HER ARGUMENT. WHEN SHE TALKS TO YOU ABOUT CANDY, THAT IS A RED HERRING. ADRIAN: LET'S GET TO DR. SPENCER. DR. SPENCER: WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A RED HERRING, THAT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS SAID WE WILL USE MEDICAL MARIJUANA TO GIVE IT A GOOD NAME. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUC HAD GONE INTO ARIZONA. IT IS NOT 3.5 MILLION, THERE IS NO OTHER -- THERE IS ANOTHER MADE APPLY. -- MADE UP L. IT WAS 500,000. AND THEY ACTUALLY MAKE A SPRAY. THIS IS THE POINT, TO DETER AND DEFLECT AND TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE AND START TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. GOING INTO EDUCATING PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS AND EVEN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO USE THESE PAIN SALES FROM'S DEATH PAIN SKILLS FROM ZERO TO 10. -- PAIN SCALES FROM ZERO TO 10. WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT AN AMENDMENT THAT IS HERE TO CHANGE OUR CONSTITUTION THAT THE FLORIDA SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION, THE FLORIDA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND EVERY OTHER MEDICAL ORGANIZATION HAS COME OUT AGAINST. THIS IS NOT HOW WE DO MEDICINE. >> ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HERE IS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCED BY THE NO ON 2 CAMPAIGN SAYS THAT IF AMENDMENT 2 PASSES, MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES WILL OPEN NEXT TO SCHOOLS AND THAT MARIJUANA WILL BE MARKETED TO KIDS. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AND I WANT TO GET YOUR RESPONSES ON THE OTHER SIDE. >> THIS IS MEDICINE. MEDICINE. MEDICINE? WITH AMENDMENT TWO, THIS IS WHAT MEDICINE WILL LOOK LIKE. POK -- POT PACKAGED LIKE CANDY UP TO 20 TIMES STRONGER THAN IT ONCE WAS. MARKETED TO KIDS SOLD NEXT TO SCHOOLS IN NEARLY 2000 POT SHOPS ACROSS FLORIDA. NO MEDICAL STANDARDS, NO PHARMACISTS, NO PRESCRIPTIONS AND NO WAY TO STOP IT. >> THIS HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF RESPONSE ON THE FACEBOOK PAGE. EVERY TIME I SEE THAT COMMERCIAL STATING THAT MARIJUANA IS GOING TO BE PACKAGED FOR CHILDREN AND SOLD NEAR SCHOOLS I WANT TO SCREAM. I HOPE PEOPLE DON'T LISTEN TO THE FEAR MONGERING. DR. SPENCER TO YOU FIRST. IS THIS FEAR MONGERING? AND ARE THE STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS AD ACCURATE? DR. SPENCER: UNFORTUNATELY IT IS ACCURATE. TO USE ONE OF HIS FAVORITE TERMS, GOOGLE IT. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE SEE IN OTHER STATES. THE AMENDMENT SPECIFICALLY SAYS EDIBLES. THE AMENDMENT ALSO DOESN'T ALLOW TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THAT. THE LEGISLATURE CAN ONLY ENACT THE PLAIN LANGUAGE. WE TRY TO GO IN AS MUNICIPALITIES AND SAY WE DON'T WANT TO PACKAGED LIKE CANDY, COLORADO IS TRYING TO CHANGE WHAT THEIR EDIBLES LOOK LIKE. WE ARE THEN VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION. IT IS NOT FEAR MONGERING, IT IS REALITY-BASED. WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL AND CONCERNED. AETRIUM: IF WE ARE ADDING MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES AND ANOTHER DRUG TO A STATE WITH THE STRUGGLING DRUG CRISIS, ARE WE JUST MAKING THE PROBLEM WORSE? MR. MORGAN: THINK ABOUT THE ARGUMENT THAT IT IS GOING TO BE NEXT TO SCHOOLS. ARE STRIP CLUBS NEXT TO SCHOOLS HE? NO. THERE ARE ZONING LAWS THAT PROTECT US FROM WHAT WE DON'T LAW -- DON'T WANT. THERE WILL BE EDIBLES BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN CANDY FORM. AT IS THEIR BEST ARGUMENT. WE ARE SCARED FOR OUR CHILDREN. SO THEY WANT TO SCARE US AND TRIC US BY SAYING OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO GET THIS CANDY. IT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IF THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE ALLOWS IT TO HAPPEN. MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ALREADY BANNED DISPENSARIES FROM THEIR WHOLE TOWNS. HE BEST ARGUMENT IS IT IS THE LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA, FALSE. CHILDREN ARE GOING TO EITHER MY CANDY, FALSE. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE NEXT TO OUR SCHOOLS, FALSE. THAT'S WHY WE ELECT OFFICIALS, THAT'S WHY WE SUPPOSEDLY TRUST OUR MAYORS -- HOW FAST DO YOU THINK A PERSON WILL BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE IF THEY PUT A POT SHOP RIGHT NEXT TO A SCHOOL? HOW MANY ELECTIONS DO YOU THINK THAT PERSON WOULD SURVIVE? YOU HAVE TO THINK IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH, YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE SCARE TACK TICK -- SCARE TACTIC. A JURY IN: WE STILL HAVE MUCH MORE TO COME ON THIS MEDICAL MARIJUANA DEBATE. ADRIAN: WE HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER A PRESCRIPTION WHEN THE -- WOULD BE NEEDED. \"I KEEP HEARING THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS NOT A PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE. IF IT WAS FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES I WOULD STILL THINK YOU NEED A PRESCRIPTION? WE GO TO YOU MR. MORGAN. IN TRUTH MEDICAL MARIJUANA WOULD BE -- WOULD THESE PRESCRIBED. -- WOULDN'T BE PRESCRIBED IT WOULD BE RECOMMENDED. WOULDN'T THAT OPEN THE DOOR FOR BAD DOCTORS OVERPRESCRIBING? MR. MORGAN: I WOULD RATHER A BAD DOCTOR BE PRESCRIBING THIS THAN OXYCONTIN. IF THE ARGUMENT IS WE'RE GOING TO BE WORRYING ABOUT CROOKED DOCTORS, THEN WE GET RID OF THE CROOKED DOCTORS, BUT WE DON'T THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER. , WHITEY YOU BELIEVE A PRESCRIPTION FOR AN OPIOID, WHICH CAN BE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE, WOULD BE BETTER TO HELP FLORIDIANS SUFFER THINGS -- FLORIDIANS THROUGH THINGS LIKE CANCER? DR. SPENCER: WE NEVER SAID IT WAS BETTER. THEY ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES. THERE ARE ISSUES WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT AND I WOULD LOVE TO COME BACK AND DISCUSS IT. BUT WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS MARIJUANA. IT IS NOT A PRESCRIPTION, WHICH IS ONE OF THE MISNOMERS PEOPLE THINK. IT IS NOT GHOST, IT IS NOT STANDARDIZED, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TAKE, HOW TO TAKE, WHEN TO TAKE IT. THEY WOULD HAVE PUT A PERIOD AT THE END OF THIS SENTENCE AND LEFT IT UP TO GROUPS OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO DECIDE WHAT OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS WOULD QUALIFY. INSTEAD THEY LEFT IT OPEN TO THESE OTHER CONDITION, WHICH THEN OPENS THE DOORS FOR ANY SYMPTOMOLOGY UNDER THOSE DISEASE PROCESSES. NOW THES PEOPLE, THIS IS NOT GOING TO HELP THEM. THERE IS NO COME CLUES OF EVIDENCE. IT NEEDS TO BE PUT UP TO SCIENCE . MR. MORGAN: I WOULD JUST JUMP IN. THE REASON THIS CANNOT BE A PRESCRIPTION IS BECAUSE MARIJUANA -- A MOVIE CALLED REEFER MADNESS STOOD FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT A BLACK MAN AND A WHITE WOMAN MAY GET TOGETHER. THEY MADE IT A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG SO WE CAN'T EVEN STUDY IT. IN ISRAEL, GOOGLE WHAT IS GOING ON IN ISRAEL. THERE HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLE STUDIES. NOW THEY CAN'T BECAUSE IT IS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG. IT WAS CHANGED FROM CANNABIS TO MARIJUANA BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SOUND MEXICAN. ADRIAN: IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE GETTING OFF TOPIC. MR. MORGAN: THE REASON WE ARE NOT, IT CAN'T BE A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BECAUSE IT IS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG, IT IS THE ESSENCE OF THE TOPIC. DR. SPENCER: I AM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ANSWER THAT. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THEY CONTINUED TO STUDY IT. THIS CAMPAIGN COMES OUT AND SAYS WE HAVE STUDIES. WE HAVE FIVE DRUGS GOING THROUGH TRIALS THAT ARE CANNABIS-BASED MEDICATIONS. IT IS A 500 PLUS CHEMICAL IN THIS PLANT. IT NEEDS TO GO UP TO THE SCRUTINY AND THE STUDY TO MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE GIVING PEOPLE SO WE DON'T GIVE THEM FALSE HOPE OR SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DETRIMENTAL. THIS WHOLE FEAR MONGERING AND TACTIC THAT WE CAN'T DO BECAUSE IT IS A SCHEDULE ONE IS SIMPLY FALSE. ADRIAN: WHAT UNIVERSITY? MR. MORGAN: IT CAN'T BE. THERE IS A PILL, IT DOESN'T WORK. LOOK AT THE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR IT. IT DOESN'T WORK. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO HARNESS IT TO WORK IN PILL FORM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN ISRAEL AND THE STUDIES THAT HAVE GONE ON, IT IS MIRACULOUS. LOOK AT THE REPORT BY SON JAKE UP THE -- BY SON J -- BY SAN JAY GUPTA. IT IS ESSENTIAL IN FLORIDA. ADRIAN: WE ARE GOING TO CLOSING, YOU GUYS GET 45 SECONDS. MR. MORGAN: HERE IS THE DEAL, THE ORGANIZATION BEHIND THIS STARTED OUT YEARS AGO CALL STREET INK. IT IS NOW THIS, WHEN YOU LOOK AT STREET INK AND THE BACKERS OF STREET INK, YOU ARE GOING TO BE HORRIFIED AT WHAT THESE FOLKS DID TO OUR CHILDREN. I KNOW SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO, BUT WHEN YOU FINISH THIS CHANNEL, GOOGLE THE WORDS STR AIGHT INC. AND THE WOR TORTURE, ABUSE, AND CHILDRE. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE WHO IS AGAINST THIS MUCH-NEEDED AMENDMENT. DR. SPENCER: I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE. I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND IS DO WE WANT TO BELIEVE THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND THE MEDICAL COMMUNITIES AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THE PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTA SCIENCE AND HOW DANGEROUS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OF THIS KIND, WHICH IS THE FACT OF LEGALIZATION, OR DO WE WANT TO BELIEVE THE PREDATORS THAT PREY ON OUR COMPASSION AND CARING FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT SUFFER? I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AGAINST THIS AND EVERY OTHER MAJOR MEDICAL ORGANIZATION THAT KNOWS, INCLUDING OUR ADMINISTRATION, THAT KNOWS THIS IS NOT HOW WE DO MEDICINE, INSTEAD OF PREDATORY INDIVIDUALS THAT RIGHT THINGS TO SCARE PEOPLE INTO \"THIS IS HOW WE HAVE TO DO MEDICINE.\" ADRIAN: THANK YOU FOR WATCHING THIS EVENING SPECIAL PRESENTATION COMMITMENT 2016, THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA DEBATE.

  "latent_24472": "Sergei Magnitsky was a lawyer in Russia exposing large-scale corruption by government officials when he was beaten to death by guards in a Moscow prison in 2009; Alexander Perepilichnyy, a Russian businessman, had fled to Britain and was a whistleblower over the same fraud when he mysteriously collapsed and died last month.\n\nThese two dramatic deaths bookend the remarkable crusade of Bill Browder, the American-born investor for whom Mr. Magnitsky worked and to whom Mr. Perepilichnyy was spilling his secrets.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Browder saw the U.S. Senate pass the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act by a wide margin, a law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers.\n\nIt was a triumphant moment for Mr. Browder, who has relentlessly lobbied for such sanctions, but it hardly ends his quest for justice over Mr. Magnitsky’s gruesome demise.\n\nHis next stop is Canada.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Browder arrives here with his remarkable story of international intrigue — state corruption, massive theft, organized crime — in a bid to see Canada pass a similar law against corrupt Russian officials.\n\nParliamentarians and government ministers will be hard pressed to hear a more compelling story, both his own and the one swirling around him.\n\nMr. Browder’s grandfather was the well-known leader of the U.S. Communist Party from the 1920s to 1940s, twice running under the red banner for president. Communism was a Browder family value.\n\n“There is all this family history and connection to Communism, so when I was going through my teenage rebellion I became a capitalist. I figured there was nothing I could do to irritate my family more than that,” Mr. Browder, 48, told the National Post.\n\nThere is all this family history and connection to Communism, so when I was going through my teenage rebellion I became a capitalist. I figured there was nothing I could do to irritate my family more than that\n\nHe graduated from Stanford business school the year the Berlin Wall fell and the two events prompted an epiphany: “If my grandfather was the biggest Communist in America, it seems perfectly appropriate that I become the biggest capitalist in Eastern Europe,” he said.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he moved to Moscow and started investing, first as an employee of Salomon Brothers, then with his own firm, Hermitage Capital Management, in 1996.\n\nHe was a success. From US$25-million in capital his fund grew to US$4.5-billion, becoming the largest foreign portfolio investor in Russia.\n\nBut the value of the huge Russian companies, some of the nation’s largest, was diminished by corruption.\n\n“Billions and billions of dollars were being stolen through all sorts of different corrupt schemes,” said Mr. Browder. Hermitage took on an activist strategy, researching and exposing corporate corruption of firms it was investing in.\n\nHe saw Vladimir Putin, who was becoming the dominant politician in Russia, as an early ally in his fight against corruption, advocating for the former KGB officer to the suspicious West.\n\nBut Mr. Browder’s éxposés were not admired by all.\n\n“It was a very effective way of stopping bad things from happening in Russia, but it was also a very effective way of creating a lot of high-placed and high-powered enemies who didn’t wish me well.”\n\nAfter almost 10 years in Russia, he was stopped at the border in 2005 and deported as a threat to national security.\n\nHe feared he might lose everything.\n\n“We quickly liquidated all our holdings in Russia in 2006 and evacuated my staff out of Russia so they couldn’t steal our money and arrest our people,” Mr. Browder said.\n\nThat was far from the end.\n\nMore than a year after his deportation, police raided his Moscow office and the offices of his lawyers, seizing corporate documents for his investment holding companies.\n\nIn response, he hired seven Russian lawyers to investigate. One was a talented young man named Sergei Magnitsky.\n\nWe quickly liquidated all our holdings in Russia in 2006 and evacuated my staff out of Russia so they couldn’t steal our money and arrest our people\n\nMr. Magnitsky investigated and reported someone had used Mr. Browder’s corporate documents to forge backdated contracts showing the firm owed US$1-billion.\n\nThe companies who were the supposed recipients of the debt sued Hermitage in Russia, seeking to claim the US$1-billion.\n\n“We weren’t even aware of these court proceedings, but three lawyers, who we didn’t hire, then showed up to represent our companies and those three lawyers pled guilty to US$1-billion of fake liabilities,” Mr. Browder said.\n\n“Then the police, the same police who raided our offices in the first place, raided all of our banks looking for assets to seize. Thankfully, there were no assets there because we had taken all of the money out.”\n\nWhen he heard all of this from Mr. Magnitsky, Mr. Browder relaxed. He had moved faster than the schemers. It seemed almost comical.\n\n“Sergei said, ‘I wouldn’t relax if I were you because Russian stories never end this way. There are never happy, clean ending to these stories.’ I asked how does this story end and he said it probably ends badly.”\n\nMr. Magnitsky probed further. He was right: The schemers were not prepared to quit without a profit.\n\nHe found the people who sought the court award had gone to the tax authorities. The previous year, Mr. Browder’s company had paid US$230-million in taxes based on its reported gains of US$1-billion.\n\nUsing the US$1-billion court judgment as proof, the schemer claimed the firm’s actual profit should be zero since the judgment erased the gains. Therefore, the US$230-million was paid by mistake and should be refunded — to them.\n\n“They applied for a tax refund of US$230-million, which was the largest tax refund in Russian history. They applied for it two days before Christmas — Dec. 23, 2007 — and was awarded and paid out the very next day.”\n\nThe schemers finally got their money.\n\nMr. Browder, meanwhile, assumed it was a rogue operation by a small, corrupt cabal.\n\n“We filed 15 different criminal complaints with regulatory agencies, with law enforcement agencies and with connected politicians, and waited for the SWAT teams and helicopters to fan out and get all the bad guys.\n\n“It quickly became apparent that there were no good guys in the Russian government. Instead of going out and trying to arrest the people who did this, they opened up criminal cases on all seven of our lawyers on various trumped-up charges.”\n\nIt quickly became apparent that there were no good guys in the Russian government. Instead of going out and trying to arrest the people who did this, they opened up criminal cases on all seven of our lawyers on various trumped-up charges\n\nFearing for their safety, he asked them to flee Russia at his expense. Six accepted, but Mr. Magnitsky declined.\n\nA man of principle and idealism, he declared since he had done nothing wrong he had no need to flee. Instead, he started testifying against the officials involved in the tax theft.\n\nIn November 2008, subordinates of those officials arrested him. Torture to elicit the retraction of his testimony began immediately, according to Mr. Browder.\n\nAfter months of abuse, Mr. Magnitsky became seriously ill.\n\nOn the night of Nov. 16, 2009, lapsing into critical condition, he was moved to a prison with a hospital, but instead of treating him, “They put him into an isolation cell and eight riot guards with rubber batons beat him for one hour and 18 minutes until he died.”\n\nHe was 37 years old.\n\n“Sergei Magnitsky was tortured to death in order to get him to retract his testimony about the corruption that he uncovered,” said Mr. Browder.\n\nAnd once again, the narrative of Mr. Browder’s life changed dramatically.\n\n“I made a vow to myself and to his memory that I was going to make sure the people who had done this to him would face justice and his death wouldn’t be a meaningless death.”\n\nJustice was not forthcoming in Russia.\n\n“The Russian government completely circled the wagons to cover up the responsibility of everybody,” he said. “Like Watergate, the crime itself is one thing but what makes this case so politically important internationally, is the high-level cover-up that goes right up to the president of Russia.\n\n“We haven’t been able to get justice inside Russia in any way, shape or form. Everybody who was involved in this — and there’s a huge amount of evidence of them being involved in this — have been exonerated, some have been promoted and even received state honours.\n\n“It became clear we would have to seek justice outside Russia.”\n\nThe corrupt Russian officials, gangsters and oligarchs profiting from this and other crimes typically hoarded their money abroad. They used foreign banks, bought foreign property, sent their children to foreign private schools and vacationed in foreign countries.\n\nIn that Mr. Browder saw a way to get at them.\n\n“They like to behave like cannibals at home and then dine at the finest restaurants with white tablecloths in Europe and North America,” he said.\n\n“It hits the Putin regime in the most profound way, because the entire objective of the current leadership of Russia at this stage is to steal money.”\n\nSince 2010, he has worked with politicians in the U.S., Canada and Europe to enact visa sanctions and asset seizures, not against Russia as a country, but against corrupt individuals within its elites.\n\nCanada’s place in such geopolitics came into focus when one of the emissaries from Moscow sent to Washington to lobby against the act was Vitaly Malkin, a Russian oligarch and member of the Russian senate.\n\nMr. Malkin, the National Post revealed in 2009, has been blocked from entering Canada by Canadian authorities who accused him of organized crime involvement. In his fight to overturn that decision, it was revealed he owns 111 condominium units in Toronto.\n\nCanada should not be a safe haven for people who do this type of crime. Canada has a very attractive economic immigrant program and it is very popular for Russians so, absolutely, Canada has to be on the list of countries that are doing this\n\nThrough court filings, Mr. Malkin, whose name is sometimes spelled Vitali Malkine in English, denied any involvement in organized crime. He won a judicial review of the decision because he was not given an adequate opportunity to address the government’s concerns before it was made. Any new decision has not been made public.\n\nMr. Browder said the Malkin case suggests why Canada is important.\n\n“Canada should not be a safe haven for people who do this type of crime. Canada has a very attractive economic immigrant program and it is very popular for Russians so, absolutely, Canada has to be on the list of countries that are doing this.”\n\nMr. Browder’s success last week in Washington brought a rebuke from Moscow, with threats of countermeasures against Americans. The diplomatic spat threatens to further damage strained U.S.-Russia relations.\n\nFor Mr. Browder, the triumph in Washington brightened the darkness of his story that had recently grown darker with a mysterious death in England.\n\nBefore Mr. Perepilichnyy fled Russia, he was wheeling and dealing with wealthy clients. Among them were people connected to the tax rebate theft.\n\nIn 2010, he contacted Mr. Browder with information on where the money went. A detailed dossier traced money to a Swiss bank and Mr. Perepilichnyy became a cooperating witness with Swiss officials.\n\nLast month, the seemingly healthy 44-year-old collapsed and died outside his mansion in a gated community that has been home to Ringo Starr, Kate Winslet and Sir Elton John.\n\nSo far, the cause of death is unknown, pending toxicology tests.\n\nIn the meantime, the death is another reminder of the high stakes in Mr. Browder’s campaign as he arrives in Toronto before heading to Ottawa for high-level government meetings Tuesday.\n\nNational Post\n\nahumphreys@nationalpost.com",

That gives the guys on the fringe one more game of tape to show prospective employers.\n\nIt will also make the week before the start of the regular season rather more chaotic.\n\nNow, 1,184 players will enter the workforce at the same moment, creating a land rush for waiver claims and practice squad signings in the days leading up to the opener.",
  "latent_24807": "(CNN) Four individuals in Miami-Dade and Broward counties have been infected with the Zika virus by local mosquitoes, Florida health officials said Friday.\n\nThese are the first known cases of the virus being transmitted by mosquitoes in the continental United States.\n\n\"While no mosquitoes trapped tested positive for the Zika virus, the department believes these cases were likely transmitted through infected mosquitoes in this area,\" according to a statement from the Florida Department of Health.\n\n\"As we anticipated, Zika is here,\" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday, adding that \"all the evidence we have seen indicates that this is mosquito-borne transmission that occurred several weeks ago.\"\n\nFrieden explained that confirming local mosquito-borne transmission of the virus is not as easy as confirming the virus in an individual by running a test. He also said that finding a Zika-carrying mosquito is like finding a needle in a haystack, and doing so is not necessary to confirm local mosquito transmission.\n\nOfficials believe the local transmission is confined to a small area north of downtown Miami within a single ZIP code. However, local, state and federal health officials are continuing their investigation, which includes going door-to-door to ask residents for urine samples and other information in an effort to determine how many people may be infected. Additional cases are anticipated.\n\nIt is possible that someone could have Zika without knowing, since 80% of those infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes, and they can last from a few days to about a week.\n\nThere is no treatment or vaccine for Zika. None of these four unidentified patients, which include a woman and three men, has needed hospitalization.\n\nTo date, there have been 386 cases of Zika in the state of Florida, including 55 pregnant women. The counties with the highest number of cases are Miami-Dade with 99 and Broward with 55.\n\nBlood donations tested\n\nThe main way people become infected with the virus is through the bite of an infected mosquito. The female Aedes aegypti and its sister, Aedes albopictus, are the primary vectors, but people can also become infected through other methods, including sexual transmission . Babies can become infected in utero, and there are confirmed cases of transmission from blood transfusion and laboratory exposure\n\nJUST WATCHED Everything you need to know about Zika Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Everything you need to know about Zika 01:42\n\nOneBlood, which handles blood collection in the affected area, began testing all donations for the Zika virus Friday, according to Susan Forbes, OneBlood's vice president of marketing and communications. Any donations that tests positive will be discarded, and the donor will be notified.\n\nOneBlood is the sole blood provider in South Florida and handles most blood collection statewide. It also works in southern Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina.\n\nMore than 60 countries and territories are reporting local transmission of the virus. U.S. health officials had warned that there would be local transmission of the virus from mosquitoes but don't expect it to be widespread, as has been seen in Puerto Rico and throughout the Americas. That's based on outbreaks of two similar mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya.\n\nThe reason is largely because of living conditions, including mosquito-control efforts and regular use of air-conditioning.\n\nFrieden said Florida has taken aggressive mosquito-control measures in the affected area, which should also limit further transmission. He said there is no cause for concern unless additional cases are identified after those measures had begun.\n\nAs of Thursday, the CDC reported 1,658 cases of the virus in the continental United States and Hawaii. None of those cases is a result of local mosquito transmission. Fifteen of those individuals were infected by sexual transmission, and there is one case of a laboratory-acquired infection. (The CDC's numbers do not always include the most current cases reported by states.)\n\nNearly every state is reporting cases of the virus. Only Idaho, South Dakota, Wyoming and Alaska have not reported it.\n\nRisks for pregnant women\n\nPregnant women are at greatest risk because the virus can have devastating consequences for an unborn baby, including the birth defect microcephaly and other neurological deficits, as well as miscarriage and stillbirth among women who were infected while pregnant.\n\nThe exact risk that an infected woman will have an affected baby remains unknown, but some studies have shown that it is between 1% and 13%.\n\nFrieden called this unprecedented , saying, \"never before in history has there been a situation when a bite from a mosquito can result in such a devastating scenario.\"\n\nLocal transmission \"is the news we've been dreading,\" said Dr. Edward McCabe, chief medical officer and senior vice president of the March of Dimes. \"It's only a matter of time before babies are born with microcephaly, a severe brain defect, due to local transmission of Zika in the continental U.S. Our nation must accelerate education and prevention efforts to save babies from this terrible virus.\"\n\nFrieden restated that it's important for pregnant women in any area where the Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito is found to protect herself against bites with the use of repellant and by wearing long pants and long-sleeve shirts.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAt least 13 infants have been born with Zika-related birth defects in the continental U.S. and Hawaii, and there have been six sudden or voluntary Zika-related pregnancy losses reported. There are more than 400 pregnant women with the virus in the United States.",
  "latent_24836": "SOUTHAVEN, Miss. – Michael Page fought on the biggest stage yet of his young MMA career, and he put on a show Saturday night.\n\nThe trouble was, most of the fans in Southaven, Miss., didn’t care for his act one bit. To that, page says, for the most part: Too bad.\n\nPage (6-0 MMA, 2-0 BMMA) ducked and dodged and waved his hands and wound up for punches and dance and gyrated his way to a gorgeous one-punch knockout of Ricky Rainey (8-3 MMA, 1-1 BMMA) to open Bellator 120 on Saturday, the promotion’s first pay-per-view. The showmanship didn’t go over well with the fans at Landers Center, though.\n\nBut Page said he won’t be changing any time soon.\n\n“It’s called showboating,” the Brit said at the post-event news conference. “I intend to put on a show. The reason I’m here and I’m able to be at this table is because I fight the way I fight. To be honest, if I was fighting exactly the same as everyone else, I don’t know if I’d be here right now. It’s not me trying to be disrespectful.”\n\nPlus, Page counters, this isn’t the first time he’s employed such style in a fight.\n\n“If you were to go back and look at any of my kickboxing fights, I’ve been fighting like that for ages,” he said. “All it is now is that I’m trying to make it so that I’m safe enough to continue doing that in the MMA world and obviously get new fans, get new support in the MMA industry. There’s so much more that we can do in the cage. Who says we can’t do that? Who says your hands can’t be by your side? If you can get away with it, do it. That’s what it is.”\n\nHis boss, Bellator CEO Bjorn Rebney, didn’t seem to mind. And that may be because he knows he may have a big star on his hands in the welterweight division – a weight class that is looking for a new standout after the departure of champion Ben Askren.\n\nTo many, Askren was a villain – and perhaps Page will become one to many people, as well. But either way, Rebney said to expect more from him soon.\n\n“Michael Page is a different breed of cat. We got to see a little taste of it tonight,” Rebney said. “We’ll get to see more of it hopefully in short order. Barring injury, we’ll get him right back.”\n\nAnd coming right back seems to be what Page would prefer, as well. And when he returns, expect more of the same playfulness in the cage, a bit reminiscent of prime Anderson Silva.\n\n“I just want to let people know this is my style,” Page said. “This has been my style for years. I’m not going to change. I’m out here to enjoy myself and have fun on my journey and hopefully get to the top.”\n\nFor complete coverage of Bellator 120, stay tuned to the MMA Events section of the site.",
  "latent_24847": "Renowned US academic Noam Chomsky says Bernie Sanders has the best policies of the Democratic presidential contenders, but does not have a real chance to win in a political system where elections are \"mainly bought\".\n\nIn the second part of an interview with Mehdi Hasan on Al Jazeera's UpFront current affairs show, the MIT emeritus professor said that he considered Sanders to be \"basically a new dealer\".\n\n\"I agree with him in a lot of things, not in other things,\" Chomsky said.\n\n\"I frankly think that in our system of mainly bought elections, he doesn't have much of a chance.\n\n\"But if he were elected I think he would - of the current candidates - be the one who would have, from my point of view, the best policies.\"\n\nAn average of major nationwide political polls, tabulated by RealClear Politics, sees Hillary Clinton, the former US secretary of state, enjoying a significant lead, 51.2 percent to 38 percent.\n\nBut Sanders has recently enjoyed a major bump in New Hampshire, with a CNN/WMUR poll pointing to a huge lead over Clinton.\n\nStill, the majority of analysts still believe Clinton to be the likely presidential nominee to emerge from the Democratic primaries.\n\nIf that were to happen, Chomsky told UpFront that he would absolutely vote for Clinton over any Republican, if he lived in a swing state.\n\n\"Oh absolutely ... My vote would be against the Republican candidate,\" said Chomsky, who lives in Massachusetts, a safe state for the Democrats.\n\nChomsky said there were clear differences between the two parties.\n\n\"There are enormous differences,\" he said. \"Every Republican candidate is either a climate change denier or a sceptic who says we can't do it.\n\n\"What they are saying is, 'Let's destroy the world.'

Photo by KCNA/Yonhap\n\nSEOUL, May 15 (UPI) -- The purge of North Korea defense minister Hyon Yong Chol is believed to have led to his execution, according to sources in North Korea.\n\nThe report follows announcements from Seoul's spy agency that claimed Hyon had been purged and possibly executed – although Hyon's death ultimately could not be confirmed by South Korea.\n\nBut South Korea-based media outlet Daily NK reported sources in Pyongyang and other parts of North Korea said there is growing evidence Hyon was executed.\n\nOne source inside North Korea said Hyon's purge was mentioned during a lecture delivered by \"political department officers of the highest-ranking military unit.\"\n\nDuring the speech, Hyon was referred to as \"an autocratic warlord who refused orders from the Supreme Leader,\" Kim Jong Un, the source told Daily NK on Thursday.\n\nComparisons between Hyon's case and the \"Kim Chang Bong incident\" of 1968 were also made, the source said. Kim Chang Bong, a fellow anti-colonial guerrilla fighter of North Korea founder Kim Il Sung, was executed for opposing North Korea's monolithic ideology.\n\nNorth Korea military cadres are expected to undergo \"ideology tests\" soon, said another source, adding personnel are \"unable to conceal their fears after catching wind of Hyon's execution.\"\n\nAnother source in North Korea's Yangkang Province said locals had heard Hyon was executed with anti-aircraft machine guns 10 days earlier.\n\nThe same source said state television continued to show Hyon Yong Chol in archived video footage in order to mitigate reactions from the international community.\n\nOn Friday, Seoul's spy agency said it is \"confident\" in its claims of Hyon's execution, reported The Hankyoreh. The statement comes two days after the National Intelligence Service made conflicting claims about North Korea's defense minister.\n\nRELATED North Korea fires more than 130 shells in nighttime military exercises\n\nNorth Korea scholar Adam Cathcart wrote in The Guardian on Friday that since the execution of Kim Jong Un's uncle Jang Song Thaek, North Korean men and women in schools and factories are expected to sing \"We will only follow you,\" a new song from North Korea's Moranbong band that adulates the North Korean leader.",
  "latent_24898": "New Delhi, Aug. 18: Any appointment to a government job made without the post being advertised in the media violates Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has ruled.\n\nArticle 14 mandates equality before the law, and Article 16 says the State shall not discriminate between citizens in matters relating to appointment to public offices.\n\nThe ruling came as the apex court recently upheld a Bihar government appeal against a high court bench quashing the dismissal of an illegally appointed police constable, Chandreshwar Pathak.\n\nPathak had pleaded that he should be allowed to continue in the job because he had already served the police for 16 years. The bench of Justices T.S. Thakur and A.K. Goel rejected the argument.\n\n“In the absence of any advertisement or selection process, the appointment of the respondent is not protected and could be validly terminated,” the apex court ruled.\n\nIt said that for any public appointment, a notice must be published in the appropriate manner calling for applications, and all the applicants must be considered fairly.\n\n“Even if the names of the candidates are requisitioned from the employment exchange”, the employer must “invite applications from all eligible candidates from the open market by advertising the vacancies in newspapers having wide circulation or by announcement in radio and television”, the court said.\n\n“If any appointment is made by merely inviting names from the employment exchange or putting a note on the notice board, etc, that will not meet the requirement of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Such a course… deprives the candidates who are eligible for the post from being considered.”\n\nThose recruited in violation of these provisions are not entitled to any relief, not even their salary, the court said.\n\nIn January 1988, Bihar’s then CID inspector-general had appointed Pathak as a temporary constable with the stipulation that he could be sacked without assigning any reason. Pathak continued in service till September 2003, when the CID sacked him.\n\nIn April 2010, a single-judge Patna High Court bench dismissed Pathak’s petition saying it was not satisfied that he had “made out a case for interference with the order of termination from what appears to be an illegal appointment based on the spoils system”.\n\n“The petitioner must perish by the same sword by which he came,” the judge ruled.\n\nBut a division bench quashed Pathak’s dismissal in January 2012, prompting the government challenge.\n\n“Learned single judge was justified in dismissing the writ petition while the division bench erred in interfering with the same,” the apex court ruled.",

The drug makes $1 billion in annual U.S. sales.\n\n“We believe the actual basis of filing patent lawsuits was to extend the significant monopoly profits at the expense of consumers,” Ramirez said during a call with reporters.\n\nAround the same time, AbbVie approved a settlement with another company, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, over a different billion-dollar drug. The FTC alleged that the companies' agreement took place because Teva Pharmaceuticals agreed not to pursue a generic version of AndroGel.\n\nThe FTC has aggressively sought out this kind of \"pay-for-delay\" settlement, which are estimated to cost consumers $3.5 billion per year, according to the agency’s report in 2010.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled last year that pharmaceutical companies could be sued for anti-trust violations if they paid rivals not to develop generic brands of their drugs.

  "latent_25009": "My 13-year-old daughter loves to play the starlet model, with me as her photographer, all in the name of a better Facebook profile picture. One day recently she turned the tables and took pictures of me.\n\nI knew I was in trouble when she showed me the final results on her laptop. \"Look mom, I made you look so much better.\"\n\nIn this case, so much better meant I'd been digitally Botoxed. Gone was the vertical groove in my forehead, a squint line I'd worked years to create by vainly not wearing my prescription eyeglasses. That wrinkle showed up as a hairline fracture when I was 30 and now, at 50, is a Grand Canyon-sized crevice.\n\nDon't get me started on why it's perfectly okay for Leonardo DiCaprio to have San Andreas-like fault lines on his forehead, while female actors like Nicole Kidman resort to so much Botox, their foreheads resemble flat screen TVs. It's a dubious statement of the times that when 59-year-old film star Kim Basinger shuns cosmetic work it makes headlines. The adages \"aging gracefully\" and \"beauty is only skin deep\" are clearly as socially appropriate these days as, say, \"a woman's place is in the home.\"\n\nAs I face (pun intended) a new decade of getting older, I'm confronted with more and more of my friends showing up at parties, often after an extended spa holiday (yes, code word for out-patient clinic) looking 10 years younger--or more often, facially paralyzed. Let's face it, when a smile looks like a snarl you just know enormous muscular effort is involved to overcome Botox.\n\nArguably worse than the freeze look is the fright face. This overly zealous cosmetic procedure lifts eyebrows to the hairline, causing a look that ranges from perpetual surprise to outright shock. Then there's the ethnic eye job, where one girlfriend (well, okay two) went in for \"medically necessary\" eye surgery and came out looking Asian. (Which is nuts, given lately Asians are busy having eye surgery to look Caucasian.)\n\nAs I cheerfully engage My Freaking Fabulous 50s (insert your own slogan), I refuse to surrender to the cultural beauty imperative where wrinkles are treated like a rash and sagging skin, like leprosy. I'm instead cheerleading a new movement, Wrinkled Women Of Worth--or even, Get Your Sexy (Facial Movement) Back!\n\nBecause, when I look at my Fabulous Fifty face in the mirror, this is what I see.\n\nI see deep lines bracketing my mouth from decades of choosing laughter, even when life has delivered the pain of losing both parents before I turned 39, and the near death of my son, not once, but twice. Despite it all, I have laugh lines.\n\nWhen I look in the mirror, I see a fan of wrinkles in the outer corner of each eye from smiling through so many episodes of joy, not to mention \"say cheese\" photo sessions.\n\nAnd on mornings where I slept poorly or drank copiously the night before, I see in my mirror someone who could pass for a bag lady. Gone are the days of living hard and looking good. Now, I tenderly love this body so that my morning face does not scare dogs and small children.\n\nAnd when I look in the mirror I see me. I see the little girl who looks out from old snapshots with her gap-toothed smile. I see the 20-year-old bride, the 30-year-old mom and the 40-year-old divorcee.\n\nWhat I don't see is a face doctored by scalpels and botulism toxin, or plumped by fillers or scoured and planed by lasers. I am every cosmetic surgeon's worst nightmare -- not because I need so much work but because I am so clear that the only work I need do, is beyond skin deep.",
  "latent_25070": "Johannesburg - The election in Johannesburg is shaping up as a tight affair. In 2014, the ANC received a historically-low 52% of the vote in Johannesburg, setting the metro up as a major swing area for the 2016 local government elections.\n\nSo what will happen this year?\n\nThe only credible public polling on Johannesburg is IPSOS’ running tracking poll, which currently has the DA leading (36% for the DA to 31% for the ANC). The poll includes a very large number of undecided former ANC voters – suggesting that the outcome could look markedly different than the current polling average.\n\nAnother way to assess potential election results in Johannesburg is to look at previous voting patterns. An analysis of the latest registration figures and the voting patterns from 2014 and 2011 suggests that the ANC could be on the verge of being pushed below 50% in Johannesburg.\n\nThe Johannesburg Electorate\n\nAfter the latest round of registration weekends, Johannesburg has a total of 2.1 million registered voters and about 835 voting districts (VDs). These voting districts can be divided into 5 distinct sub groups:\n\n1. Solid ANC VDs (where the ANC receives more than 70% of the vote)\n\n2. VDs that lean towards the ANC (where the ANC receives 50-70% of the vote)\n\n3. Marginal VDs (where a party wins with less than 50% of the vote)\n\n4. VDs that lean towards the DA (where the DA receives 50-70% of the vote)\n\n5. Solid DA VDs (where the DA receives more than 70% of the vote)\n\nThese five groups of VDs have the following characteristics:\n\nBut despite this advantage, the ANC faces some major problems that threaten its ability to reach 50% in the metro.\n\nThe ANC’s 3 big problems in Johannesburg\n\nProblem 1: Voter registration\n\nThe DA significantly out-registered the ANC during the 2016 registration weekends. The total voters roll grew by roughly 30 000 new voters in the DA base areas, whilst the total number of registered voters in ANC areas was essentially unchanged.\n\nThis outcome is significant for two reasons: Firstly, it means that the DA base grew relative to the ANC base, creating a slightly more favourable overall electorate for the DA. But secondly, it could indicate that DA supporters are much more motivated to get to the polls in this election than ANC supporters are.\n\nProblem 2: The EFF\n\nThe ANC’s got a very serious problem on their hands with the EFF in Johannesburg. Comparing the 2011 to 2014 results, we can see that the EFF siphoned off a huge number of votes from the ANC in ‘solid ANC’ and ‘lean ANC’ VDs. Consider these results:\n\nIn both the ‘solid ANC’ and ‘lean ANC’ areas, the ANC suffered significant losses, almost exclusively to the EFF (the DA did make minor inroads in each case). Although the ANC still won in these areas, it won them by smaller margins - reducing the overall ANC vote count significantly.\n\nThe EFF’s impact on the ANC also has an important geographic element to it. The ‘solid ANC’ VDs (where the ANC only lost about 10% to the EFF) are almost exclusive in Johannesburg’s Southern townships (Soweto and Orange Farm). It is interesting to note that the ANC is more resilient in these Southern townships.\n\nThe ‘lean ANC’ VDs (where the EFF had a massive impact on the ANC by taking about 16% of the vote from the ANC) are almost exclusively in the Johannesburg CBD and Johannesburg’s Northern townships (Diepsloot, Alexandra and Ivory Park).\n\nThe divergence in the ANC performance between these regions is a very important development, and it suggests that both the EFF and the DA’s best growth prospects are in Johannesburg’s CBD and Northern townships.\n\nProblem 3: Turnout\n\nFor the last two elections, the ANC has struggled to get voters in its strongest areas to the polls, whilst the DA has done relatively well to get its supporters to the polls. This creates a significant ‘turnout gap’ between the DA base and the ANC base, inflating the DA’s overall percentage of the vote and deflating the ANC’s overall share. Here is the evidence:\n\nTurnout in DA areas far exceeded turnout in ANC areas in both elections, but the ‘turnout gap’ was particularly pronounced in 2011 (the last local government election). If the pattern repeats itself, it could spell trouble for the ANC.\n\n- Election map: Previous ANC results\n\nExpectations for August\n\nSo the ANC faces some challenges this August: The turnout gap is likely to look similar to the one in 2011, the makeup of the overall electorate is slightly more favourable to the DA, the EFF is set to again take a chunk out of the ANC vote and the DA is set to grow its share of the vote in the townships if the IPSOS poll is to be believed.\n\nSimulating an election outcome using the latest registration figures, the 2011 turnout gap and the 2014 voting pattern (so for the moment assuming no new growth for the DA or EFF), produces the following result:\n\nThe result shows how close the ANC is to the 50% mark. Even without any DA or EFF growth, the party is just barely hovering over 50%. The critical question of course is whether the 2011 turnout pattern will change and whether the DA or EFF can make further inroads in ANC areas.\n\nI modelled a plausible scenario using the following assumptions:\n\n1. Turnout in ANC areas remains the same as in 2011\n\n2. Turnout in DA areas increases by 5%\n\n3. The DA grows marginally in the townships whilst the EFF remains stable (a conservative assumption given the IPSOS polling)\n\n4. The DA consolidates the opposition vote further\n\nThat simulation produced the following result:\n\nThis is a conservatively favourable scenario for the DA. Any number of other changes could take place that amplifies the DA’s growth (like huge DA base turnout or significant DA growth in strong ANC areas). Conversely, there are also plausible developments that could occur in favour of the ANC. ANC base turnout in particular is an important variable with upside potential for the ANC given that it was very low in 2011 (55%) and that it could edge higher this time around as voters will be aware of the high level of contestation in the metro.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe model suggests that the ANC is very likely to be the largest party in Johannesburg, but that it could easily be pushed below 50% (and even well below 50% in certain scenarios). The conservative scenarios that were tested generally produced results where the ANC falls just below or just over 50% in a range from 45% to 52%.\n\nIt is important to remember though that the simulations described above are based on (conservative) assumptions. Dramatic and unexpected things can happen on Election Day, especially if turnout looks markedly different than 2011.\n\n- Dawie Scholtz holds an MBA from UCT and is currently studying towards a Master's Degree in advanced management at Yale University.

  "latent_25244": "A long time ago, I wrote an article entitled Bag of Confidence, and ever since, many have turned to me with their equipment questions. I would love to profess that I was smart enough to have just the right camera gear from the get go, but such is not the case. Like so many in the field, having the right camera gear was a trial-by-error methodology for much of the beginning of my photography career. I was asked to write this piece in the hope that you might learn from my mistakes, and build on my successes. So here’s how my camera bag has in it what it does today.\n\nWhere It Started\n\nPhotography for me, like for so many others, started at home, with other shutterbuggers in the family. My father carried an Argus C3 throughout WWII & Korea, and was still shooting with it when I was a teenager. Then my brother bought his Minolta, and when my dad saw that, going from a rangefinder to an SLR, well, he was sold. I got the hand-me-down, but that didn’t last long—the Minolta SLR was great. The photography bug bit hard, so as a freshman in high school, I was in the photography class.\n\nThis influence was huge! My teacher had a Nikon F, and my cousin had one as well. I will never forget holding my cousin’s F, with a 200mm f/4 attached, and looking out across the valley, seeing small things looked “big” in the viewfinder. I couldn’t afford a Nikon, so I saved and saved until I got a Minolta SRT202, my first serious camera.\n\nThat lasted a few years, and served me very well. But when I went off to school, it was obvious that the features in the camera, and the quality of the lenses (I had many a Vivitar back then) required that I move up. In 1980, I bought my first Nikon, an F2 w/DP-1 finder, and a 50mm f/2. That was it. I was hooked, and I’ve never looked back!\n\nThe “Pro” Body Bug\n\nThe F2 was upgraded a few times during the next couple of years with the latest metering head and a few lenses, until the F3 was introduced. While I looked at the 'prosumer' bodies of the time, there has always been something about the feel of the large, heavy, pro Nikon bodies that has always had me owning them. The time the F3 was added to my camera bag was the same time I got my first telephoto lens, the 400mm f/5.6 ED IF. That’s what I had when I started out as a wildlife photographer. It was a great system, teaching me many lessons about photography, wildlife photography and camera gear.\n\nThe F3 brought with it a photographic life-changing feature for me, TTL flash! This one simple, yet very powerful feature now made flash a friend, not a foe—a tool, not a ball and chain! Lighting for wildlife was now simple, small, compact and most importantly, no longer a hazard to critters. This was improved with each camera body, from the F3 to the N2020 with its AF, and finally the N8008. This technology, when combined with biology, made photographs possible that weren’t possible before, sending me down a path of forever chasing new technology.\n\nThe F3 morphed into the F4, the F4 into the F5—probably the finest film camera ever. The F5 was responsible for putting a whole lot of my best images in the filing cabinets and in print. It was during this time that the 800mm f5.6 ED IF entered my camera bag. That focal length became my main bird lens, and in my mind, it put my photography on the map. At the same time, TTL flash, flashes and accessories improved, making it possible to concentrate on just the subject and not the photography.\n\nThen, in 1998, I walked out of a back room at PMA New Orleans carrying a small, brown paper bag with a secret the world was not yet to know about. I took it back to my hotel room, and with no one looking, took it out of the nondescript bag, powered it on, and took a photo of my big toe. My first digital photo was captured!\n\nIn the fall of 1999, the D1 was put into my hands, and I’ve never looked back at film since. One of my favorite photos of all time, one I rarely share, was taken with the D1. A 30x40 print of Sneak, a grizzly bear, hangs behind my desk, and that print was made from a 1MB JPEG. I knew then—as I know now—that digital rocks!\n\nToday’s Bag of Confidence\n\nEvery photographer needs to have their own bag of confidence, a camera bag of gear they can pick up and know they have the tools they need to tell their visual story their way. It’s through three decades of building that bag for my needs that I came to what I have today. That is:\n\nD4\n\nD800\n\n600mm f4 VR\n\n200-400mm f4 VR2\n\n70-200mm f2.8 VR2\n\n24-70mm f2.8 AFS\n\n50mm f1.4 AFS\n\n24mm f1.4 AFS\n\n18mm f2.8 AF\n\n16mm f2.8 AF\n\nTC-20eIII\n\nTC-17eII\n\nTC-14eII\n\nMany ask why I own Nikon, and I’ve read many strangers’ ideas why, but there is only one reason—the same one I’ve said many times—flash! Nikon’s flash is what has kept me with the system for thirty years. It is an essential tool to my photography, and when it’s easy, photography is easy.\n\nWhy do I have the gear that I do in my bag? It boils down to one basic reason—it solves the problems I face in my photography. Cost does play into the equation. That's why it includes only these pieces—the ones I need—and not the ones I want. Every piece of gear has to serve more than one function. The 16mm fisheye does not only landscapes, but also my cockpit panos. The 24mm f1.4 AF-S is not only a fast wide angle, but also a great macro lens. The list just keeps on going.\n\nAnd the most important aspect of this, the gear, might all change tomorrow! I feel photographers are as much problem solvers as storytellers. Solving problems in front of the camera and behind, so that we can tell the story as we see it, is very much a part of the process, dictating what gear we have in our bag.\n\nOne question I was asked is, “What’s the most-used item in your bag, what’s the least used, and why?” This is a very valid question, but if you have an answer for this question, either you aren’t in the business of photography, or you’re no longer in the business of photography. That’s the one aspect of all of this that is hard to grasp if you don’t make a living from your photography—the capital investment pressure. It’s like an employee—if they aren’t pulling their weight, you've got to let them go. If I have a piece of gear that's not pulling its weight, it’s got to go.\n\nWhat’s the point of all of this? Probably the main point is that photography and photography gear are a learning experience. As my photography skills grew, the amount of camera gear grew. As camera technology evolved, my photography evolved, and the marriage of gear, skill, technique and passion moved forward. It pushed the photography forward, and it’s still pushing it forward today. Having the right gear does make a difference, but it’s not the end-all. It still takes the person behind it, their creative process, and the heart that drives them to make the photograph. But without that gear, those moments in life would only be recorded on the thin emulsion of our minds. Since I think we need to share our photographs, the gear is essential.",
  "latent_25586": "MSNBC’s Chuck Todd spent the first 20 minutes on Wednesday’s MTP Daily complaining about the White House and its “credibility crisis.” “If it's Wednesday, we've come a long way from George Washington and that cherry tree. Tonight, the White House credibility crisis deepens,” he mocked, as he started his show after the administration was found to have misled on several occasions. “I would be fired for lying,” he lamented, noting how people are skeptical of the press.\n\nTodd began his opening rant by playing a clip of the day’s White House press briefing where Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked: “Do you see any circumstances where it's appropriate to lie from the podium?” “And it's a question that had to be asked TODAY of this White House,” an irritated Todd sounded off.\n\nBut NBC was nowhere to be found back in late 2013 when Fox News’ James Rosen cornered State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki on the Iran deal negotiations, asking: “Is it the policy of the State Department, where the preservation of the secrecy of secret negotiations is concerned, to lie in order to achieve that goal?” NBC was also nowhere to found when the Obama administration was caught editing the question out of their archived video in early June of 2016.\n\n“They’ve compounded misleading statements with misleading statements about those misleading statements,” Todd bemoaned about the current White House. “They've been caught in blatant contradictions and petty fabrications. Where to begin?”\n\nPerhaps it’s best to start with those who are the pot calling the kettle black.\n\nUnironically, Todd whined to NPR’s David Folkenflik that he has talked to people who have told him they “don't know what to believe” anymore between politicians and the media. “And they sort of throw up their hands and say: ‘I give up.’”\n\nBut who could blame them? It’s not like they can look to MSNBC for completely factual coverage.\n\nTake Andrea Mitchell for example. When Justice Neil Gorsuch was still in the early stages of the nomination process, Mitchell lied and claimed that President Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, was never granted a meeting with any GOP Senators when, in fact, he met with 16 of them. That was a lie also told by MSNBC’s Chris Matthews.\n\nThere were numerous MSNBC hosts, like Katy Tur, who rewrite history to suit their political arguments for the day. And others, like Stephanie Ruhle, who parrot debunked Planned Parenthood propaganda.\n\nBut the network’s Rachel Maddow really took the cake when she completely fabricated a scandal involving President Trump and ‘missing funds’ for his inauguration. The evidence for her accusations broke down to: “The inauguration didn’t look like it cost $107 million, so there for Trump must be doing something shady.”\n\n<<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>>\n\nAnd for all of Todd’s chiding that no one could “take [the Trump administration] at their word at anything,” they constantly took the Obama administration’s word on everything, despite their lies about Operation Fast and Furious and the Benghazi attack.\n\nIn describing his reaction to those skeptical people, a clearly frustrated Todd, declared: “I always want to say: ‘I would be fired for lying.’” “You would be, but not everybody believes that,” Folkenflik responded without missing a beat. But would he really? Because all the evidence points to no. MSNBC has yet to fire any of the previously mentioned liars.\n\nAnd that’s not to mention their most infamous embarrassment: Brian Williams. Despite Williams’ disgraceful lying about his time in the Middle East, MSNBC found it appropriate to keep him on the payroll. And with enough time, he eventually got his own show during the 2016 election called The 11th Hour. The network also conducted an internal and secret investigation into Williams’ offense, but have never been forthcoming with their findings.\n\nThere is an abundance of evidence that shows how MSNBC has an ankle high bar for truth telling standards, and they’ll help up those who manage to trip on it. So Todd’s job is secure. And since that’s clearly the case for MSNBC, in the words of Chuck Todd himself: “Why should we or the public or Congress or the world take them at their word at anything?”\n\nTranscript below:",

What was Google thinking?\n\nThe good news for potential converts, however, is the Nexus 6 is far better to use than its statistics imply and it all comes down to common sense. What Motorola has done so much better than its two main rivals is deliver on the ergonomics and it feels great in hand, huge but great.\n\nThis is largely down to a heavily curved back that nestles snugly in your palm (only the thickest point in the middle is 10.1mm) and edges that have just the right curvature so you get a good grip. The power and volume keys have also been intelligently positioned lower down the phone so they are easy to reach with your thumb and Motorola’s trademark rear dimple has moved lower to make it a resting point for your index finger and stabilising point of contact.\n\nYes, as many have commented, the Nexus 6 is essentially an enlarged Moto X (which is no bad thing) but it is these carefully considered edits which mean Motorola hasn't simply enlarged it to create the Nexus 6. Something Apple is guilty of doing with the iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nRead more: iPhone 6 Plus Long Term Review: Beautiful Freak Is The iPhone’s Future\n\nFurthermore Motorola has created a rock solid phone. The metal chassis and rear curvature make it incredibly rigid, the camera has a flush finish - unlike its main rivals - and the dual front facing stereo speakers (more later) are raised which help to protect the screen during a fall.\n\nIt isn't all perfect though. The Nexus 6 has a form factor which is easily the most practical I’ve seen on a phablet, but it lacks panache. The plastic back surprisingly omits the soft touch finish seen on the standard Moto X and is prone to collecting fingerprints and though most edges and seams are well crafted, around the camera ring the finish is a little rough and ready.\n\nFurthermore the Nexus 6 is not a one-handed phone. Different hand sizes obviously impact where the threshold lies for you, but for the vast majority the Nexus 6 will cross it. The length of the phone plays a part, but more important is width which stops you wrapping your thumb as far around the display as is needed.\n\nRead more: Nexus 6 vs Nexus 5: What’s The Difference?\n\nFor those even remotely considering a Nexus 6 this won’t be a dealbreaker and its phablet rivals are also two handed devices. Swiftkey and its clever compact screen mode (see above) will address your one-handed typing needs, but it can’t help you reach the top corners.\n\nApple’s ‘Reachability’ fix (sliding the whole screen down with a double tap on the TouchID button) may be crude, but Google would be wise to look into something similar.\n\nNext Page: Display...\n\nDisplay: Big And Brilliant\n\nPerhaps the main reason potential Nexus 6 owners are prepared to suffer the inconvenience of its huge form factor is its mammoth screen and here Motorola has delivered in spades.\n\nNexus 6: 5.96-inch, 2560 x 1440 (2k), AMOLED panel - 493 pixels per inch\n\niPhone 6 Plus: 5.5-inch, 1920 x 1080 (Full HD), IPS panel - 401 pixels per inch\n\nGalaxy Note 4: 5.7-inch, 2560 x 1440 (2k), Super AMOLED panel - 515 pixels per inch\n\nSimply put, the Nexus 6 screen is jaw dropping. The extra size is noticeable against it rivals, particularly the iPhone 6 Plus, and Motorola has done an incredible job in slimming down the bezels. With the exception of the LG G3, no other smartphone comes close and it makes you appreciate what a superb job the company has done to keep the form factor as small as it has.\n\nAs for the panel itself, Motorola has toned down the colour saturation compared to the Moto X which gives the Nexus 6 more realistic tones while still remaining incredibly rich and bright. The difference in the 2k resolution versus the iPhone 6 Plus’ 1080p panel can be spotted if you look closely enough, but both remain exceptional.\n\nThe LG G3 is still the best display I've seen and - while fractional - I’d place the Note 4’s 2k Super AMOLED panel ever so slightly higher as well. This is because it has an extra degree of sharpness, but none of this will concern owners of any of these phones in day-to-day use.\n\nMore useful than this nitpicking, will be Google’s decision to fit an extra row of both vertical and horizontal icons onto the Nexus 6 homescreen making it 6 x 5 rather than 5 x 4. This means 50% greater space which really takes advantage of the big screen, especially with the homescreen widget support long built into Android.\n\nOf course third party launchers have long been able to resize Android icons and fit as many as you like, but Nexus devices are all about stock Android and this is a very welcome tweak.\n\nRead more: iPhone 6 Plus Vs Galaxy Note 4 Review: 2014's Biggest Phone Fight\n\nNext Page: Performance And Android 5.0 Lollipop…\n\nPerformance - Class Leading, Almost Everywhere\n\nThe upside of phablets is how much can be crammed into them and the specifications of the Nexus 6 are about as good as it gets in mobile phone technology in late 2014.\n\nDriving the show is Qualcomm’s latest and greatest chipset, the Snapdragon 805. It runs at full throttle like the Note 4 which means a quad-core 2.7GHz Krait 450 CPU and quad-core 2.5GHz Adreno 420 GPU.\n\nThe bad news is the chipset is not 64-bit, despite Lollipop’s newfound support. The good news is it doesn’t matter one bit.\n\nMotorola has paired the Nexus 6’s Snapdragon 805 chipset with 3GB of RAM and in combination with stock Android 5.0 Lollipop the handset flies. The aim of Nexus devices has always been to show off Android to its best abilities and this has never been better illustrated than with the Nexus 6.\n\nLollipop’s most startling new feature Material Design, looks fantastic, its 60fps transitional animations are buttery smooth and it is extremely hard to catch the phone out. There is also nothing to trouble it within the Google Play Store itself and even the latest and greatest games are unlikely to present a challenge for at least a few years.\n\niOS has long been the benchmark for slick, fast operation but Lollipop is now right up there and it has none of the lag which occasionally impacts the TouchWiz skin on the Galaxy Note 4. All the while Motorola has done a very good job with its thermal envelope and the Nexus 6 never gets more than warm, even under prolonged stress.\n\nElsewhere the Nexus 6 garners attention for its 13MP camera with optical image stabilisation and 4K video (more later), but observers will also spot that in true Nexus style there is no expandable storage or removable battery - a Note 4 staple. With just 32GB and 64GB options the former will concern some (especially with 4K video), though the latter is combated by the Nexus 6’s huge 3220 mAh battery and support for Qi wireless charging.\n\nI’ll deal with battery life specifically in a bit, but as a hint: the loss of a removable battery isn't the end of the world.\n\nAside from this the Nexus 6 hits all the usual flagship smartphone targets. Key ones are 802.11ac WiFi, ‘LTE Advanced’ 4G which supports download speeds of up to 300Mbit, dual front facing stereo speakers (again more later) and water resistance (to splashing but not full submersion).\n\nRead more: Nexus 6 - Everything You Need To Know\n\nAndroid 5.0 Lollipop - 2014’s Best Mobile Platform\n\nI’ve already done an extensive Android 5.0 Lollipop review and head-to-head with iOS 8 so this isn’t the time for another full review. What I am keen to highlight, however, are aspects of its implementation on the Nexus 6.\n\nYes this phablet gets the full works including Material Design, the new notifications system and app switcher plus multi-user and guest modes, but there are a number of little touches to the Nexus 6 which really stand out.\n\nRead more: Best And Worst Things About Android 5.0 Lollipop\n\nOne of the best in day-to-day use is an Android version of ‘Moto Display’ which automatically detects motion and lights up the display in battery-friendly monotone. This means it is easy to quickly check the time or notifications and means the phone is great for at-a-glance information. Support for this functionality will be available to all Lollipop phones, but they will need compatible hardware to support it.\n\nMotorola hasn't implemented gesture recognition (wave a hand above the screen to turn it on) but that isn’t a huge loss as a negative side effect is that the screen can come on regularly, even when walking past it.\n\nThat said there is one area where Lollipop is lacking at this very early point in its lifecycle and that is phablet-specific features.\n\nWhereas Apple has started to make apps function differently on the iPhone 6 Plus compared to the iPhone 6 to take advantage of its larger screen and the Note 4 is heavily customised with phablet-friendly features like the S Pen stylus, split and windowed screen operation, the Nexus 6 is essentially an Android phone, just bigger.\n\nThat means Gmail doesn’t split into columns as on Android phablets, nor do the recently updated Google Calendar and Google Maps offer any sort of new layout to take advantage of the extra space. You can see more emails, more calendar entries and more of the map but that’s it.\n\nRead more: iOS 8 vs Android 5.0 Lollipop: Material Difference\n\nAs such my concern, given that these are Google’s latest core apps, is that it has no plans to differentiate how Android works on a phablet compared to how it works on a phone or tablet. I recognise the complication this could cause, but enhancing some apps (and giving developers the tools to do the same), is something that comes into play when you launch a device only 1-inch smaller than the Nexus 7 tablet.\n\nYes in isolation, for me, Android 5.0 Lollipop has become the best mobile operating system currently available. But in launching its first phablet Google has yet to give us any indication of whether it will bring subsequent benefits to such a massive phone to tempt owners of smaller handsets to go bigger. The future for phablets is not in forcing phone makers to do all the software tweaks themselves.\n\nNext Page: Camera and Battery Life...\n\nCamera\n\nWhile phablet specific aspects for the Nexus 6 are thin on the ground at present, where it is off to a flying start is the camera. Phablets have started to dominate the top phone cameras courtesy of the iPhone 6 Plus, Note 4 and LG G3 which means this traditional weak area of the Nexus line has a tough job on its hands. Thankfully the Nexus 6 comes out swinging.\n\nNexus 6: 13 megapixels, f2.0 aperture, OIS, 4k (2160p) video. Front: 2MP, 1080p video\n\nGalaxy Note 4: 16 megapixels, f2.2 aperture, OIS, 4k (2160p) video. Front: 3.7MP, 1440p video\n\nLG G3: 13 megapixels, f2.4 aperture, OIS, 4k (2160p video). Front: 2.1MP, 1080p video\n\niPhone 6 Plus: 8 megapixels, f2.2 aperture, OIS, 1080p video. Front: 1.2MP, 720p video\n\nAmong this mass of specifications, the figure to focus on above is not megapixels but the aperture. The Nexus 6 has a slightly larger aperture compared to its rivals which allows it to take in more light. In combination with its optical image stabilisation (OIS) this gives it the foundation to edge ahead of the pack. And in photography terms, it does.\n\nIn good conditions the images the Nexus 6 can capture are superb. They offer more detail at full size than the iPhone 6 Plus and they are less prone to the extensive sharpening seen on the otherwise brilliant Note 4 - even if the Nexus 6 can also oversharpen slightly as seen on the full resolution crop of the leaves (further down).\n\nRead more: Why iPhone 6 Plus Camera Beats iPhone 6\n\nIn low light the Nexus 6 is also a champ and the shot it took of the lighter flame in pitch black was even achieved without HDR. Meanwhile HDR shots are uniformly excellent as the shot of the tree branches against the night sky illustrate.\n\nConsequently while Nexus 5 owners have gotten used to using HDR for every shot to shore up its somewhat erratic performance, Nexus 6 owners only need use it sparingly. So unless you're taking a photo where there are multiple light sources, leave it off.\n\nThe flip side is the dual flash which Motorola has made a lot of fuss about cannot compete with the wonderful True Tone flash in the iPhone 6 Plus and the Nexus 6 has a slightly slower focus time while the LG G3 and Note 4 are also quicker off the mark.\n\nWhen it comes to video, the Nexus 6 falls back into the pack. Its 4k results in combination with OIS are as good as anything I’ve seen from the Note 4 (the current class leader) and its microphone picks up audio extremely well. That said no camera app on Android currently offers slow motion results on a par with that achieved by the 240fps mode on the iPhone 6 Plus and the stock Android camera app remains pretty basic. Hopefully that will change.\n\nOne point of contention I do have with the Nexus 6, however, is the operation of the viewfinder. At present it is a little laggy and it can occasionally stutter during quick panning. This actually doesn’t affect the video results, so it is a software glitch I would expect Google to fix.\n\nBeyond this, Android 5.0 Lollipop actually has the potential to take camera performance to another level. It now offers apps direct access to the RAW files which means custom image processing can be created to suit individual lenses.\n\nGoogle has already shown increased emphasis here already as the Nexus 6 actually has the same sensor (a Sony IMX214) as the LG G3 yet it offers better results. As other flagship Android smartphones start upgrading to Lollipop it will be fascinating to see how their cameras are also improved.\n\nRead more: Android 5.0 Camera Tests Show Update Instantly Improves Every Smartphone\n\nI must also make a quick mention of the Nexus 6 speakers. During video playback you will be struck by how loud and clear they are. This is because they are both front facing and provide stereo, an effect which is actually audible due to the gap between them thanks to the large screen.\n\nThis is a major step up from the (still excellent) single front facing speaker on the Moto X and all its phablet rivals. In fact the Nexus 6 is now on a par with HTC’s class leading ‘BoomSound’ speakers as best seen on the HTC One M8. BoomSound still has a tiny bit more bass, but the Nexus 6 speakers are louder making them easily the loudest speakers I've heard on any phone.\n\nBattery Life - Phablet Fantastic\n\nIf you aren’t interested in a Nexus 6 because of its huge display, then it is almost certainly because of its massive battery.\n\nLike the Note 4, the Nexus 6 has a 3220 mAh battery, bigger than the 3000 mAh battery in the LG G3, the 2915 mAh battery in the iPhone 6 Plus and substantially bigger than the 2300 mAh battery in its predecessor, the Nexus 5.\n\nThe long and short of this is the Nexus 6 delivers all day battery life. You can kill it before your day is up with very intensive usage, but that is true of all smartphones and even tablets - and you will see I achieved that in the graph below deadening it in about 10 hours.\n\nThat said 1.5 days should be expected from normal use and it might even stretch to two days with light use. Given the Nexus 5 could be flat by early afternoon, the change is night and day. Of course your individual selection of apps, widgets and authorised background processes means no results are the same between any two users, but you will find it outlasts the LG G3 and is roughly on par with the Note 4.\n\nStill the iPhone 6 Plus remains the battery king. In use battery consumption is very similar to the Nexus 6, but it still retains the edge in standby. For example while the Nexus 6 will use about 5--6% of its battery overnight, the iPhone 6 Plus will use 1-2%. Android Lollipop’s battery saving focus courtesy of ‘Project Volta’ has definitely helped, but this is one area where it can still be tweaked further.\n\nWhere the Nexus 6 does get top marks, however, are its battery saver mode and charge times. The former is now finally built into Android and kicks in automatically at 15% battery life (this can be adjusted or disabled) and can provide up to another 90 minutes of use.\n\nFurthermore Qualcomm’s ‘Quick Charge 2.0’ technology is built into the Snapdragon 2.0 chipset and with the provided charger (or any Quick Charge 2.0 compatible charger) it backs up Google’s promise that a 15 minute charge can provide up to six hours of use. This is incredibly handy when you’re caught short, especially in conjunction with Android’s battery saver mode.\n\nThe caveats are: quick charging slows the more the battery is filled and if you use the phone while it is charging the charge rate slows significantly. From empty to 100% takes about two hours.\n\nThe Nexus 6 does also support Qi wireless charging like the Nexus 5, Note 4 and several Nokia Lumia handsets but this is a much slower charge rate so it is best used overnight or by a desk.\n\nNext Page: Value, Availability and Bottom Line\n\nValue And Availability - Premium And Prime Time\n\nThe Nexus range has long been loved for its combination of cutting edge specs and bargain basement pricing, but with the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 tablet that era appears to be over:\n\nNexus 6: 32GB - $649; 64GB - $699\n\nGalaxy Note 4: 16GB - $599, 32GB $699\n\niPhone 6 Plus: 16GB - $749, 64GB - $849, 128GB - $949\n\nIt is worth pointing out that the Nexus 6 is still the cheapest of its biggest rivals and significantly less than the iPhone 6 Plus, in particular. That said this is no longer a casual purchase and, while pricing differs from carrier to carrier, on contract there is little between them.\n\nGoogle also hasn't helped itself by yet again making a mess of the Nexus 6 launch, something it repeated with the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 and pre-order availability for the Nexus 6 have so far totalled minutes rather than days.\n\nThese stock problems don’t look likely to end anytime soon either with several US carriers having already put back their launch dates and stock looks set to be low well into 2015.\n\nSimilar problems hit Apple with every iPhone launch, but it is selling millions. Google and whichever manufacturer it works with each year really need to up their game.\n\nRead more: Motorola Moto X (2014)\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis isn't the Nexus review I expected to write. Like many I thought a shift to a 5.2-inch or even 5.5-inch handset would occur and there is no doubt in moving to a 6-inch display and premium pricing the Nexus 6 has left many disappointed and frustrated. Myself included.\n\nBut treated in isolation the Nexus 6 is a great success and for those prepared to step up in size, you will be rewarded with perhaps the most complete phone ever made. The screen is gorgeous, the bezels tiny, the form factor is ergonomic, the performance is blistering, the camera and speakers are class leading and the battery life is great.\n\nMeanwhile Android 5.0 Lollipop is a huge step forward and, while I’d like to see more phablet-specific aspects, it is only going to get better with time. Especially as Nexus devices quickly receive Android updates.\n\nFor me this is the best big phone on the market, ahead of the Galaxy Note 4, LG G3 and iPhone 6 Plus. Whether it holds onto first place in a year's time though will depend on the evolution of iOS and Android.\n\nUltimately, however, it is impossible to escape the question of size. I started this review with it and I will end with it.\n\nIn an ideal world everything packed into the Nexus 6 would also be packed into a new version of the Nexus 5, much like Apple has done with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. To some extent that has happened with the 5.2-inch Moto X that inspired the Nexus 6, but there are speed, battery, screen and camera compromises.\n\nAs such, for better or worse, the best Android device is now a phablet and that leaves us all with a sizeable decision to make.\n\n___\n\nFollow @GordonKelly\n\nMore on Forbes",
  "latent_25938": "Within weeks of the US election, president Donald Trump said he intended to scrap NASA’s research on climate change, shifting those resources—less than $2 billion of the agency’s $19 billion budget—to its space program.\n\nOther Republicans have echoed that goal. Oklahoma state senator Jim Bridenstine, who is reportedly being considered (among others) to run NASA, once called on Barack Obama to apologize to the people of Oklahoma for funding climate change research. Texas representative Lamar Smith, chairman of the House committee on Science, Space and Technology, said earlier this month that NASA should be focused on space, not climate change, because “another dozen agencies” are already studying the latter.\n\nBut cutting NASA’s climate science research could prove to be an expensive, logistical nightmare, according to a contractor who works as an engineer for one NASA satellite that collects climate data. The engineer requested to remain anonymous to avoid jeopardizing their employment at the agency.\n\nNASA currently has 16 earth science satellites in orbit (and three other earth science instruments attached to the International Space Station) that, in addition to climate data, collect information on the atmosphere, oceans, and land-based phenomena like wildfires. The satellites make up the core of NASA’s climate science program, and the most immediate problem with eliminating climate research is what would be come of them.\n\n“If you stopped operations—if nobody manned the satellites—they would crash and spread space debris,” the engineer said. NASA currently tracks around 500,000 pieces of space debris traveling at extremely high speeds; satellite engineers must steer their spacecraft to avoid them. If a satellite crashes into a piece of debris, the satellite would splinter, possibly sending “40,000 or 50,0000 pieces of space debris into low earth orbit,” the engineer said. “Then you have to try to account for all those pieces of debris. That would be truly a crisis. They wouldn’t de-staff our teams just because of that danger.”\n\nTransferring satellite operations to a different agency would be costly. NASA’s earth science satellites are operated in large part by contractors, many with five-year agreements, who use specialized equipment at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Severing those agreements, and physically moving those machines to a different agency’s headquarters, would be a massive headache. “All the engineers and scientists are geographically living near the center where we work,” the engineer said. “All the resources—all that stuff is geographically tied down.”\n\nEven if the Trump administration wanted to remove those satellites from space entirely, the logistics and red tape surrounding the “deorbiting process”—delicately bringing a satellite back to Earth—can take “years and years,” said the engineer, who worries more about the administration leaving the satellites in place and simply ceasing data collection.\n\nBudgetary waste is a common refrain among those seeking to end climate science at NASA. Since other US agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also study climate change and earth science, critics argue, there is a degree of redundancy in NASA’s work.\n\nBut redundancy isn’t wasteful; it is a basic tenet of high-quality science. If more than one set of data point to the same trend or conclusion (especially if they were collected by entirely separate scientists at separate agencies), scientists can have more confidence that the conclusion is correct. For that very reason, climate scientists often use climate data gathered by NASA, NOAA, and the EPA. Eliminating any of these data sources would reduce the overall diversity of data and, by default, the scientific rigor of US research. It would also consolidate data collection into the hands of fewer political appointees.\n\nAlready, grassroots efforts are underway at universities around the country to download and store federal science data. “Data rescue” groups have managed to harvest NASA’s earth science data, as well as much of NOAA’s and the EPA’s data. NASA employees have taken notice. “We’re all pretty excited by it,” the engineer said. The data rescue initiatives have gained urgency in the wake of Scott Pruitt’s confirmation as EPA administrator, as NASA employees worry he could pull the EPA’s climate data from public view.\n\n“Censorship is my number one concern,” the NASA engineer said. “Once you consolidate the sources of data, it’s easier to censor.”",
  "latent_26113": "Now that some time has gone by since the passing of Satoru Iwata, it’s time to get back into Nintendo goings-on. The most fascinating Ninten-news I’ve seen lately was the sudden announcement by Square Enix that Dragon Quest X/XI would be released on the NX system, then the quick correction stating they would be “considered” for the NX. Next, Square Enix continued to show their interest in the NX with the announcement that a port of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn could make its way to the NX. I’m fascinated by this, not due to the speculation that is now circling regarding the system (What will it run? How powerful will it be? Will it rely heavily on the Quality of Life platform?), but rather, the type of game being spoken of, the company that made the statement, and how early this statement has come.\n\nIt’s another Dragon Quest/Final Fantasy game, so what’s the big deal?\n\nI’ve stated before that Nintendo missed a huge opportunity by not gathering more JRPG content for their Wii U; I’m happy Xenoblade Chronicles X will be making it’s way to my Nintendo console in December, but I just wish there were more. With the GamePad being such a great tool to use for maps, inventory, and potential for unique ways to play games, it would seem that JRPG gameplay would be enhanced by the little console. In addition, Nintendo would be catering to their favorite market; their home market of Japan. This seems like a win-win for the company, yet, many JRPGs (and RPGs, as a matter of fact) have passed the Wii U for the PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nThis is why Square Enix already “sniffing out” the NX is so huge; this could be a sign that JRPGs may be making a solid presence again on a Nintendo console. Now, JRPGs typically don’t make oodles of money, but they have slowly been making a comeback, in a sense (see titles like Bravely Default and Yokai Watch), and franchises like Final Fantasy will continue to draw large crowds. Nintendo could help to push this genre further into the spotlight again with the NX, if this [incredibly] early interest is a sign of things to come. So, the opportunity to cater to their home market and create more 3rd party support for their system? Nintendo should start working with Square Enix sooner than later!\n\nWhy is Square Enix so important?\n\nFinal Fantasy. Dragon Quest. Kingdom Hearts. These are just a few of the top selling franchises Square Enix has produced over the years. These would create more hardware sales for Nintendo, as well as lay a solid foundation for a game library. But, if that wasn’t enough, creating healthy relationships with developers like Square Enix could also open doors to other genres made within the company – titles like Tomb Raider and Hitman might also make their way to the console, creating even more of a library.\n\nI’m willing to bet that if Square Enix is showing potential support so early for a system we know almost nothing about, other companies have had their interest piqued as well. This, again, simply leads to more 3rd party games (more specifically, for this article, JRPGs), which the Wii U has been lacking for some time now. In short, Square Enix is a well known name that could open the door for other developers to step in.\n\nWhy does such an early [ambiguous] statement mean so much?\n\nTo have developers show any interest at all when there is nothing revealed about the system, other than the fact that it is in development, is a good sign that companies are still interested in Nintendo products. With the Wii U garnering so much controversy and what seems to be disdain from so many developers, this is a little refreshing to see. Sure, Nintendo 1st party titles are simply outstanding, but the gaming masses want more, whether we realize it or not. Where does the massive amount of content stem from? Other developers. Whether you like them or not, the Assassin’s Creed, Call of Duty, and various sports games out in the gaming world sell very well. These can result in hardware sales for Nintendo, if proper marketing and 1st party titles can sell (which, honestly, Nintendo titles will). This all to say one thing: this shows interest from developers, which leads to support, and ultimately could prove to be a lucrative partnership.\n\nCould you imagine Kingdom Hearts on a Nintendo console? It would fit perfectly!\n\nNow, all of these thoughts are speculation, since we haven’t heard much about the NX from other developers, and we have no clue what the NX truly is. But, I found this news to be quite intriguing; this could be a very nice start already for Nintendo’s next console (or, whatever it is). I’ll be keeping my eye on other developers over the next six months though, as I have a feeling we will start hearing more interest in the NX from others.\n\nWhat do you think about Square Enix’s sudden statements about possible NX support? Would you like to see more JRPGs on a Nintendo system; do you think both the genre and the company would benefit if that happened?",

  "latent_26193": "Michael Bachelor Gender Male Age Adult Life state Sim Biography Michael is just out of college and he doesn't know what to do with his life. Can you help Michael succeed? Family Family/Families Bachelor family Marital status Single Personality Zodiac sign Libra Appearance Hair color Black Skin color Medium Body shape Fit Other information Game The Sims Playability Family Bin Neighborhood Neighborhood 1\n\nNot to be confused with Michael Bachelor (hidden).\n\nMichael Bachelor is a playable character in The Sims and The Sims 3. His family is one of the three famous starter families in The Sims. In The Sims 2, he is the late husband of Dina Caliente and the older brother of the missing Bella Goth. As his last name suggests, he is a bachelor for most of the game.\n\nContents show]\n\nBiography Edit\n\nLife leading up to The Sims 3 Edit\n\nIn The Sims 3, Michael is a teen Sim living with his parents, Jocasta and Simis Bachelor, and his younger sister, Bella. He is dressed in a \"jock\" style and he has the Schmoozer and Athletic traits. His other two traits are Loves the Outdoors and Friendly. Michael's wishes are mostly about athleticism and improving relationships. His skin is lighter than it was in older Sim games. His eyes are also brown, while in The Sims 2, they are light blue. He can be seen at school and the local gym. His bio states he has lots of friends at school, but it can be assumed that they don't live in Sunset Valley as at the start of the game, his only friend outside of his family is Mortimer Goth. He has a love for the outdoors, so he doesn't mind helping Jocasta in the garden. He has 1 point in the Athletic skill. When the family is first played, Michael is 13 days from being a young adult.\n\nLife leading up to The Sims Edit\n\nIn The Sims, Michael is similar to the character of \"The Graduate\" as he recently graduated from college and doesn't know what to do with his life. He starts in Neighborhood 1's Family bin. He wears blue jeans, blue and white sneakers and a blue-grey Sim State University shirt. His last name was meant to match his state, which is unmarried and living alone. It should be noted that in this very first game, his relations to Bella Goth are not mentioned and he was treated as a separate character from her family.\n\nIt is possible that Michael Bachelor in The Sims was not originally supposed to be related to Bella in the first place, but to be a separate character. The revelation of Bella's original surname, and her relationship to Michael Bachelor, was later coined by Maxis for The Sims 2 to explain what had happened to some of Pleasantview's notable built-in characters, as the game was a sequel to the original The Sims game[citation needed]. However, Michael and Bella use the \"Asian\" head skins and both have tan skin, so it's possible they were always meant to be related.\n\nAlso, his appearance and biography in The Sims suggest a young man in his early twenties, yet the 25 years between the The Sims 3 and The Sims would make him in his late 30s at least. While it's possible for him to have gone to college and graduated later in life, it doesn't really fit with his original portrayal as someone just starting out in life. Even ignoring The Sims 3, there are still plotholes caused by Michael's age: in the original game, Michael should be in his early or mid-20s. Yet by the sequel, set 25 years later, he had died of old age. Based on his age in the original game, this means he died of \"old age\" at around 50. Even including The Sims 3, he would have died of old age at around 65. Usage of the Elixir of Life either to prolong or shorten his life could explain this. According to SimEnhancer, Michael Bachelor was the third Sim created in Neighborhood 1.\n\nIn The Sims 3, he is Bella's older brother. However, in The Sims, when he has just graduated college, Bella is already married with a daughter (and appears to be slightly older than him). This might suggest that he went to community college first and took a while to graduate, whereas Bella did not go to college, married Mortimer, and had Cassandra by the time Michael graduated. There also is the idea that he might have used the Elixir of Life to stay young (while Bella grew older) and was prematurely aged later on, but it is most likely a simple continuity error.\n\nLife leading up to The Sims (Console) Edit\n\nIn The Sims (console), Michael has black Mohawk hair, black glasses, blue shirt, brown pants and brown sandals. He is in the Family bin alone and without a home. The player must build him one in order to be played. His sister, Bella Goth, lives with her husband Mortimer Goth and daughter Cassandra Goth in 5 Sim Avenue. Yet again, his relation to Bella Goth is not stated and he remains a separate character from her line of the family.\n\nLife leading up to The Sims 2 Edit\n\nIn The Sims 2, Michael is already a deceased elder and is revealed to be Bella Goth's older brother. Before his death, he married Dina Caliente, sister of Nina Caliente. His urn sits on a coffee table in the Caliente sisters' condo.\n\nWhen resurrected, Michael recognizes Dina as family, and can perform exclusive interactions such as \"family kiss\" in addition to romantic interactions. Bella will appear in his relationship panel, but he will be unable to call her. Michael's facial structure is identical to that of the 2nd face template in Create a Sim, except the slightly customized upper lip. But the difference is so small that it normally can only be proven through BodyShop. Oddly, when trying to view his DNA page in SimPE, it will appear blank. This oddity also happens with Michael's sister Bella, and Darleen Dreamer. If you use the Prints Charming Fingerprint scanner[citation needed] in a barely-played Pleasantview, you will find his fingerprints all over the entire neighborhood. The prints of other dead or missing Sims can also be found, but Michael's are by far the most prevalent, being easily found in every playable house and some of the empty ones. Even though Michael is thin, his fitness level indicates that he is supposed to be fit. His sister Bella also has this case.\n\nThe two Michael Bachelors Edit\n\nFor some reason, there are two Michael Bachelors. One wears a purple and white track suit and has medium skin with 14 days left in the Elder stage. The other has tan skin, wears a black shirt, and has 101 days left as an Elder. The Michael Bachelor with tan skin has relations with Dina Caliente, Bella Goth, Simis Bachelor, Jocasta Bachelor, Alexander Goth, and Cassandra Goth, while the medium-skinned Michael Bachelor's relations were partially removed. The Michael with tan skin has the Knowledge aspiration, while the other has the Popularity aspiration. The Michael with tan skin also has the Leo zodiac sign,and no personality points, while the other has the Aries zodiac sign and the personality points 5, 8, 6, 3, 3. In SimPE, both Michael Bachelors are ticked as ghosts.\n\nThe medium-skinned Michael Bachelor is the one seen in the Caliente family album, and his relationship with Nina was very high (around 95 lifetime relationship). Since Nina is seen crying at Michael and Dina's wedding, it is possible that she had a crush on him, or perhaps they were close friends and she was crying tears of joy. For memories, medium-skinned Michael Bachelor has four memories: [invisible] Reputation Aspiration, [invisible] Token- Sim- Initialized, and two [invisible] Token - I Am Dead(s). The tan Michael Bachelor has three memories: [Invisible] Token-Sim-Initialized, and two [invisible] Token -I Am Dead(s).\n\nSimology Edit\n\nGallery Edit\n\nMichael throughout The Sims games.

  "latent_26290": "Welcome to possibly the only English website in existence that is wholly dedicated to the infamous \"Robotech the movie (aka the Untold Story)\". No, this is not a website about the \" Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles \" movie, nor the forthcoming live action movie currently being produced by Sony Pictures and directed by James Wan. This website is about the 1986 film \"Robotech the movie\", a co-production by Harmony Gold and defunct B-movie producer Cannon Films. You may have never heard of this film, which is quite understandable. The film was only shown for a month in Dallas, Texas from 25 July 1986 as part of a test screening. Although it never received a home video release in the United States, it did receive English language video releases in the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands in the late 1980's and into the very early 1990's, as well as an English TV broadcast on South African TV in the late 1980's. Despite the resurgence in interest in all things Robotech since the early '00's, strangely the full length film hasn't never been released on commercial DVD or BD (a 29 minute edit comprising only of the \"Southern Cross\" segments was released in 2011), nor has it been bootlegged widely, despite increasingly rare original UK VHS copies of the movie fetching prices upwards of US$60. The film, mostly based on the 1985 Japanese Original Video Animation \"Megazone 23\", was made to cash in on the success of the \"Robotech\" TV series and profits of the film were planned to be used as capital to fund the follow up Robotech TV series, \"Robotech II: The Sentinels\". Although the film remained in Dallas cinemas for around a month as part of a test screening and did \"exceptionally well\" at the box office (according to the film's director Carl Macek), plans to release the film across the US on 1,400 screens the following month were shelved when the distributor, Cannon Films, discovered teenagers and young adults made up the vast majority of the audience. Cannon had already planned a nationwide advertising campaign aimed at children and decided to either retool the film or change the marketing. Cannon Film's financial difficulties scuttled plans to relaunch the film. The behind the scenes chaos of the production of \"Robotech the movie\" caused it's director, Carl Macek, to practically disown the film altogether. He felt the film was a disaster area, mostly due to interference and changes forced upon the film by producers at Cannon Films. This included cutting around a third of the \"Megazone 23\" footage as well as including footage from \"Southern Cross\", the series which made up the second arc of the \"Robotech\" TV series. One of the most interesting things about the film is that Harmony Gold (the producers of \"Robotech\"), commissioned the Japanese production company who made \"Megazone 23\" (Idol Co Ltd), to create a brand new ending for the film. This ending is completely different to the original ending of \"Megazone 23\", and was included on video releases of an obscure English dub of \"Megazone 23 Part II\" that was only released in Japan with Japanese subtitles in 1987. According to a 2008 interview with \"Megazone 23\" director Ishigoro Noboru, the animation for this new ending was produced by the anime studio AIC (of \"Tenchi Muyo!\" fame). I created this website because I was really surprised at the lack of information, as well as the great amount of misinformation that was on the web about this film. A lot of sites actually claim that it was never released on home video in English, and this is simply untrue . I've tried as hard as possible to make this website as complete and accurate as possible, but if you find something that's not correct or wish to add some more info, please feel free to email me.

  "latent_26386": "OTTAWA — Leading security and intelligence experts generally applaud the novel Liberal legislation to stand up a committee of parliamentarians to examine and publicly report on the efficacy and legality of Canada’s surging national security activities.\n\n“Overall, (it’s) a very good bill, promising the creation of parliamentary capacity that is long overdue,” says Wesley Wark, a University of Ottawa professor specializing in intelligence, national security and terrorism issues.\n\nCraig Forcese, associate professor of law at the same school and a foremost expert on national security law, calls it, “a good bill, although with inevitable flaws likely reflecting compromises designed to reconcile elements within the government.”\n\nUnveiled last week, Bill C-22 proposes the creation of a “national security and intelligence committee of parliamentarians,” with a mandate to review the operations of at least 17 government departments and agencies with security and intelligence functions.\n\nThe move honours a Liberal election promise to boost scrutiny of national security operations to offset the increased counterterrorism powers granted to security services and police under the Anti-terrorism Act of 2015, formerly Bill C-51.\n\nReview of the national security apparatus (and the handling of public complaints) is now siloed within three, small watchdog agencies staffed by subject-matter experts, including the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC), which conducts after-the-fact reviews of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the country’s human spy service. The three expert organizations will continue their work, at least for now.\n\nEach, however, has limited statutory authority to exchange information with the others and cannot pursue investigations that stray into a counterpart’s jurisdiction. SIRC, for example, cannot follow CSIS’s trail when it crosses into the jurisdiction of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), the foreign signals intelligence service.\n\nThe new all-party committee of seven MPs and two Senators, to be chosen by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and supported by a small secretariat, would be sworn to permanent secrecy and tasked with reviewing any and all national security activities to gauge whether they are effective, efficient and legal. Its primary investigative tool would be a statutory power to access many of the nation’s most guarded secrets.\n\nEven so, the legislation gives government a handful of disclosure escape clauses. Most notable is the appropriate minister’s power to veto committee requests for information deemed “injurious to national security.”\n\nSuch broad veto power, “places the committee on a much more constrained footing in terms of reviewing activities than the expert review bodies like SIRC,” Forcese observes.\n\nAnother clause allows a minister to refuse to share a broad range of information deemed to be “special operational information” under the Security of Information Act. Also restricted will be any information from which the prohibited information may be inferred, something Forcese characterizes as a “potential Mack truck” in the committee’s path. “Based on past practice in the government secrecy world, the universe of information that the government tends to believe may give rise to inferences is vast.”\n\nHe says C-22’s limitations on the committee’s ability to review certain activities is credible only if countervailed by a reformed expert review system that does get to see everything and can follow the threads from organization to organization.\n\nWark, however, doesn’t see any way around the restrictions. He points to compensatory requirements, including requiring ministers to inform the committee of any refusals, the committee’s ability to inform the expert review bodies of those rejections and its ability to report the refusal in its annual report to the prime minister, a redacted version of which is to be tabled in Parliament.\n\nIt is important not to lose sight of the bigger picture\n\nIn announcing the legislation, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale called C-22 the “cornerstone” of a major government review and reform of the country’s national security architecture, prompted by last June’s passage of the Conservative’s Bill C-51, portions of which the Liberals have promised to change.\n\nSays Forcese: “While C-22 is a good start, the best review in the world cannot compensate for bad substantive law (C-51). So it is important not to lose sight of the bigger picture.”\n\nConcludes Wark: “The real test will be finding the right members, doing good work, earning the trust of the security and intelligence community, and finding ways to really inform the Canadian public about sensitive intelligence and security issues.”\n\n• Email: imacleod@postmedia.com | Twitter: macleod_ian",
  "latent_26461": "Alexopoulos jumps ship before vote that could allow criminal charges to be brought against far-right Greek party's MPs\n\nGreece's far-right Golden Dawn party has been thrown into crisis after one of its MPs broke ranks before a crucial vote by the Athens parliament that is likely to pave the way for criminal charges to be brought against the group's 18 MPs.\n\nAs the legislature prepared to cancel politicians' immunity from prosecution in the coming days – following charges that the MPs ran the neofascist force as a criminal organisation – Chrysovalantis Alexopoulos abandoned the party, citing ignorance of its activities. The extremists, whose emblem bears a resemblance to the swastika and whose leadership is prone to giving Nazi salutes, are seen as Europe's most violent political force.\n\n\"I'm sorry that I did not act earlier, and that I did not differentiate my stance,\" the 43-year-old wrote in a letter to parliament, explaining his decision to sit in the 300-seat house as an independent. \"I reached this decision following a series of revelations regarding the activities of [Golden Dawn], which have been defined as criminal, and of which naturally I had no knowledge. My conscience no longer permits me to associate my patriotic and nationalist views with such actions and practices.\"\n\nHis desertion threw the once water-tight Golden Dawn into disarray, with insiders speaking of a \"civil war atmosphere\" in its ranks. Recent polls show support for the party – until last week austerity-whipped Greece's third biggest force – dropping precipitously.\n\n\"This is how far-right parties have disintegrated in Greece in the past,\" the writer Dimitris Psarras, who has followed Golden Dawn since its inception as a fringe group more than 30 years ago, told the Guardian. \"Alexopoulos's decision to break ranks is the first big rupture.\"\n\nJudicial sources said the MP's implicit recognition of the group's illegal activities would add credibility to the array of charges the party faces. Since the extremists were catapulted into parliament with 7% of the vote on the back of widespread fury with the political establishment almost two years ago, immigrants, leftists and gay people have been attacked, often brutally, by black-clad Golden Dawn supporters.\n\nAn in-depth investigation of the group by magistrates was triggered by the fatal stabbing of a popular leftwing musician at the hands of a party operative last September.\n\nSix of the organisation's 18 deputies – including its enigmatic founder, the mathematician Nikos Michaloliakos – have already been accused of using Golden Dawn to operate a criminal gang and are in prison pending trial. Three others face similar charges but have been released from custody on bail.\n\nOn the basis of a 200-page report compiled by prosecutors, three more Golden Dawn MPs had their immunity from prosecution lifted last week. Among them was Michaloliakos's wife, Eleni Zaroulia, who triggered global condemnation when she described immigrants as \"subhuman\" in an address to parliament in 2012.\n\nAlexopoulos' desertion sparked instant derision with the ultra-rightists denouncing the politician as a \"traitor\" and a \"coward\", and accusing him of betraying the cause. The party's spokesman, Ilias Kasidiaris, a candidate for mayor in forthcoming local elections, appeared to acknowledge that the organisation was in trouble.\n\n\"If any other party had suffered what they have done to Golden Dawn,\" he said, preparing supporters for the possibility of further desertions, \"not only MPs would have left, but cadres and members too, taking with them their offices, doors and windows included.\"\n\nGiving voice to that sentiment the mass-selling daily newspaper Ta Nea dedicated its front-page editorial to what it hoped would soon be the group's demise, describing Alexopoulos' desertion as a \"positive development\".",

  "latent_26632": "Last week the Indianapolis Colts officially signed 18 undrafted free agents, who will participate in their rookie mini-camp this upcoming weekend.\n\nLet’s take a look at each of the players the Colts signed and what their chances are for making the 53-man roster.\n\nDeyshawn Bond, G, Cincinnati\n\nA 6-1, 302 pound lineman who is from Indianapolis and played at Warren Central High School, Bond was a four-year starter along the offensive line for Cincinnati. He wound up playing in 48 career games and starting 47 of them, and though he spent a lot of time at center the Colts list him as a guard.\n\nThe Colts will always be looking for offensive line competition and Chris Ballard will continue to prioritize the trenches, so it’s not a surprise to see the Colts sign a few UDFAs up front. Bond is an interesting player who could be poised to compete for a spot on the 53-man roster, though there are only so many spots for linemen. Anthony Castonzo, Jack Mewhort, Ryan Kelly, Joe Haeg, Le’Raven Clark, Brian Schwenke, and Zach Banner will likely all make the roster, and Denzelle Good and Austin Blythe are others who may have an edge. So Bond will face some competition in trying to win a spot, but he should at least have a chance to compete.\n\nDalton Crossan, RB, New Hampshire\n\nA 5-11, 202 pound back, Dalton Crossan had an impressive collegiate career in which he played in 44 games and rushed for 2,617 yards and 27 touchdowns while averaging 5.8 yards per carry. He also caught 105 passes for 779 yards and eight scores. He totaled 1,226 total yards and 16 total touchdowns in 2015 and then recorded 1,547 total yards and 14 total touchdowns in 2016. A former lacrosse player, Crossan choose football in college and impressed as a rusher, receiver, and kick returner.\n\nCrossan was one of the players that Chris Ballard mentioned recently as an UDFA to keep an eye on, so he might have a decent shot at making the roster. The Colts have Frank Gore, Robert Turbin, and Marlon Mack at running back, but if they do keep four backs then the fourth spot seems wide open right now. They have a couple of young backs who will be competing this offseason, but Crossan could be right there in the middle of that competition.\n\nDarrell Daniels, TE, Washington\n\nIn 49 games at Washington, the 6-3, 247 pound Darrell Daniels started 18 of them and caught 47 passes for 728 yards and five touchdowns, averaging 15.5 yards per catch. He moved from wide receiver to tight end in 2013 and is much more of a receiving tight end in that regard, and in 2016 he caught 17 passes for 307 yards and three scores, averaging 18.1 yards per catch.\n\nAnother one of the players that Ballard recently mentioned to keep an eye on, Daniels comes into a tight end room with the Colts that is looking for a number three behind Jack Doyle and Erik Swoope. Brandon Williams was signed in free agency and then Mo Alie-Cox was signed as a project player, but that number three tight end spot seems pretty open. So Daniels could stand a decent shot at the position, competing with Williams, Alie-Cox, and fellow UDFA Colin Jeter.\n\nTrey Griffey, WR, Arizona\n\nYou may recognize the name “Griffey,” as Trey is the son of baseball Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. (who ranks sixth all-time with 630 career home runs and who was a 13-time all-star and 10-time Gold Glove winner) and the grandson of Ken Griffey (who was a key piece to the Big Red Machine in the 1970s and was a three-time all-star). Trey was actually drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the 24th round of the 2016 draft, but that was as a tribute to his father (who wore number 24 with the Mariners), since Trey hasn’t played baseball since before high school. He’s focused on football, and in44 games at Arizona the 6-2, 209 pound receiver caught 79 passes for 1,241 yards and six touchdowns, averaging 15.7 yards per catch. In 2016, he caught 23 passes for 382 yards and two scores.\n\nThe Colts didn’t draft any receivers this year but did sign a few as undrafted free agents, though unlike some other positions there doesn’t seem to be as much room for competition at wideout. T.Y. Hilton, Donte Moncrief, Kamar Aiken, and Phillip Dorsett will probably all make the roster, and I think Chester Rogers probably will have a pretty good shot too. So that’s already five receivers, and we haven’t even mentioned Quan Bray (who would only make it if the Colts decide he’s their return man). There’s not a lot of open roster spots at this position, then, but the Colts could be looking for guys who stick out to keep working with them on the practice squad.\n\nThomas Hennessy, LS, Duke\n\nThomas Hennessy (6-2, 246 pounds) was Duke’s long snapper for the past four seasons, playing in 52 games and seeing action on 545 snaps. He helped Duke’s special teams unit convert 61-of-80 field goal attempts (76.3%) and 187-of-188 PAT attempts (99.5%) during his career as the long snapper, and he also helped Duke lead the ACC with the fewest punt return yards allowed in both 2014 and 2015. In addition, Hennessy helped the cause by recording four tackles.\n\nIt’s rare to find an undrafted free agent that seems to be almost guaranteed a roster spot when it’s just May, but Thomas Hennessy might come close. The Colts cut Matt Overton last week and will need to replace him, and currently Hennessy is the only long snapper on the roster. So he’s not yet guaranteed the spot, but he seems to be the clear frontrunner to be the Colts’ long snapper in 2017.\n\nBug Howard, WR, North Carolina\n\nThe 6-4, 221 pound Howard played in 53 games during his time at North Carolina, catching 146 passes for 2,048 yards and 18 touchdowns (averaging 14 yards per catch). His 18 touchdown receptions rank as the sixth-most in school history. In 2016, he caught 53 passes for 827 yards and eight scores, averaging 15.6 yards per catch.\n\nAs mentioned earlier when discussing Trey Griffey, there’s not a ton of roster spots that will likely be open for the Colts at the wide receiver position. So Howard faces an uphill battle in that regard, but teams are always looking for young receivers to keep working with - so, if Howard impresses, the Colts will likely notice.\n\nColin Jeter, TE, LSU\n\nColin Jeter (6-6, 251 pounds) originally began his collegiate career at Kilgore College (Texas) before transferring to LSU in 2014. During his three seasons at LSU, he played in 35 games and started 17 of them, catching 23 passes for 289 yards and two touchdowns. He was a three-time SEC Academic Honor Roll selection.\n\nUnlike Darrell Daniels, Colin Jeter is more of a blocking tight end. That could be intriguing for the Colts, who have an all-around tight end in Jack Doyle and a receiving tight end in Erik Swoope. They could opt to go with a blocking tight end as the number three guy to balance that out, but they’ll mainly be looking for players who produce. Either way, the number three tight end spot does seem to be open for Jeter to compete.\n\nJerome Lane, WR, Akron\n\nOne of two Akron wide receivers signed by the Colts as undrafted free agents this offseason, Lane (6-3, 226 pounds) played in 37 games during his collegiate career, catching 101 passes for 1,800 yards and 14 touchdowns (averaging 17.8 yards per catch). He had a very good 2016 season in which he caught 62 passes for 1,018 yards and six scores. He began his time at Akron as a linebacker and played defense in 2014, recording 14 tackles, five sacks, and five tackles for loss.\n\nOnce again, it might be hard for these undrafted free agent receivers to make the roster initially because of the other guys ahead of them on the depth chart with the Colts. But, with that said, I think Lane could have an especially intriguing case if he impresses as a receiver in camp, because of his defensive background. That could be valuable and could help him contribute on special teams, which could give him an early advantage over some of the other UDFA wideouts.\n\nChris Lyles, CB, Mississippi College\n\nLyles began his collegiate career at Hinds Community College (Mississippi) before transferring to Mississippi College, where he played in 17 games and recorded 25 tackles, 0.5 tackles for loss, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery, an interception, and two passes defensed. In 2016, he produced the bulk of that as he recorded 25 tackles, 0.5 tackles for loss, a forced fumble and fumble recovery, a pick, and two passes defensed. He also participated in track and field. It should be noted that Lyles is the only one of these undrafted free agents (officially announced as signings by the Colts last week) to not be on the Colts’ roster on their website. Most likely that’s just an error on the part of the website team, but it’s at least worth noting.\n\nThe Colts will likely be looking for young corners to work with and help develop, and so Lyles should have the opportunity to show what he can do. He’ll be making the jump from a smaller school to the NFL level, though, which could be a significant adjustment.\n\nChristopher Muller, G, Rutgers\n\nChristopher Muller (6-6, 315 pounds) played in 50 games during his collegiate career at Rutgers, starting 49 of them. He made 48 of those 49 starts at right guard and never missed a game during his collegiate career, starting 49 games in a row to end his career. He was named a team captain in 2016.\n\nLike Deyshawn Bond, Muller will be competing for a backup spot at guard - and if there’s a spot to be competing for up front, it’s at right guard, which is where Muller played at Rutgers. It’s presumed that Joe Haeg and Brian Schwenke will be the main contenders there for that spot with Denzelle Good also perhaps a contender, and it’s likely that Bond and Muller will be competing for depth. The Colts will always be looking for offensive linemen, but Muller will really have to show that he’s worth continuing to work with in order for him to stick around.\n\nJoJo Natson, WR, Akron\n\nThe Colts signed two receivers out of Akron, as JoJo Natson joins Jerome Lane. Natson (5-7, 159 pounds) is a small wideout who was dismissed from Utah State in 2015 for a violation of team rules, but upon transferring to Akron he had an impressive 2016 campaign, catching 59 passes for 837 yards and ten touchdowns (averaging 14.2 yards per catch). He produced during his collegiate career as a receiver, rusher, and punt returner, as he scored 27 total touchdowns (15 receiving, six rushing, and six returning).\n\nHis versatility as a three-way threat as a receiver, runner, and returner could make him interesting to the Colts, but he’s a small receiver and so his size could be a question. And, like the other receivers we’ve looked at, Natson faces an uphill battle because of the players ahead of him. His capabilities as a return man could make him a bit more interesting, however, especially depending on what the Colts decide to do at that spot with Quan Bray.\n\nReggie Porter, CB, Utah\n\nPorter (5-11, 185 pounds) played in 36 games at Utah and started 22 of them, recording 91 tackles, two tackles for loss, two interceptions, 18 passes defensed, and a fumble recovery. He had his best season in 2016 when he recorded 43 tackles, two tackles for loss, two picks, and six passes defensed.\n\nThe third player that Chris Ballard recently mentioned to keep an eye on, Porter will be competing for a depth spot at cornerback. The Colts need young guys with talent to work with, and so there could be a spot or two for young guys who impress in training camp. If Porter can do that he might be able to make it as a depth corner, but he’ll have to really produce and show up in camp and preseason.\n\nBrandon Radcliff, RB, Louisville\n\nRadcliff (5-9, 206 pounds) rushed for 2,365 yards and 26 touchdowns during his career at Louisville, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. He also added 20 receptions for 196 yards and a touchdown. In 2016 he rushed for 903 yards and six touchdowns while averaging 6.5 yards per carry.\n\nLike Dalton Crossan, Radcliff could be very much in the competition for the fourth running back spot - if in fact the Colts decide to keep four backs. It seems like the top three on the depth chart are pretty much set, with Frank Gore, Robert Turbin, and Marlon Mack, but after that it seems to be open. So if Radcliff impresses there could be a roster spot for him, but he doesn’t even seem like the most likely undrafted rookie to make that spot (that would be Crossan).\n\nRigoberto Sanchez, P, Hawaii\n\nRigoberto Sanchez played in 26 games at Hawaii as both the punter and the kicker, making 21 of 24 field goal attempts (87.5%) and averaging 44.8 yards per punt. He punted 144 times and didn’t have one blocked, recorded 45 punts of 50+ yards, had 49 punts pinned inside the 20 yard line, and recorded six touchbacks. He also served as the kickoff specialist and recorded 39 touchbacks on 93 attempts (41.9%). Last year, he was perfect on field goals (13 of 13) and averaged 44.6 yards per punt.\n\nThis is an interesting UDFA signing and one to perhaps keep an eye on. Sanchez is listed by the Colts as a punter, and that would mean that he’ll be competing with free agent addition Jeff Locke this offseason. Locke seems to be the favorite to win that spot, but I’m not sure it’s completely guaranteed. Most likely, Sanchez is simply the camp leg who will help relieve some of the workload for Adam Vinatieri and Jeff Locke. But with a change in punters this year, there is a chance for Sanchez to perhaps win the spot - but it would have to take a very impressive performance and proof that he can contribute at multiple spots, as the punter, kickoff specialist, and perhaps even the holder too.\n\nGarrett Sickels, OLB, Penn State\n\nSickels (6-4, 261 pounds) left school early and it didn’t pay off, as he went undrafted. He played in 14 games last year at Penn State and started 12 of them, recording 47 tackles, 12.5 tackles for loss, and six sacks as he was named Penn State’s Most Valuable Defensive Player at their annual football banquet. During his three years at the school, he recorded 20.5 tackles for loss and eleven sacks in 39 games (24 starts).\n\nThe Colts will be looking for any help they can get at outside linebacker, and interestingly Sickels was the only UDFA at the position that they signed. With how uncertain the linebacking corps are there should certainly be a spot for Sickels if he can show that he can produce or that he can get after the quarterback. Even if he can show some flashes of raw pass rush ability he could be a practice squad candidate. At this prime position and as the only UDFA signed at the spot, he’s a guy who could have a chance of sticking around as one of the 63 guys the Colts keep. There will be real competition, at the very least.\n\nJhaustin Thomas, DE, Iowa State\n\nThomas (6-5, 292 pounds) was a second-team All-Big 12 selection in 2016 as he recorded 23 tackles, 9.5 tackles for loss, three sacks, an interception, and a pass defensed. In his 20 games at Iowa State, he recorded 38 career tackles, 12 tackles for loss, four sacks, a pick, and a pass defensed. He originally started at Trinity Valley Community College (where he also played basketball) before transferring to Iowa State.\n\nThe Colts have a crowded defensive line group that will be competing for spots, so Thomas faces a tall task in trying to make the roster. With Henry Anderson, Kendall Langford, Johnathan Hankins, Hassan Ridgeway, T.Y. McGill, Grover Stewart, Al Woods, David Parry, and Margus Hunt all also competing for playing time and spots, Thomas is a long shot. But if he can flash pass rush ability, he could be a guy that is worth keeping around on the practice squad.\n\nJerry Ugokwe, OT, William & Mary\n\nUgokwe is a big player, standing 6-7 and weighing 321 pounds, and he has a lot of experience. He started 42 games at William & Mary, making the first seven starts at left tackle and then closing his career with 35 straight starts at right tackle. A Nigerian native, he didn’t play football until he was a junior in high school and walked on at William & Mary, eventually finding himself as a four-year starter.\n\nThis is a guy with some potential to keep growing, as he hasn’t been playing football that long but still has a lot of collegiate starting experience. The Colts don’t have as much depth at tackle as they do at guard either, and especially the right tackle position could use some more depth. Ugokwe is the only undrafted tackle that the Colts added, and while it will likely be Le’Raven Clark starting it’s possible that Ugokwe could push for either a spot on the 53-man roster or the practice squad so that the Colts could continue to work with him.\n\nPhillip Walker, QB, Temple\n\nWalker was a four-year starter at Temple, where he ranks as their career leader in attempts, completions, passing yards, passing touchdowns, and total offense, while he’s also the first Temple QB to ever lead the team to multiple bowl games. In his career he started 49 games and completed 55.8% of his passes for 10,668 yards (7.3 yards per attempt), 74 touchdowns, and 44 interceptions while also adding 763 yards and nine scores rushing (2.2 yards per carry).\n\nChris Ballard said earlier this offseason that the Colts would add a fourth quarterback to take into training camp, and that guy is Phillip Walker. He joins a QB room that obviously has Andrew Luck, plus backups Scott Tolzien and Stephen Morris. The starting spot is of course out of the question, and even the backup spot seems most likely to go to either Tolzien or Morris. But the possibility of the Colts keeping three quarterbacks shouldn’t be ruled out, especially with Luck’s injury, while teams often keep a practice squad QB too. So Walker could have a shot to stick around in some role, but he’ll have to have a good camp and preseason if he hopes to do so.",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nU.S. Border Patrol agents talk next to the U.S.-Mexico border fence on Dec. 9 near Nogales, Ariz. (Photo11: John Moore, Getty Images)\n\nWhy might the Department of Homeland Security shut down?\n\nThe Senate is locked in a stalemate over the Department of Homeland Security funding bill because of immigration amendments that the House attached to the bill last month. If the bill doesn't pass the Senate, the Department of Homeland Security will run out of money on Friday.\n\nWhat happens if Congress doesn't agree by the Friday deadline?\n\nAbout 30,000 DHS employees — mostly office workers — will be furloughed. More than 80% of the department's 240,000 employees will still go to work because their jobs are deemed essential to the nation's safety. Those workers, however, will not get paid.\n\nWhich employees are considered 'essential'?\n\nMany who work at Customs and Border Protection, the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Secret Service and the Coast Guard are considered essential for national security. They patrol the borders, check luggage for weapons at airports, respond to natural disasters or guard the president.\n\nWill those 'essential' employees get paid back?\n\nCongress would have to decide whether Homeland Security employees would get retroactive pay after any shutdown. Federal workers received back pay after the 2013 government shutdown, but federal contractors did not.\n\nWhat's the fight about?\n\nImmigration amendments Republicans added to the DHS funding bill would bar any federal funds from being used to carry out Obama's executive orders to protect about 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work in the USA. The amendments also would end a current Obama administration program — Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) — that gives temporary legal status and work permits to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\n\nWho's on which side?\n\nCongressional Republicans added the immigration amendments to the funding bill. Senate Democrats, independents and Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada united on three separate votes to block the House-passed bill from advancing in the Senate because they objected to the immigration provisions.\n\nAre other government departments at risk of shutting down if this bill doesn't pass?\n\nNo, this bill is specifically for funding the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nListen to Cup of Politics.

  "latent_26677": "This story appeared in the January 16, 2012 issue of Forbes Magazine. Photos by Chris Leschinsky/Getty Images for Forbes.\n\nBy Todd Woody\n\nDrive out of California’s smoggy San Joaquin Valley, past the oil rigs planted helter-skelter in citrus groves, climb into the Tehachapi Mountains, and the future suddenly comes into view. Hundreds of gleaming white wind turbines generating carbon-free electricity carpet chaparral-covered ridges and march down into the valleys of Joshua trees that lead to the Mojave Desert.\n\nHere in Kern County, a bastion of Big Oil and Big Agriculture, green energy has become big business. In the past 36 months the wind industry has attracted $3.2 billion in investment to a region with an unemployment rate 64% higher than the U.S. average. A multibillion-dollar transmission line under construction in the Tehachapi will carry as much as 4,500 megawatts of renewable energy, most of it from wind farms, to coastal cities. At peak output that’s the equivalent of four or five big nuclear power plants and a linchpin of California’s mandate to ­obtain a third of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020. With a crucial federal tax credit set to expire at the end of 2012, developers are racing to put steel into the ground and secure a spot on the wire.\n\n“The hotels are now full, the people who work in the restaurants now have someone to wait on,” says Lorelei Oviatt, Kern County’s planning director in Bakersfield, the honky-tonk hometown of Buck Owens and Merle Haggard. “If you were laying concrete for a house, now you’re laying concrete for a turbine.”\n\nA shadow, however, is falling on the Tehachapi, cast by the nine-and-a-half-foot wingspan of a Pleistocene-born bird of uncommon intelligence and longevity. With the investment of tens of millions of dollars and extraordinary effort by scientists, North America’s largest bird, the California condor, is staging a spectacular comeback after verging on extinction 25 years ago. The 200 birds in the wild today (out of 400 total) are rapidly reinhabiting their historic range in one of the nation’s great achievements of conservation biology. Naturalists can once again marvel at a bird that manipulates hot winds to soar hundreds of miles without flapping its wings.\n\nIt’s a flight path that is taking the condor perilously closer to the spinning blades of Tehachapi wind turbines that depend on those same thermal currents to generate power; biologists fear it’s only a matter of time before the condor begins hitting the 500-foot-high machines. A single death could be catastrophic for the wind industry, the regional economy and, not least, the condor. The loss of an alpha bird could disrupt breeding patterns and an intricate avian hierarchy, according to biologists. “It would be a major disaster,” says Mark Tholke, an executive with wind developer enXco, which is building several projects in the Tehachapi.\n\nUnder the federal and California ­endangered species acts, it’s illegal for anyone to kill a condor without first securing a permit to do so. Given that the government has not issued such an “incidental take” permit and has no intention of doing so, if a turbine kills a condor, the operator could be charged criminally. Environmentalists could also ask a judge to shut down a wind farm where a condor died. “If we as an industry don’t come up with a plan that is clear and reliable,” says Tholke, “the uncertainty is going to drive some investors away and drive up the cost of renewable energy.”\n\nAlready, state regulators have scuttled a huge Pacific Gas & Electric wind project in part because of the financial risks of a potential condor-caused cut to electricity production. Last June the Tehachapi’s biggest developer, Terra-Gen Power, abruptly pulled a planned 411-megawatt farm after Oviatt says she told executives that condor concerns and opposition from local residents would likely doom the project. Then in October the Sierra Club and two other environmental groups sued Kern County over its approval of a 300-megawatt NextEra Energy Resources wind farm that state and federal officials warn poses a high risk to condors.\n\nU.S. Fish & Wildlife Service biologists, meanwhile, have told county officials and developers that most of the multibillion-dollar projects on the drawing board as well as at least one existing wind farm threaten the condor, according to agency records FORBES obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request. “The service requests that the county of Kern exercise extreme caution in developing wind energy within the Tehachapi area because it falls within the range of the California condor,” Raymond Bransfield, a senior biologist, wrote Oviatt in November 2009. “Until we have a better understanding of the behavior and flight patterns of California condors within the Tehachapi area we strongly recommend that the county of Kern not permit any action that may result in take of California condors.”\n\nConflicts between renewable energy and wildlife are nothing new. But the condor presents a conundrum that will force some hard choices about the balance we’re willing to strike between obtaining clean energy and preserving the wild things. There are no black-and-white answers here, just shades of green. As the condor begins to go where no condor has gone in decades, developers, environmentalists and government biologists have formed a task force and are scrambling to meld conservation science with a Silicon Valley-style technological solution to wind and wildlife. “The stakes are high for both sides,” says Ashleigh Blackford, senior wildlife biologist for renewable energy at the Fish & Wildlife Service in Sacramento, Calif. “The question is, how quickly can we come up with answers given the pace of wind farm development?”\n\nAgainst a backdrop of juniper-and pinon-pine-studded golden hills on a bright November day, two condors soar effortlessly through a canyon, cruising over the San Andreas fault line that runs through the Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge two hours north of Los Angeles. We’re about 35 miles northwest of the Tehachapi, as the condor flies, and it was here, just on the other side of the canyon, that the last wild condor was captured on Apr. 13, 1987. By then the world population of wild condors had dwindled to 22 as human development, DDT and lead poisoning took their toll. The decision was made to take all the survivors into captivity and breed them in a last-ditch effort to save the species.\n\nBreeding programs proved a success, and in 1992 the first condors were reintroduced into the wild with the goal of eventually establishing self-sustaining populations in California, Arizona and Baja, Mexico. Four of the final 22 wild birds captured in 1987 still survive. “Locked into the cranium of those four birds is 10,000 years of evolution,” says Jesse Grantham, the California condor coordinator for the Fish & Wildlife Service, aiming his binoculars at the birds flying in the canyon.\n\nCondor 21 (half of the wild birds are GPS-tagged), one of the final four, was returned to Bitter Creek in 2002 and continues to sire offspring. No surprise there, biologists say, as condors may live 60 years or more. Weighing about 20 pounds, condors resemble supersize turkey vultures, with bald, reddish-pink-and-orange heads and a pattern of distinctive white feathers under their black wings. “Thousands of years of evolution has fine-tuned this bird to be totally dependent on air for survival,” adds Grantham, whose deep suntan testifies to the 30 years he has spent tracking condors. “Then you realize how important topography is to air, and then you begin to realize that for the condors air is their habitat.”\n\nThe ideal topography turns out to be like the network of ridges and valleys that make up the Tehachapi range, which connects California’s coastal mountains running south from Big Sur to the Sierra Nevadas on the east side. In the summer, as the valley floor several thousand feet below broils, hot air rises through the canyons and condors catch rides on the thermal currents.\n\nOn this day condor 368 is doing just that, surfing a thermal shooting through the canyon. At the end of the crevice the heat rises, and the condor catches the column of air as if it were stepping onto an escalator, circling ever higher. When the hot air hits a layer of cold air it dissipates, and the bird flies off on a thermal, heading toward its nesting grounds some 45 miles to the south.\n\nThose hot-air highways can take the condor some 200 miles in a day as the bird forages for food or takes a road trip on a whim to satisfy its curiosity. The condor has evolved to be attracted to novel objects and activity as it must constantly scour vast landscapes for its dinner, be it dead cows, deer or, for the coastal cousins, elephant seals and beached whales. Those who have observed the bird for decades say condors are a highly social, even playful species, with a defined pecking order in which they belong to specific clans. “A condor is a primate that’s been trapped in a bird’s body,” says Grantham.\n\nWhile the birds tend to forage alone, more than two dozen have been photographed sharing a meal of bloated bovine. The nightmare scenario for biologists would be if one of these clans of condors follows an alpha bird directly into a 45-story turbine after the alpha has spotted dinner below a wind farm. Condors don’t look up when they fly; not expecting to collide with anything at that height, they have evolved over the eons to soar looking down for carrion on the ground.\n\nBack when many of the current wind projects were being planned, the condor had yet to expand beyond the core reintroduction sites. But maps produced by the Fish & Wildlife Service plotting condor locations and flight paths between 2005 and 2010 show an explosion of avian exploration in recent years, with some birds flying over or near existing and proposed wind farms.\n\n“Wind turbines right now are on the edge of the condor’s expanding range,” Grantham notes. “But as the number of birds begins to increase and they begin to take advantage of some of the other food resources in the southern Sierra, there’s no question that’s where the birds will be. They’ll be crossing over those areas where most of the wind energy is going now.”\n\nI’ve gone to see some of those new wind farm sites with Tholke, the enXco executive, and Jim Walker, the company’s vice chairman and a longtime industry leader in efforts to reduce wind farms’ impact on birds. They are among the few wind company execs willing to talk publicly about the condor. “As far as I’m concerned this is an industry that doesn’t need to spend any time in denial,” says Walker, 67, a no-nonsense wind veteran standing amid Joshua trees as construction cranes hoist 260-foot turbine towers into place at the Manzana wind farm. “This is about two big successes—the successful reintroduction of the condor and the success of this technology. It’s our responsibility on the wind-industry side to let these two coexist.”\n\nThe 300-megawatt Manzana project speaks to the economic pressures driving development in the Tehachapi, one of the nation’s prime spots for wind power. EnXco originally developed the project and then sold it to Iberdrola, the Spanish energy giant, which in turn was to build the turbine farm for utility Pacific Gas & Electric. Although Kern County issued permits for Manzana, California utility regulators last March refused to approve PG&E ownership of the wind farm, finding the price of the power unreasonably high. High, too, regulators concluded, was the risk that the condors could force a curtailment of electricity production. In an unusual move, Iberdrola is pressing ahead and building Manzana without securing a long-term contract to sell the electricity it will generate, according to Tholke.\n\nThe need for that speed lies a few miles away, where steel towers of the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project are being erected. Snagging space on that power line is why enXco broke ground in December on its 140-megawatt Pacific Wind project ­adjacent to Manzana.\n\n“We feel pretty comfortable with the location of these projects in regard to the condor, as we’re on the downdraft where they wouldn’t be flying,” says Tholke, 41, gesturing at the desert, empty of condor chow, with the Tehachapi foothills miles in the distance. “Our development model is first avoid potential issues.”\n\nBut in a sign of how contentious wind projects have become the Fish & Wildlife Service disputed Kern County’s characterization of the Pacific Wind site’s potential to attract condors as “low.” (The county green-lighted the project nevertheless.) In October the agency objected to the county’s environmental review of enXco’s 350-megawatt Catalina project to be built nearby. “We do not agree with your conclusion that California condors are ‘absent’ from the project area,” wrote Diane K. Noda, a field supervisor, in a letter to the county. “California condors likely use the proj­ect area as foraging habitat and are likely to be affected by project activities.”\n\n“We cannot envision a situation where we would permit the lethal take of California condors,” she added.\n\nThe company most at risk from the condor is Terra-Gen, which plans to build 1,550 megawatts’ worth of Tehachapi wind farms financed by the likes of Citibank and Google. In a preliminary review Kern County found that the company’s proposed 230-megawatt Morgan Hills project would “pose a high risk of collision” to the condor. Federal officials in August told county planners that Terra-Gen’s 300-megawatt Alta East wind farm “poses a threat” to the condor. The wildlife service also labeled as “high” the potential for the condor to appear on the site of the company’s giant Alta Oak Creek wind complex, now being built. Terra-Gen declined requests for comment.\n\nLast May Kern County concluded that NextEra’s 300-megawatt North Sky River project posed a low risk to the condor, stating that no birds had been detected within 18 miles of the site. Then on July 18 two condors flew near the site and possibly directly over it, according to their GPS signals. Although the agency urged the county to withhold its approval, the project received the go-ahead on Sept. 13. A month later the Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife and the Center for Biological Diversity sued to overturn that decision. A NextEra spokesman declined to comment, citing the litigation.\n\n“I don’t really think it’s the intention of the citizens of California, who have been really supportive of renewable energy, that we take such a conservative view of new projects that we never do anything,” says Oviatt, the Kern County planning director, who noted the county itself has so far rejected some 650 megawatts of wind projects.\n\nBut Dan Taylor, executive director of the National Audubon Society’s California office, says more litigation may be inevitable unless a technological fix is found. “We’re on a collision course for some potential fatalities,” he says. “I think the day a condor is killed by a wind turbine in California changes the course of future development.”\n\nAvoiding that day could depend on technology like the U-Haul-size radar system parked recently at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, home to a major condor research and breeding center. Made by a company called DeTect, its spinning antennas are scanning foggy skies for turkey vultures, standing in for condors.\n\n“About nine months ago we started getting calls from developers because condors are expanding their range and moving down into wind farm areas, which makes everyone very worried,” says Gary Andrews of DeTect.\n\nAndrews has deployed an avian radar unit in the Tehachapi for wind developer Terra-Gen to see if the system can detect condors. If so, it could be connected to a system that automatically shuts down turbines when a bird approaches a wind farm.\n\nIn Mexico James Sheppard, a wildlife biologist with the zoo, is using his field research to develop an algorithm that will help predict the condor’s future expansion. That “will obviously have important implications for wind farm development,” he says.\n\nThe work is being funded by Sempra Generation, which is planning to build a large turbine farm in the Baja region. “We don’t want to make a large commitment to the wind project without understanding the larger environmental issues,” says Sempra exec Joe Rowley.\n\nMichael Mace, the zoo’s curator of birds, who has worked with the condor for three decades, has been meeting with visiting wind executives who have come to learn how the condor might behave around turbines. “We have these companies moving very quickly to develop these projects, but from a scientific perspective it’s going to take some time to research and answer those questions,” says Mace as we walk past the breeding center where several condors perch regally on their roosts. “No one wants to take an endangered species out of the air. The risk and liability here are tremendous.”",
  "latent_26764": "A few decades ago, Larry Bell would show up at parties with bottles of beer he brewed in his basement. Some people were leery of this self-described stoner’s early editions of bootleg booze. Bell doesn’t blame them.\n\n“There was a lot of bad beer in the beginning,” Bell tells Benzinga. “But it had so much more flavor (than regular beer) that people overlooked the flaws.”\n\nBell's Brewery\n\nToday, Bell is a bona fide beer baron. He is principal owner of Bell's Brewery, Inc., the 12th-largest brewer in the nation with revenues upwards of $100 million annually. Bell's brews -- Two-Hearted Ale is among the most popular and Oberon Day holds a special place in many hearts -- are available in at least 33 states and counting. He's currently staging a tactical invasion of Texas.\n\nSo-called “craft beers” such as Bell’s have eroded the big global producers’ hold on the market. Beer sales were down 1.2 percent through the first 50 days of 2017, according to market research firm IRI Worldwide. Bell’s volume sales, meanwhile, were up 26.7 percent during the same period.\n\n“Beer has lost to wine and spirits, along with the phenomenon of craft beer,” said Bart Watson, an economist for the Brewers Association, a craft beer trade group.\n\nSee Also: Beer Is Still The Undisputed Champ Of Alcoholic Beverages\n\nWhere It All Began\n\nBell’s journey began in late 1970s when he got a job at a bakery in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he learned about yeast and began brewing beer as a hobby. By 1980, he was using tubs to brew his own beer in his basement while his roommate grew marijuana upstairs.\n\n“We were a self-sufficient household,” he says.\n\nThe demand for Bell’s underground beer grew to the point where people he didn’t know were showing up at his place to buy. At one point, thinking federal authorities were pounding on his door, he fled through a window, only to find out his visitors were members of a bluegrass band in the market for a case of Kalamazoo Cream Stout.\n\nHe began with a $200 stake -- a birthday gift from his mother -- and incorporated for $35. He gradually took on investors, including the owner of a local spice company who supplied the hops. He eventually set up home-brewing supply company in a space at the bakery. Today, he has two breweries in Southwest Michigan and a small one in Escanaba.\n\n“The first years (were) really, really lean,” he says. “We didn't have money to buy bottles. I had a license to sell other beers. We would hand-wash the bottles. Hand-sanitized. Rinsed, filled, labeled, distributed,” he says.\n\nIn 1984, he met a roommate of one of his customers, fell in love and got married. The next decade brought two kids while Bell spent most of his days either brewing or selling, delivering barrels and bottles to stores and bars from Chicago to Detroit. Bell’s wife at the time, Sue Kovats-Bell, supported the family during the early years as a nurse.\n\n“He was very creative, very smart,” she says. “I'm attracted to creative, hippie-like guys. He had a dream. At that time it was pretty revolutionary. The guy was broke.”\n\nTaking It Next Level\n\nPeter Travis, former manager of a sandwich shop where Bell worked, said the budding brewer “had enough business acumen to take it to the next level...and a lot of people don’t. I see it in the restaurant business. People know how to make good food but they don’t know how to make money.”\n\nKovats-Bell said she promised to support Bell for five years after the two married in 1985. “It ended up being 10,” she says. He moved from the bakery into “a desolate warehouse. He’s like, \"This is where the beer kettles are going to be, this is where the fermeters are going to be.\"\n\n“I knew he could pull this off. We came close to bankruptcy. I was risking losing our little tiny home and our little car.”\n\nThe pressures eventually ended the marriage just as the brewery was beginning to turn the corner.\n\n“He was gone a lot. I didn’t feel the teamwork any more.” She said she could have had 50 percent of the stock, but settled for an amount she called “minimal.”\n\nThe brewery business hasn’t been easy on Bell’s marriages. “I’m on my fourth wife,” he said.\n\nSee Also: U.S. Adults Trade BUD For Bud: How Legal Weed Is Hurting The Beer Industry\n\nKeeping It In The Family\n\nBell intended to keep a majority stake in his brewery, but by the time the 1990s rolled around, he was controlling only 40 percent. Relations with investors grew increasingly contentious. Lawsuits ensued. He spent much of the decade buying out his investors until he once again had majority control.\n\nHe’s grooming his daughter to take over as CEO.\n\n“I was two months old when he founded the brewery,” says Laura Bell. “Parents divorced when I was 10 and the brewery was part of that. I think he was more invested in making the brewery successful.”\n\nShe never envisioned succeeding her father. “I had resentment toward him and what the brewery stands for. Would have I appreciated a more present dad? Yeah,” she said.\n\nShe said she gradually grew to appreciate the business after she took a job in production in 2008. “I learned about Bell from other people,” says Laura Bell. “I found the employees were passionate and engaged and awesome. I realized that Bell's was much more than my father. I thought: I cannot (mess) this up.”\n\nA Revolutionary\n\nBell, 58, realizes he’s changed as Bell’s has boomed. He was an affable jazz flautist who relied on a bicycle as basic transportation into his 20s. Now, among his 10 cars are half a dozen Jaguars of various vintage, along with a Bentley, a Rolls-Royce and a vintage Checker cab. He has season tickets to his beloved Chicago Cubs and once threw out the first ball. He sang “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” in the announcer’s booth. He has houses in Michigan and one in Chicago.\n\nThe Brewers Association’s Watson says Bell’s today is on solid ground, with a broad portfolio of beers and a loyal customer base.\n\n“They have taken a slow and steady approach that has enabled them to stay family owned,” said Watson. He said it would be difficult to do now what Bell did with the market in the 1980s and 1990s, where he ranks with craft brewers from the era such as Anchor Steam and Sierra Nevada.\n\n“They were among the pioneers,” Watson says.\n\nToday, the company has 525 employees. Bell doesn’t see the business ever going public.\n\n“I could sell and get a boatload money, but how much money do you need?” asks Bell, who survived a prostate cancer scare nine years ago. “I get to own a brewery. How much fun is that?”",

When she asked school officials for help, they shipped her off to a psychiatric ward. Then she found the camera.\n\nEze is suing Brooklyn College for false imprisonment, among other things, over a 2008 episode in which she approached school administrators for help in dealing with issues she was having with her roommates and landlord at her Brooklyn apartment. According to the complaint, Eze believed that she was being \"defamed on the internet\" by her former roommates and that \"her landlord at the time had installed a hidden camera in her bedroom.\" Sounds nuts!\n\nThat's what school psychologist Sally Robles thought. When Eze went to Brooklyn College's Office of Campus and Community Safety Services to ask for help, security officers called Robles, who proceeded to ask Eze about her mental health history and whether she ever heard voices. When Eze protested that she was simply an international student asking the school's security staff for help on dealing with a housing issue, Robles called an ambulance.\n\nEze was \"forced\" into the ambulance by school officials, and ended up being committed to Kings County Psychiatric Hospital for two weeks, where in addition to being made \"physically and emotionally ill and subject to great humiliation,\" she missed her final exams and was \"terminated\" by the school.\n\nTrouble is, according to Eze's verified complaint, there really was a camera hidden in her bedroom.\n\nWhoops! Now, Eze offers no proof in her complaint that the camera existed, nor did she ever file criminal charges against her landlord for it. Her attorney, Andrew Spinnell, says she doesn't have it any more: \"I've never seen it. She said it was hidden in a vent, and she moved out right away. But the issue isn't whether there was a camera—the issue is this timid, foreign student here in America all by herself went to Brooklyn College for help, and instead of helping her, they grill her and think she's a wacko.\" As for the internet defamation, Spinnell is vague: \"She heard about that through friends. She said it was hearsay.\"\n\nEze settled a medical malpractice case against the City of New York stemming from the episode in November for what Spinnell says was a \"six-figure\" amount. Which would tend to indicate that someone erred in locking her up for two weeks. You can read her complaint here.\n\nEze is refusing to answer questions, and Brooklyn College did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n[Photo of Brooklyn College via Wikipedia.

  "latent_26982": "It was intended to be a “floating paradise” for London but instead Joanna Lumley’s vision of a Thames garden bridge has collapsed amid acrimony, with the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, and his predecessor Boris Johnson arguing over how £37m of public money had been spent on a project without a brick being laid.\n\nThe actor had conceived it as a memorial to Princess Diana, but the trust behind the £200m project for a tree-lined bridge between Temple on the north side of the Thames and the South Bank said it had to abandon the scheme because it did not have support of the mayor whose financial support had become necessary for its survival.\n\nKhan responded by saying Londoners should be “very angry” about the amount of public money already spent on a scheme that had become increasingly controversial. He said: “I have been clear since before I became mayor that no more London taxpayers’ money should be spent on this project, and when I took office I gave the Garden Bridge Trust time to try to address the multiple serious issues with it.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An artist’s impression of their proposed Garden Bridge across the Thames. Photograph: Heatherwick Studio/PA\n\nHis Tory predecessor, a proponent of the bridge, hit back, saying it was so sad that Khan had “killed” what he said could have been a “beautiful project” and suggested it could one day still be built. “The only crumb of comfort is that good plans have now been developed and can be readily revived,” Johnson said.\n\nProponents of the bridge, which would have featured 270 trees and thousands of plants, argued that it would be a big tourist asset and a useful pedestrian link. Lumley’s vision – stemming from childhood memories of mountain gardens in Malaysia – had been taken forward by the designer Thomas Heatherwick in 2013 as part of a private development, but the project ran into increasing difficulties.\n\nCharity behind London's garden bridge hits back at MP's criticism Read more\n\nCritics said it was in a crowded section of the capital already well served by bridges, and questioned why public money should be spent on a link that would be privately run, would be able set its own rules for access, and would close at night and be available to hire for private events.\n\nMervyn Davies, the chair of the trust, wrote to the mayor outlining the reasons why the trust had taken the decision, and tried to pin the blame on Khan. Lord Davies said it was “with great regret that trustees have concluded that without mayoral support, the project cannot be delivered”.\n\n“We had made great progress obtaining planning permission, satisfying most of our planning conditions and we had raised £70m of private money towards the project,” he said, adding that the bridge would have been a “beautiful new green space”.\n\nHeatherwick won the design competition for the bridge a few months after designing the Olympic torch for the London Games, winning the backing of Johnson and George Osborne, the then chancellor, who committed £60m of public money to the scheme. The rest was intended to come from corporate donations, but the trust failed to raise the private money it needed. It secured only £69m in private pledges, leaving a gap of at least £70m, with no new pledges obtained since August 2016.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Davies warned in January that the project faced many challenges that needed to be resolved before construction could begin, including securing final planning consents for the south end of the bridge near Waterloo, securing a guarantee from London authorities for future maintenance costs and raising more private money.\n\nThe garden bridge is dead – now £37m of public money must be repaid Read more\n\nKhan, meanwhile, asked the former Commons public accounts committee chair Margaret Hodge to investigate whether the bridge still represented value for public money. Her report, published in April, recommended that the plan be scrapped. She pointed to multiple failings and argued that the business case for the bridge was “incredibly weak” and based on unconvincing evidence, and said it had been given special treatment under the support of Johnson as mayor.\n\n“What started life as a project costing an estimated £60m is likely to end up costing more than £200m,” Hodge wrote.\n\nThe £37m spent on the bridge included direct grants of about £26m from the Department for Transport (DfT) and about £11m in services in kind from Transport for London, of which £8.4m was spent with engineering company Arup.\n\nFour months later, Khan wrote to Davies announcing he would not provide the financial guarantees needed for construction to begin, effectively killing off the scheme. Lumley said in April that decision was “absolutely shattering, devastating”, adding that she was disappointed that the project had become politicised.\n\nKate Hoey, the MP for Vauxhall, and the councillors Jennie Mosley and Kevin Craig, who campaigned with the local community against the bridge, said the costs to the public purse were in the sphere of £50m. The higher figure, they said, came from the government underwriting the cancellation costs on the bridge, which is thought to be a further £15m on top of the £37m.\n\nThey said they would be seeking a full public inquiry and “accountability for the garden bridge trustees in respect of lost taxpayers’ money”.\n\nThe London Evening Standard, edited by Osborne, blamed Khan for the collapse of the project on Monday. The bridge, the newspaper said, “was a brilliant and imaginative plan to put the river centre-stage in London, designed by one of the most distinguished contemporary British architects, Thomas Heatherwick, and it will not now be realised, for what looks like nakedly political reasons” [see footnote].\n\nHeatherwick struck a more rueful note. In a statement he said: “London needs new bridges and unexpected new public places. The garden bridge has not found its right moment, but I hope one day it will and that London continues to be open to ideas that make life here better.”\n\n• This footnote was added on 15 August 2017. Thomas Heatherwick is not a qualified architect but he was the designer of the garden bridge project.",

  "latent_27474": "After ISIS Threat, China May Have to Get off Sidelines in Middle East\n\nOn Feb. 27, the Islamic State released a slickly produced propaganda video detailing for the first time “scenes from the life of immigrants from East Turkistan [i.e. Xinjiang] in the land of the Caliphate.” The video, in which a Uighur militant exclaims that the Islamic State will “shed blood like rivers” to avenge Beijing’s “oppression” of Muslims in the Western region of Xinjiang, provides not only a highly stylized view of Uighur militants’ training with heavy weaponry and snapshots of their daily life in the “caliphate,” but is also punctuated by two brutal executions of alleged “informants.”\n\nWhile the direct threat against China and the brutality of the executions has captured much attention, a close analysis of the video suggests something even more important: the possible splintering of Uighur militancy.\n\nThe video demonstrates the intensification of the Islamic State’s threat to China. In 2014, Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi argued that China was on a par with states such as Israel, India, and the United States as an “oppressor” of Muslims. This was followed by the group’s execution of a Chinese citizen, Fan Jinghui in Iraq in November 2015. The new video adds to this by providing the first visual evidence of Uighur militants fighting for the Islamic State and lends greater weight to Chinese claims that hundreds of Uighurs have been recruited by the group in recent years.\n\nRevealingly, a militant in the video denounces the “apostasy” of the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) — a well-established Uighur militant group that has had a significant presence in Syria since 2012 — and urges TIP members to defect to the Islamic State. This leads to a significant implication: it highlights a potential splintering of Uighur militants between the well established Al Qaeda-affiliate, TIP, and the Islamic State.\n\nTo date, TIP has posed the most immediate terrorist threat to China. This has been based on its close alignment with Al Qaeda, a product of the group’s genesis in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in the late 1990s. As Al Qaeda itself became active in Syria with the establishment of Jabhat al-Nusra as its affiliate in January 2012, TIP also began to release videos about the Syrian conflict and articles in its magazine, often comparing the struggle of the anti-Assad forces to that of the Uighurs in China. By 2015 TIP had a well-documented presence on the battlefield in Syria, with the group releasing a number of videos detailing its role in combat in Idlib, Jisr al-Shughur, and the Al Ghab plain. There have also been reports of the establishment of significant settlements of Uighur fighters and their families (numbered in their hundreds) since 2014 around Idlib and Latakia.\n\nThroughout TIP has remained a steadfast ally of Al Qaeda and its affiliates in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusrah and its leadership has openly criticized the Islamic State and rejected the legitimacy of its “caliph,” Baghdadi. Al Qaeda for its part has widely praised TIP. Ayman al-Zawahiri, for instance, released a video in July 2016 titled “Turkestan: Patience and Then Victory,” that hailed TIP for its struggle against the “atheist occupier” of “East Turkestan” (i.e. Xinjiang) and encouraged followers to wage jihad “in any corner of the world, wherever they may be.” The video provides confirmation that the Al Qaeda-Islamic State split has now begun to affect Uighur militant groups.\n\nSuch splintering could, however, have contradictory effects. One could be broadly positive for China; inter-group conflict presaged by the video could distract and weaken Uighur militants’ ability to carry out attacks against China or its interests. Conversely, competition between TIP and Islamic State-aligned Uighurs in fact may present China with a metastasizing threat to Xinjiang and its interests in Central Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe latter dynamic may already be taking place, discernible in the August 2016 attack against the Chinese embassy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, and the 2016 New Year’s Eve Istanbul nightclub attack. In the first of these attacks, the suicide bomber was revealed to have been an ethnic Uighur who Kyrgyz authorities subsequently claimed had been travelling on a Tajik passport and assisted by an ethnic Uzbek with links to the TIP in Syria. The 2016 New Year’s Eve attack was claimed by the Islamic State, and Turkish authorities subsequently identified the gunman as an ethnic Uighur with links to Syria.\n\nThese developments present a major challenge to Beijing. Within Xinjiang, China has responded to the growing threat with a show of force, including recent “anti-terror” rallies of thousands of security personnel in major cities such as Urumqi, Kashgar, and Khotan. Externally, however, the question of how the activities of TIP and now Islamic State-aligned Uighur militants will affect Beijing’s approach to Iraq and Syria remain unclear. Ultimately, Beijing may have to jettison its long-standing aloofness to the crisis in both countries if China wishes to combat Uighur militancy effectively.\n\nVCG/VCG via Getty Images",
  "latent_27493": "60 Minutes Tells Stories About FBI And NSA But Somehow Fails To Connect The Dots\n\nfrom the comey's-no-hero dept\n\n60 Minutes, which has been harshly criticized for running puff pieces for the NSA and FBI recently, is at it again. Last night, they ran two unrelated yet completely conflicting segments—one focusing on FBI Director Jim Comey, and the other on New York Times reporter James Risen—and the cognitive dissonance displayed in the back-to-back interviews was remarkable.\n\nFirst up was 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley's interview with FBI Director Jim Comey. 60 Minutes aired the first part of the interview last week, which ran 14 minutes and did not contain a single adversarial question. This time, Scott Pelley asked him at least asked a couple softballs about civil liberties, although the primary one Comey just refused to answer.\n\nThe main focus of the piece, however, was Comey's supposed commitment to \"the rule of law.\" \"That's a principle over which James Comey is willing to sacrifice his career,\" Pelley explains to the audience. He then proceeded to re-tell the infamous \"hospital bed\" scene from 2004 during the Bush administration, where Comey, then deputy attorney general, threatened to resign unless Bush altered the original NSA warrantless surveillance program. Bush relented a bit and so Comey stayed on as deputy attorney general for more than a year afterwards.\n\nComey is portrayed as the hero, who stopped illegal surveillance from going forward. What Comey did was certainly admirable, but this episode happened in March 2004 and only pertained to a small portion of the NSA's illegal activities. The NSA's illegal warrantless wiretapping program (as the public knew it) was first exposed more than eighteen months later in December 2005. 60 Minutes explains this in the very next segment but couldn't apparently put two and two together: Jim Comey was presumably also responsible for signing off on the illegal program the New York Times exposed after his hospital bed protest.\n\nDuring this segment, 60 Minutes interviewed James Risen about the Obama administration's war on leaks and described the scoop he is most famous for: his Pulitzer Prize-winning story exposing that same warrantless wiretapping program.\n\nRisen explains to 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl that the NSA was not only gathering metadata without a warrant on Americans in 2005, but the content of phone conversations as well. And as Stahl herself points out—and as former NSA chief Michael Hayden basically admits in the segment—this was in direct violation of the 1978 law the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which required court orders to conduct such spying.\n\nCritically, Risen's first story in December 2005 makes it clear the warrantless wiretapping of Americans was ongoing at the time. And we learned just last year as part of the Snowden revelations that Comey's hospital protest was over Internet metadata, not illegal eavesdropping on phone calls.\n\nSo to sum up: the government was breaking the law in December 2005. This is the program that Comey had presumably signed off on after the much-talked-about incident and he remained deputy attorney general. Yet Comey is still uncontroversially portrayed as a man dedicated to \"the rule of law.\"\n\nThis information was readily available to 60 Minutes, as it's in the most well-known recounting of the hospital bed scene done by reporter Barton Gellman for the Washington Post and in his book The Angler in 2007. As Barton Gellman reported in 2007, Comey forced some changes with his potential resignation in 2004, but \"much of the operation remained in place.\"\n\n\"Imagine you're doing ten things one day, and the next day you're only doing eight of them,\" an unnamed official told Gellman in The Angler. \"That's basically what happened here.\"\n\nCross posted from the Freedom of the Press Foundation.\n\nFiled Under: 60 minutes, fbi, fisa, james comey, james risen, nsa, surveillance\n\nCompanies: cbs",

One night later he was in the starting lineup against New York and helped Miami to a 98-81 win.\n\nJohnson knocked down a 3-pointer on his first shot as part of the Heat's 13-2 start and finished with 12 points on 5-of-10 shooting.\n\n\"You get a guy a caliber of, a player like him, you normally get that in the offseason,\" said Dwyane Wade, who had 26 points. \"So to be able to get it right now, as you're going into a playoff run, is very important for this team, especially with everything that we've been dealing with.\"\n\nJohnson's 86 3-pointers are five more than the total of top Miami 3-point shooter Chris Bosh, who is sidelined with a blood clot that formed in his leg.\n\nWith Bosh's status for the remainder of the season unclear, the Heat are in the precarious position of trying to hold off Atlanta, which is a half-game back. Johnson hasn't been part of a division-winning team since he was with Phoenix in 2005.\n\n\"This is kind of new, but I'm up for it, man,\" Johnson said. \"It's a challenge. I'm looking forward to it, and every game from here on out is going to be a playoff-type game for us. We've got to have that mentality.\"\n\nThe Bulls (30-28) are also in unfamiliar territory.\n\nSince closing within 2 1/2 games of conference-leading Cleveland on Jan. 7, Chicago has gone 8-16 to fall into an eighth-place tie with Charlotte and Detroit. The Bulls haven't been outside the top eight in the East since Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nThe Heat have won nine of 10 against East teams, a stretch that began with an 89-84 victory at Chicago on Jan. 25 in this season's only previous matchup. Wade had 28 points while the Bulls were held to 39.8 percent shooting.\n\nPau Gasol had 19 points and 17 rebounds, but Derrick Rose scored four points in 13 first-half minutes before leaving with lower back and right hamstring injuries.\n\nRose has missed the last three games due to his hamstring and is day to day. He joins Jimmy Butler (strained left knee), Nikola Mirotic (appendicitis) and Joakim Noah (shoulder) on Chicago's injury list.\n\n\"We know what we've got,\" forward Taj Gibson told the Bulls' official website after Saturday's 103-95 home loss to Portland. \"We just know that we have to play harder and can't mess up. We have a small window for mistakes now and that's the biggest thing.\"\n\nGasol stepped up again with his first triple-double of the season, recording 22 points, 16 rebounds and a career-high 14 assists.\n\nDoug McDermott scored 18 and is seeing an increased role in the offense, averaging 19.6 points while hitting 10 of 20 3-point attempts in the last five games.\n\nThe Bulls have dropped seven of eight road games, scoring 95 or fewer in each of the last three.\n\nThe Heat are 24-3 when holding opponents under 96.\n\nCopyright 2016 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27648": "Journalists helped cement Donald Trump’s candidacy, according to a new report\n\nInstead of bashing the press as dishonest, Donald Trump should get on bended knee and thank it, if you buy into a new Harvard study on election coverage.\n\nJournalists were “unmindful that they and not the electorate” were Donald Trump’s target during the so-called “invisible primary” leading up to the first votes being cast in New Hampshire and Iowa, according to the study.\n\nHarvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy unveiled on Monday the report, which seems a bit narrow in focus even if broad, and possibly accurate, in condemnation of coverage.\n\nIt maintains that the yearlong period leading up to the initial votes diverged from precedent when it comes to two “basic indicators of news coverage [that] would have predicted Trump’s heavy coverage.”\n\nFirst there is a candidate’s standing in polls. Second is one’s ability to raise money, which tends to be seen by journalists and the political establishment as a metric of inherent and potential strength. Neither of these indicators explains Trump’s coverage, according to the report:\n\nWhen his news coverage began to shoot up, he was not high in the trial-heat polls and had raised almost no money. Upon entering the race, he stood much taller in the news than he stood in the polls. By the end of the invisible primary, he was high enough in the polls to get the coverage expected of a frontrunner. But he was lifted to that height by an unprecedented amount of free media.\n\nIt then asks a decidedly rhetorical question: what was the fascination with Trump for the press? The answer: “Journalists are attracted to the new, the unusual, the sensational — the type of story material that will catch and hold an audience’s attention. Trump fit that need as no other candidate in recent memory. Trump is arguably the first bona fide media-created presidential nominee. Although he subsequently tapped a political nerve, journalists fueled his launch.”\n\nIn a conclusion sure to be disputed by some reporters, it contends that journalists “seemed unmindful that they and not the electorate were Trump’s first audience. Trump exploited their lust for riveting stories. He didn’t have any other option. He had no constituency base and no claim to presidential credentials.”\n\nThe notion of no-constituency base may also inspire some qualms among reporters. They may contend, albeit in a certain hindsight, that there was a base in a celebrity-craving nation, especially White working-class members, possessing distinct economic grievances and drawn to Trump’s anti-establishment stance.\n\nThe Harvard paper is arguably Old Media-skewing in its methodology. It assesses that pre-primaries period via stories by eight organizations: CBS, Fox, the Los Angeles Times, NBC, The New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.\n\nThere’s thus no dissection of cable news campaign coverage, which has expanded in dramatic fashion, or social media, all the more so given Trump’s bombastic, prolific and seemingly effective use of it. None of the new digital news dynamos are critiqued, either. But the lack of cable news analysis in the study seems especially unfortunate when Harvard makes the case for unmindful coverage. Many reporters, especially on the print side, might point a finger at cable news for giving Trump inordinate time and being often uncritical.\n\nBut it seeks to pre-empt some journalists’ response to criticism that they “fueled the Trump bandwagon.” First, it refutes the notion that reporters were in “watchdog” mode and that bad Trump news coverage outpaced the good. Second, it derides the claim that the cable news networks were a prime handmaiden of Trump via blanket coverage, while others were more restrained.\n\nIts data concludes that Trump coverage was “favorable in all of the news outlets we studied. There were differences from one outlet to the next but the range was relatively small, from a low of 63 percent positive or neutral in The New York Times to a high of 74 percent positive or neutral in USA Today. Across all the outlets, Trump’s coverage was roughly two-to-one favorable.”\n\nOn the Democratic side, it doesn’t buy into the notion of Bernie Sanders as an essentially forgotten (by the media) candidate until very late in the game. It finds that after a predictably modest amount of coverage, and characterization as a long-shot, coverage picked up and was “tonally” more positive than that of Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe study concludes with looks at what it deems the “metanarratives,” or general storylines about candidates, that surface in the pre-primaries period.\n\nWhether the metanarratives that emerged during the 2016 invisible primary will persist is a yet unanswered question but the outlines of these early narratives was unmistakable.\n\nTrump was a “shoot-from-the-lip bully, given to braggadocio and insulting and outrageous comments,” while supposedly touching the frustrations of middle-and lower-class white prospective voters. Meanwhile, Clinton “was the candidate best prepared for the presidency as a result of her experience and detailed knowledge of policy issues.”\n\nWhere she fell short was in how that characterization “competed with more frequently employed negative ones — that she was difficult to like, overly calculating, and hard to trust.”\n\nThe study of campaign coverage in 2016 is not the first and surely won’t be the last since the contest, especially Trump’s rise, will be a feast for analysts and academics for years to come.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nPrint",
  "latent_27651": "Willie James Gault (born September 5, 1960) is a former American football wide receiver and Olympic athlete. He played in the National Football League for 11 seasons for the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Raiders. Considered one of the fastest NFL players of all-time,[1] Gault was a member of the Bears team that won Super Bowl XX, and was also a member of the U.S. Olympic team that boycotted the 1980 Olympics.\n\nGault played college football at the University of Tennessee from 1979 to 1982. He led the Vols in all-purpose yardage as a sophomore, junior and senior,[2] and was named to the All-American team in 1982. He still holds numerous school kickoff return records.[3]\n\nGault is currently pursuing a career as an actor. He also remains active in masters athletics, setting world masters records in the 100-meter and 200-meter dashes for the 45–49, 50–54 and 55–59 age groups.\n\nHigh school [ edit ]\n\nGault was born and raised in Griffin, Georgia. He was named for his mother, Willie Mae. Both of his parents worked in a textile mill. He later recalled that his classmates considered him a \"teacher's pet.\"[4]\n\nGault played football and ran track for Griffin High School. He had two receptions for 19 yards in Griffin's 7-7 tie against Valdosta in the AAAA State Championship Game during his junior year.[5] He had a 48-yard touchdown catch for the North team in the 1979 GACA North/South Game (a preseason all-star game).[6] During his senior year, he caught 33 passes and scored 7 touchdowns, averaging 19 yards per catch. He was named All-State following his junior and senior seasons.[7]\n\nUniversity of Tennessee [ edit ]\n\nGault played football at Tennessee during an era when the school was acquiring its reputation as \"Wide Receiver U.\" Three of Gault's teammates— Anthony Hancock, Clyde Duncan, and Tim McGee— would be first-round NFL Draft picks, and three others— Mike Miller, Lenny Taylor and Darryal Wilson— would be drafted in later rounds. During his four years at UT, Gault caught 89 passes for 1,482 yards and 10 touchdowns, returned 78 kickoffs for 1,854 yards and four touchdowns, and returned 78 punts for 659 yards and a touchdown.[8]\n\nDuring the regular season of his freshman year in 1979, Gault caught three passes for 95 yards, including a 69-yard touchdown in Tennessee's 51-18 win over Utah. He had a team-leading four catches for 22 yards in the Vols' 27-22 loss to Purdue in the 1979 Bluebonnet Bowl.[9]\n\nGault's breakout year came during the 1980 season. Though he caught a relatively modest 14 passes for 240 yards while splitting time with Miller at receiver, he returned 24 kickoffs for 662 yards, and tied a national single-season record by returning three kickoffs for touchdowns. He returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown to provide Tennessee's lone score in the team's 30-6 loss to Pittsburgh. He then returned kickoffs for touchdowns in back-to-back games at the end of the season: a 92-yarder against Kentucky and a 98-yarder against Vanderbilt.[10] Calling the latter play for the Vol Network, long-time broadcaster John Ward shouted, \"Ladies and gentlemen, Willie Gault has run all the way to the State Capitol.\"[11] Gault added a 48-yard touchdown catch in the Kentucky win.[12]\n\nDuring his junior year in 1981, Gault caught 22 passes for 479 yards and four touchdowns while continuing to split time with Miller. He also added to his reputation as a dangerous return man, with 28 kickoff returns for 606 yards, and 31 punt returns for 381 yards and a touchdown. In Tennessee's 28-20 win over Ole Miss, Gault had a 54-yard kickoff return, a 66-yard punt return for a touchdown, and a 49-yard punt return. He returned a punt 66 yards for an apparent touchdown against Auburn, but it was called back on a penalty. He caught a 75-yard touchdown pass in the Vols' loss to Alabama, and registered a 49-yard touchdown catch against Memphis State. He had 217 receiving yards against Vanderbilt, including an 80-yard touchdown catch and a 72-yard reception.[13] In Tennessee's 28-21 win over Wisconsin in the 1981 Garden State Bowl, Gault returned a kickoff 87 yards for the Vols' first touchdown of the game.[14]\n\nGault entered his senior year a Preseason All-American.[13] As part of an explosive receiving corps that included Mike Miller, Lenny Taylor and Darryal Wilson, Gault registered a team-leading 50 catches for 668 yards and four touchdowns. He also registered 23 kickoff returns for 549 yards and a touchdown, and 20 punt returns for 145 yards.[15] He caught touchdown passes of 78 yards and 38 yards in Tennessee's 24-14 loss to Auburn,[16] and returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown in the Vols' 24-24 tie against LSU.[17] Gault caught a 52-yard touchdown pass in Tennessee's 35-28 win over Alabama, helping the Vols break an 11-year losing streak to the Tide.[18] He caught a 19-yard touchdown pass in Tennessee's 28-22 loss to Iowa in the 1982 Peach Bowl.[19] He was named an All-American at the end of the season.[20]\n\nAs of the 2012 season, Gault's 1,854 kickoff return yards and 2,513 total return yards remain school records. His 27.6 yards per kickoff return in 1980 and his 987 total return yards in 1981 remain school single-season records.[21] Gault's mark of 4,035 career all-purpose yards is the second-highest tally in school history, trailing only Stanley Morgan's 4,642. His 273 all-purpose yards against Auburn in 1982 and 268 against Vanderbilt in 1981 remain the second and third-highest single game tallies in school history, trailing only Chuck Webb's 294 yards in the 1989 Ole Miss game.[22]\n\nTrack and field [ edit ]\n\nGault qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team and would have participated in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow had the United States not boycotted the event. He was one of 461 athletes to receive a Congressional Gold Medal.[23] Gault set a record in the 110-meter high hurdles at the SEC track and field championships in May 1981.[24] At the 1982 SEC championships, he again set the 110-meter high hurdles record, and won the Commissioner's Trophy for the highest overall score.[25] He won the 60-yard hurdles event at the 1983 SEC indoor championships with a time of 7:05.[26] At the 1983 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships, Gault won the 60-yard high hurdles and the 60-yard dash with times of 6.98 and 6.18, respectively.[27] At the 1983 NCAA outdoor championships, Gault placed third behind Roger Kingdom and Reggie Towns in the 110-meter high hurdles.[28]\n\nGault was part of a world record-setting 4 × 100 meter relay team (1. Emmit King, 2. Willie Gault, 3. Calvin Smith, 4. Carl Lewis) at the 1983 World Championships.[29] He also competed in the 110 meter hurdles and attended the Liberty Bell Classic, where he won a bronze medal in the 100 meter race). He made the 1988 Winter Olympics bobsledding team as an alternate. His personal bests are 13.26 seconds in the 110 meter hurdles and 10.10 seconds in the 100 meters.[30]\n\nPersonal bests [ edit ]\n\nEvent Time (seconds) Venue Date 100 meters 10.10 A Provo, Utah June 5, 1982 200 meters 20.68 Tempe, Arizona March 20, 1982\n\nGault was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the first round (18th overall pick) in the 1983 NFL Draft, and had an immediate impact during his rookie season. He caught four passes for 103 yards and a touchdown in the Bears' loss to New Orleans, five passes for 103 yards and a touchdown in the Bears' loss to Baltimore, and four passes for 129 yards and an 87-yard touchdown in the Bears' loss to Green Bay.[31] Gault was the prototypical \"speed merchant\", meaning his greatest asset was his pure straight line swiftness.\n\nDuring the Bears' dominant 1985 season, Gault caught 33 passes for a team-leading 704 yards. His best game of the season came in the Bears' 33–24 win over Minnesota, when he caught six passes for 146 yards, including a 70-yard touchdown.[32] In the Bears' 46–10 victory over New England in Super Bowl XX, Gault had four receptions for a game-leading 129 yards, and four kickoff returns for 49 yards.[33] At the end of the 1985 regular season, Gault helped organize teammates to perform the \"Super Bowl Shuffle\", a rap song and music video that raised money for a local charity. He sang one verse in the song.[4]\n\nBy the 1986 season, friction had developed between Gault and Bears quarterback Jim McMahon. In his autobiography published that year, McMahon suggested that Gault was undependable, and only put forth his best effort if the game was on national television.[4] Gault stated in an interview with Sports Illustrated that he wasn't sure why McMahon seemed hesitant to the throw it to him more often (the Sports Illustrated article's author, Bruce Newman, suggested that Gault didn't get as many throws because he was frequently double-teamed).[4] In spite of this squabble, Gault finished the 1986 season with 42 catches for 818 yards, including 7 catches for 174 yards against Cincinnati, and four catches for 116 yards against Tampa Bay.[34]\n\nPrior to the 1988 season, Gault was traded to the Los Angeles Raiders.[35] He caught four passes for 102 yards in the Raiders' loss to Cincinnati on October 2, 1988.[36] He caught four passes for 131 yards and a touchdown in the 1989 season opener against San Diego, and had 147 yards on just two catches in the Raiders' win over Cincinnati on November 5, 1989.[37] He caught four passes for 103 yards to help the Raiders defeat his former team on September 30, 1990.[38] The Raiders did not re-sign Gault following the 1993 season.[39]\n\nIn spite of his speed, Gault never won the NFL's \"Fastest Man\" competition. He placed second behind frequent winner Darrell Green in 1986, having defeated fellow Olympic sprinter Ron Brown in the semifinals.[40] In the 1990 competition, Gault again placed second, losing to Brown in the finals (Green was recovering from an injury and didn't compete).[41] Green (a cornerback) would frequently cover Gault when their respective teams played. In the Bears' 23–19 win over Washington in the 1984 playoffs, Gault beat Green for a 75-yard touchdown reception after getting held without a catch in the first half.[42] In the Bears' loss to the Redskins in the 1986 playoffs, Gault had five catches for 82 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown, while going head to head with Green.[43] In the Redskins' 21-17 win over the Bears in the 1987 playoffs, Green held Gault without a catch before leaving the game with an injury.[44] In the Raiders' 21–20 win over the Redskins in 1992, Gault went without a reception for most of the game before beating Green for a 50-yard catch that set up the winning touchdown.[45]\n\nGault finished his 11 NFL seasons with 333 receptions for 6,635 yards. He also returned 9 punts for 60 yards, rushed for 154 yards, returned 45 kickoffs for 1,088 yards, and scored 45 touchdowns (44 receiving and 1 kickoff return).\n\nCareer statistics [ edit ]\n\nCareer statistics Receiving Kickoff returns Season Team G Rec Yds Y/G Avg Lng TD KR Yds Avg Long TD 1983 Chicago 16 40 836 52.2 20.9 87 8 13 276 21.2 38 0 1984 Chicago 16 34 587 36.7 17.3 61 6 1 12 12 12 0 1985 Chicago 16 33 704 44 21.3 70 1 22 577 26.2 99 1 1986 Chicago 16 42 818 51.1 19.5 53 5 1 20 20 20 0 1987 Chicago 12 35 705 58.8 20.1 56 7 0 0 0 0 0 1988 L.A.

He portrayed Willie the Sweeper in the NBC series The Pretender. Willie also had an appearance on the sitcom Still Standing playing himself as the father of Tina's friend. He had a few appearances on Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide playing himself alongside sportscaster Van Earl Wright and most recently was featured in the series finale. He also was in an episode of MTV's Parental Control. In Season 4 Episode 8 of Friday Night Lights, the Dillon Lions radio color-man is named Willie Gault as a tribute.\n\nDuring Super Bowl XLIV, Gault joined other members of the 1985 Chicago Bears in resurrecting the Super Bowl Shuffle in a Boost Mobile commercial.[46]\n\nGault has been active at the highest levels of Masters athletics. On June 24, 2006, Gault set a world record of 10.72 seconds in the master's 100 meters, in the division for athletes aged 45 to 49. On April 26, 2008, Gault (at age 47) set a new world record of 21.80 seconds in the M45-49 age-group for 200m.[47][48] In May 2011, he set world records for the 50-54 age group in the 100-meter (10.88) and 200-meter (22.44) dashes.[49]\n\nIn April 2016, Gault was ordered to pay $206,571 to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit regarding his actions in a scheme to inflate share prices of the medical device company Heart Tronics Inc, for which he had been co-CEO. Gault was cleared of the most serious fraud charges.[50]\n\nIn November 2016, Gault was inducted into the 2017 class of the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame.[51]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]",

But bikeways should be built in response to demand, not the other way around.\n\n“It is wrong if the City is spending public money on secret promotional activities to normalise cycling.”\n\nThe Lord Mayor appears to be treating the allegations as a silly season stunt by an opposition councillor.\n\nShe declined to issue a personal response but a spokesperson said: “These allegations are entirely untrue.”\n\nThe spokesperson said the idea was particularly bizarre considering cycling was a popular, fast-growing activity in the Sydney LGA.\n\n“As we build safe, separated bike lanes, the numbers of riders grow, and we’ve had faster growth in riding here than in any comparable city in the world.”\n\nCity of Sydney CEO Monica Barone and Manager of the City’s Cycling Strategy Fiona Campbell also dismissed Cr Vithoulkas’ claims. But Ms Vithoulkas insists there are unused bikes chained up in Potts Point, Pyrmont and Surry Hills, in mint condition and often fitted with identical bike locks, baskets and bells.\n\nMs Vithoulkas said the Living Sydney party had been monitoring the situation “for some time” and a pair of bikes chained to City bike racks outside the Pyrmont IGA supermarket had been there “for at least six months”.\n\n“No-one uses them, they never go anywhere. They’re brand new and from the tyres it looks like they haven’t been ridden even once.\n\n“The only thing that happens is the basket which is on one of the bikes fills up with rubbish over time, until someone – I don’t know who – cleans it out.”\n\nWhen City News visited the bikes in question, staff at Pyrmont IGA said they, too, were mystified by the ever-present bikes.\n\nMs Vithoulkas said: “Anything is possible when it comes to our bicycle-mad Lord Mayor.\n\n“If the City itself isn’t placing them around town, I suspect a PR or marketing company acting on the City’s behalf.”\n\nBut a spokesperson for the Lord Mayor was adamant that was not possible either, adding to the mystery of just who is behind Sydney’s phantom bikes.\n\nMs Vithoulkas denied the bikes were associated with her or the Living Sydney party.\n\n“No, we didn’t put them there,” she said. “They’re nothing to do with us.”",

The Spring Oaks team came in third place overall. Communities in Schools, along with the the Spring Oaks Middle School chess club, held a chess tournament at the end of April. The Spring Oaks team came in third place overall. Photo: Spring Oaks Chess Club Photo: Spring Oaks Chess Club Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Spring Branch ISD students find success in chess club 1 / 1 Back to Gallery\n\nThere is an afterschool club at Spring Oaks Middle School, but you might not know it is there unless you stumbled upon it. Besides the occasional chatter, it is fairly quiet in the classroom except for the sound of moving pieces on the boards.\n\nThe chess club is headed by John Vargas, the Communities in Schools student support specialist at Spring Oaks in Spring Branch Independent School District, and has been going strong for nine years.\n\nRight now the club has about 20 members who gather after school, but Vargas says that when the students play at lunch time, that number can easily grow to 200.\n\nLast month, Spring Oaks and Communities in Schools together hosted a chess tournament.\n\n\"A lot of the students want to play in tournaments. However, what keeps us from going to many tournaments is money,\" Vargas said. \"The main reason why we did this tournament is because a lot of the students are leaving to go to high school, and they wanted to compete because they haven't competed against anybody yet. Everyone was asking steadily.\"\n\nVargas noted that a lot of people helped put the tournament on and it was a community effort. Some people supplied water and food, and others supplied small gifts for winners.\n\nThe Spring Oak chess club came in third overall.\n\n\"We did real well considering there were other teams who had played in tournaments quite a bit,\" Vargas said.\n\nParent Claudia Presas has all three of her children in the chess club, including seventh-grade son Matthew Pardo.\n\n\"Matthew played in the tournament and played three games and lost two. He beat a high schooler. He could have lost all of the other games, but he was so excited he beat a high schooler. He kept talking about it,\" Presas said. \"It builds up his confidence and makes him think outside the box.\"\n\nPresas thinks that chess should be considered a sport because, after seeing her children play, she thinks it looks harder than playing football.\n\n\"Sometimes my kids come home and say their heads hurt from thinking too hard about where to move a piece,\" Presas said.\n\n\"I am trying to get better than my brother! I have not gotten there yet but I want to keep trying. I like learning new things,\" said her son, Matthew.\n\nThe game has instilled friendly competition in the players. Vargas says each player shakes hands before and after each game.\n\nThey all hope to win the coveted purple set of chess pieces that goes to the current best player. If the player wins four games in a row with the purple pieces, Vargas says, the player will get their own chess board to keep.\n\n\"Everyone wants to stop you from getting the chess board. We came up with this idea a few years ago, and everyone really likes it; everyone is really competitive,\" Vargas said. \"I tell the kids it is like anything else you do in life. You have to do it over and over to get good at it.\"\n\nThe game has taught the students social skills, as well as even math problems by doing fractions on the boards. The chess club has also provided a place for students to fit in, find friends and helps them do better overall in their classes.\n\n\"I moved here last year. I didn't know anybody. In lunch, a kid asked me to play. It helps me with my math. My grades have improved a lot. I have learned that I have to have a lot of patience,\" eighth grader Jose Ramirez said.\n\nEighth grader Abraham Sanchez said, \"My one friend at lunch would always beat me, so I joined the chess club to get better.\"\n\n\"He used to struggle in the sixth grade,\" Vargas said of Sanchez. \"But in seventh grade he got better, and now his teachers are really proud of him for the grades he's gotten this year.\"\n\nParent Lauro Gayton said his seventh-grade son, Caleb, has ADHD and used to be fidgety and shy. He thinks the chess club has changed Caleb in multiple ways for the better.\n\n\"Caleb is always reminding me, 'Dad, don't forget, tomorrow is chess after school.' He enjoys the game. It makes him sit down and think. He is a real shy kid, so the chess club was a way for him to make friends. Caleb was one of those kids where, he has ADHD, and doing this helps him out. And I want to thank Mr. Vargas for that,\" Gayton said.\n\n\"I wanted to get my brain up and running and learn new strategies. I have a lot of fun even though I lose sometimes,\" Caleb said.\n\n\"I have been with Communities in Schools for about 20 years. It's not part of what we do, it is an extra thing that we do. Some people think that chess is all I do, but there are a lot of benefits to playing chess. We will do anything that will get kids together,\" Vargas said.",

Darron Cummings/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nWithin hours of the alliance's debut, it was already on shaky ground, with Kasich telling his supporters in Indiana on Monday morning to still vote for him and insisting he wasn't trying to do anything to stop Trump. By Thursday, Cruz was insisting there was no \"alliance\" — these aren't the droids you're looking for — and Kasich's chief strategist, soon after, sending not-so-cryptic tweets about not being able to stand \"liars.\"\n\nCruz followed up the swelling success of that moment with another transparent attempt to change the narrative of the race before Indiana's primary Tuesday: He named Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nOr, more accurately, he signaled that if he won the GOP nomination at some point between now and the end of the Republican National Convention in mid-July, it was his intention to pick Fiorina. Which was sort of weird. But not as weird as the fact that Cruz spoke for 30 minutes before he actually, you know, got to the point.\n\nTed Cruz announced that Carly Fiorina will be his running mate in his bid for the 2016 Republican nomination – but his introduction took almost half an hour. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Fiorina pick was seen as either presumptuous or head-scratching (or both!) in most circles, and, even on the day it was announced, didn't move the needle as Cruz had to hope it might.\n\nEven when Cruz got legitimately good news this week, it fell well short of expectations. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) kind of, sort of endorsed Cruz on Friday, but he also heaped praise on Trump in the process and made clear that he wouldn't be doing much other than voting for Cruz in the final few days of the primary race.\n\nAdd it all up and here's what you get: a candidate desperately trying to make fetch happen. And it is not happening.",
  "latent_28028": "Some of you may recall last year’s post about 3D printing and my general disappointment with consumer-grade additive manufacturing technology. This was the start of my year-long quest to turn bits into atoms. Since that time there has been much progress in the technology and I’ve learned a lot about manufacturing. But first, a little about why I’m doing this, and my new project titled: Ether Drift.\n\nA little over a year ago, I met a small team of developers who had a jaw-dropping trailer for a property they tried to get funded as a AAA console game. After failing to get the game off the ground it was mothballed until I accidentally saw their video one fateful afternoon.\n\nWith the incredible success of wargaming miniatures and miniature-based board game campaigns on Kickstarter, I thought one way to launch this awesome concept would be to turn the existing game assets into figurines. These toys would work with an augmented reality app that introduces the world and the characters as well as light gameplay elements. This would be a way to gauge interest in the property before going ahead with a full game production.\n\nA lot of this was based on my erroneous assumption that I could just 3D print game models and ship them as toys. I really knew nothing about manufacturing. Vague memories of Ed Fries’ 3D printing service that made figurines out of World of Warcraft avatars guided my first steps.\n\n3D printers are great prototyping tools. Still, printing the existing game model took over 20 hours and cost hundreds of dollars in materials and machine time. Plus, 3D prints are fragile and require a lot of hand-finishing to smooth out. When manufacturing in quantity, you need to go back to old-school molding.\n\nYou can 3D print just about any shape, but molding and casting has strict limitations. You have to minimize undercut by breaking the model up into smaller pieces that can be molded and assembled. The game model I printed out was way too complicated to be broken down into a manageable set of parts.\n\nSo I scrapped the idea of using an existing game property. Instead, I developed an entirely new production process. I now create new characters from scratch that are designed to be molded. This starts as a high detail 3D model that is printed out in parts that molds are made from. Then, I have that 3D model turned into something that can be textured and rigged for Unity3D. There are some sacrifices made in character design since the more pieces there are, the more expensive it is to manufacture. Same goes for the painting process–the more detailed the game texture is, the more costly it becomes to duplicate in paint on a plastic toy.\n\nSo, what is Ether Drift? In short: it’s Skylanders for nerds. I love the concept of Skylanders–but, grown adult geeks like toys too. The first version of this project features a limited set of figures and an augmented reality companion app.\n\nThe app uses augmented reality trading cards packed with each figure to display your toy in real-time 3D as well as allowing you to use your characters with a simple card battle game. I’m using Qualcomm’s Vuforia for this feature–the gold standard in AR.\n\nThe app lets you add characters to your collection via a unique code on the card. These characters will be available in the eventual Ether Drift game, as well as others. I’ve secured a deal to have these characters available in at least one other game.\n\nIf you are building a new IP today, it’s extremely important to think about your physical goods strategy. Smart indies have already figured this out. The workflow I created for physical to digital can be applied to any IP, but planning it in advance can make the process much simpler.\n\nIn essence, I’m financing the development of a new IP by selling individual assets as toys while it is being built. For me, it’s also a throwback to the days before everything was licensed from movies or comic books and toy store shelves were stocked with all kinds of crazy stuff. Will it work? We’ll see next month! I am planning a Kickstarter for the first series in mid-March. Stay Tuned to the Ether Drift site, Facebook page, or Twitter account. Selling atoms instead of bits is totally new ground for me. I’m open to all feedback on the project, as well as people who want to collaborate.",

  "latent_28166": "Everyone wants to make the next great mobile application.\n\nIt can be an extremely profitable way to make some money if you know what you’re doing.\n\nIf you’ve got a great idea and decided to consult with a developer, you may have been surprised to hear how costly it is to outsource development.\n\nSo that’s when the thought hit you, “I can just do learn to do this myself.”\n\nI can relate.\n\nIt’s the reason why I studied code and learned to build apps.\n\nBut where do you start?\n\nDepending on your current situation and intentions, there are a few different routes you can go.\n\nI’ll make sure to cover all of these scenarios throughout this complete beginner guide to mobile app development.\n\nWe’ll even cover topics like how to estimate development costs .\n\nWhile building an app may sound intimidating, it’s really just like anything else. If you practice and put the time in, it will get much easier.\n\nPlus, it helps to have some guidance from an expert in the field (that’s where I come in).\n\nHere’s everything you need to know.\n\nSo…why do you want to become a mobile app developer?\n\nOK. So you’re probably aware of how popular mobile apps are.\n\nBut just how many apps are there?\n\nLet’s take a look at some information from Statista .\n\nDon’t be intimidated by the number of apps available across different platforms.\n\nSure, you’ll have some competition, but the majority of these likely won’t be in your industry.\n\nPlus, lots of apps out there are complete duds.\n\nYou won’t have to worry about competing against those either.\n\nWith that said, it’s important that you have a clear goal before you become a developer.\n\nHere are a few common scenarios:\n\nYou want to build your own startup company\n\nYou’re trying to be a freelancer or run a mobile app development shop\n\nYou are a business owner that doesn’t have the funds to outsource app development\n\nChances are, you fall somewhere within these three examples.\n\nLet’s say you have the next big idea.\n\nYou want to take that concept and build an app to become the next Snapchat or Instagram .\n\nIf you fall into this category, I sincerely admire your ambition.\n\nThis won’t be an easy route, but if you’re successful, it could potentially be the most profitable.\n\nIn this case, you’ll need to learn how to do everything from scratch.\n\nYou’ll also want to consider how you plan to make money from your app.\n\nRelying on paid downloads might not be your best option.\n\nIn fact, the majority of mobile applications are available for free .\n\nSo before you dive in head first, make sure you think about your strategy for generating a profit.\n\nFor those of you that want to be a freelance app builder or start your own app store, this isn’t something you need to worry about.\n\nYou’ll make money by charging clients to build apps for them.\n\nIf you’ve got the marketing skills as well, you can double as a consultant and charge more for your services.\n\nIn this case, it’s probably not the worst idea for you to know some different strategies to make money.\n\nOr you can just stick to familiarizing yourself with the best tools for mobile app designers .\n\nLet’s talk about the business owners who want to build an app as an extension of their current brand, business, or website.\n\nWhat’s your budget?\n\nThe majority businesses plan to budget between $250,000 and $500,000 over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nDoes this sound too high to you?\n\nIt’s not.\n\nYour location is relevant to how much it’s going to cost to develop your app.\n\nIf you’re located in North America, expect to pay roughly $150 per hour if you’re planning to hire someone to build your iOS mobile app.\n\nSo unless you’re planning to take a trip to Indonesia, it won’t be inexpensive.\n\nOn average , an app will take about 7-9 months to build and cost you about $270,000.\n\nThat’s an unrealistic number for some businesses.\n\nYour company may not even be able to secure a $200,000 line of credit, never mind pay over $250,000 for an app.\n\nSo what’s the solution?\n\nFollow my guide, and I’ll show you the most cost effective ways to develop your own app if you don’t have the funds to pay someone else to do it.\n\n[thrive_lead_lock id=’14525′]Hidden Content[/thrive_lead_lock]\n\nOption #1: Just learn how to code everything\n\nIf you want to become a mobile app developer, learning to code is your first option.\n\nIt’s not required for everyone, but for some of you, this will be the best route.\n\nI’m speaking to those of you who want to build the next Instagram or Snapchat.\n\nHere’s the good news, you don’t need to go back to school to learn code.\n\nThere are some great resources online that teach you how to code for free.\n\nI’ll show you my favorite ones.\n\nTeam Treehouse offers a free trial for a week to new users.\n\nSo you can learn to code from your own computer, anywhere with a Wi-Fi connection.\n\nHere’s how their system works.\n\nThey have thousands of videos to teach users the basics of coding.\n\nAfter you watch the videos, you’ll take quizzes to test your knowledge.\n\nThen, Team Treehouse gives you the tools needed to practice coding with interactive challenges.\n\nThe platform is super clean and really easy to use, especially for beginners.\n\nCode Academy is another one of my favorites.\n\nTheir platform also has interactive tools that will teach you the coding basics for your mobile application.\n\nLet’s take a step back for a minute.\n\nBefore you commit the time and teach yourself how to code, you should learn the basics of developing a minimum viable product (MVP).\n\nAre you familiar with the lean startup methodology?\n\nIt’s a solution for shortening the cycles of product development.\n\nWhy should you consider this?\n\nIn short, it can save you money in the big picture.\n\nHere’s a scenario.\n\nA company has a great idea for a product, or in your case, a mobile application.\n\nYou could spend months or potentially years perfecting the app and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop it.\n\nThen your big moment comes – it’s finally launch day.\n\nAll your hard work is about to pay off, right?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nThe consumer market could reject the idea, and your startup fails.\n\nSo, rather than asking yourself, “Can I build this app?” ask, “Should I build this app?”\n\nHere’s a visual representation of this cycle.\n\nYou’ll constantly conduct research and get customer feedback throughout the process.\n\nThat way you can make the necessary changes along the way to minimize any inefficiency before a large-scale release.\n\nUsing the learn startup methodology will also let you know early on if you should continue developing your app or just cut your losses and avoid major failure.\n\nBuild Measure Learn\n\nIf you can do these three things continuously, it’s worth it to learn how to code for your startup company.\n\nOption #2: Use app builders\n\nApp builders are perfect for existing business owners who want to use a mobile application to enhance their company.\n\nYou may not have the budget to pay over $200,000 for someone else to build it for you.\n\nLearning how to code probably isn’t an option either due to the time constraints of running a company.\n\nApp builders are also ideal for entrepreneurs and freelancers who want to make some money building apps for other businesses.\n\nBoth of these scenarios require zero coding skills if you find the right app builder.\n\nSo where do you start?\n\nLook for existing templates and examples of generic applications.\n\nI know I’m biased (obviously) but BuildFire has tons of great templates to fit your business.\n\nRegardless of your business type or industry, you’ll be able to find a template to get you started.\n\nYou could always design a template from scratch, but personally, I think it’s much easier to work off of an existing design.\n\nSo what space is your company in?\n\nEcommerce\n\nRestaurant\n\nEntertainment\n\nReal Estate\n\nSmall Business\n\nNon profit\n\nThe options go on and on.\n\nFor those of you who want to build apps for other businesses, app building tools like this give you the option to work with multiple templates all on the same platform.\n\nIt’s easy.\n\nSo you won’t need to learn how to code, you’ll just have to get good at navigating through the website and figure out what works best for your clients.\n\nThen you can just white label the app to make money by selling it to the businesses you’re working with.\n\nLet’s take this one step further.\n\nWhat if your clients want customized features that aren’t in the generic templates?\n\nNot a problem.\n\nTake advantage of BuildFire’s pro services team .\n\nReach out directly to our experts.\n\nWe’ll spend one on one time with you to figure out exactly what you’re looking for.\n\nOnce everything is decided on, we build the app for you.\n\nThen you can just resell it to your clients make a profit without having to do the bulk of the work.\n\nThis is ideal for people who have a large list of clients.\n\nIf you have to do all of the work yourself, it’s nearly impossible to scale.\n\nSo here’s your solution.\n\nUse the BuildFire white labeling service.\n\nWe build the apps, and you can sell it branded as your own.\n\nThat way you can spend the majority of your time and effort to get new customers.\n\nYou might make fewer margins, but this system is much more scalable.\n\nOver time, this model is sustainable and will generate long-term profitability.\n\nOption #3: Use app builders and some coding (using BF SDK)\n\nThe third choice for becoming a mobile app developer involves a combination of our last two options.\n\nYou can use an app building service and use some coding.\n\nI’m referring to the BuildFire software development kit .\n\nInstead of having our team build the app for you, this kit can teach you how to build it yourself.\n\nOnce you learn how to add custom features for your clients, you’ll be able to generate more profit.\n\nNow, this will take more time and effort compared to our last option, but it all depends on your personal preference.\n\nYou may not be able to work with as many clients, but you’ll have higher margins on each project.\n\nUsing app builders and coding like the BuildFire SDK will also give you the opportunity to build plugins.\n\nWhat’s a plugin?\n\nIt’s an added extension to an existing application.\n\nThey add more functionality to the user experience and can help generate more profits.\n\nHere’s an example.\n\nLet’s say you have an ecommerce business and want to develop a mobile app for your company.\n\nYou can use the Shopify plugin to add features to your store.\n\nYou’ll have different options while navigating the SDK.\n\nYou can add:\n\n3rd party developer plugins\n\nPlugins created by BuildFire\n\nCustomized plugins built on your own\n\nIf you’re going to take the time to learn some code through an app builder, you should consider including a plugin with your designs.\n\nConclusion\n\nBecoming a mobile app developer is much easier than it sounds.\n\nDepending on your situation, you’ve got lots of options to choose from.\n\nLearning how to build mobile apps are ideal for people who:\n\nWant to build their own startup company\n\nAre trying to create apps for other businesses\n\nOwn a business and can’t afford to outsource development\n\nVirtually everyone today has a smart phone in their pocket.\n\nHow do people spend time on their phone ?\n\nThis graphic reinforces how important it is for you to get involved in this space.\n\nThere’s a tremendous opportunity for profit in the mobile app development field.\n\nIf you’re trying to launch a startup company, it’s in your best interest to learn how to code everything from scratch.\n\nThat’s not necessarily the easiest route, but it’s the most realistic.\n\nFortunately, you won’t have to go back to school to do this.\n\nThere are plenty of online tools like the options that we discussed earlier that can teach you how to code from your own computer.\n\nApp builders are perfect for business owners who don’t have the funds to pay a developer.\n\nJust look for a generic template based on your industry and add the features you need.\n\nFor a more customized experience, you can work with the BuildFire pro services team directly.\n\nIf you’re an entrepreneur who wants to make money by selling apps to other businesses, take advantage of the white labeling services.\n\nWe’ll build your app.\n\nAll you have to do is brand it yourself and sell it to your clients.\n\nThis will give you a chance to grow your client list and scale your revenue stream.\n\nBut, if you want to learn the coding process from an app builder, just download the software development kit.\n\nYou can also learn how to add plugins to generate more profits.\n\nWhich option will you choose on your path to becoming a mobile app developer?",

  "latent_28265": "After running a campaign that in many ways tried not to be defined by race, Mr. Obama placed himself squarely in the middle of the debate over how to address it, a living bridge between whites and blacks still divided by the legacy of slavery and all that came after it.\n\nHis language reached at times for the inspiration and idealism of the civil rights movement, but for the most part addressed the politics of race in straightforward terms that seemed intended to keep the discussion grounded in the realities of the moment.\n\n“It’s a racial stalemate we’ve been stuck in for years,” Mr. Obama said. “Contrary to the claims of some of my critics, black and white, I have never been so naïve as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle, or with a single candidacy — particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own.”\n\nFor Mr. Obama, who is engaged in an intense fight for his party’s nomination with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the 37-minute speech five weeks before the Pennsylvania primary was an attempt to realign his campaign after a turbulent two weeks. Images of Mr. Wright, replayed again and again on television, threatened to damage a coalition of black and white voters that Mr. Obama has been trying to forge.\n\n“I can no more disown him than I can disown my white grandmother,” he said, “a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe.”\n\nThe speech, delivered before a small audience of local supporters, elected officials and clergy members at the National Constitution Center, was broadcast live on cable. His words were directed at a variety of constituencies, including the superdelegates who, it now seems likely, will decide the nomination, and white voters in states like Pennsylvania that could be vital both in the primary and in the general election.\n\nMr. Obama stayed up well into the night writing much of the speech himself, aides said. His words carried familiar strains of the biography he wrote more than a decade ago about his search for racial identity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn recent days, televised images of Mr. Obama have been accompanied by old sermons of Mr. Wright delivering a blistering critique on white America. As the days go on, it remains an open question whether the images of the pastor will fall to the side and Mr. Obama’s campaign message regains its prominence. This speech was a political risk, his advisers said, whose wisdom may not be fully known for months.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Douglas Wilder, the mayor of Richmond, Va., who was the nation’s first elected black governor, said in an interview. “It was a very, very difficult subject to bring up. It had to be approached in a way that was really something of substance.”\n\nMr. Obama indicated that he wanted to move quickly to other issues, scheduling two high-profile speeches over the next two days on topics other than race.\n\n“I suppose the politically safe thing would be to move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork,” Mr. Obama said. “We can dismiss Reverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed Geraldine Ferraro, in the aftermath of her recent statements, as harboring some deep-seated racial bias.”\n\nHe noted that his candidacy had been successful in predominantly white states and in largely black states, but he conceded that the nation’s racial divisions remained firmly ingrained and that black anger and white resentment was rarely interchangeably understood.\n\n“For the men and women of Reverend Wright’s generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away, nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years,” Mr. Obama said. “That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends, but it does find voice in the barbershop or the beauty shop or around the kitchen table.”\n\n“In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community,” he said. Later, he added: “So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town, when they hear that an African-American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed, when they’re told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time.”\n\nA few hours after the speech, Mrs. Clinton arrived at City Hall here for a campaign stop. She said she had not seen it, but said she was “very glad” that Mr. Obama had made it, given that race had been a “complicated” issue in America marked by “pitfalls” and “detours.”\n\nFor nearly a week, Mr. Obama has struggled to distance himself from statements by Mr. Wright, who had cast the government as racist, corrupt and murderous among other things. Mr. Obama concluded over the weekend that he had failed to resolve the questions, aides said, and told advisers he wanted to address the firestorm in a speech.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStanding against a backdrop of eight American flags on Tuesday morning, Mr. Obama offered the most thorough explanation to date about his association with the church and his pastor, whom he has known for nearly 20 years.\n\n“For some, nagging questions remain. Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Of course,” he said. “Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely — just as I’m sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed.”\n\n“The profound mistake of Reverend Wright’s sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society,” he added. “It’s that he spoke as if our society was static, as if no progress has been made.”",
  "latent_28479": "Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday — the beginning of a new era in American politics with the new president’s conservative platform set to reshape the nation.\n\nTrump took the oath of office administered by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts — and then addressed a crowd of hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe new president, with President Barack Obama standing by, struck a conciliatory note during his remarks, calling on Americans to unite behind his administration.\n\n“We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships, but we will get the job done,” Trump said.\n\n“Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you,” he said.\n\nHe then reiterated his vow to dramatically change the government and the direction of the country.\n\n“Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people,” he said to applause.\n\n“For too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed,” Trump continued, blaming the political establishment for the malaise.\n\n“Their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you.”\n\nTrump praised his supporters and the “movement they created.\n\n“You came by the tens of millions to become part of an historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves,” he said.\n\n“For too many of our citizens, a different reality exists. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.”\n\nHe decried rising crime in cities across America and repeated his call for a crackdown.\n\n“The crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success,” he vowed.\n\nTrump also turned combative when touching on his key campaign themes — jobs, law and order, better trade deals with other countries and infrastructure improvements.\n\n“I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again. Winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams,” he thundered.\n\n“We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American. And hire American.”\n\n‘I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down.’\n\nThe billionaire businessman also said the US would vanquish ISIS.\n\n“We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth,” he said.\n\nHe finished his brief remarks by repeating his vow to “make America great again,” prompting Obama to remark, “Good job, good job” as the pair shook hands.\n\nRain began to fall as Trump delivered his inaugural address, which clocked in at just 16 minutes.\n\nAfterward, he called out “Great job, Jackie!” to 16-year-old Jackie Evancho, following the “America’s Got Talent” star’s rendition of the national anthem.\n\nDuring Trump’s speech, his administration took control of the White House Web site, wiping away Obama’s positions on environmental regulations, LGBT issues and civil rights.\n\nIn their place, the new White House put forth policies including “An America First Energy Plan,” “Making Our Military Strong Again” and “Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community.”\n\nVice President Mike Pence was sworn in first by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, followed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing a rousing version of “America the Beautiful” accompanied by the US Marine Corps Band.\n\nThe ceremony was cordial, with Trump in a dark overcoat and his wife, Melania, clad in a powder blue cashmere jacket, standing at his side. Former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, were in attendance, as were former President George W. and Laura Bush and former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nNew York Cardinal Timothy Dolan offered a prayer before the swearing-in took place.\n\n“God of our ancestors and lord of mercy, you have made all things. And in your providence have charged us to rule the creatures produced by you, to governing the world in holiness and righteousness, and to render judgment with integrity of heart,” Dolan said.\n\n“Give us wisdom for we are your servants, weak and short-lived, lacking in comprehension of judgment and of laws.”\n\nNew York Sen. Chuck Schumer praised the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n“We Americans have always been a forward-looking, problem-solving, optimistic, patriotic and decent people. Whatever our race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, whether we are immigrant or native-born, whether we live with disabilities or do not, in wealth or in poverty, we are all exceptional in our commonly held yet fierce devotion to our country,” he said, as many in the crowd booed and chanted, “We want Trump” and “Lock her up,” referring to Hillary Clinton.\n\n“Today we celebrate one of democracy’s core attributes, the peaceful transfer of power. And every day we stand up for core democratic principles enshrined in the Constitution. The rule of law. Equal protection for all under law. The freedom of speech, press, religion. The things that make America America.”\n\nMeanwhile, cops used pepper spray to quell violent downtown Washington protests during the inauguration.\n\nWith Bruce Golding",
  "latent_28492": "The Republican National Committee is trying to increase pressure on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of Monday’s first presidential debate.\n\nClinton’s poor health — she collapsed during the 9/11 memorial ceremony and was dragged into a van by staff, her doctor says she was diagnosed with pneumonia — relaxed campaign schedule, and “debate reflexes” as a career politician running for president for a quarter of a century put intense pressure on her to exceed all expectations, RNC Chief Strategist and Communications Director Sean Spicer said in a statement:\n\n[T]he pressure is squarely on Hillary Clinton to live up to her reputation as a talented debater at a time when millions of undecided voters will be glued to their screens. For Clinton, high expectations stem from ample experience. Clinton is a career politician who has spent years sharpening her debate reflexes and beefing up on public policy. Donald Trump is new to the format. Aside from the primary debates (which have lower levels of attention focused on them and many more participants), Trump’s lack of formal, political, one-on-one debate experience gives Clinton a significant advantage.\n\nThe leftist media have repeatedly crowed about Clinton’s superior debating skills:\n\nClinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon described Clinton’s approach in seeing the debate stage as a “proving ground.” Chief Strategist Joel Benenson echoed Fallon by declaring of Trump, “I don’t think he can go toe to toe with her,” and speculated Clinton “will come out on top.” Not to be outdone, Clinton surrogate Ed Rendell said she held her own on many occasions in 2008 against Obama, who he called “probably the greatest debater in public speaking, in politics, in our lifetime.” The optimism in the Clinton camp is shared in the media as well, where there is almost unanimous agreement Clinton is an adept debater. Dana Bash, Chris Matthews, and Chris Hayes note how “seasoned” she is, and more pundits than we can count (including John Heilemann, Wolf Blitzer, and Mark Shields) laud her talent, experience and debate skills.”\n\nYet this gives the blunt, plain-speaking Trump the advantage, the RNC says:\n\nTrump hasn’t been running for president for 24 years; he’s spent his career as a successful businessman. Few are expecting the same level of polish from a verbal gunslinger whose rhetorical strength is speaking to the heart – and the gut – of the American people. Aside from the Super Bowl, the first debate has very high potential to be the most watched television event of the year. With so much riding on this moment and a wealth of experience working in her favor, Hillary Clinton has no excuse not to turn in a near-flawless performance.\n\nOnline polls taken after GOP primary debates declared Trump the winner of every single one.\n\nClinton has held few events in the days leading up to the first presidential debate, which will take place on Monday at 9 PM EST. Both candidates must stand for 90 minutes before the audience, under hot stage lights.",

  "latent_28599": "Republicans have successfully pushed an anti-abortion bill through the New Hampshire House of Representatives that would require doctors to lie to women in order to scare them from having an abortion.\n\nThe bill, known as HB 1659, not only requires women to wait a mandatory 24 hours before having an abortion, it also requires doctors to give them false information by telling them that abortion cause breast cancer. The bill, sponsored by GOP Rep. Jeanine Notter, states:\n\n“e) Materials that inform the pregnant woman that there is a direct link between abortion and breast cancer. It is scientifically undisputed that full-term pregnancy reduces a woman’s lifetime risk of breast cancer. It is also undisputed that the earlier a woman has a first full-term pregnancy, the lower her risk of breast cancer becomes, because following a full-term pregnancy the breast tissue exposed to estrogen through the menstrual cycle is more mature and cancer resistant. In fact, for each year that a woman’s first full-term pregnancy is delayed, her risk of breast cancer rises 3.5 percent. The theory that there is a direct link between abortion and breast cancer builds upon this undisputed foundation. During the first and second trimesters of pregnancy the breasts develop merely by duplicating immature tissues. Once a woman passes the thirty-second week of pregnancy (third trimester), the immature cells develop into mature cancer resistant cells. When an abortion ends a normal pregnancy, the woman is left with more immature breast tissue than she had before she was pregnant. In short, the amount of immature breast tissue is increased and this tissue is exposed to significantly greater amounts of estrogen—a known cause of breast cancer. Women facing an abortion decision have a right to know that such medical data exists. At the very least, women must be informed that it is undisputed that pregnancy provides a protective effect against the later development of breast cancer.”\n\nAccording to the Huffington Post, Notter believes “that abortion would cause spaces in breast duct tissue to allow for the growth of cancer cells. She said she believed birth control pills lead to the same issue. Notter last month also said that she believed that birth control pills taken by women cause prostate cancer in their male children.”\n\nThe claim that abortions cause breast cancer is a false theory developed by anti-abortion advocates as a way to scare women into deciding against abortion. According to ThinkProgress, organizations such as the National Institutes of Health, the Susan G. Komen Foundation, the ???American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the World Health Organization, and the American Cancer Society all dispute the claim as bogus because there is absolutely no scientifically proven link between abortion and breast cancer.\n\nBut that isn’t stopping Republicans from forcing doctors to spread such misinformation as true. Republicans in Kansas have passed the same kind of bill, as has Texas and Alaska. Oklahoma Republicans are also pushing similar bills. Even Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum is pushing the lie as part of his war against women’s health. Republicans are now so desperate to stop abortion that they have to invent lies and force doctors to repeat them. This breast cancer lie reminds me of the whole ‘masturbating will make you go blind’ lie that parents used to tell their kids to scare them from exploring their sexuality. Even though that theory is also a complete and utter lie that has no scientific proof, I bet Republicans still say that to their kids.\n\nThis bill is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Doctors are forbidden by law to tell lies to their patients. This legislation will ultimately cause women to not trust their doctors which is wrong on so many levels. Republicans are trying to sell this bill as an ‘informed consent’ bill or a ‘right to know’ bill. The GOP seems to feel that women are stupid and don’t know anything about pregnancy, as if women don’t already learn about it in sex education or biology. If women want more information, they’ll ask their doctor for it. They don’t need information, especially false information, to be forced upon them as if they are children who need to be lectured or scared. By passing this bill, Republicans are saying it’s legal for doctors to lie to their patients as long as it’s for a conservative cause. This is a new tactic being used in the Republican war against women and it should cause the defeat of all Republicans this November. How much lower do Republicans have to sink to convince everyone that they aren’t capable of governing anymore?",

The film's plot follows six strangers who come across an ancient evil in the murky bog and are pitted in a fight for survival. Each of the travelers has a tale of heroism that seemingly links them to the situation, and only a local Archaeologist has the theories that may be able to save their lives.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nThe film opens with a man setting up a deadly trap, and luring a creature from the darkness by puncturing a drum of water. He successfully kills the creature and is briefly attacked by another who comes out of the bog. These appear to be normal people, capable of survival under the bog's depths. The man shrugs off the attacks and continues on into the night.\n\nMeanwhile, an archaeology Professor (David Wallace) is teaching a class of students about ancient sacrifices that had taken place in Ireland centuries ago. One student with a great deal of questions confronts the mummified remains of a sacrifice, and abruptly leaves the room. Upon investigation he finds that she is a hired assistant (Saiorse Reilly) and she leaves with him on an archaeological evaluation of some of the local hillsides. During this time a pair of travelers (Hannah Ross and her cousin Mallory) break down in an automobile they had stolen and head off on foot. Along the way, Mallory sprains her ankle, and she and Hannah take refuge in a remote cabin at the central area of the bog. A woman named Val Leary and her cab driver (Deano Doyle) get stuck in the bog and inadvertently find their way to the cabin, shortly afterward David and Saiorse arrive, having run into a cow on a nearby road. As the six strangers learn to live together, they are greeted by the outraged owner of the house known simply as \"Hunter\" or \"The Hunter\" who invites them in for the night, promising to show them the road out the following morning. As they dine over supper, they regale stories of personal heroisms between one another; Deano states he had once rushed a woman giving birth to children to a hospital, Mallory and Hannah had saved the life of a child's father who had fallen into the bog off chance. While Val admits she had dug up one of the \"Bog Men\" sacrifices, though she lies and says she did it some time prior and had called the police (which she had not done when she uncovered it earlier the same day). David sparks suspicion and Val and Deano leave. Hunter shortly after decides to go hunting, and provides bedding for the rest to lay on.\n\nDuring the night, Saiorse has a bad dream and David comforts her. The following morning, they find Deano but a large man who had earlier been resurrected from the Bog itself appears, causing Mallory to fall into a bog pool, nearly drowning, Hunter is able to free her, revealing Val's body who had apparently attempted to grab Mallory from under the bog. Now extremely ill, Mallory is taken back to the cabin, and Hunter is put under Saiorce's scrutiny saying he could have killed them. Deano is led back to the road his Taxi had gotten stuck on, but admits to Hunter he had lied about his story, accidentally killing a fare by catching her coat into the back door of his cab and dragging her to death afterward stashing her body into the swamp. After Hunter parts, Deano attempts to free his taxi and is accidentally dragged to his death as well. Back at the cabin, Hannah departs to find another way out of the bog and ends up getting captured by the giant man. David attempts to intervene and calm the bog man down, but Hunter shoots him, and in his rage the man decapitates Hannah. Upon his return, Mallory tells David that they had lied about their stories as well, that they had accidentally hit an old trench digger walking along the road and buried him near the bog. Dying shortly after, David realizes that their stories seem to have prompted this, Saiorse tells David that she too killed a man, her uncle who constantly beat and raped her, even giving her a still born child. And Hunter claims that a man he had saved in the forest \"could have\" been saved, instead he killed the man to stop his agony after he accidentally shot him in the first place. The bog man returns, kills Hunter who manages to give David a clue to killing him, when the man is distracted by the water pouring from the cabin's shower, David throws fire into it as it had been laced with gasoline and causes the man as well as the cabin to go up in a ball of fire, allowing David and Saiorse to escape. As they watch, the bog man runs in flames from the house and returns to the bog.\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]",

  "latent_29041": "By Tori Jackson, BA in International Affairs, GWU, 2015\n\nFebruary 24th, 2015 was a day of one of the greatest devastations I have ever faced. My entire post-collegiate world shattered as I read these words: “We regret that we are unable to offer you an assignment at this time.” Peace Corps had dumped me. I thought wanting it more than anything I had ever wanted before was enough, that my passion would carry me 8,213 miles to Mozambique. A few hundred tears later, I rallied and began to figure out what I had done wrong the first time, learning from the mistakes I was not willing to make again.\n\nFor me, applying to the Peace Corps meant being one step closer towards doing all of the things I dreamed of while studying International Affairs: exploring the world, speaking new languages, and most importantly, helping others – but it all began with rejection. One month after my world came crashing down I completely revamped my application by doing each and every one of the things below, and applied again for the Peace Corps. My diligence and perseverance paid off: I was recently offered and have accepted an invitation to serve as a Peace Corps Education Volunteer in Ecuador departing in January 2016.\n\nTips for a successful Peace Corps application:\n\nRealize that YOUR RESUME IS EVERYTHING! The resume to a Peace Corps application is what an avocado is to guacamole – it doesn’t exist without it and a bad avocado will make you dump the batch. Know your skill set and shoot for posts you are qualified for. If you want to be a youth development volunteer but haven’t dealt with children since you were one yourself, maybe reconsider. Read the job description, required AND desired skills of the post(s) you are interested and tailor your resume to highlight the experience you have that would make you a great fit for these jobs. Your Peace Corps resume can and should be up to TWO pages and if you are a recent grad you can reach back to high school experience.\n\nGain RELEVANT EXPERIENCE! From the six sectors Peace Corps serves the qualifications vary greatly from one to the next. I was initially interested in Community Economic Development, but looking at the requirements I realized two years of business management experience wasn’t feasible in the next two semesters. A quick Google search revealed an English teaching opportunity close to campus that worked with my schedule and was exactly what the education sector was looking for. With that, combined with my study abroad experience and a few other work/volunteer opportunities, I had enough to qualify for the majority of education jobs. Don’t wait until senior to do that Google search, start as early as possible!\n\nBe FLEXIBLE! Fresh from a year studying abroad in Brazil, sand still between my toes, I was dying to get back to a land where the beautiful Portuguese language is spoken. Enter Mozambique – the only Portuguese-speaking country Peace Corps is currently serving. I had to learn the hard way that applying for one country is almost a guaranteed way NOT to get into Peace Corps. As you can imagine, 12 spots, hundreds of applicants, some of whose full-time teaching and Masters degrees trumped my volunteer undergrad experience. Do not limit yourself to a specific country or region – trust the process and take the leap. But remember: do not put anywhere if you really will not go anywhere. Be honest with yourself while keeping an open-mind.\n\nApply EARLY! Peace Corps’ new handy-dandy Apply-By Date can give the illusion that you have months, weeks, or days left to apply. This was a mistake I made the first time, applying 3 days before the deadline. The successful time around I was reviewed, interviewed, and invited an entire month before the apply-by date even arrived. Volunteer Openings are released on a quarterly basis. As soon as the postings come out, put your volunteer application in to give yourself the best chances of being seen.\n\nBe RESOURCEFUL! Admittedly, as an intern at the Peace Corps office I had consistent access to Return Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs) and their advice, but so can you! There are a multitude of outreach events across the country designed to give you a chance to get to know recruiters, and more importantly for them to get to know you. The RPCV community is over 200,000 strong – neighbors, coworkers, professors, etc. Talk to the people who have been in your situation before and the majority will be more than willing to offer support. You are not in this alone.\n\nLast, but certainly not least Be PERSISTENT! I expressed my interest to any and everyone I could at the Peace Corps office about how serious I was about my application. But be careful to not go over the edge into annoying and unprofessional – remember this is a job application process and should be treated as such. Once your application is sorted into a country, email the placement officer listed expressing your gratitude for being considered and reiterating your interest in the position. A direct message can only have a positive impact, distinguishing you in a sea of hundreds of resumes.\n\nSo these tips are the recipe for success right? Not exactly. An important thing to remember is that thanks to an application process reduced from 8 hours to 1 hour and a generation that values experience over compensation, Peace Corps is experiencing more qualified applicants now than there are positions available. Know that a rejection is not necessarily an indication that you are not qualified, but instead that the timing wasn’t right/there were too many applicants/your country choice was too narrow – there in fact could be a million different reasons why. And if all else fails – take it from me – try, try again!",

  "latent_29588": "Movie Review Movie Review Office Christmas Party C Movie Review Office Christmas Party C C Office Christmas Party Director Josh Gordon, Will Speck Runtime 105 minutes Rating R Cast Jason Bateman, T.J. Miller, Olivia Munn, Jennifer Aniston, Kate McKinnon, Courtney B. Vance, Karan Soni, Vanessa Bayer Availability Theaters everywhere December 9\n\nAssembling a whole comedy festival’s worth of very funny people isn’t a foolproof recipe for hilarity, but it should assure at least a decent number of laughs. Whether Office Christmas Party clears that very low bar depends on how generous you want to be—in this season of generosity—with the definition of “decent number” and “laughs.” Does smiling at the sight of Kate McKinnon in a bad Christmas sweater count as a laugh? Does Rob Corddry loudly telegraphing his disdain for the material deserve a pity chuckle? Is T.J. Miller giving a shout-out to Prince and David Bowie funny, or does it just provide mourning moviegoers a chance to test out that old theory about laughter being the best medicine? Directed and written by a bunch of comedy veterans with spotty resumes, Office Christmas Party counts on an overqualified cast and a literal (but unrelated) SNL premise to do the work for it. But it would take a Christmas miracle (or at least, you know, some effort) to make this yuletide ensemble look like something people will still be watching by next December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoolly goofball Clay (Miller) benevolently runs the Chicago branch of his deceased father’s company, ZenoTek. (They provide servers for other businesses—a detail that seems intentionally boring and incidental, until the movie for some reason pivots its third act around it.) After a bad quarter, Clay’s merciless sister Carol (Jennifer Aniston), who’s CEO of ZenoTek, demands major downsizing unless they can somehow turn things around in the final two days before Christmas. Determined to save his staff, Clay joins heads with newly divorced CTO Josh (Jason Bateman) and company tech wizard/designated Bateman love interest Tracey (Olivia Munn) to concoct a hair-brained scheme: They’ll ignore company protocol and throw a bitchin’ holiday bash, all to impress (and subsequently sign) a major client (Courtney B. Vance).\n\nStressed-out desk jockeys really cutting loose on company property isn’t a terrible comedic setup, even if it’s been trotted out countless times on countless network sitcoms. But Office Christmas Party can’t even be bothered to commit to its one-crazy-party premise, the kind from which last December’s Sisters got some modestly amusing mileage. Vance, who was so transfixing earlier this year as Johnnie Cochran on The People V. O.J. Simpson, seems to be having the most fun, his guest-of-honor character going from mannered stick-in-the-mud to coked-up wild man after a mishap with an artificial snow machine. But that farcical turn is about as outrageous as the movie dare goes. It settles instead for sight gags like a reindeer drinking from a toilet and instantly dated jokes about Game Of Thrones and the Fast & Furious series. This is a “bawdy” big-screen comedy any nervous HR representative could rubber stamp. In its own R-rated way, it’s safe for work.\n\nEventually abandoning the very shindig its title promises in favor of some sanitized mayhem on the streets of the Windy City, Office Christmas Party mostly offers its stars a chance to fumble through programmatic character arcs. Will Bateman’s heartsick nice guy get over his ruined marriage in time to woo Munn’s brainy dream girl? Will Aniston’s boss-from-hell locate some seasonal good spirit? Will office nerd Nate (Karan Soni, scoring a full supporting role after funny bit appearances in Deadpool and Ghostbusters) successfully convince his coworkers that the escort (Abbey Lee) he’s hired is really his date? Directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck, who previously paired Bateman and Aniston in 2010’s dire The Switch, provide some perfunctory Christmas-movie niceness to offset the naughtiness that never really arrives. You don’t have to be a Scrooge (or a heartless corporate bigwig) to wish everyone involved in this half-assed thing had worked a little harder in fourth quarter.",
  "latent_29714": "After just one year, some schools around the country are dropping out of the healthier new federal lunch program, complaining that so many students turned up their noses at meals packed with whole grains, fruits and vegetables that the cafeterias were losing money.\n\nFederal officials say they don't have exact numbers but have seen isolated reports of schools cutting ties with the $11 billion National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools for meals served and gives them access to lower-priced food.\n\nDistricts that rejected the program say the reimbursement was not enough to offset losses from students who began avoiding the lunch line and bringing food from home or, in some cases, going hungry.\n\nThe Lunch Express brings meals to kids in need in rural Tenn.\n\n\"Some of the stuff we had to offer, they wouldn't eat,\" said Catlin, Ill., Superintendent Gary Lewis, whose district saw a 10 to 12 percent drop in lunch sales, translating to $30,000 lost under the program last year.\n\n\"So you sit there and watch the kids, and you know they're hungry at the end of the day, and that led to some behavior and some lack of attentiveness.\"\n\nIn upstate New York, a few districts have quit the program, including the Schenectady-area Burnt Hills Ballston Lake system, whose five lunchrooms ended the year $100,000 in the red.\n\nNear Albany, Voorheesville Superintendent Teresa Thayer Snyder said her district lost $30,000 in the first three months. The program didn't even make it through the school year after students repeatedly complained about the small portions and apples and pears went from the tray to the trash untouched.\n\nDistricts that leave the program are free to develop their own guidelines. Voorheesville's chef began serving such dishes as salad topped with flank steak and crumbled cheese, pasta with chicken and mushrooms, and a panini with chicken, red peppers and cheese.\n\nIn Catlin, soups and fish sticks will return to the menu this year, and the hamburger lunch will come with yogurt and a banana - not one or the other, like last year.\n\nNationally, about 31 million students participated in the guidelines thattook effect last fall under the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.\n\nDr. Janey Thornton, deputy undersecretary for USDA's Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, which oversees the program, said she is aware of reports of districts quitting but is still optimistic about the program's long-term prospects.\n\n\"Many of these children have never seen or tasted some of the fruits and vegetables that are being served before, and it takes a while to adapt and learn,\" she said.\n\nThe agency had not determined how many districts have dropped out, Thornton said, cautioning that \"the numbers that have threatened to drop and the ones that actually have dropped are quite different.\"\n\nThe School Nutrition Association found that 1 percent of 521 district nutrition directors surveyed over the summer planned to drop out of the program in the 2013-14 school year and about 3 percent were considering the move.\n\nNot every district can afford to quit. The National School Lunch Program provides cash reimbursements for each meal served: about $2.50 to $3 for free and reduced-priced meals and about 30 cents for full-price meals. That takes the option of quitting off the table for schools with large numbers of poor youngsters.\n\nUSDA, First Lady makeover school lunches\n\nThe new guidelines set limits on calories and salt, phase in more whole grains and require that fruit and vegetables be served daily. A typical elementary school meal under the program consisted of whole-wheat cheese pizza, baked sweet potato fries, grape tomatoes with low-fat ranch dip, applesauce and 1 percent milk.\n\nIn December, the Agriculture Department, responding to complaints that kids weren't getting enough to eat, relaxed the 2-ounce-per-day limit on grains and meats while keeping the calorie limits.\n\nAt Wallace County High in Sharon Springs, Kan., football player Callahan Grund said the revision helped, but he and his friends still weren't thrilled by the calorie limits (750-850 for high school) when they had hours of calorie-burning practice after school. The idea of dropping the program has come up at board meetings, but the district is sticking with it for now.\n\n\"A lot of kids were resorting to going over to the convenience store across the block from school and kids were buying junk food,\" the 17-year-old said. \"It was kind of ironic that we're downsizing the amount of food to cut down on obesity but kids are going and getting junk food to fill that hunger.\"\n\nTo make the point, Grund and his schoolmates starred last year in a music video parodyof the pop hit \"We Are Young.\" Instead, they sang, \"We Are Hungry.\"\n\nIt was funny, but Grund's mother, Chrysanne Grund, said her anxiety was not.\n\n\"I was quite literally panicked about how we would get enough food in these kids during the day,\" she said, \"so we resorted to packing lunches most days.\"",

  "latent_29819": "WASHINGTON -- Israel and Hamas have agreed to a cease-fire in the week-old conflagration in Gaza that has left more than a hundred dead and many more wounded.\n\nThe halt in hostilities was announced during a Wednesday press conference in Cairo, Egypt, by the Egyptian foreign minister Mohammed Kamel Amr. He was joined by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has spent the past 18 hours engaged in a whirlwind tour of diplomacy in a hasty attempt to reach a peace deal.\n\nThe cease-fire is set to take effect at 9 p.m. Cairo time, or 2 p.m. EST. More than 140 Palestinians, and five Israelis, have been killed in the conflict, which was almost entirely conducted by airstrike, rocket and drone.\n\nEgyptian mediators told Reuters that Hamas believes it has won \"guarantees\" from the Israeli government to stop assassinating its leaders, and to ease the way for Palestinians to move across the borders of the Gaza Strip. Israelis say that if the rocket fire from Gaza does not stop, they hold the right to redouble their military strikes in the future.\n\nThe brokered deal appears to be a major diplomatic coup for the U.S. and for Egypt, whose role in the Middle East has been in question ever since a revolution led to the rise of an Islamist government more sympathetic to Hamas.\n\nFor the U.S., the resolution, at least temporarily, of the conflict marks a signature achievement in the early moments of President Barack Obama's second term.\n\nAfter appearing for several days to remain aloof from the crisis, pausing amid a tour of Asian nations only to offer words of support for Israel and its \"right to defend itself,\" Obama ended up devoting substantial time to numerous phone calls with both Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nObama later dispatched Clinton to the region, where she met with officials in Israel late Tuesday night before traveling to the West Bank and Cairo on Wednesday. Clinton had been traveling with Obama on the Asia tour, thought to be one of her last major foreign trips as secretary of state.\n\nAmerican officials consistently said they were seeking a \"de-escalation\" of the crisis, but in a briefing on Obama's final call with Netanyahu, they noted that Obama had \"recommended\" that Netanyahu accept the Egyptian proposal. The briefing offered the first open indication that the president had put pressure on his Israeli counterpart to accept a cease-fire.",

  "latent_30034": "Turkey on Friday lashed out at the United States after images surfaced apparently showing U.S. soldiers in Syria wearing the insignia of a Kurdish group opposed by Ankara.\n\nForeign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said during an international conference in southern Turkey that it was \"unacceptable\" for soldiers of a Turkish ally to use the patches of the YPG — the Kurdish People's Protection Units which are fighting the Islamic State group in northern Syria.\n\nHe said Turkey had relayed its displeasure to U.S. officials in Washington and in Turkey, and rejected explanations that the patches were for the soldier's protection.\n\n\"In that case, we would recommend they use the patches of Daesh, al-Nusra and al-Qaida when they go to other parts of Syria and of Boko Haram when they go to Africa,\" he said in reference to Jihadi extremist groups.\n\n\"To those who say they don't consider the YPG to be the same as these terrorist groups, this is our response: this is applying double standards, this is being two-faced,\" Cavusoglu added.\n\nTurkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdish Workers' Party, or PKK, an armed insurgent group which it has fought for decades and is considered a terror organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.\n\nTurkey is an ally in the U.S.-led coalition against IS but the two countries are at odds over the involvement of Kurdish fighters in northern Syria in the battle against the group.\n\nOn Thursday, Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said U.S. special forces have in the past \"worn insignias and other identifying marks with some of their partner forces.\"\n\n\"What I will say is that special operations forces when they operate in certain areas do what they can to, if you will, blend in with the community to enhance their own protection, their own security,\" he said.\n\nCook also faced a barrage of questions about whether or not the special operations forces were on the front lines, since in the past U.S. officials have stressed that American troops are not at the battlefront.\n\n\"We do have special operations forces in Syria,\" Cook said, adding that they are an \"advise and assist mission\" with forces that carry out the fight against IS and they \"are not at the front line.\"\n\nHe declined to provide any specifics about their location, but reports suggest they were in or near Fatisah, which was one of three villages that Syrian forces took back from Islamic State militants in recent days.\n\nSenior military officials said that it is difficult to tell where exactly the forces were, and how far from the fighting they were. They said the troops were moving with Syrian rebel forces as they headed toward Raqqa, and that it's possible they were closer to the front line of battle than they had been before. But they said there has been no change to the policy that the commandos will advise and assist but not fight on the front lines.\n\nThe officials were speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThere has been about 50 special operations forces in Syria doing the advising mission. But President Barack Obama has authorized the deployment of 250 more. Officials would not say exactly how many are currently in Syria, but said that all of the additional 250 have not arrived.\n\n___\n\nBaldor reported from Washington D.C.",
  "latent_30071": "There's a Sophocles quote about the perils of knowledge. \"How terrible is wisdom when it brings no profit to the wise,\" he wrote, with the generally grim outlook of a Greek tragedian.\n\nIt's a timely reminder — as you read through the business pages and pore over the blogs and scratch your head at Twitter's hot take du jour — to wonder where wisdom lies in this economic beat.\n\nWhat is 'On The Money'? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/armstrongcbc\">@armstrongcbc</a> tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cbchh\">@cbchh</a> what to expect on tonight's premiere <a href=\"https://t.co/080YzivglA\">https://t.co/080YzivglA</a> —@OnTheMoneyCBC\n\nThese are particularly murky times for our economy, when even the wisest among us are often flummoxed. Some of our best and most reliable economic indicators are awash in contradictions. Whether it's our GDP grinding along at meagre levels, or wildly volatile jobs figures or manufacturing data, the picture that emerges is foggy.\n\n\"The economy today is much more confusing than it used to be,\" says Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist with CIBC World Markets. \"We used to have a normal economic cycle where the economy goes up, inflation goes up, you raise interest rates, you go into a recession and then you cut interest rates and everything goes back to normal.\"\n\n\"Now we have a situation where it's not working,\" he says.\n\nPolicy-makers from Tokyo, Frankfurt and Washington have tried everything to spark a recovery. After traditional methods didn't work, they turned to modern-day central bank alchemy — everything from negative interest rates to quantitative easing. And still, eight years after the great recession, the global economy remains stuck in the mud.\n\nBenjamin Reitzes, senior economist at Bank of Montreal says the whole structure of our economy has changed.\n\n\"You had a period of 10 or so years when you had China integrating into the global economy and that created a persistent trend of increased trade that apparently made growth better pretty much everywhere (whether it made everyone better off or not is a separate point) but it improved GDP growth globally. And that trend is over now.\"\n\nOn the Money Today, CBC is launching a new economics and business program called On the Money. It's about you and your money and what's happening with our economy. We'll tell those stories, your stories and together, I hope we can get a better sense of the economic forces at play at home and around the world. I hope you can tune in. — Peter Armstrong\n\n\"What the new trend is,\" Reitzes says, \"that's difficult.\"\n\nTal says today's economy is much harder to predict. Our integrated modern economy means what's happening in China has a direct impact on mortgage rates here in Canada. \"And this link, this correlation is much larger than it used to be because of globalization.\" But Tal says that's only part of the picture.\n\n\"There is a growing gap when it comes to income distribution in Canada. This means that average numbers don't tell you anything any more,\" he says. \"Because you look at average GDP and average income and it doesn't really tell you the story. So you cannot look at average numbers and say 'Canada is doing OK' because within this number you have a huge gap between people who have a lot and people who don't have much.\"\n\nYou have a huge gap between people who have a lot and people who don't have much. - CIBC economist Benjamin Tal\n\nThe old models don't necessarily work any more. Tal points to one odd fact that stands out for him. Canada is the No. 1 country in the world in terms of education, but we are also the No. 1 country in terms of educated people who live in poverty.\n\nAll that, he says, adds to the difficulty in getting a good reading on what's happening. And yet, now more than ever, people are screaming for a better understanding of the global economy and the role Canada will play. Whether it's the success of books and movies like The Big Short or Thomas Piketty's blockbuster hit Capital in the Twenty-First Century, people are hungry for a sense of why the economy is acting this way and what will come next.\n\nThomas Piketty says economists need to look beyond the data to the broader story the economy is telling us.\n\n\"Economics 101 is obsolete in many ways,\" says Tal. \"The great recession changed a lot of things. That is why we are trying all kinds of things we never tried before: negative interest rates, quantitative easing and that's clearly confusing.\"\n\nPiketty himself says economics needs to look beyond the data to the broader story the economy is telling us.\n\n\"To put it bluntly,\" he says in his bestselling book, \"the discipline of economics has yet to get over its childish passion for mathematics and for purely theoretical and often highly ideological speculation, at the expense of historical research and collaboration with the other social sciences.\"\n\nAnd yet, even as the fog lies heavy over the economic horizon, economists like Reitzes, Tal and countless others are compiling the individual stories that make up the breathtaking amount of data we have at our disposal. They're parsing those experiences and threading them into one common narrative, hoping to better understand the economy at large.",

  "latent_30166": "Ultra-strong and self-healing copycat material graphene has been the subject of intense excitement since Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselo extracted it from bulk graphite in 2004, earning them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010. Now, an international team of physicists led by Novoselo has published a paper laying out a timeline of future uses for the incredibly versatile material, which includes its role in anticancer drugs and rollable e-paper. \"A roadmap for graphene\", published in the journal Nature, proves that the one atom-thin super-conductive material has plenty of future uses outside of electronics, though it will be an integral part of the imminent future development of devices. That's because the type of graphene needed for things like touchscreens is of a lower, more easily manufactured quality. \"Different applications require different grades of graphene and those which use the lowest grade will be the first to appear, probably as soon as in a few years,\" said Novoselov. \"Those which require the highest quality may well take decades.\" The latter includes applications like anticancer drugs (its minute size, strength, chemical durability and adaptability makes it an ideal conduit for drug delivery) and using graphene as a silicon replacement, which the paper envisions occurring around 2030.\n\nIn 2010 a paper was published suggesting that nano-graphene oxide sheets be used in medical imaging, as they are photoluminescent and thus useful in near-infrared imaging. According to Novoselov's timeline, this will become a reality around 2020 -- at about the same time we begin to see graphene in high speed wireless communication and security devices.\n\nIn the near future, we will see graphene being used as a replacement for indium tin oxide in touchscreen devices in the next three to five years, with flexible touchscreen \"rollable e-paper\" emerging by 2015 -- imagine folding up a browser and popping it in your pocket, and office printers becoming all but redundant. A team at Rice University has already begun trialling graphene touchscreens by growing a fine sheet of graphene onto a metal grid of nanowires, and Samsung has demonstrated similar prototypes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe paper also details the three main methods for extracting graphene. Liquid phase and thermal exfoliation will be suitable for batteries, supercapactiors, printed electronics, smart windows and electromagnetic shielding. The process basically gives us either graphene flakes or paints, with the latter ideal for easily adding strength or conductivity to a secondary material. Chemical vapour deposition is a process by which the material is grown onto copper foils, ideal for flexible touchscreens.

The material is so versatile, there will surely be plenty more uses we've not yet thought of.

Molly Shattuck, 47, pleaded not guilty in Sussex County Superior Court to two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors.\n\nShattuck first made contact with the boy in May after seeing his photos on Instagram, according to court affidavits obtained by NBC affiliate WBAL. In July, their meetings would include Shattuck picking up the teen from summer school and having physical contact in a parking garage, the affidavits said. The touching progressed into oral sex when the boy stayed at her vacation rental home in Bethany Beach over Labor Day weekend, WBAL reported. Also at the home were her children and their friends, and she allegedly bought alcohol with the boy that weekend.\n\nAn official at his school went to Baltimore County police after learning about the alleged relationship in late September. Investigators later executed a search warrant of Shattuck’s posh Baltimore home. She was indicted Monday and ordered to have no contact with minors, except her own children.\n\nShattuck is the estranged wife of Mayo Shattuck, a Baltimore businessman and the chairman of energy company Exelon Corp. She became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history — at age 38 — when the Ravens hired her in 2005. She retired as a part-time coach with the squad in 2013. She also appeared on an episode of the ABC reality show “Secret Millionaire” and wrote a healthy lifestyle book entitled, “Vibrant Living.”\n\nA judge allowed her released Wednesday on $84,000 bond.

No longer burdened by the flabby underbelly of the Michael Bay films and allowed free reign of the cult-classic cartoon, not to mention a slick cel-shaded art design, Platinum Games looks like it is having a field-day developing Transformers: Devastation. After seeing the footage in this latest gameplay trailer, critics could call it just another licensed cash-in, but I wouldn’t believe them.\n\nPlatinum Games has just the right balance between fun combat and simplistic level design, knowing where the strength of its studio lies: in pure action. Activision’s presser has more.\n\nLong-time Transformers fans know that every single robot-in-disguise has a very specific personality. Grimlock, for instance, probably wouldn’t be described as “neighborly” and Sideswipe isn’t always interested in playing by the rules, but both have a fondness for combat. Optimus Prime, on the other hand, would always prefer a diplomatic solution. Platinum Games, the developer behind Transformers: Devastation, spent a lot of time trying to match each character’s personality with a complementary fighting style. Bumblebee, for example, attacks faster than any other Autobot, but he sacrifices a fair amount of power. And Wheeljack’s mechanical ingenuity translates into an attack pattern that centers on ranged weapons.\n\nActivision also announced special skins for those who pre-order, gaining access to the characters Nemesis Prime, Red Alert and Goldfire. Three special weapons designed specifically for pre-ordering customers will also be available.\n\n• The Dark Star Saber is a fiercely intimidating blade that radiates waves of dark energy with every swing. • The Photon Disruptor is an incredibly powerful, shotgun-style weapon that has a short range but deals huge amounts of area damage. • The twin Golden Hunter is a pair of blaster pistols that causes enemies to drop credits when attacked.\n\nTransformers: Devastation launches on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC on Oct. 6.\n\nOrder This From Amazon",

I hope they win all of their wars, because that would be good for all of us.\n\nWhat's the ban\n\nA Dutch court has banned all trading of Samsung Galaxy S, Galaxy S II and Ace across most countries in Europe. Samsung's primary European distribution hub is in the Netherlands. Effectively, this will shut down most of their European distribution unless the company modifies its logistics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge thinks that Samsung has violated the method for swiping through a photo gallery. Samsung has already said that the photo browsing conflict can easily be solved with a modification, a statement that basically validates Apple. Why didn't Samsung implement this modification in their browsing photos system if they knew it was a copy of Apple's method from the beginning?\n\nBecause they are a cheap bag of lazy, unimaginative bastards, that's why. And that makes us mad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue invention vs lazy mothers\n\nWhen he introduced the iPhone, Steve Jobs said they had patented the hell out of it, and rightly so. I'm sure that, of those patents, there are a lot that could be challenged in court. But there are many others, like the ones above, that can't be challenged because Apple actually invented them from scratch. Something like unlocking the screen by dragging an unlock image may seem trivial to you, but someone had to come up with the idea in the first place. And, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of little things like that that Apple put into the first iPhone that nobody thought about first.\n\nAnd those little things, that whole set of ideas and methods, is one of the reasons why the iPhone was a raging success. Love them or hate them, by inventing all these codes Apple implemented a new language that has quickly become embedded into our minds and lives. It's so good, so intuitive and natural, that we all have adopted it without even thinking about it. That includes Apple's rivals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose rivals, like Google, Samsung, or HTC, just said \"oh fuck this, let's all do the same\" and came up with devices that are mostly copies of what Apple put out in their first iPhone. Sure, they added some stuff of their own and sure, Apple's user interface has some aspects that are not original. But mostly the iPhone's competitors are clones that show no imagination, no better ways to do things.\n\nWe need new, better things\n\nBecause yes, there are better ways to do things. Or at least different ways. You only have to come up with them. Look no further than Microsoft Windows Phone 7. The vilified Redmond company actually had the imagination and the balls to make something different. And, in that process, they actually came up with better ideas than Apple's.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's good for everyone. It introduces diversity, new methods, evolution. That, as someone who loves brilliant technology, excites me. You should be excited too. And you should hope that Apple wins all these patent wars against the lame and lazy.

  "latent_30847": "The primaries in West Virginia last night ended with victories for Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Even though Hillary Clinton leads with a pretty much insurmountable margin, Sanders’s recent victories show that he still has strong support from voters, and he has pledged to not give up until the nomination is officially decided.\n\nThis means Clinton has to divide her focus between winning the Democratic nomination on the one hand, and on the other, defeating Donald Trump in the general election. For Trump, it was an easy win in both West Virginia and Nebraska last night–winning more than 75 and 60 percent of the vote respectively. His success comes despite rumors that Ted Cruz might get back into the race if the results turned in his favor. Which they didn’t.\n\nHere’s a recap of what went on last night:\n\nIn West Virginia, Sanders won almost every demographic. One big reason is concern about the economy and the state’s large population of working class households and coal workers. Some argue that Clinton alienated coal workers in March when she commented that her climate policies would put many coal miners out of business.\n\nEven though Sanders won big last night, he now needs more delegates than remain in the coming elections to have a chance to beat Clinton in pledged delegates alone. Otherwise, he will need to win two-thirds of the remaining pledged delegates and also win over some superdelegates.\n\nAbout three-quarters of Democrats in West Virginia said they did not want the next president to continue Obama’s policies, and four in 10 want less liberal policies, two groups that did not favor Clinton.\n\nTrump’s victories do not mean everything is under control for the GOP. Polls show concern from Republican voters–with 58 percent of voters in West Virginia feeling that the party is divided but will be able to unify later on, while only half of the voters in Nebraska believed that it will be able to do so.\n\nNext up is the Kentucky primary for the Democrats and the Oregon primary for both parties, which will take place on May 17.",

One of the executive orders called for “the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border” as well as the provision of additional resources to help the Department of Homeland Security thwart illegal immigration.\n\nThe second one focuses on “enhancing public safety in the interior of the United States,” which penalizes jurisdictions and municipalities within the United States that choose not to cooperate with the federal government in tackling illegal immigration.\n\nLopez Obrador also called upon his supporters to “fight for liberty” in opposing Trump’s executive orders.\n\n“Go and fight for liberty, represent our people with dignity and all human beings who dream of a just world,” he insisted. “Defend the migrant Mexican workers!

  "latent_30996": "Posted By: Madame Fleur\n\nOct. 21, 2008\n\nGOP efforts to disenfranchise voters are nationwide, but as battles over registration lists sweep the nation, in Montana the state GOP has received a decisive blow to its underhanded efforts to steer the election in favor of McCain.\n\nSeveral weeks ago in The Treasure State, a state Republican official challenged nearly 6,000 voters over apparent discrepancies in their addresses.\n\nThe GOP asked that county election officials make certain voters prove their current address when they attempt to vote. According to then-GOP Executive Director, Jake Eaton, who resigned last week, the voters were selected from counties where Republicans found the greatest discrepancies in voter addresses when comparing data from the statewide voter database with the National Change of Address database. According to Eaton, the case was filed in response to a joke made by Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer in July about tampering with the results of the 2006 U.S. Senate election.\n\nState Democrats went to court to block the challenges, charging that the move was a blatant attempt to suppress Democrat voter turnout: the case primarily targeted voters in six traditionally Democratic-leaning counties.\n\nThe Republican antics lost favor even within their own party when further investigation revealed that among the voters in question was a member of the Army Reserve about to deploy to Kuwait , and an 86-year-old World War II hero.\n\nAddress discrepancies of this sort are also not critical to ensuring accurate voter counts. There’s no electoral college among counties in Montana. It doesn’t affect the election’s outcome whether a person votes in the precinct where they live, or the one that they recently moved from.\n\nRepublicans were all but forced to drop their case last week after a federal judge determined that Republicans filed the case \"with the express intent to disenfranchise voters.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Donald Molloy of Missoula did not rule on the case, but made his assessment of the Republican tactics clear, saying \"[t]he timing of these challenges is so transparent that it defies common sense to believe the purpose is anything but political chicanery.\"\n\nAs mentioned above, Montana’s GOP Executive Director resigned last week - just three weeks before the election – no doubt because this partisan debacle sparked such anger and failed so publicly. One hopes that similar tactics to undermine the democratic process are discouraged by the example set in Montana. Ohio, Wisconsin and Alabama take note: Americans will settle for nothing less than an honest, fair election in 2008.",

  "latent_31246": "Rod Wise September 15, 2014 at 5:20 pm\n\nHere we go again.\n\nOnce more the metaphorical cry of “Boots and Saddles” echoes across Australia, as we gear up for another military plunge into the cesspit that is Iraq, as though engaging in armed conflict in a country in which we have no strategic interest was as superficial as a script from a John Ford western.\n\nThis time, we are told, it is to liquidate a “death cult” that epitomises evil. Last time it was to cauterise “weapons of mass destruction” that epitomised evil. Last time, many thousands of deaths later, the supposed reason why we invaded Iraq proved to be at best a fallacy, at worst a downright lie. What will the next “months and months”, in the words of Tony Abbott, show about the world threat posed by ISIS/ISIL? Time will tell. But, unfortunately, more Australian lives may be lost in the telling.\n\nHowever, there are a few observations that seem to this writer to be essential if this latest adventure is to be seen in any truthful context.\n\nFIRST. The geniuses who orchestrated the 2003 invasion, Bush Junior, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Blair, Howard and the rest of them, have been remarkably silent about these recent developments. And that’s hardly surprisingly, when one considers that those behind the latest flap would argue that they are cementing the legacy of 2003. Evidenced by Abbott claiming that our new involvement is at the request of the Prime Minister of Iraq. (Sounds awfully similar to the claims of the Menzies-Holt government that our involvement in the Vietnam quagmire was at the request of the South Vietnamese government.) Perhaps, with the wisdom of hindsight, those geniuses concede, by their silence, that this latest flap is serving only to confirm how ephemeral and fantastic was their supposed legacy of 2003, a democratic Iraq.\n\nSECOND. Surely, the experience of the years since 2003, with daily news footage of beheadings and suicide bombings, would have told our esteemed leaders that the concept of a democratic Iraq, as we understand it, is ludicrous. That only fools rush in where angels fear to tread, as the old saying goes. The racial antagonisms and the medieval religious obsessions which criss-cross that patch on the map ought to have alerted our leaders by now that throwing your weight around, just because you can, is no substitute for a thoughtful policy that is realistic given the peculiar circumstances that apply in the target country. While Obama may be circumspect in how far he goes this time, he is still reacting to US domestic pressure above all else, and does anyone seriously believe that the Republican blowhard who will inevitably follow him in the White House in 2016, will exercise a similar restraint? Are we doomed, then, to relive all the other failed adventures that have characterised US foreign policy since the collapse of the Soviet Union went to their heads? Like Somalia? Like Afghanistan? Like Libya? Like Syria? Etc, etc.\n\nTHREE. The mutually antagonistic mosaic that lies within the arbitrary, cartographic lines that define the boundaries of Iraq ought to daunt any sensible Western policy-maker. While the ultimate enemy, Iran, may be Shi’ite, its people are Persians. Their allies (and our “friends”) in Iraq, the Shi’ite majority, are Arabs. The so-called “Sunni” opposition are both Sunni and Arab. Their “enemies”, the Kurds, are also Sunnis. The north-eastern Kurds, who we are now arming, are part of a wider Kurdistan, that includes great swathes of Turkey and Iran. And we wonder why Turkey won’t come to the party in the fight against ISIS/ISIL when, you can stake London to a brick, that much of the munitions sent to Erbil, will end up in south-eastern Turkey. Iraq is a dog’s breakfast. Especially when you throw in a further element, the Christian minority, which is currently under attack by the Sunni ISIS/ISIL forces although it was once a pillar of the Sunni-dominated Saddam Hussein regime that was overthrown in 2003 by the “Coalition of the Willing”. Iraq was always a can of worms from which the 2003 invasion ripped the lid. That is the real legacy of the Coalition of the Willing.\n\nFOUR. To repeat the point, only fools rush in where angels fear to tread. While the Americans have consistently shown themselves to be over-reaching fools, the real tragedy of the past two decades has been the poor role played by the British. As the power which constructed “Iraq” in the aftermath of the First World War, they, more than any other power, would understand the realities that underpinned balance-of-power diplomacy. After all, they held most of the world in thrall to their influence for a century with an army that could fit into a phone box. But rather than exercise any restraint on the Americans, as the Germans tried to do in 2003, they have consistently refused to be out of step with US foreign policy, apologising for its instinctive adventurism, for no visible return whatsoever. Such is the lingering legacy of their failed Suez expedition in 1956. Such is the true decline of a once-great power.\n\nFIVE. And now our turn. How timely is Australia’s enthusiastic embrace of this latest Iraqi adventure, coming so soon after Abbott’s “tough talk” bombast over Putin and Ukraine. It is so empty and so transparently tailored to Australian domestic considerations, like everything that Abbott does and has ever done, that it is sad to see the Australian media buying the line so readily. The dismal performance of David Irvine, the head of ASIO, in failing to convince us that there is a genuine threat to Australia from returning Jihadists (none of whom is said to have been in ISIS/ISIL), should raise in any sceptical mind, the question about what exactly are we paying for with this elaborate and expensive security apparatus that has been imposed on us. And now we have a new terrorist threat level? Higher, even, than after the Bali bombing? And they won’t tell us exactly why? But coming at a time when the Abbott government is floundering and desperately needs to work out some deal with the Palmer United Party well away from the constant glare of publicity? Don’t make me laugh. What we are actually paying for is protection of the Abbott government. The same government which claimed a budget “crisis” to justify its attacks on the Australian standard of living but which, it seems, can find any amount of money to further its own interests and survival.\n\nFROM ROD WISE, ARMIDALE",

Note: Please continue to fill out the important medical information on the back of your number.\n\nWhy the changes?\n\nAt the 2014 TCS New York City Marathon, a letter system made corrals easier to locate.\n\nThe medical tag is an extra safety precaution designed to protect runners.\n\nBag Check\n\nYour race number includes a bag-check tag that you'll remove and pin to the clear bag provided for bag check. Bags are sorted by race number.\n\nWhy the change?\n\nThe adhesive stickers we used for bag check in the past tended to fall off in cold or wet weather.\n\nBest Pace\n\nWe use a new formula—one that's used at many other races across the country—to predict your pace and make your corral assignment. The formula converts race paces to a 10K race pace. If you haven't finished a race in the last 12 months, we use your most recent race in the past two years. If you haven't finished a race in that time period, you'll input your expected pace.\n\nPlease note that your pace is based on your single best pace (converted to a 10K; see chart), not an average of your race paces over the 12-month period.\n\nWhy the change?\n\nResponding to runner feedback, we are using a formula that more accurately predicts finish times and thus ensures that runners line up in the proper corral. This makes races more enjoyable for everyone.

  "latent_31826": "Daylife/Getty Images used by permission\n\nFor many Germans, deployment in Afghanistan meant delivering aid and reconstruction to the country’s relatively peaceful north. But now the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. And Germany seems to have found itself unwillingly dragged into a war.\n\nBerlin has just changed the rules of military engagement for troops abroad, giving soldiers more leeway to use lethal force. This is seen as important in northern Afghanistan, where attacks by Taliban insurgents are becoming more frequent…\n\nIn a joint action with Afghan forces, 300 German soldiers used heavy firepower for the first time in a bid to flush out Taliban insurgents who are moving into the region.\n\nBack home, meanwhile, Chancellor Angela Merkel last month awarded four soldiers the Bundeswehr’s new cross of honour.\n\nIt was the first time since the end of World War II that Germany had awarded medals for bravery – a remarkable change in attitude considering post-war Germany’s traditional wariness of military symbols.\n\nBut although the German government looks set to get tough on the battlefield, popular opinion is heading in the opposite direction…\n\n“The war is so unpopular that politicians won’t even call it a war,” said Alan Posener, political correspondent for the German daily newspaper Die Welt.\n\n“We are now using armoured personnel carriers and light tanks to fight the Taliban. But politicians are saying, no, it’s not a war, it’s a peace mission. If they didn’t say that, they would get flayed alive by their voters.”\n\nRTFA. It’s longish – and not conclusive. It could be four times as long – to wander through the complexities of German history and politics.\n\nThis generation has more than enough reason to be contemptuous of warhawk politicians. They live every day with the heritage of their grandparents who voted “Yes” to shock and awe. But, a significant chunk of the 9/11 terror plot was drafted in Germany. Just because Al Qaeda felt safe enough to attack America from Hanover isn’t reason enough to expect neutrality to be respected by religious maniacs. Next month or the month after may be their turn.\n\nThere are alternatives to exclusively military solutions just as there are dynamic changes in analyzing how to fight a war in the 21st Century. The Germans have the right – and responsibility – to choose how they proceed with any of this. Without “leadership” from American and British politicians.",
  "latent_31849": "As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, and by now you might have seen dramatic images of passengers on stranded icebreaker Akademik Shokalskiy being rescued by helicopter last Friday after becoming lodged in Antarctica sea ice on Christmas Eve.\n\nAnother type of picture – the graph – plays a major role in science. No one could look at the graph below, which shows the extent of arctic ice during the past 1,450 years, without realising that the polar ice cap has been melting at a rapid and wholly unprecedented rate over the past few decades.\n\nSkeptical Science\n\nSimilarly, my own research has shown that if people are shown a graph with global temperatures during the past few decades, they invariably understand and predict that further warming is in stock – this is true even for the few people (less than 10% in my sample) who denied that climate change is taking place.\n\nGraphs and pictures are powerful scientific analysis and communication tools.\n\nThe power of graphs and pictures, and the anecdotes they can evoke, are also powerful means by which people can be misled, inadvertently or otherwise.\n\nIt is well known that the national newspaper, The Australian, has a track record of distortion and misrepresentation when it comes to climate reporting, so it is informative to examine what role pictures, or the anecdotes they evoke, often play in their reporting.\n\nThe recent adventures of the Australian expedition to Antarctica are a case in point. Under the headline Stuck on a ship of (cold) fools, the newspaper opined:\n\nYou have to feel a touch of sympathy for the global warming scientists, journalists and other hangers-on aboard the Russian ship stuck in impenetrable ice in Antarctica, the mission they so confidently embarked on to establish solid evidence of melting ice caps resulting from climate change embarrassingly abandoned because the ice is, in fact, so impossibly thick. The aim of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, led by Chris Turney of the University of NSW, was to prove the East Antarctic ice sheet is melting. Its website spoke alarmingly of “an increasing body of evidence” showing “melting and collapse from ocean warming”. Instead, rescue ships and a helicopter, all belching substantial carbon emissions, have had to be mobilised to pluck those aboard the icebreaker MV Akademik Schokalskiy from their plight, stuck in what appears to be, ironically, record amounts of ice for this time of year.\n\nAn ice breaker gets stuck in ice – we’ve all seen the pictures – and somehow this is an embarrassment to “global warming scientists”.\n\nActually, no.\n\nIf one goes to the expedition’s website, their first three scientific goals (there are nine altogether) are as follows:\n\ngain new insights into the circulation of the Southern Ocean and its impact on the global carbon cycle explore changes in ocean circulation caused by the growth of extensive fast ice and its impact on life in Commonwealth Bay use the subantarctic islands as thermometers of climatic change by using trees, peats and lakes to explore the past\n\nI have highlighted the important bit: the growth of extensive fast ice. So what is “extensive fast ice”? It is a form of sea ice, and it is obviously sea ice in which the expedition is now stuck.\n\nIn other words, the expedition is experiencing the very conditions it set out to study — namely the various kinds of sea ice that scientists know are increasing around Antarctica, while the icecaps on Antarctica are known to melt.\n\nHow much is Antarctica melting? The graph below shows us.\n\nShepherd A et al (2012). 'A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance.' Science, 338 6111:1183-9\n\nThere is a solid body of evidence that Antarctica is melting (a consequence of global warming) whereas sea ice around Antarctica is increasing. The reasons underlying those seemingly opposing trends make for some fascinating science.\n\nA fascination with science, alas, is not always apparent in the pages of The Australian.\n\nTheir idolatry of pictures, on the other hand, cannot be overlooked.\n\nIf it is not icebreakers, then it is a picture of a bronzed Aussie swimmer in his budgie smugglers under the headline Wong wipeout doesn’t wash with locals. This heroic 53-year-old had been swimming at Bondi beach for 30 years and “was adamant he had seen ‘no change’ to the coastline”, thereby presumably putting yet another final nail (approximately the 156th) into the coffin of global warming and sea level rise.\n\nA great picture, perhaps, and Bondi’s swimmers are entitled to their opinions. The actual data, meanwhile, paint another picture about global sea level rise: a steady increase in mean sea level over the past two decades.\n\nNerem R S et al (2010). 'Estimating Mean Sea Level Change from the TOPEX and Jason Altimeter Missions.' Marine Geodesy 33, no. 1 supp 1: 435.\n\nPictures are powerful.\n\nPictures are worth more than a thousand words.\n\nPictures and graphs can inform when they present scientific data. But equally, pictures can mislead when they evoke irrelevant anecdotes instead of the reality that is described by scientific data.",
  "latent_31894": "Jesse Nolte once had a federal firearms license so he could legally sell guns. As a younger man, he competed in cowboy action shooting contests – shooting pistol, rifle, and shotgun in quick succession – which he calls “lots of fun.”\n\nBut Friday may be a highlight of his gun-carrying career.\n\nThe Pittsburgh native was awaiting President Trump’s speech here at the 2017 NRA Annual Meetings and Exhibits in downtown Atlanta – the first time a sitting president has addressed the chief gun lobby since President Ronald Reagan in 1983.\n\nWith Mr. Trump already rolling back Obama-era gun regulations, Mr. Nolte says the National Rifle Association has gone from playing defense to offense. “They’re flying high,” he says.\n\nAs for himself, however, he says this may be his last convention.\n\nHe's in part looking for a break from a lifetime of focusing on guns. But most important, Nolte says he is for the first time confronting a paradox brought into focus by last year's election: Many of his own beliefs about gun safety don’t jibe with the NRA’s “go for broke” political strategy. He, for example, would support expanded background checks, as well as limits on people with mental illnesses purchasing weapons.\n\nMost of all, he says, he doesn't like the idea of being “fleeced” by the organization’s fund-raising, some $30 million of which went into backing Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nThe hesitation of people like Nolte, gun policy experts say, underscores the fact that American gun owners are not always in lock step with the NRA. In fact, one new poll shows that a majority of gun owners do not support some of the gun lobby’s more aggressive positions, including legalizing silencers and getting rid of gun-free zones around schools.\n\n“The NRA talks about broadening its base and spreading guns more broadly into society, so [Trump’s speech] would seem like a great marketing and political opportunity,” says Bob Spitzer, a political science professor and gun culture expert at the State University of New York, Cortland. “But I would put big question marks around this idea of normalization and diversification of gun culture. Yes, that is the NRA’s goal and drive: to press as many guns into as many hands as possible. But if you look at the long-term change, it’s not clear that they’re really being successful in terms of actually increasing the percentage of nontraditional gun owners carrying and using guns.”\n\nNevertheless, as perhaps 80,000 Americans descend on Atlanta, Trump is headlining the conference at a time of unprecedented success for the gun lobby and its political capital.\n\nConcealed-carry permits have gone from 2 million to 15 million in the past two decades. The Pew Research Center last year found an uptick since 2014 in people who self-report gun ownership.\n\nGeorgia is part of this shift toward more permissive gun rights, primarily in states that vote (or can swing) Republican. Here, NRA members now can legally carry in churches, bars, and even at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the world’s busiest tarmac.\n\nTrump already has unraveled some Obama-era regulations on guns. He backs making it easier to buy silencers, and has put his support behind an NRA-backed bill that would federalize concealed-carry rules, something now handled individually by states.\n\nAnd Trump's appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court is seen by NRA supporters as a boon for new constitutional reviews of gun measures.\n\nAt the same time, there is also evidence that the appeal of guns has broadened beyond Republican men. For example, 58 percent of Americans say gun ownership does more to protect people from crime than put people at risk.\n\nThe Liberal Gun Club, an educational and social group, reports a 10 percent increase in membership since Trump’s election. Democratic candidate Rob Quist in Montana has crafted a number of advertisements featuring guns. As many as one out of four people who identify as Democrats own guns, according to recent surveys.\n\n“You know who decides what normal is?” NRA broadcaster Colion Noir said recently, in support of making it easier to buy silencers. “The people with the loudest voice.” Mr. Noir, who is African-American, represents what many see as a new breed of gun owners.\n\nYet the average NRA member still looks a lot like the average Trump voter – a lot like Mike Fitz, in fact.\n\nMr. Fitz, a white gun owner and retired firefighter from New York, says, “We’re still mostly older white guys who have lived long enough to realize that cops aren’t going to be there when you most need them, but your gun is.”\n\nBut perhaps the biggest challenge for an emboldened NRA is that most Americans – even gun owners like Nolte and Fitz – aren't necessarily in lockstep with what are perceived by many as extreme measures, including ending gun-free zones, such as around schools. Perhaps in reflection of that, sponsors called the silencer bill “The Hearing Protection Act.”\n\nA poll released this week by Americans for Responsible Solutions, which promotes greater gun safety, suggests that the NRA is out of step with gun owners on issues ranging from silencers to gun-free zones. For example, 88 percent of gun owners surveyed support requiring people who want to carry concealed firearms to obtain a permit, and only 24 percent wanted silencers deregulated.\n\nAnother study found that of the 90 percent of Trump supporters who prioritize gun rights, 74 percent also favor expanded background checks – something the NRA has fought against.\n\nAs for the gun-buying boom? Without a Democrat in the White House – which gunmakers and shop owners used to spur sales – Americans are buying fewer guns, meaning gun manufacturers are scaling back production.\n\nAt the same time, fully half of Americans live in states that have enacted major gun regulations in Obama era. That gives incentive to the NRA to keep fighting, says Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the UCLA School of Law.\n\n“No, we are not at peak gun,” says Mr. Winkler, author of “Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.” “The courts have yet to address the biggest issues in gun politics today – the right to carry outside your house, what kind of permits can be placed on such activity, and whether bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines are constitutional.”\n\nAt the Georgia World Congress Center, gun enthusiasts could find the latest tactical gear, see concerts by country music stars, and people-watch for celebrities.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nFor many gun owners, the annual NRA trek “is like church, a pilgrimage,” says Nolte. And despite his own misgivings, he expects the voices of Americans with guns on their hips to remain influential.\n\n“The NRA plays the long game,” he says. “They know that even Trump could turn on you.”",

I grew up being told of a world on the rise — a world fated for justice. I saw graphs of shrinking global poverty, and of the rise of peaceful democracy. I cheered for Obama and made calls for Senator Bennet. Hope and change were more than promises to me. They were destiny.\n\nAnd then I grew up.\n\nI watched the Arab Spring fail. I watched hundreds of thousands of lives ruined in the aftermath of imperialism.\n\nI watched the economy crash. I watched friends move away and bankers walk free.\n\nI watched Rachel attempt suicide. I watched my friend struggle with the shackles of a hateful “family” for the crime of being different.\n\nI watched my older peers march on Wall Street. I watched promises of unity and reform crumble into brutality and roundups.\n\nI watched my home city burn. I watched two fires destroy hundreds of homes, and hundreds of lives. I watched climate change wreak havoc, while politicians looked the other way.\n\nI watched old women beaten and bloodied for blocking pipelines. I watched the police serve and protect corporations, and disregard human life.\n\nI watched the number of starving children increase. I watched the wealthiest country on earth fail to feed 16 million kids.\n\nI watched my friend hang himself. I watched a “world class” university work him to death.\n\nI watched Trump win the Presidency. I watched a celebrity whose chief characteristic is incompetence show the true face of the Reagan-Clinton legacy.\n\nI watched dead fish coat the shores of Ha Tinh, Vietnam. I watched a community thousands of miles away ruined by corporate greed.\n\nI watched Trump pull out of the climate agreement. I watched the United States commit another crime against humanity. I watched him destroy our future.\n\nI watched my own university defend white supremacists and promote their organizations. I watched cries of free speech drown out the wailing of the oppressed.\n\nI watched Heather Heyer die. I watched hundreds rally in defense of leftists, only to see them shunned a week later.\n\nI watched the tax bill pass. I watched my last hopes for a stable future evaporate. I watched the hopes of the most depressed, indebted, and exploited generation in recent memory fall to dust.\n\nI watched as the dream of progress became the nightmare of reality.\n\nTo be completely honest, I am utterly exhausted. I am so tired of begging for scraps, of protesting for basic decency. The false hopes of my youth did nothing to prepare me for an adulthood of sobering misery. And while I may be incredibly fortunate, even I am not immune to the soul sucking capitalist horror we have inherited.\n\nVive La Commune!\n\nThis legislation will make the rich richer and the poor poorer, in an era already marked by unprecedented inequity. It will add trillions to the deficit, and kill thousands. It will cripple the United States, and strip the already destitute young of what little wealth they have. This legislation is violence. It has no basis in morality, nor any shred of dignity. It will build a world in the image of unregulated capitalism — it will be the tyranny of the invisible hand.\n\nMy only hope arises from our desperation. My generation has the most awareness, the most humanity, and the least to lose, of any generation. If there is to be a revolution, if there is to be progress, we will stand at the forefront. But as I have said before, we will not be motivated by the ideals of our youth, nor by the shadows of “hope and change.” The shattered promise of progress will inspire rage, not reconciliation.\n\nThose in power should be afraid. In the passage of this tax bill, they have shed their last pretense of dignity and humanity. And they will pay for these crimes.\n\nWe are living a life after progress.

  "latent_32343": "Catalans will cast their vote for a new regional assembly on Sunday (25 November) in an election that could have considerable consequences for Catalonia and the rest of Spain.\n\nCatalan separatist parties wishing to split from Spain are set to win most of the seats in the Catalan Parliament and current Catalan President Artur Mas is expected to continue on his post. His centre-right alliance party Convergència i Unió (CiU) will most likely regain majority ahead of the left-wing independentist Esquerra party, but short of the absolute majority they had hoped for.\n\nThe election campaign has been ugly with Mas accusing the conservative Partido Popular government in Madrid of standing behind a personal smear campaign and of scaremongering to dissuade Catalans from voting for CiU.\n\nMadrid, on the other hand, has said the Catalan government is unjustly blaming Madrid for Catalonia's economic woes.\n\nA recent convert to independence, Mas called for early elections last September after Barcelona and Madrid failed to reach agreement on a new fiscal pact. The Catalan government wanted the right to collect and decide on the region’s own taxes instead of passing them on to Madrid, as it currently does.\n\nSpanish President Mariano Rajoy opposed the move. This prompted Mas to state that the Catalans would be better off creating “a state of their own”. If the new Catalan Parliament, as expected, has pro-separatist parliamentarians making up two thirds of its ranks, this will pave the way for a referendum on the independence of Catalonia – despite strong resistance from Madrid.\n\nOne of Spain’s 17 regions, Catalonia is responsible for a fifth of the Spanish economy, which in turn is the 4th largest economy in the eurozone. European capitals will therefore also take note of the Catalan election results as Rajoy is trying to avoid a bailout from Europe despite a severe recession in Spain.\n\nCatalans have long complained that despite the Catalan region being one of the biggest contributors to the Spanish budget, they get much less back in funding for services and public works. The deficit lies at around €15 billion, according to the Catalan government. The north eastern region is also a heavily indebted region.\n\nThey also complain that the rest of Spain does not respect their different Catalan identity and language. Catalans were outraged two years ago when the Spanish Constitutional Court eliminated some aspects of their autonomy in an updated regional statute despite it being approved by the Spanish Parliament four years before.\n\nThe worsening economic situation and the high unemployment numbers in Spain has only amplified the separatist feeling in Catalonia. This came to a climax on Catalan national day on 11 September this year when more than one million of Catalonia’s 7.5 million citizens took to the streets of Barcelona to call for independence.\n\nMeanwhile, an eventual referendum on Catalonian independence would raise many awkward questions in Brussels - not least whether the would-be independent region would have to re-apply for EU membership.",
