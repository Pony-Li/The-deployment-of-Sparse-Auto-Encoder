  "latent_37": "ISLAMABAD: A lawmaker from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has demanded action against non-state actors, especially Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, BBC Urdu reported.\n\nDuring a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs held Thursday, PML-N lawmaker Rana Muhammad Afzal asked, “Which eggs is Hafiz Saeed laying for us that we are nurturing him?\"\n\nHe also said, “The efficacy of our foreign policy speaks for itself when we couldn’t curtail Hafiz Saeed.”\n\n“India has built such a case against us about the JuD chief that during the meeting on Kashmir, foreign delegates mention him [Hafiz Saeed] as the bone of contention between Pakistan and India,” he maintained.\n\nRana recalled a recent trip to France, where he had been tasked to explain the worsening situation in Kashmir, and said that the name of Hafiz Saeed was brought up time and again by foreign delegates.\n\nThe lawmaker said that although he had rarely heard about Hafiz Saeed during his 25 years in politics, Saeed was considered a notorious character in international circles. He asked whether Hafiz Saeed was good or bad for the Kashmir cause.\n\nRana said that although the government's stance on Kashmir is correct, banned outfits were a source of embarrassment for the country.\n\nIt was reported in Dawn newspaper on Thursday that state policy on non-state actors was discussed in a high-level security meeting between civilian and military leadership.\n\nIn an unprecedented warning, the civilian government has informed the military leadership of a growing international isolation of Pakistan and sought consensus on several key actions by the state.\n\nDuring the meeting it was decided that military-led intelligence agencies are not to interfere if law enforcement acts against militant groups that are banned or until now considered off-limits for civilian action.\n\nIn an email to DawnNews, Afzal denied seeking any action against Hafiz Saeed.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged to have said that: “His [Hafiz Saeed] optics give India an opportunity to blackmail Pakistan internationally. If he is of no benefit to Pakistan, then why are we allowing his optics to affect loss to Pakistan?”\n\nForeign Secretary Aizaz Chaudhry summarised the results of the recent diplomatic outreach by Pakistan, the crux being that Pakistan faces diplomatic isolation and that the government’s talking points have been met with indifference in major world capitals.\n\nIn response to Foreign Secretary Chaudhry’s conclusions, Gen Akhtar asked what steps could be taken to prevent the drift towards isolation. Chaudhry’s reply was direct and emphatic: the principal international demands are for action against Masood Azhar and the Jaish-i-Mohmmad; Hafiz Saeed and the Lashkar-i-Taiba; and the Haqqani network.\n\nTo that, Gen Akhtar offered that the government should arrest whomever it deems necessary, though it is unclear whether he was referring to particular individuals or members of banned groups generally. At that point came the stunning and unexpectedly bold intervention by Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif.",

  "latent_141": "Israeli Collaborators, Provocateur Rocketeers and Cynical Ceasefires\n\nJoe Quinn\n\nSott.net\n\nDid anyone else notice that the ‘ceasefire’ in Gaza sort of came out of the blue? Pundits put this down to ‘war weariness’ on both sides, but the precise timeline of events leading up to the ceasefire has me a little perplexed.\n\nOn Monday, 18th August, a 72-hour ceasefire was declared as part of the talks in Cairo. The following day, Tuesday, the Israeli delegation left at 4 pm, precisely the time when the IDF would later say that Hamas had fired rockets at Beersheba, thereby “breaking the ceasefire”.\n\nIsrael used the opportunity to attack the house of the al-Dalou family where alleged Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif was believed to be. Deif, who is said to be partially paralyzed and wheel-chair bound (as a result of 5 previous attempts on his life by Israel), apparently wasn’t there, or so Hamas claim (althoughIsrael claims he was), so only his wife, his 3-year-old daughter Sara and baby son were murdered when the IDF dropped five 1-ton bombs on the building. Two days later, on Thursday, the IDF claimed that they had killed three Hamas officials in a multiple missile strike in Rafah in Southern Gaza.\n\nHamas was clearly rattled. The next day, Friday 22nd, Hamas executed 18 individuals that they claimed were “Israeli collaborators” and a ‘rocket’ landed in a Kibbutz on the Gaza border, killing four-year-old Daniel Tregerman, the first and only Israeli child casualty. The collaborators were reportedly executed for “following and monitoring leaderships, finding targets to hit the resistance – such as rocket launching pads and tunnels – monitoring the movements of leaders, delivering information on resistance members who have been targeted, providing detailed descriptions of the houses of a number of resistance members that have been destroyed during the war, determining civil and military sites and targets through GPS devices, collecting phone numbers of resistance members and getting devices and equipment from Israel for spying purposes.”\n\nIn 2013, Al-Monitor’s Adnan Abu Amer wrote:\n\n“No official statistics from Palestine or Israel have been issued, nor have any exact numbers been provided. Some estimates say there could be fewer than 10,000 “undercover agents [in Gaza].”\n\nThe connection between the breaking of the ceasefire, the killing of Hamas officials and the execution of collaborators is clear. But what is most interesting is the fact that Hamas appears to have had no intention of breaking the ceasefire at that time, had not ordered the firing of rockets, and were unaware that any were about to be fired. On the other hand, the Israelis were expecting the ceasefire to be broken by ‘Hamas rocket fire’, at a very precise time, which allowed them to be confident that Deif would be in the house and vulnerable because he was not expecting an attack during a ceasefire, which he had no reason to believe would be broken. But someone did fire rockets just a short time before the Israeli attack on the Deif house and it’s likely that that same ‘someone’ also gave Israel the precise location of the house where Deif was believed to be (and may well have been).\n\nIn a Haaretz article on August 20th, senior correspondent and columnist Amir Oren made some cryptic but very interesting remarks about the targeting of Deif:\n\nIt doesn’t matter if Hamas fired the rockets that hit the Negev Tuesday evening, or knew who fired them […] if Hamas’ version of the sequence of events is true, it seems that Israel was hoping to seize a rare opportunity to strike Deif […] [Israel] needed only two conditions: the breaking of the ceasefire by Palestinians which would give Israel the pretext to attack […] and the involvement of other groups, aside from Hamas, in the fire.\n\nOren goes on to say:\n\nIn the past, more than 30 years ago, there were Israeli military and diplomatic officials who were not averse to staging an incident in order to have an excuse to respond to it, with a pre-planned operation.\n\nWith his reference to “staging an incident” in relation to Hamas ‘breaking the ceasefire’, Oren appears to be suggesting that the ‘Hamas rocket fire’ that ‘broke the ceasefire’ last week was a ‘staged incident’ in order to justify the pre-planned operation to target Deif when he least expected it.Oren’s suggestion was echoed, in a more direct way, by former Israeli attorney general under both Rabin and Netanyahu, Michael Ben Yair, when he posted the following on his Facebook page:\n\nThere is no ceasefire [agreement]. There are only renewed acts of hatred. Who’s at fault? Good question – Hamas which wants a deal more or Israel which faked a violation in order to assassinate Mohammed Deif.\n\nAgain we see a direct reference by a respected Israeli to Israel ‘staging a provocation’. Over the past seven weeks, the only ‘provocations’ cited by Israel as justification for its continued bombardment of Gaza were ‘Hamas rockets’. It makes you wonder about those alleged 10,000 Israeli collaborators inside Palestine and if the activities of some of them involve more than merely snitching to Israel on the location of Palestinians and tagging Palestinian homes with high-tech ‘beacons’.\n\nAmir Oren’s comment that “more than 30 years ago, there were Israeli military and diplomatic officials who were not averse to staging an incident” is also interesting in that it places the idea of what is essentially Israeli ‘false flag’ operations in a long-term historical context.\n\n‘More than 30 years ago’ was the early 1980s and there are several “terror attacks” against Israel or involving Israel that might fit the bill. For example, the car bombing of the Israel military headquarters in then occupied Tyre, Lebanon, in November 1982 during Israel’s first Lebanon war, an attack that the Israeli government has, ever since, insisted was a “gas cylinder explosion”. There was also the June 1982 attempted assassination by members of the Abu Nidal gang of then Israeli ambassador to the UK, Shlomo Argov, that was used by Israel as justification for the aforementioned 1982 Lebanon war. Abu Nidal is widely believed to have been an Israeli agent, a psychopathic ‘hired gun’ who could be relied on to carry out attacks against both Israeli and Western targets and members of other Palestinian groups in order to undermine and discredit the Palestinian cause.\n\nJust for the record, the true Palestinian cause, like all other true Arab (etc.) liberation movements of the 20th century, is based on resistance to Western imperialism and the promotion of progressive secularism. This was the ideological basis for all genuine and popular Arab political groups in the 1950s and ’60s. Since then however, Western imperialists and the state of Israel have consistently sought to prevent the emergence of Arab democracies and, instead, promoted the most reactionary and extremist elements. As a result, they have successfully replaced the original, normal human ideals with the bastardized, grotesque image and ‘ideals’ of the modern “Muslim terrorist” which is nothing more than the projection onto Arabs of the inner nature of the Western and Israeli psychopathic elite. ISIS/IS is the culmination of this long term projection process and is the literal brainchild of Washington and Tel Aviv.\n\nGetting back to our timeline; the day after the attack on Deif, a Hamas official living in Turkey, Saleh al-Arouri, made the surprising claim that Hamas was responsible for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teens in June, the event that was initially used by Israel to kick start the attack on Gaza, an event which, as I have explained, bears all the hallmarks of the work of agents of the state of Israel itself. Strangely, Arouri added that Hamas in Gaza “did not have the intention at this time to ignite a large battle“, in which case, we have to wonder who did have the intention to force a large battle on Hamas in Gaza? Hamas in Gaza has consistently denied that they knew anything about the murder of the teens, and the Israelis apparently believe them. Nevertheless, Arouri’s ‘admission’ was responded to by Israel with the murder of three Hamas officials in a house in Rafah in the south of Gaza the next day.\n\nThe following day, Friday 22nd, Daniel Tregerman, a 4-year-old Israeli boy was killed when a ‘rocket’ hit a Kibbutz near the Gaza border. Three more days of sporadic ‘rocket fire’ and Israeli missile strikes on Gaza ensued before a sudden permanent ceasefire was announced on Tuesday 26th. This was certainly a strange time for the Israelis to ‘give in’; after all, their rationale for the bombardment of Gaza was to ‘prevent rocket fire into Israel’ and yet, within a few days of the very first child casualty from that same rocket fire, they call an end to the punitive campaign?\n\nUp to that point, just three people had been killed by rocket fire from Gaza, a rabbi, a bedouin and a Thai worker, so from the Israeli point of view, before the death of the 4-year-old, just one Israeli Jew had been killed by rocket fire. My point being, if the aim of Operation Protective Edge was to ‘stop rocket fire’ and protect the lives of Israelis, then the job was certainly not complete; in fact, given that the death of a child is generally viewed as more egregious than that of an adult, the death of Daniel Tregerman put the entire operation back to ‘square one’. Yet a definitive ceasefire was agreed just 4 days later.\n\nBy most accounts, Hamas emerged the ‘victor’, receiving two of its four demands (relating to the lifting of the economic blockade of Gaza) and the other two (an airport and seaport for Gaza) to be discussed in one month’s time. For its part, Israel reduced Gaza’s 1.8 million population by about 2,000, killed a few Hamas officials, and secured the status quo, the status quo being more or less the situation before the 7-week bombardment of Gaza. As I have mentioned previously, Israel’s real goal in launching operationProtective Edge was to stall the establishment of a Fatah/Hamas unity government and facilitate the continued expropriation of Palestinian land. Today, Israel announced the biggest annexation of West Bank land in 30 years. With the swipe of a pen, 400 hectares of Palestine became part of Israel. The justification? The killing of the three teens in June.\n\nThe false image of Palestinians as ‘terrorists’ who want to ‘destroy Israel’ is promoted by Israel as a bulwark against the emergence of a genuine movement for Palestinian rights that can be accepted internationally. To perpetuate the idea that Paestinian = terrorist, Israel has to launch periodic ‘anti-terrorist’ operations against the Palestinian people. When such operations are politically expedient, Israel manufactures a ‘provocation’ to justify the operation. On this occasion, the provocation was the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teens by agents of the state of Israel. While the operation was ongoing, provocations in the form of rockets fired by agents of the state of Israel inside Gaza were used.",
  "latent_212": "One day in October, Randy Stearns walked out to a Florida campfire, dressed in a fringed leather top like a modern-day Davy Crockett. “Hello, friends, Randy the Tiger Man,” the animal trainer greeted the camera, which was set between a teepee and totem pole out in the woods near his family’s Dade City zoo.\n\n“You can’t believe a damn thing you see on the news,” the 34-year-old declared in the filmed fireside chat posted on Facebook. “Just look at me. I’m the newest Charlie Sheen. Every time you go on, there’s something on about us, the park…”\n\nThen Stearns took aim at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)—a constant topic in The Tiger Man’s online videos. “Kind of like Rambo, they drew first blood,” Stearns said. “We had to go out there, defend ourselves.”\n\nJust two months before, the wannabe Jack Hanna stood guard at the zoo’s gates with a holstered weapon, joining supporters flaunting neon “PETA Kills” T-shirts. They were protesting, and allegedly delaying, a court-ordered inspection of the private, unaccredited zoo’s collection of adult and baby tigers.\n\nStearns and his parents run Dade City’s Wild Things (DCWT), a 22-acre zoo about 44 miles northeast of Tampa. The attraction has more than 300 animals: jaguars, lions, bears, lemurs, macaques, porcupines, bearded dragons, and other reptiles.\n\nBut it’s known for baby tigers, deployed for photo-ops and swim sessions in the zoo’s chlorinated pool. In years past, the cubs appeared on Good Morning America and Fox & Friends for the seemingly adorable gimmick.\n\nYet behind the footage, there’s allegedly a darker side to the tiger business, according to animal-welfare advocates—one that prematurely rips cubs away from their mothers and forces them into stressful encounters with humans for profit.\n\nAccording to PETA, Dade City’s Wild Things is contributing to a captive tiger overpopulation crisis by continually breeding them for photo-ops and ticket sales. Once cubs grow too large for customer interactions, they’re left to languish for the rest of their days in cages, or sold off to other roadside attractions and collectors of exotic animals, PETA says.\n\nThe big cats are at the center of separate lawsuits brought by PETA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which respectively allege the zoo violated the Endangered Species Act and the Animal Welfare Act over its handling of the tigers.\n\nThe zoo also faces a state lawsuit for allegedly accepting donations while not registered as a nonprofit. Florida’s Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services claims the zoo used hundreds of thousands in charity funds to foot the bills for Randy Stearns’ nuptials and the bankruptcy payments of his mother, Kathy.\n\nMeanwhile, Randy Stearns is battling criminal charges in Missouri, where he’s accused of exposing himself to five girls at a hotel in June 2016. Stearns, who was in town for a conference, allegedly exposed his genitals to one victim as she left an elevator and headed to her room, an indictment states.\n\nStearns followed the girl and flashed her through the zipper of his pants, the indictment states. A spokeswoman for the St. Charles County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office said Stearns pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include six counts of sexual misconduct involving a child less than 15 years of age.\n\nHis next court appearance is Jan. 2, records show. Stearns’ defense attorney declined to comment on the charges.\n\nWhen reached by The Daily Beast, DCWT declined to comment on any of the three lawsuits targeting the zoo, or on Randy Stearns’ pending criminal charges. “Our attorney has advised us to not talk about it,” one staffer said over the phone. Emails left for Kathy Stearns and Randy Stearns were not returned. The family’s attorney, William Cook, declined to comment.\n\nStill, DCWT hasn’t been shy in social-media posts. In one August Facebook video (titled “Daily Update : Truth”), Kenneth Stearns boasts about making “PETA kills” signs, which he vowed to post at other zoos and along the highways.\n\n“Them five terrorists that come in here, yeah, their pictures is gonna be on there, too… we’ll make ’em famous,” said Stearns, apparently referring to a showdown between the zoo and PETA inspectors the week before.\n\n“That’s what they do to us, ain’t it? You know, they don’t know this is a two-way street, y’all. Everything they do to us, we gonna do to them, except we gonna do legal stuff,” continues the 58-year-old Stearns.\n\n“God’s going to take care of us. He always does, always has and always will this time,” he said. “Don’t mean it’s easy.”\n\nPETA requested, and a judge granted, a site inspection to observe the tigers and the zoo’s treatment of them, saying the visit by a team of experts was “necessary and permissible” because the animals’ “behavior and physical condition are central to the claims at issue in this lawsuit.”\n\nBut the animal park shipped off about two dozen tigers in the weeks before an inspection could be conducted.\n\nWhen that court-ordered site visit came due in early August, the Stearns family and 20 supporters kept federal marshals at the zoo gates for 30 minutes, the Tampa Bay Times reported.\n\nKenneth and Randy Stearns were armed, “touching their holsters and posturing, following us every step of the way,” Jenni James, counsel for the PETA Foundation, told the Times.\n\nJames told The Daily Beast that protesters blocked the driveway and heckled and hurled epithets at PETA’s inspectors. Kenneth Stearns fumbled with his holster and leaned against one of the smallest tiger enclosures to block photographs, James said.\n\n“ They know they ain’t got nothing. With no tigers, how they gonna prove tiger abuse? You know? There ain’t no abuse. ” — Kenneth Stearns, in a Facebook video\n\nOne supporter even mocked the empty cages, yelling, “Get some shots of the tigers, guys. Oh, wait. There’s none here.”\n\nThe zoo posted video from the inspection on YouTube, under the heading, “Terrorist Group PETA violating a court order during an inspection #1.” (In response to the title, James said, “I don’t know what laws they think we broke frankly.”)\n\nDays after the inspection, Kenneth Stearns told fans in a Facebook video, “They know they ain’t got nothing. With no tigers, how they gonna prove tiger abuse? You know? There ain’t no abuse.”\n\nCops accompanied PETA because Kathy Stearns stopped them from conducting a prior inspection on July 20. When the inspection team arrived, they found a crude homemade wooden sign at the front gate that said, “Closed due to PETA terrorist death threat.”\n\nIndeed, seemingly to avoid the survey, Kathy Stearns and her hubby, Kenneth, shipped 19 tigers to Oklahoma in a livestock trailer without air conditioning, according to the PETA lawsuit. In affidavits, witnesses claimed the tigers, some of which were pregnant, didn’t have food or water. Three baby tigers were born and died during the 18-hour, 1,200-mile journey, PETA says.\n\nThe Stearns clan transported their big cats—quickly and without regard to the animals’ safety—in a bid to defy PETA and the federal judge who had scheduled an inspection of the tigers at the facility, PETA alleges.\n\nWhen one white tiger arrived at The Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma, it was so thirsty it began drinking out of a dirty puddle, a Facebook video showed. Joe Maldonado, president of the Wynnewood park and a Libertarian candidate for governor, posted Facebook Live videos of the tigers, the burial of the cubs, and staffers administering anesthesia by sticking poles through holes in the trailer.\n\nIn the footage, a Wynnewood staffer zoomed in on the dead tigers and said, “Kathy, all I can say is, I’m sorry dear, couldn’t get to ’em on time.” At another point in the video, the man says, “Somebody had some problems, had to get rid of all their tigers.”\n\nFour other cats were sent to Endangered Animal Rescue Sanctuary (EARS) in Citra, Florida, about 84 miles north of Dade City.\n\nThe sanctuary’s owner, Gail Bowen, said DCWT delivered two white tigers named Remington and Luna on July 13. Kenneth Stearns transported the animals in a fifth-wheel trailer, Bowen said in an affidavit in PETA’s case.\n\nStearns told Bowen he’d eventually collect the tigers and mentioned signing a contract, but no such document was provided, the affidavit says.\n\nTwo days later, Stearns appeared at EARS with a pair of orange tigers, Rory and Rajah, in the same vehicle. Behind them was another trailer with the 19 tigers, who “were all without water and appeared very hot,” Bowen said.\n\n“I was profusely sweating just standing in [the] shade… because it was hot as blazes,” Bowen said, adding that she hosed down the tigers and gave them water to drink. According to Bowen, Stearns’ crew was in a hurry and left after 20 minutes.\n\nBowen caught up with Kathy and Kenneth Stearns on Aug. 2. During the meeting, Kathy Stearns told Bowen that PETA had sued her, and that she moved the tigers because she wanted to get them out before an inspection occurred, according to the affidavit.\n\nKathy Stearns then allegedly informed Bowen that she wanted the white tigers back so she could breed them. “She said that she was looking to get them back in about one year,” Bowen said in the affidavit.“I do not believe DCWT should breed tigers to simply exploit tiger cubs in public encounters, and I did not tell either Kathy or Kenny Stearns that I would agree to return the two white tigers to DCWT,” Bowen concluded.\n\nMeanwhile, Deborah Warrick, the founder of the nonprofit St. Augustine Wild Reserve, said an associate of Kathy Stearns contacted her to see if she’d accept two 7-year-old brother tigers from the Dade City zoo. In an affidavit in PETA’s case, Warrick said she spoke to Stearns on July 14 and asked how many cats needed a home. Stearns, according to Warrick, was evasive but said “a lot.” Warwick built a new enclosure for the brothers and awaited their arrival, only to discover they’d instead gone to EARS. She called Bowen, the owner of EARS and a personal friend.\n\nBowen cried and told Warrick that she was “very disturbed” by DCWT’s decision to transport 19 tigers to Oklahoma in a cattle trailer, Warrick said.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Bowen said Kenneth Stearns was among the crew transporting the tigers, which were foaming at the mouth and urinating on each other in the trailer.\n\nA 24th tiger, a baby named Shiva who grew too big for public swims, was sent to another Florida zoo called Hernando Primate, James said. William Cook, an attorney for Kathy Stearns, told PETA counsel in a July 19 email that Shiva “has grown too large for swims and she has been placed since DCWT is done with her.”\n\nPETA has argued DCWT should be held in contempt for violating the court order for an inspection.\n\n“The tigers are the evidence in our lawsuit, and the evidence is gone,” James said.\n\nFighting Tooth and Claw\n\nIn the 2012 Good Morning America segment, reporter Matt Gutman hopped into the water to take a dip with Tony the Tiger.\n\nThe 6-week-old cat hissed and paddled away from Gutman, then climbed on top of him, apparently in an attempt to escape. ABC anchor Amy Robach joked in a voiceover that Tony “doesn’t look like he wants to be in the pool,” and Lara Spencer chimed in, “That wasn’t a happy growl.”\n\nRandy Stearns joined Gutman in the pool with an older, calmer 30-pound cat named Tarzan. In the backdrop, Tony was pushed back into the water after climbing to land.\n\nTony the Tiger was featured in another 2012 video by Barcroft TV, swimming alongside a 5-year-old girl wearing water wings. “He has a pretty good temperament, he loves attention, he’s been raised around people,” Randy Stearns said in the video.\n\n“I would love having my own baby tiger to swim with,” the girl said, in a clip that’s spilling over with cuteness.\n\nThe family-friendly publicity is a far cry from the zoo’s current affairs, with the three ongoing lawsuits and the criminal case against Randy Stearns.\n\nLast month, the 19 Dade City tigers secretly shipped to Oklahoma were placed at a 720-acre wildlife sanctuary outside Boulder, Colorado.\n\nA federal judge approved an agreement between PETA and the Wynnewood zoo to send the cats to The Wild Animal Sanctuary, where about 84 tigers roam free after being rescued from roadside zoos or surrendered by their owners.\n\nAmerica’s captive tigers outnumber their wild, endangered counterparts. Experts estimate as many as 10,000 captive tigers are in the United States alone.\n\nAccording to PETA’s lawsuit, the wild tiger population is at an all-time low, with just 3,200 of the apex predators in the world today.\n\nBut big cat sanctuaries “are bursting at the seams with tigers rescued from unaccredited zoos and private owners,” the complaint states.\n\n“DCWT plays a large role in the captive-tiger overpopulation crisis as one of a relatively few exhibitors who are breeding cubs for public encounters and fueling the overpopulation problem,” PETA said in court papers.\n\nThe zoo sells “many of the tiger cubs it regularly breeds to other exhibitors for use in public encounters and to so-called ‘backyard breeders,’” the complaint alleges, adding that Kathy Stearns has a waitlist for tiger cubs, and that the cats can go for $4,000 each.\n\nPETA filed its federal lawsuit in October 2016, alleging that the cub swimming program at Dade City’s Wild Things violates the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe suit came after a PETA probe in 2015 and 2016, when an eyewitness worked and volunteered at the zoo to document what the group claims is abusive handling of distressed and sickly animals.\n\nPhotograph and video footage reveal the zoo’s true stripes as a tiger cub breeding mill, PETA claims. One clip shows Ariel, a cub who couldn’t hold her head straight and appeared to suffer from a spinal deformity or neurological disease. According to PETA, the tiger was forced to swim repeatedly and for a 10-minute stretch where she struggled to keep her head above the water. Other footage showed two cubs being taken from their mother hours after they were born. A dead newborn was left on the ground before eventually being bagged and tossed in the trash, PETA claims.\n\nIn response to the 2016 lawsuit, DCWT filed a counterclaim one month later, alleging fraud and tortious interference with business and contractual relationships over the “undercover” job.\n\nPETA’s lawsuit alleges that DCWT’s practices violate federal law by distressing the tigers, causing them pain and discomfort, and risking illness and injury.\n\nDCWT trainers often begin introducing the cubs for public play sessions when they are less than 4 weeks old, and the zoo utilized at least one cub when she was only 2 weeks old, the complaint states.\n\nThe zoo charges $39.99 for a 10-minute group encounter with baby tigers. During these sessions, as many as two dozen visitors are permitted to pet, play with, hold, or kiss the cubs.\n\nGuests who prefer one-on-one sessions pay $299 per couple. The tiger swims are $300 per person or $1,000 for a family of four. According to the zoo’s website, the 30-minute encounters are in and out of the pool.\n\nThese encounters stop when the cubs are about 6 months old. “To ensure a constant supply of cubs for use in its lucrative public encounters, [the zoo] breeds and purchases tiger cubs,” the lawsuit states.\n\nPETA has also accused DCWT of obtaining a one-week-old white tiger from an Oklahoma facility and leaving the mother behind. And the zoo separated at least three cubs from their mothers within days of birth in order to ship them to for-profit ventures, including an Ohio amusement park, court papers allege.\n\nPrematurely separating the cubs from their mothers causes psychological and physical injuries, and stops them from engaging in species-typical behaviors, the lawsuit says. (In the wild, tiger cubs are not weaned until approximately six months old and remain with their mothers for nearly two years, PETA says.)\n\nCubs open their eyes for the first time six to 12 days after birth, and they have difficulty thermoregulating until they are several weeks old, the suit states. Mother’s milk is crucial, because it has antibodies cubs’ immune systems lack; cubs don’t make their own antibodies until they’re 8 weeks old.\n\nThe Association of Zoos and Aquariums advises against hand-rearing tiger cubs, stating that it should only be done in emergencies, such as “when parent-rearing is not possible due to maternal neglect or health reasons.”\n\nPETA’s lawsuit says studies suggest that forcing animals to interact with audiences—as the Dade City zoo’s cubs do almost daily—causes them greater distress than if they were simply on display.\n\nIn July 2015, the USDA filed a lawsuit against the zoo over the same swim program, saying it violated the Animal Welfare Act.\n\nIn February of this year, a judge ruled that the swims violated regulations stating that young animals “shall not be exposed to rough or excessive public handling or exhibited for periods of time which would be detrimental to their health or well-being.”\n\nThe judge ordered the zoo to cease and desist the program, and leveled a $21,000 civil penalty and 60-day suspension of its exhibitor’s license. DCWT appealed this ruling, saying the swims are “beneficial to both tigers and people.” (A decision is pending.)\n\nKathy Stearns developed the swim program with veterinarians “over several years as part of its tiger training program as a means to acclimate captive bred tigers to the presence of humans and to build a greater bond with the public in the animal world,” zoo attorney William Cook wrote in court papers.\n\nStearns claims to limit the swims to three per day and says the cubs don’t swim for more than a few minutes total. She said trainers check the tigers each morning, and that they’re checked again before swims, the appeal states.\n\n“You can’t make it swim. I mean, it’s going to do what it’s going to do. It’s never going to follow your pattern,” Stearns testified at a hearing held in June 2016.\n\nBut the PETA lawsuit claims that, despite previous USDA citations, the zoo continued to prevent distressed cubs from leaving the swimming pool by dragging them on leashes, grabbing their tails, pulling them by the feet, and holding the skin of their necks.\n\n“DCWT often schedules back-to-back encounters, forcing the tiger cubs to interact with numerous people over the course of a day,” the complaint alleges.\n\nIn a single day, zoo staff allegedly used the same tiger cub in at least two private encounters, two or more group encounters, and swim sessions with 17 guests, the lawsuit says.\n\nDuring these encounters, the tigers often cry, growl, attempt to break free, and use body postures experts recognize as stress, court papers state.\n\nPETA says witnesses saw staff restraining one desperate cub by pulling its leash and holding onto the base of its tail. The worker repeatedly pushed the cub down as it tried to climb on her to escape the pool, the complaint alleges.\n\nIn another session, an employee allegedly voiced concern that the same cub was getting too tired to play, but the tiger was kept in the pool and was panting audibly.\n\nOn a third occasion, Kathy Stearns tossed a flotation device into the water for a cub to play with, but the tiger swam away. When the animal escaped the pool, Kathy told a worker to “just dump [the cub’s] ass in the water,” the lawsuit says.\n\nPETA claims employees press the cubs to the ground by their sides or collars so guests can pet them during private and group encounters. Staff was also allegedly instructed to pinch their ears and noses to keep them in line.\n\n“They begin a lifetime of cruelty for these animals,” PETA attorney Jenni James told The Daily Beast. “They’re taken days or hours after their birth, manhandled by humans, then put in a pool from which they cannot escape.\n\n“When they get too large, they’re discarded to cages. If they’re female, they’re forced into breeding for more tiger cubs,” she said.\n\nPETA has asked a federal judge to hold DCWT in contempt for shipping its tigers to Oklahoma, and has asked for a default judgment in its favor.\n\n“The Stearns family acts like they’re above the law, but it’s catching up to them,” James said.\n\nMoney Trail\n\nIn October, the state of Florida also sued the Stearns, claiming they collected donations for their menagerie but instead used them for personal expenses including Randy Stearns’ wedding and Kathy Stearns’ bankruptcy.\n\nThe Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services says that Kathy and Kenneth Stearns registered Stearns Zoological Rescue and Rehab Center as a nonprofit in 2007. The firm’s registration expired in July 2016.\n\nWhen Stearns Zoological attempted to register in February 2017, the agency asked for additional documents. The nonprofit withdrew its application one month later.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Stearns Zoological was fined $500 for soliciting donations in September 2016 without being registered with the department. The company was also ordered to cease and desist from seeking contributions.\n\nDespite the order, Stearns Zoological continued to seek cash through Dade City’s Wild Things, which was never registered as a charitable organization. (Stearns Zoological was tax exempt until May 2013, when the IRS revoked its status for failure to file a form 990 for three consecutive years, the lawsuit says.)\n\nDCWT continued to solicit donations on its website, which falsely stated donations were tax-deductible, until at least March 2017.\n\n“We receive no state or federal funding. We survive strictly on the generosity of animal lovers like yourself who understand the importance of providing for these animals,” the website said regarding its Endangered Species Conservation Fund.\n\nStill, an analysis showed that $211,659 from the nonprofit’s coffers was transferred to an account for the family’s peat business, from March 2016 to February 2017.\n\nKathy Stearns filed for personal bankruptcy in 2013 and was required to make monthly payments to a trustee. In February 2016, her bankruptcy case was dismissed for delinquency in payments. One month later, she filed a motion to reconsider the dismissal.\n\nDays later, $17,500 was transferred to the turf business from DCWT, court papers allege. On the same day, a cashier’s check was drawn from the peat company and made to the bankruptcy trustee. Soon after, a second cashier’s check for $6,693 was made to the trustee from the same account.\n\n“Non-profit funds were intentionally transferred to the [turf account] so that they could be used to pay the delinquent personal bankruptcy payments of Kathryn Stearns,” the state of Florida said in court papers.\n\nIn the meantime, Randy Stearns got hitched at Dade City’s Wild Things in March 2016. Nearly $10,000 of the nonprofit’s money went to the wedding, the lawsuit claims. The peat account listed a number of wedding expenses, including $3,229 total for catering, $1,544 for floral arrangements, and $1,492 for photography.\n\n“Despite Kathryn Stearns’ claims to the contrary, Defendants have held Stearns Zoological and DCWT out to the public as a not-for-profit entity and as a charity,” the complaint states.\n\nIn a Sept. 12, 2017, video posted on DCWT’s Facebook page, Kathy Stearns continued soliciting donations. She discussed the zoo’s financial problems and pleaded, “I really need you guys to step it up a little bit. A dollar even helps please.”\n\nIt’s not the first time Kathy Stearns has faced trouble from Florida agencies.\n\nIn August 2011, she pled no contest to obtaining property or services using worthless checks. State law prohibits charities from allowing any of its officers or employees who plead guilty or no contest in the last 10 years to any crime involving fraud, theft, larceny, and the like to solicit contributions.\n\nWhen Stearns Zoological filed an application for nonprofit registration with the state in December 2011, Kathy Stearns falsely stated no such plea existed, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe department became aware of the plea in May 2012. Three months later, the agency canceled Stearns Zoological’s registration and ordered the firm to cease and desist from collecting donations in the state of Florida.\n\nIn October 2012, the zoo filed a new application stating Kathy Stearns would not handle contributions. The request was eventually granted, after the nonprofit said Stearns would not have access to the funds.\n\nDespite this, Kathy Stearns has continuously been involved in the solicitation of contributions and has had access to said funds, the complaint states.\n\nIndeed, she’s listed as an authorized signer on the nonprofit’s accounts, and she’s the primary person for withdrawing funds, signing checks, or otherwise handling the donations, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe department has asked a judge to order the Stearns to pay fines, and to permanently ban them from soliciting donations in Florida.\n\nIn court papers, the Stearns family denied their business account received their nonprofit’s funds. “Soliciting contributions and depositing contributions into an account is not wrongful conduct,” their lawyer wrote in court papers. The attorney declined to comment.\n\nBut the show has gone on at Dade City’s Wild Things. Kathy Stearns introduced her newest baby tiger, Noah, on Facebook last month, writing that he was available for encounters starting Nov. 28.\n\nNoah was featured at “Pasta with a Purpose,” an event scheduled for Oct. 7 and that originally was billed as a benefit for DCWT with a silent auction and raffle. DCWT postponed the dinner, which was listed in the state’s lawsuit.\n\nA Dec. 16 dinner for DCWT was $25 per ticket but didn’t mention a charitable affair. “Thank you for your patience on our reschedule date,” DCWT wrote on its Facebook event page. “We have been waiting for our newest arrival ‘Noah’ to make sure he was available for the Pasta Dinner.”\n\nThe next day, supporters posted photos of the event, including one of a woman bottle-feeding Noah in a little cage strewn with toys.\n\nOne attendee wrote, “We had a great time and we’ll see you at the next fundraiser! ....and I am quite sure before that, too!”",
  "latent_232": "1. We're here at QCon London 2010 and I'm sitting here with Dan Ingalls. Dan, why don't you explain to us what you've been doing for the last 40 years? It's a long story, but if we go back to the period that I talked about in my talk, from 40 years it began with my first experience in programming and then becoming associated with Alan Kay in the work on Smalltalk. That kept us busy, productive and entertained for really a couple of decades. There was a period when I left the industry for about 10 years to run a family business, but then I came back and that was the time when I did Squeak with some other people. That grew out of the fact that it seemed to me that when I came back software had not changed much, but the computers were much faster and allowed us to do a lot of things, it was really sort of a better time for Smalltalk. Then I retired for a brief period then came back to work at Sun and at that point, things were happening on web that I wanted to play with and spent a while wondering why that was so complicated and got the idea for the Lively Kernel and that's kept me busy pretty much since that time.\n\n2. Let's start out with the first period - the Smalltalk period at Xerox PARC. What was Smalltalk-72 like? It's a very different language than the language we find in Squeak. It's based on message passing, is that true? Smalltalk-72 I think of as the coolest scripting system that ever was. What it is, it's a programming model where in the code you have access to essentially the token stream of the code that called you. If you look at some of the original compiler compiler work, in current compiler works, you are essentially looking at the incoming token stream. If you allow that to happen in a program, it allows the program to parse on the fly, which is a mistake in normal programming, but what it allowed us to do is to play with different syntaxes for what we wanted to do and to actually choose to have message oriented semantics in the language. We put together the system Smalltalk-72, which could have just been something like Logo, except that it was powerful enough to talk about messages and we had the opportunity to develop a style for an extensible language, one with classes and instances and a style for message sending, as the model for processing. It actually was used productively for 4 years. We did several iterations of a curriculum for a school with children to find out if that was teachable. Then we had pretty creative people in the group working also on graphics and music, which we also used the system to describe. We got a lot of experience with how we wanted the object oriented style to work.\n\n3. The fact that in Smalltalk-72 you were parsing essentially the token stream, this reminds me a bit of Lisp macros. Do you see any connection to that? Did those exist back then? We were aware of Lisp. It was an inspiration for Alan and for me and for other people in the group, but I'm not sure if there is really about that. I think of Smalltalk-72 as being sort of a marriage of Lisp and Meta. The META I'm talking about there is a paper about it called META-II, it was written by Val Schorre in 1962 and it's a beautiful paper. It ends up with a compiler compiler that's written in itself in about a quarter of a page. It's another gem like McCarthy's Lisp eval. I recommend that paper to anybody who is so interested.\n\n4. It strikes me also that Smalltalk-72 was very focused on the messaging, because there was no concept of methods, as in later Smalltalk. Because you are really just getting a stream of data and you have to interpret it. Right, we were just in the process of discovering that. If you look at code, in Smalltalk-72 you'll see a class description that is just like a function with a whole lot of code, but the style we quickly evolved was one where that code was testing to see if it was this message or this message or this, like keyword testing. Then, the little sub-bodies of code that went which each of those corresponded to methods. We thus got experience with that style, but it's true that the language did not have a syntax for it, that came later.\n\n5. That was then Smalltalk-76. What were the big changes, the big feature list for Smalltalk-76? Smalltalk-76 came to me all as a unit during a weekend at the beach. When we had gathered this experience of how we wanted things to be, but the language itself (or at least the programs) ran really slow because they were having to parse on the fly. I really wanted to get it to where it could be compiled and run by some sort of virtual machine. We had come up with this style of using keywords to make things more readable, especially for the kids and essentially for doing all of the message testing was testing on token names. That's where I came up with the keyword syntax. You can actually see pieces of it.\n\nThe colon that takes an evaluated argument in Smalltalk-72, wound up being a piece of the keyword in Smalltalk-76. Also, infix arithmetic had been dear to my heart ever since I encountered APL so that I preserved so that's a part of the syntax, but the syntax of Smalltalk-76 and Smalltalk-80 is very simple. I think that's one of its virtues. Anyway, part of that whole gestalt that came to me was not only that way of having a fixed syntax, but that could flexibly allow for all sorts of message patterns. Together with a byte encoding that you could compile to. In that I was motivated by another thing that was happening at the same time at Xerox PARC, which was the development of microcoded computers. In the back of my mind there was some previous work done by Peter Deutsch on a microcoded Lisp or a byte encoded Lisp. I knew that if we could compile the pieces of our language to small code syllables, we could execute that very fast in these microcoded processors. That was in the back of my mind and, if you take a look at the Smalltalk-80 virtual machine it all goes back to that sort of whole gestalt.\n\n6. When did Smalltalk images come along, the image concept? Was that in Smalltalk-72? Did it come later? It began with Smalltalk-72 and I would trace it back even earlier to one of the things that I had loved about APL - it was the APL workspaces. In APL you could do some work, you could bind some variables, you could define some functions and you save that workspace and when you start it up again you could load that workspace and everything would be exactly as you left it. Because of course they didn't have any graphics on the screen. Then, when we did Smalltalk-72 there was that convenience in the back of my mind and also the Alto Machine - we had these disk packs that stored less than a floppy disk, but you could load the entire program state from the disk to run. It was like a personal computer, but used by different people. People would come in, they would load the disk pack and then start to work and then leave and take the disk pack with them. We were working with children and we wanted the children to be able to do some project, put some stuff on the screen.\n\nThen, if it was the end of their session, we wanted them to be able to save that and come back exactly the way it had been when they next had a chance to work. It might be on a different computer. The simplest way to do that was the Alto operating system had something that would in just like one second unload the entire state of memory onto the disk and another symmetric operation that would load it back in from the disk. We seized on that and said \"Fine, just load the whole session out and load it back in.\" That became the image model. It stood the test of time for us. There is a downside of working that way, but it worked great for our productivity and you see that later on in Squeak's rampant portability. Squeak runs bit identically across platforms of different endianness and different processors, so you can take a Squeak image that's been stored out, ship it across the world to somebody with a different shaped screen, different color depth, all that and it just works.\n\n7. You mentioned the downsides of the image. How could you work around these downsides or what are the downsides? There are a couple of downsides. One is that it makes the system somewhat a slightly heavier weight thing, although nowadays, with the size of current computers it's nothing. The other is (people talk about it as) the walled garden, where you tend to do everything in your own system, which is a wonderful thing and many of the virtues of the Smalltalk world come about that way. But if you then want to work with other external programs, other systems, it's harder to do that because you may have your own encoding for objects and they have to be translated going in and out and so on. I think of that as being less and less a problem now as we go to thinking more in terms of network computing than we get used to these interfaces to foreign systems. But during that period, it was a barrier for Smalltalk to integrate as well as other say systems in Unix or Linux that were set up to flexibly use a bunch of different things at the operating system level.\n\n9. You mentioned the Alto computer at Xerox PARC. A question I always wanted to ask is there is a rumor that Smalltalk was the GUI at Xerox PARC, the only GUI. Is that true? What were the systems at Xerox PARC? That's not the case. Xerox PARC had a couple of different laboratories. There was the so-called Computer Science Laboratory and we were in what was called The System Science Laboratory. Our group is actually called The Learning Research Group. There was the Smalltalk system, but there was another project that produced Interlisp and they had their own GUI. Then, in the Computer Science Lab, there was a similar other system that was worked on by Chuck Gaskin, Martin Newell and people like that and they produced other systems like the Bravo text editor and a lot of that work went on into the later Star product that Xerox actually sold.\n\n10. Those other systems had their own GUI? Yes, each of them had their own GUI. A couple of things showed up first in our group and it was wonderful at Xerox PARC that there was a lot of sharing of work. I think this has been written about in books. We had this usually weekly meeting called \"Dealer\" where we would participate along with people from the Computer Science Lab and somebody would say \"Wouldn't it be cool if we could do this particular graphic thing?\" and we'd come back and program it up and give demos back and we'd share back and forth in that way? Some of the things were done first in Smalltalk and then spread quickly. Pop-up menus is an example of that and we had overlapping windows on the screen before the other groups, but something like that you just see once and you want to do it. That kind of thing spread virally within Xerox\n\n11. Which system did Steve Jobs see? The system he saw was Smalltalk and I was one of the 2 people who gave the demo I guess Adele was involved in the negotiations and talking about it.\n\n12. Moving on another 4 years to Smalltalk-80. How did that come about? What were the changes to Smalltalk-76? Smalltalk-80 is very much like Smalltalk-76. The Smalltalk-80 virtual machine is almost identical. All of that was really done with Smalltalk-76. We changed the numbering on it mainly because it was a time when we were getting ready to put Smalltalk out into the world. One of the things you see in Smalltalk-76 if you look into it is we had our own special character set with lots of glyphs that made sense to our language, but did not appear in the Ascii set. One of the first things to do was to make it Ascii compliant and we did that almost completely. The one thing we didn't do is we left the left arrow for assignment which looked funny on computers that had underbar in that place. That was one of the changes. There were a couple of real improvements, we put in, Booleans. The Smalltalk-76 was more in the Lisp model of nil equals false, and then I unified blocks in a way that was different from Smalltalk-76. That's pretty much it.\n\n13. Blocks had appeared in Smalltalk-76. What was the change in Smalltalk-80? One of the problems with Smalltalk-76 is you didn't get an object for a block that was passed in. You got essentially a pointer back to where it came from and it made it the case that if you wanted to pass a block, there was no a way to pass a block that you were handed onto another procedure at a lower level. If you had something like that that was 3 levels deep, you had to essentially do the overhead of creating blocks 3 times down. There was some complication in the syntax in order to allow the effect of unevaluated variables in a block call in Smalltalk-76 that complicated the syntax so that you can have a keyword that either evaluated its argument or didn't. We got rid of that in Smalltalk-80.\n\n14. Where did blocks come from originally? What lessons did you learn in Smalltalk-72 to get to blocks in Smalltalk-76? Smalltalk-72, as I say was this completely flexible thing that parsed on the fly. When I did Smalltalk-76 one of the hardest things to do was to figure out how to make something compilable there to go there and yet that would pass essentially variables by name and not by value and still have it compiled. I just did what it took and if you look at Smalltalk-76, you'll see what the solution was. But it did the job and in Smalltalk-80 the blocks that we got there were just a more mature version of that and simpler in a way in that you didn't have this difference between unevaluated and evaluated keywords.\n\n15. There was some controversy about blocks in Smalltalk-76 or Smalltalk-80. Some people didn't like them. What was the case there? I think one of the aspects of blocks that people object to is that they hand out a capability an access to within an object that isn't in its external protocol. If you store that capability somewhere, it's a breech of security. What we did at that time - that put us on a new plateau was really great, but I think since that time we've learned some lessons and that aspect of blocks is one of the lessons we learned.\n\n16. Has that problem been dealt with or I suppose it's still a problem that you expose an internal information with closures? One of the things you want to do is not be able to store blocks. I think the approach of closures is a better approach in that sense. Some other things we've learned, such as the bad aspects of shared mutable state. If you want to look around at Smalltalk-like work that's more forward looking, I think Gilad Bracha's work on Newspeak is probably a good place to look. A lot of that goes back also to the work done by Mark Miller on the language E. Actually I don't think of E as being as much a language as an architecture, but it has informed a lot of current work on more secure systems.\n\n17. The language E brings the concept of capabilities, is that right? The basic idea is only, a piece of code should only get a handle that has only operations that are safe to perform on it. You don't give somebody a handle to the file system, you give them a handle to a specific file if you want it to be written on.\n\n18. That avoids having to do security checks and things like that. In fact it constitutes a security check because what else can you do with it?\n\n21. The '80s passed and then you invented Squeak. Who came up with Squeak? Here is how Squeak came about. I was about to go back and work with the old crew at Apple and we knew we needed a software system that we had domain over and so we figured out that would probably be Smalltalk and we had specifically the old Apple Smalltalk as something we could use because it was in the public domain, but the virtual machine we had for it was a pile of 68K assembly code and we didn't want to have to go deal with that. This was after my time of being away from the computers for 8 years and they had gotten so much faster that it occurred to me we probably could actually run the reference implementation of Smalltalk that was in the Blue Book and actually use it. It would run slowly, but it would be usable. I had this flash - I still remember driving in the rain and thinking this thought that the way that code was written, it could be translated to C. It was specifically written to not use messaging really, although it was in the Smalltalk syntax, so that it could be a guide to other implementers who read the Blue Book. Therefore, by definition, it was translatable to something like C and we ought to be able to just write a translator in Smalltalk from that to C. That was the germ of Squeak.\n\nOther than that, Squeak is just another Smalltalk-80, but the cool thing was that it would then include the code for the Virtual Machine, which would a) mean we had a Virtual Machine that we could easily debug and change, so it would be nice and malleable and b) it would be really easy to give to other people to do ports. Squeak has a very different character, you know - it's full of flexible graphics and stuff that you don't see in the other Smalltalks and the reason (I think) is that having the system including the primitives, the virtual machine and the graphics, all written in good old malleable debuggable Smalltalk. It meant that there were lots of things that would be fun to do, would be creative that we wouldn't normally have done if the graphics were done in some less malleable way, but we could just try them very simply. The work that I did on WarpBlt, this flexible scaling rotating version of BitBlt, I don't think I ever would have approached it if I'd had to do that in C, just because it's a big complicated thing. But I wrote a version of it in Smalltalk, which I can sit there and debug. That was also during a trip to New Hampshire and it took 3 days to get the kernel of it all working. Then, because of this wonderful simple push button translation to C, we had it working at full native code speed a day later.\n\n22. In your talk, you mentioned the concept of a kernel as a basic set of concepts that you can build on. Could you go into that a bit? What does this entail? A kernel it's an abstract term and people use it all different ways. People talk about the Unix kernel and this and that. I think of a kernel as just something that a lot of people talk about it as a platform. It's just a set of APIs or definitions that you then can build other stuff on top of. You can have a graphics kernel and what is that's all you need to do whatever you want in the world of graphics. There are other kernels that maybe provide all that you need to run an operating system.\n\n24. The word kernel brings us to your current project - the Lively Kernel. The Lively Kernel is written in JavaScript. The first question - why? JavaScript is here. It's all over. The project came out of my being interested in getting into what people were doing on the world wide web. When I looked at it, it looked really complicated because I was looking at it from the standpoint of personal computing and how do you take this medium which is the web and your browser and turn it into something active. I think of a system like Smalltalk or Squeak and yet what I found was a text markup language that is coming from a server and it just didn't feel like any of the immediacy that I like to feel in personal computing. I took a deep breath and thought \"There is good graphics in the browser and there is a dynamic programming language there. Why do you need all this other stuff? If we have that why don't we just take that and make a little kernel out of it and see what you can get from there?\"\n\n26. But you didn't like the idea? No, actually it's an experiment that we're playing with in the Lively Kernel. I didn't do that originally with the Lively Kernel because partly I view this as a new world and I thought to go and try and just translate Squeak into this new world. For one thing it would have been politically incorrect and for another thing I felt like that I would be carrying some baggage from the past. The only thing that I wanted to bring from the past was the experience from Squeak that it's really simple to do this stuff. You take a dynamic language, you build a graphical structure like the Morphic system in Squeak and that's all you need. I thought to rewrite it in JavaScript would be a challenge and it was and it's a little bit different, maybe better in ways and not as good in ways. But the essential thing that it preserves is that simplicity of a simple graphical structure in a dynamic language. Then, coming around the full circle to where it is self-supporting.\n\n27. Does the Lively Kernel also have an image concept like Squeak or how does that work? It doesn't really. Except that we're going in that direction. The Lively Kernel runs as you'd expect, it loads like a web page. When you click on its web page what comes into your computer is a pile of JavaScript which then starts running and in some cases some XML that's been stored. But we're going to change that probably. That's just running as a web page. When we get into the notion of persistence in the Lively Kernel that's up to whatever you happen to be writing in the Lively Kernel. What we have in the Lively Kernel is a WebDAV file access protocol, so that if you have an account on a server somewhere, then you can store your world as a new web page and that then is like the image model. We actually did the work so that we store XML for the existing graphics on the screen and there is a way to store also any definitions that you've made that are beyond those that come with the Lively Kernel. In that sense, once you start one of these pages, if you click on it, it comes up and you're pretty much back where you were.\n\nWe use the web page as the persistence model that's pretty much like the Smalltalk image. It has the same nice features that you store it that way from a Windows computer and you load it that way on a Macintosh in a different browser and it's all the same \" it still works. That's the benefit of working with we get that for free because of these various protocols that have been a part of the Internet standards for quite a while.\n\n28. How do you do graphics in the Lively Kernel? Do you use Canvas or SVG or what's your current approach? The Kernel approach is the Morphic model that comes from Squeak essentially. Squeak got it from the work done on Self by Randy Smith and John Maloney and Dave Ungar, I think worked on it, too. That's basically a model of a scene graph that is in the language itself, so it's programmable and flexible. The first version that we did of the Lively Kernel uses SVG. SVG is scalable back to graphics and it's one of the world wide web graphic standards.\n\nIt's wasn't a perfect match for morphic because it presents its own scene graph and morphic has a scene graph model, so we actually had to do pairing between the components. Pairing is also an invitation to complexity, but we dealt with that. Then, about a year ago or so I did another version that would use just the Canvas protocol. Just for people who don't know about it, SVG is a retained graphics model. In other words, it includes the model for graphic nodes and if you change one, it has all the logic built in that will repaint the screen.\n\nCanvas is a graphic standard that just gives the screen as a canvas, like a bitmap, a pixmap and if you want to change something on the screen you have to take care on repainting the damaged area. Morphic is ideally set up for dealing with that kind of updating. It just took me a week to make a layer and make a change so that all the Lively Kernel would run on the Canvas model equally well. The answer to your question \"to come back to it\" is that the Lively Kernel has there 2 versions: one runs on SVG and one runs on Canvas and they are pretty much identical.\n\n29. Is there any difference in speed? The SVG will render somewhat faster because SVG code for rendering and for dealing with updating damaged areas is all native. But what we're finding is that Canvas code runs just as fast. I think it's actually going to run faster. The reason being that the actual painting on the screen is still native in the Canvas version. We don't have to go through the pairing and updating of SVG nodes at all. You would think that managing the damaged areas in JavaScript would slow it down, but the JavaScript engines are now getting fast enough that that's not a problem.\n\n30. Talking about speed, it strikes me that the Lively Kernel was quite courageous when you started it because it was before the Google V8 wathershed. How did that feel back then? It was slow, but speed wasn't the first figure of merit that I was after. I wanted something that felt like a personal computer. I felt like individual programmers were getting disenfranchised, because in the good old days any computer you bought came with BASIC and you just start it up and you could write a program and have it running in 5 minutes and all very simple.\n\nIt seemed to me that nowadays we had come supposedly so much further and you couldn't do anything simply on the computer without getting something that had an inch of documentation that you had to read through and just know simple access. The figurative merit that I was after with the Lively Kernel was something that would be simple to start up, simple to program, simple to play with and if it ran slowly, I didn't care. The truth was it ran reasonably well. SVG is performant graphics and even those slow JavaScripts were reasonably performant.\n\n32. Are you going to get an iPad and run Lively Kernel on it? Absolutely. I say something more about the iPad and that kind of world, which is I think there is another role for the Lively Kernel, which has to do with simple authoring. The fact that the Lively Kernel is just a web page and you click on it and you're running this system, it's a system that can do graphics editing, can produce images, can do simple programs, like Squeak that you can save a page from, means that basically anywhere you have a network computer, you can have authoring.\n\nThat 's one ingredient. Another is I noticed that there is a certain challenge you have before you can become a developer for say the iPhone and yet the iPhone has Safari in it and it runs Lively Kernel applications just fine. It seems to me there is an opportunity here for something much more open than the App Store in which everybody can contribute and produce and share active content.",
  "latent_425": "Run silent, run deep — and now, run in packs? Submarines are traditionally lone wolves, but the rise of robotics is starting to change that. Just yesterday, defense contractor BAE announced a $4.6 million award from DARPA to build an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) to accompany manned submarines, helping them spot targets by sending out active sonar pulses.\n\nWhile the contract is tiny by Pentagon standards, it’s a harbinger of things to come underwater. Done right, the sonar drone could give bubbleheads a new advantage at a time when Russia and China are copying our old ones. But there are plenty of technical and tactical hurdles to overcome. The first is cramming a sufficiently high-powered sonar, an underwater datalink, and an adequate power source in a drone small enough to launch from a torpedo tube. If you can do all that, then you have to make sure the sonar and datalink aren’t too powerful, or they’ll give away the drone’s location — or even help the enemy find the manned submarine itself.\n\nKnown as MOCCA (Mobile Offboard Clandestine Communications & Approach), the sonar UUV would help the manned mothership detect enemy submarines at greater distances, without being detected in return. Active sonar, which sends out a pulse of sound — that loud “PING” you hear in war movies — has a much longer range than passive sonar, which merely listens. But submarines generally rely on passive sensors, because the enemy can home in on active pulses. If the sub can launch an unmanned underwater vehicle with active sonar, though, the UUV can move a safe distance away before it starts pinging. Yes, the enemy may well detect the drone, but even if they destroy it, the manned sub is safe.\n\nThe relationship between sub and drone would be a bit like that between a hunter and his hound, working together to find prey. But in this hunt, though, the prey shoot back. The hope is they shoot the noisy hound instead of the quiet hunter. The danger is the hound will give the hunter away.\n\nHow? One danger is that the UUV’s active sonar pulse might hit its parent submarine, echoing off and effectively spotlighting it for the enemy. While you would never intentionally aim your sonar at a friendly sub, sound bends and bounces in funny ways underwater. “Sound that is projected will be scattered,” warns DARPA’s Broad Agency Announcement outlining the problem. “Scattered sound may inadvertently illuminate the host submarine and possibly compromise stealth.”\n\nThe other danger is the datalink. The manned submarine and the UUV have to communicate, if only so they know where the other one is. The more data they exchange — the humans sending orders to the drone, the drone sending scouting reports back — the more transmissions there are to detect. Submarines traditionally operate alone precisely because coordination requires communication, and communication can be detected. As the BAA puts it, “the MOCCA communications link cannot degrade submarine stealth.”\n\n“Underwater data links are a relatively mature technology. The challenge here is to create one that can provide high bandwidth if the UUV needs to send data to the submarine and can also be hard for an enemy to detect,” said Bryan Clark, a retired submariner and former aide to the Chief of Naval Operations, how the Center for Strategic & Budgetary Assessments. (Clark wrote an intriguing study on underwater communications). The crucial question is how much bandwidth you want, which in turn depends on what, exactly, you want the drone to do. There are two basic approaches, Clark told me:\n\nThe unmanned underwater vehicle has an active sonar transmitter, but only the manned submarine has a receiver. This basically splits the sonar in two. The UUV is just sending out the ping, not listening for the echoes. That means it’s not collecting any data, which means it doesn’t need to transmit much. This is the stealthier approach — but it forgoes the opportunity of using the UUV as a second sensor platform to look at things from a different angle.\n\nThe UUV has both a sonar transmitter and a receiver. The submarine’s passive sensors can still listen for the echoes from the UUV’s pings, but now the UUV is listening too, providing a second chance to pick up faint signals and a second perspective to triangulate a signal’s source. The problem is now the UUV has to transmit all this information back to the manned submarine. This approach is more likely to see the enemy coming, but it’s also more likely to be seen.\n\n“If the UUV just transmits active sonar and other platforms listen to the reflections form the sonar, the datalink only needs to be able to control the UUV and provide feedback on its location,” Clark said. “If the UUV is also acting as a sensor, much more bandwidth is needed, (and) as bandwidth goes up, the required power level probably rises and could make the link more detectable.”\n\nClark still firmly believes underwater drones are central to the future of naval warfare: He just never said developing the technology or the tactics would be easy. “Overall, the idea of using UUVs as adjuncts to submarines or surface ships in Anti-Submarine Warfare to be sensors…is a good one,” he told me. “The key is coming up with tactics and applications where they offer better performance than the traditional approaches we use today.”\n\nThe DARPA contract starts us down that road.",
  "latent_471": "Lençóis Maranhenses National Park (Parque Nacional dos Lençóis Maranhenses[a]) is a national park located in Maranhão state in northeastern Brazil, just east of the Baía de São José. Protected on June 2, 1981, the 155,000 ha (380,000-acre) park includes 70 km (43 mi) of coastline, and an interior composed of rolling sand dunes. During the rainy season, the valleys among the dunes fill with freshwater lagoons, prevented from draining due to the impermeable rock beneath. The park is home to a range of species, including four listed as endangered, and has become a popular destination for ecotourists.\n\nPhysical geography [ edit ]\n\nThe park is located on the northeastern coast of Brazil in the state of Maranhão along the eastern coast, bordered by 70 kilometres (43 mi) of beaches along Atlantic Ocean.[4][5]:80 Inland, it is bordered by the Parnaíba River, the São José Basin, and the rivers of Itapecuru, Munim, and Periá.[5]:80 The park encompasses an area of 155,000 hectares (380,000 acres), composed mainly of expansive coastal dune fields, which formed during the late Quaternary period.[1][5]:79\n\nWhile much of the park has the appearance of a desert, the area receives about 1,200 millimetres (47 in) of rain per year, while deserts, by definition, receive less than 250 millimetres (10 in) annually.[3] About 70% of this rainfall occurs between the months of January and May.[4]\n\nThe sand is carried to the park from the interior of the continent by the Parnaíba and Preguiças rivers, where it is then driven back inland up to 50 kilometres (31 mi) by winds, creating a series of sand dunes rising as much as 40 metres (130 ft) tall.[3] During the rainy season, between the months of January and June, the rainstorms fill the spaces among the dunes with fresh water lagoons of up to 100 metres (330 ft) in length and 3 metres (10 ft) in depth, and together comprising as much as 41% of the area of the park.[4][6] The water in the lagoons is prevented from draining by a layer of impermeable rock located beneath the sandy surface.[2] The lagoons typically have a temperature between 27.5 °C (81.5 °F) and 32 °C (90 °F), pH of between 4.9 and 6.2, and low levels of dissolved nutrients.[7] When the dry season returns, the pools quickly evaporate, losing as much as 1 metre (3 ft) of depth per month.[6]\n\nIn the interior of the park are located two oases or restingas, Queimada do Britos, covering an area of 1,100 hectares (2,700 acres), and Baixa Grande, covering an area of 850 hectares (2,100 acres).[4]\n\nThe area of the park has an average annual temperature of between 26 °C (79 °F) and 28.5 °C (83.3 °F) and an annual temperature variation of about 1.1 °C (2 °F).[4][7]\n\nEcology [ edit ]\n\nThe lagoons in the park are often interconnected with one another, as well as with the rivers that run through the area. They are home to a number of fish and insect species, including the wolf fish, which burrows down into wet layers of mud and remains dormant during the dry season.[6][3] Besides the dunes that form the centerpiece of the park, the ecosystem also includes area of restinga and mangrove ecosystems.[2]\n\nThe park is home to four species listed as endangered, the scarlet ibis (eudocimus ruber) , the neotropical otter (lontra longicaudis), the oncilla (leopardus tigrinus) and the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).[2] The park also includes 133 species of plants, 112 species of birds, and at least 42 species of reptiles.[2][4]\n\nTourism [ edit ]\n\nA visitor near one of the park's freshwater lagoons in 2017\n\nLençóis Maranhenses National Park receives as many as 60,000 visitors a year, and is a popular destination for ecotourism, given its unique physical features.[3][5]:80 Common activities within the park include \"surfing, canoeing, adventure tourism, rustic camping, horseback riding, and all-terrain vehicle...and water tours.\"[5]:80 The best route of entry is flight to the regional capital of São Luís, and then travel by jeep to the interior of the park from Barreirinhas.[6]\n\nIn popular culture [ edit ]\n\nThe park was featured in the Brazilian film The House of Sand. Kadhal Anukkal, a song from an Indian Tamil language film Enthiran starring Rajnikanth and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan was also shot here.[8][9] The film Avengers: Infinity War used the park's landscape as the planet Vormir.[10]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ [3] Literally the \"bedsheets of Maranhão\"",

  "latent_633": "Just Ask the Damn Question\n\nShortly after I moved to the US in early 2006 I bought a copy of the bestseller ‘The Why Cafe’ by John P Strelecky.\n\nI forget now what question prompted me to e-mail the author, but e-mail him I did and asked for some feedback.\n\nI was shocked when the reply came back within an hour suggesting we meet up for breakfast the following week.\n\nI’d no idea that John lived literally less than 5 minutes down the road from me, he could have been anywhere on the planet for all I knew.\n\nLife is weird like that sometimes, eh?\n\nA couple of years later and I was playing golf with John when I asked him what his next book was going to be about. It’s going to be called ‘How To Be Rich and Happy‘ he announced with a big smile.\n\nI stifled a chuckle because that sounded a little too grand for my tastes.\n\n“Do you want to take a look at the publishers proposal and let me have your thoughts?” he asked me. “Sure” I responded thinking more of how I was going to get my ball out of the water than the book.\n\nThe following day John sent me the proposal and I ‘filed’ it to look at later, but never did. That is until we arranged to play again and I remembered saying I’d read it, so I frantically dug it out so I could offer the promised feedback.\n\nI Asked The Question\n\nI was blown away by the concept and immediately thought I could add a lot to it. When the topic came up on the round I told John I really liked it, but also that I thought I could make it better and we should write it together.\n\nHe agreed.\n\nEarlier this week I went to Johns to pick up the hard copy versions of the books that have now published in Netherlands, France and Taiwan (Germany and China to follow) that our agent had sent.\n\nWe were talking about what to do next when John said, “You know, I get lots of e-mails and lots of people telling me how amazing it would be to write a book, but you are the only person that’s ever asked if you could co-author”\n\nEven though we talk about the power of asking for help in How To Be Rich and Happy, it had never occurred to me that if I’d not asked John the book wouldn’t even exist as it is now.\n\nIf I had never e-mailed John and asked him a question we would never have become friends.\n\nIf John hadn’t asked me to read the proposal, we would never have co-authored it.\n\nIf I hadn’t asked John if I could co-author he wouldn’t have offered.\n\nAsking for help is not a sign of weakness (just the opposite) and it’s not impinging on somebody. I get loads of requests for help and time and sanity restraints mean I turn most down, but here’s the crux:\n\nI don’t begrudge any of them because I have a choice. I’m a big boy and can say ‘no’ if something isn’t right for me.\n\nSo can the person who may be in a position to help you.\n\nMore importantly though, they can also say yes, but you’ll never know until you ask the question.\n\nAs Wayne Gretzski said:\n\n“You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take”\n\nSome people stress about rejection as this point, but the fact is even if they say ‘no’ you are in exactly the same position as you were before.\n\nActually no, strike that you’re in a better position because:\n\nYou can move on and give somebody else the opportunity to say ‘yes’ You won’t be looking back in 20 years time thinking “Why was I such wuss?”\n\nTo celebrate the triple launch of How To Be Rich and Happy we’re slashing the price for a limited period.\n\nThe hard copy in English is currently only available on our site and retails for $25. As I’m sure you know all that money goes into printing copies of the book to give to good causes, John and I don’t take a penny out for ourselves.\n\nUntil February 14th (I know, we’re such romantics) you can grab it for just $10 plus shipping.\n\nThe PDF version sells for $19 and you can grab that for a measly $4, or a tad less than a venti soy latte from your favorite purveyor of fine ground beans.\n\nAll you need to do is go to the site, click on the button for the format you’d prefer and then enter coupon code “justask” and you get a great deal and help good causes to boot.\n\nWoo-hoo baby!\n\nCan You Help Me Please?\n\nOk so I told you to ask for help, and I’m practicing what I preach by asking for your help if I may be as so bold, and I may because it’s my blog.",

The Beautiful Tree That's Causing Quite A Stink\n\nIt's springtime in Pittsburgh, and throughout the city, Callery pear trees are sprouting beautiful, white blossoms.\n\nBut that's just the problem. Simply put, these trees stink.\n\n\"This whole place smells like dead fish,\" says Sheila Titus. \"I mean everywhere. Everywhere you see one of these trees with the white on them.\"\n\nTitus has lived in her home in the now-hip neighborhood of Lawrenceville for 49 years. Two decades ago, her grandson and his 7th grade class planted a row of Callery pears across the street from her house.\n\n\"They told us they were putting nice trees up with flowers on them, and they come up with this stinkin' stuff comin' out of them,\" she says. \"Oh God, it was terrible.\"\n\nMike Dirr, a professor of horticulture at the University of Georgia and an expert on woody plants, says at first, he advocated for the tree.\n\n\"We thought, 'Gee, this is a panacea,' \" Dirr says. \"You can stick it into any planting space in an urban situation, in concrete-heavy soils, clay soils, limestoney soils, acid soils, and it's gonna grow.\"\n\nNative to China and Vietnam, the Callery, or Bradford pear, became the street tree of choice for American cities beginning in the 1950s. The beautiful, white flowering tree was disease-resistant and had the ability to grow in diverse climates and soil types.\n\nBut, Dirr says, the Callery pear soon revealed its downsides: It stank, and new trees started sprouting up everywhere, crowding out native species.\n\n\"I'm not a crazy, invasive-police kinda guy, but I can see the future and this tree is I think one of the biggest scourges we have,\" he says.\n\nThat's why the Callery pear is now prohibited by the Pittsburgh Urban Forest Master Plan, according to Matt Erb of the nonprofit group Tree Pittsburgh.\n\n\"In the last five years, through the TreeVitalize Pittsburgh program, we've planted 23,000 trees throughout Allegheny County, and not one of them is a Callery pear,\" he says.\n\nStill, there are thousands of the trees in Pittsburgh, and many more across the country, from New York City to Colorado.\n\nMike Dirr says they'll probably never be eradicated.\n\nSo each spring, Sheila Titus and her daughter Kim will just have to deal with the smell.\n\n\"We're lucky today that the odor's not as strong,\" Kim says, \"or else it would be in the house.\"\n\n\"We thought it was our dog,\" Sheila says.\n\nThen, Sheila says, the dog died, but the smell remained.",

Among the bits of info revealed by the team is the fact that OxygenOS won't be open source. Instead it will be a \"real OS.\" Steve \"Cyanogen\" Kondik couldn't resist poking fun at that.\n\nCyanogen OS as produced by Cyanogen Inc. is not completely open source either, but it sounds like OnePlus is going for a more closed approach akin to HTC Sense or TouchWiz. There are, of course, some open source requirements for anything based on Android, but it's not unheard of for an OEM to keep all the development and features closed. It's actually the default.\n\nLook at it this way—Samsung doesn't have a git for TouchWiz where you can access the code, but it releases kernel source for each build. Apparently OnePlus will be doing something similar. Kondik points out the community development is a boon to CM, and he certainly has a point. He also says CM has \"no plans of taking our toys and going home.\" Burn. It will be interesting to see how well the small OnePlus ROM team can operate without help from a legion of hobbyist devs.",

Hopefully players and developers alike can find something to learn from this info!\n\n(For the historians, all info on this page is as of April 1st, 2016.)\n\nAll Game Sales\n\nShovel Knight has sold 1.2 million units total! 200,000 of those units are physical retail sales. We’re still in a bit of shock here! Previously, a successful game in our portfolio would barely break 50k copies sold. Want to know the platform breakdown? Here’s a graph!\n\nBefore you save the graph above for your next platform vs platform discussion, there’s a few key items that are worth keeping in mind:\n\nOur Sony and Microsoft versions did not come out until April 2015, 9 months after our initial release on PC and Nintendo systems. The Nintendo Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Sony PS4 are also naturally higher in sales as they received full retail releases in October 2015. Every platform except Sony’s systems have gone on sale during some major holidays, but none of them have ever been sold for more than a 33% discount. Keeping our game at full price has been a major part of our strategy as we believe players will be more invested in the game and therefore hopefully, enjoy it more if it isn’t bought at a bargain bin price. Although Amazon Fire TV does not have enough sales to appear on the graph, it’s a bit tricky to measure because Shovel Knight was packed in with 50,000 consoles, and those sales are not accounted for in the graph. The Amazon Fire TV also released in September of 2015 – which is rather late when compared to everything else and a tall order to catch up to. Also of note, we have still not released the game in Asian territories. We plan to release in Japan in June on Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Wii U.\n\nSome interesting facts about our sales trends:\n\nIn general, the game sales are still very strong. In November 2015 we actually sold more units digitally on Nintendo Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Steam in North America (our initial release platforms) than we did in the same month the previous year, November 2014.\n\nContrarily to the previous point, March 2016 was our worst sales month since our initial release. Oh no!\n\nThe first 6 months of sales on all Sony platforms are equivalent to the total first 6 months on just the Nintendo Wii U. On Nintendo 3DS we sold about 50% more than Sony. Alternatively, Microsoft is 50% of Sony.\n\nWe typically average 25k-35k units a month.\n\nSteam is our best seller, but it’s also benefited the most from discounted sales. In an average month, Nintendo 3DS almost sells twice as much as Steam.\n\nRetail Sales\n\nOur big push last year was getting Shovel Knight at retail with the game and the amiibo figure. We’ve learned a lot of crazy things about retail: how small the margins are, how long and arduous the process is of creating and shipping discs/carts, how difficult and finicky retailers can be to work with, and much, much more. Although it was a huge pain, at the end of the day, we think our game benefits from being available at retail. Hopefully, it is bringing more kids, families, and an all around wider audience to our game that otherwise wouldn’t have considered it. So far at retail, we’ve sold more than 200,000 units:\n\nA few items to note here. Tracking data for physical sales is extremely hard and not nearly as accurate as digital sales. In Europe, we get very little information due to all the distributors and retailers involved. In North America, we only get information for Target, Best Buy, Amazon, Gamestop, Toys R US, Wal-Mart, and Canadian retailers. Here’s even more detail with a breakdown of our North American sales per store:\n\nNote, not all the stores carry all platforms of the game. For example, Target sells only Nintendo Wii U and Nintendo 3DS versions in stores. Also, some stores have an advantage due to time sold. Toys”R”Us started selling Shovel Knight late in December, and unlike most the other stores, did not have pre-orders available.\n\nSome facts we noticed here:\n\nIn 2015, each month we typically sold twice as much at retail when compared to digital. Into 2016, the platforms now sell about 1:1.\n\nIt appears that retail sales did not cannibalize digital sales at all. The sales data looks more like we’re selling on a new platform rather than a percentage of people moving away from digital. It’s possible this could change over the course of the year though.\n\nInterestingly, the retail release did not help the digital release! When we launch on another system we normally see a small boost on the currently existing platforms, but that wasn’t the case with retail.\n\nWe’ve currently sold through about 70% of our retail stock.\n\nRetailers requested the most PS4 stock, but Wii U has been our best seller!\n\nNote, for a $24.99 copy of the retail game, we receive a 3-4 dollars less than our digital release, which sells for $14.99. Also, we still haven’t actually been paid for retail product due to the long tail of not knowing if all the units will sell.\n\nBeing a retail publisher of the game also comes with additional costs. We had to take out a very expensive insurance policy, get the game rated at retail in every territory (much more expensive than digital), create packaged versions for every language, system, and rating, and much more.\n\nRegion Breakdown\n\nOne area we still have a lot of room for improvement in is reaching more regions. We’re still heavily bought in North America vs Europe. Typically about 63-77% of our games are bought in North America depending on the platform. PC is the low end of that spectrum where Wii U is on the higher end. Keep in mind Shovel Knight is still only available in English, German, Spanish, Italian, and French. So we definitely have room to grow, and hope to continue introducing new languages as the ongoing game updates begin to finalize. Here’s the breakdown by region for Steam:\n\nSteam User Stats!\n\nHere are some fun game stats based on our Steam users:\n\nOur most unlocked achievement is First Purchase, which 85% of people have done. We’re not sure how much Goatician makes from each Meal Ticket sold, but we wish him well in his entrepreneurial pursuits.\n\n32% of people have gotten the Victory Achievement, meaning they completed the game as Shovel Knight. 2% of players have gone on to complete New Game +.\n\n5% of our Steam PC players were determined to be playing on Mac, with 1% determined to be on Linux.\n\n345,000 people have Shovel Knight in their Steam wishlist. 102,000 people have removed Shovel Knight from their wishlist and 131,000 people have picked up Shovel Knight after having it on their wishlist!\n\nMedian playtime is 5 hours and 23 minutes. Average playtime is 8 hours and 3 minutes.\n\nShovel Knight: Plague of Shadows\n\nWhen we set out to make our first expansion for Shovel Knight, Plague of Shadows, we knew that we’d be putting it out for free. We really wanted to make a great campaign that felt new and exciting, and would draw new players in! We also wanted to make players of the original game feel like they got their money’s worth, in the hopes of keeping our reputation as sterling as possible. For instance, many players feel great about supporting Blizzard because they know that every Blizzard game will be updated and improved for many years in the future (in fact, a new patch for the 16 year old Diablo II was just released!). Our plan was ambitious… but could we make it work?\n\nYou may remember our magic formula for how to simply calculate game production costs. Plague of Shadows was no exception – we went all out in its development just as if we were starting on a new game. We had 8 people full time on the project for about a year – meaning we effectively spent roughly a million dollars creating FREE update content for the game. Is that ridiculous?! Yes, most definitely. Was it worth it? We think so! We really love what we created and we think the fans who gave it a shot did too. That said, by traditional publishing standards, it would probably be perceived as a catastrophic failure!\n\nHere are some facts about it:\n\nWe spent about 1 million dollars developing Plague of Shadows over the course of a year.\n\nWe made zero dollars selling Plague of Shadows. Whoops!\n\nDevelopment started in July 2014 with the target release date of Q2 2015. The update was released in September 2015. Boy, did we go late!\n\nPlague of Shadows started as the Kickstarter Stretch Goal “New Playable Boss Knight” at the $115k funding goal. It also included the Stretch Goal “Challenge Mode” reached at the $180k Stretch Goal. By people using ‘Kickstarter math’, that means we should have spent $35,000 developing the content.\n\nSome members of the team were involved with multiple projects at the same time as needed. Bug fixing, new language support, new regions, new features, and submissions on different platforms. Overall, we estimate these additions took less than 2-3 months of the team’s time.\n\n6% of players completed Plague of Shadows on Steam. This means roughly 20% of the people that beat Shovel Knight also continued on to finish Plague of Shadows.\n\nMetacritic has 4 or less reviews listed per platform for Plague of Shadows as opposed to 46 for the Shovel Knight base game. Plague of Shadows scored an 89, 4 points higher than Shovel Knight! Our thanks to websites who chose to cover Plague of Shadows as an entire new release, reviewing it, or featuring it at the end of the year.\n\nThere was a small increase in sales on the month Plague of Shadows was released, but in general, it appears to not have directly increased sales. But of course, it’s hard to say if Plague of Shadows is actually helping keep the game selling at its current rate as opposed to dipping since, as we mentioned above, sales are remaining strong.\n\nOn some storefronts and systems, you might not even know Plague of Shadows exists! There are plenty of hooks out there to promote sales, DLC, and re-releases…but it can be unexpectedly challenging to promote free updates to a base game.\n\nWe’ve received a surprising number of requests from people begging us to let them give us money for Plague of Shadows that we’ve now setup a cool donation button on our site. Don’t worry though, you can actually download some pretty cool art with it too! Picking up official merchandise is also a great way to show support and get something rad! If you’re interested in other ways to support the game, anything from telling a friend, writing up your honest impressions on Steam, or a star rating on Amazon goes along way to help!\n\nAfter hearing all that, you might be thinking…”Wait. you weren’t kidding! Isn’t Yacht Club currently developing two more campaigns just like Plague of Shadows!?”. The answer is…yes! From the very beginning, way back when in Kickstarter land, we’ve always done our best to scale up Shovel Knight to exceed the amazing level of support the game has received and we plan to continue doing so with the major game updates too. In the end, we just want to make great content for our fans. We hope that everyone tries Plague of Shadows sometime and sees how much love we squeezed into every pixel! Seriously, go play it. Next time we do a sales article, we want to see Plague of Shadows higher than 6%!!\n\namiibo Figure Sales\n\nWe hope to provide a very in-depth article about how the Shovel Knight amiibo was made soon. So stay tuned for that! In the meantime, here’s a bit about its sales so far. Believe it or not, we actually ordered over 200,000 units to be manufactured and shipped all over the world. We’ve currently sold through 180,000 of those units since the amiibo figure launched January 8th. 60,000 of those going to Europe and the rest going to North America. The sales for the amiibo figure are still strong, enough so that our North American distribution branch decided to order 30,000 more units! Here’s a breakdown of US amiibo figures per major retailer:\n\nSome facts worth noting:\n\nWhen we were considering the possibility of releasing before Christmas, we would have launched with just 25k units in the US. We sold 75k units in our first week! We are very glad we delayed the release until after Chirstmas- after all, that would have been a lot of would be knights left out in the cold.\n\nEurope and Canada have almost sold out of units!\n\nWe sold about 10k units in March in North America.\n\nThe amiibo only sells online at Wal-Mart because our distributor was worried we couldn’t keep all 10,000 stores in America full with stock.\n\nThe amiibo did not increase game sales as much as we might have expected. During January, we saw a small bump in sales, particularly on Wii U, but only slightly higher than normal. The strongest benefit was Wii U physical sales, which probably sold around 3k more than we expected for that month.\n\nWe spent 3 months of everyone’s full attention developing, playtesting, and iterating on the amiibo content! In other words, just the game content cost the development team $240,000. In our in-depth amiibo article, we'll detail how much we get from each unit. Be sure to check that out in the near future!\n\nMiscellaneous Facts\n\nHere’s some stuff you may or may not want to know:\n\nWe really, really wanted to provide a grand total of how many emails we have received and responded to since the project’s start. However, we couldn’t accurately capture it in data format. Suffice to say, its a lot. With just rough checks on our public facing addresses, we have received over 30k, and we make it a point to respond to each and every one of them! Just one team member here alone has sent more over 6330!\n\nWe have written over 17,000 tweets with a great majority of these being replies. Not bad considering we did not know how to use Twitter before starting Yacht Club Games! One of our most popular tweets is, somewhat perplexingly, this.\n\nMost watched single YouTube video: >1.5 million views! Most watched YouTube Playlist: >3.9 million views\n\nHalf as many babies were born during Shovel Knight’s development as people that work at Yacht Club (that’s 4 babies)\n\nOver 16,000 commits have been made to the Shovel Knight game repository.\n\nWhen localization first started, the original game’s English text was around 11,500 words. It is now at 22,219 words in English and a combined total of 108,362 words across English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish.\n\nOur build tech has grown too! We've gone from personally building each and every version of the game to three servers crunching away on new builds each and every change! It takes less than one hour for the servers to generate all 54 build configurations which are always ready to go (all platforms, regions, internal, stable, etc). We've had 19883 automated builds made since November 2014. A special thanks to TeamCity and JetBrains for their friendly and accommodating support!\n\n414,653 lines of code and counting, not counting 3rd party or tools ... and 0 warnings!\n\nIt’s Not Over Yet!\n\nWe’re still working away on the rest of the Kickstarter Stretch goals. King Knight’s campaign, Specter Knight’s campaign, Body Swap, and 4 Player Battle Mode are all being worked on at the moment. Also in production is the final Kickstarter reward: the Shovel Knight art book (lots of great stuff on the way in that department!). We hope to finally conclude Shovel Knight’s long development journey at the end of this year. It’s been a really fun few years, and we couldn’t be more grateful that you’ve all supported us through this time. We never though we’d be doing things like this, from making a game so beloved, getting to revisit and re-imagine it from another character’s point of view, releasing an amiibo figure, even to making a crazy awesome plush collection!!\n\nThank you again for your amazing support! We are so, so humbled. Thank you!\n\nWe hope everyone is looking forward to the upcoming Shovel Knight updates, and everything from Yacht Club Games! Congrats on making it through this very long article, here's a summary!\n\nFor now, here’s a tiny glimpse at playable Specter Knight’s run animation. As is the tradition! Now get excited, haha! Now and forever!",

I think I speak for many residents of the DC area when I say we’re glad you’re coming to Washington (well, at least your money is). This town has needed an infusion of excitement for a long time, and with the lame-duck Obama Administration lacking in any second-term surprises and the NFL post-season months away, your arrival may be the jolt we need.\n\nFor me, the best part is you’ve rode into town to save an institution so venerable it has its own John Phillips Sousa march. Yes, The Washington Post of the past few years has been like a treasured uncle who is way past his prime. He’s fading and there’s not much that can be done about it, but you just can’t imagine the place without him. Sure, lots of things have been done to try and prop up the old fellow, but the end seemed as inevitable as a Lindsay Lohan moving violation.\n\nSo Jeff, here you are to save our beloved Post.\n\nNow lots of people have wondered just what you have in mind to restore the paper’s glory. Of course, you really don’t know the first thing about running a sophisticated global newsgathering operation that maintains the highest journalistic standards. And there was that interview you gave in November where you weren’t exactly supportive of the newspaper business:\n\n“About one thing I am certain: In 20 years there will be no more printed newspapers. If they do exist, they will be considered a luxury item for certain hotels to offer as an extravagant service for their guests. Printed newspapers will no longer be normal in 20 years.”\n\nSo if I were a Post employee, should I be looking for other opportunities?\n\nYes… and no.\n\nThe fact is Jeff, you spent $250M on the NEWSPAPER part of The Washington Post Company… not the TV stations or the Kaplan educational service (which are profitable). You bought the printers-ink-smeared part of the company filled with newspapers, reporters and printing presses. Yet, you wouldn’t throw money at something you intend to shut down. You’re not a gazzilionnaire for being dumb… or making bad business decisions.\n\nYou’ve got something in mind for the Post, haven’t you Jeff 😉\n\nWell like a newspaper advice columnist from days of old, let me fill up a few column inches here Jeff with some thoughts that you can take or leave in your new venture:\n\n“Three Ways to Make The Washington Post Great Again”\n\n#1– Leverage that Legendary Amazon Customer Service Strategy\n\nNow I realize that Amazon didn’t buy the Post, Jeff… your personal fortune did. Yet you created at Amazon one of the most remarkable customer service operations in the world. Through those sometimes-creepy ‘Recommendations’ lists as well as your awesome product return policies, you made the Amazon experience one that is the envy of the consumer industry. Sure, you crushed all those bricks-and-mortar businesses along the way (and you’re going to need those surviving retailers to drive local ad sales for the Post), but looking past those burning remains for a moment Jeff, you know how to interact with two key constituents for The Post’s future sustainability: the residents you reach and the businesses with whom you help connect them.\n\n• What do RESIDENTS of the Washington region want in terms of news, information and entertainment that so far the Post and its sister newspapers (including the Gazette here in Montgomery County) have not delivered?\n\n• In an age of numerous marketing and sales opportunities, what do BUSINESSES want from an organization like The Post to help drive customer transactions? These are fundamental questions that every news organization is facing today Jeff, it will be fascinating to see what you learn from your customer service experience.\n\n#2– Dump the “I Wanna Be a Local CNN” stuff and focus on Hyperlocal\n\nYes Jeff, every business needs to have video as part of their content strategy… especially news organizations. But the way The Post has been approaching video is utterly flawed. Seriously Jeff, take a look at some of the things they have been attempting… boring expert/reporter interviews that can be seen on a half-dozen other national cable channels… and lame attempts to get Post reporters on camera. Why would the public want to watch this stuff? Jeff, your content needs to be unique and distinctive. Look instead at the local, even hyperlocal resources that you already have across the region. Here in Montgomery County, you still have a small number of reporters and editors (and yes, cutbacks have really decimated their ranks the last few years) who are doing good work and creating unique stories seen nowhere else. With a little help, you could leverage that content into constantly available on-demand video via your website and pushed out to the community through social media and old-fashioned emails. Permission marketing and audience engagement is the type of relationship-building that The Post desperately needs… and you understand intimately, Jeff.\n\n#3—Don’t Dump the Presses Just Yet, but….\n\nAll this week Jeff, the rumors have been flying that you will want to turn off the presses, dump the printed version of The Post (and some of its other not-so-profitable newspapers) and move everything online… maybe even create some sort of Kindle version of The Post. Well, that would certainly be a huge shift from where things are today. A recent survey of national daily newspapers showed that The Post lags far behind others in the industry in establishing paid content online and other digital offerings. Long-ago, I ended my own weekly subscription to The Post, opting to just keep the weekend edition and grab whatever I need online. I see fewer and fewer newspaper bags at the end of my neighbors’ driveways these days, and the Gazette often just rots at the curb unopened. People’s news & information habits have altered dramatically in a short period of time, and mobile devices are increasingly able to handle video and electronic content so that printed sources are becoming obsolete (as you said yourself Jeff just last year). Yet the value of The Post brand is its newsgathering capability as well as its reputation for thoughtful reporting and commentary. In an age of mile-wide-and-inch-deep news coverage, The Post can find a sustainable economic model by leveraging quality journalism that can be found nowhere else in Washington DC… and delivering that when and how the consumer wants.\n\nJeff, I believe that our community deserves a world-class news organization like The Washington Post. Certainly, others will come onto an already crowded playing field, competing for those local eyeballs and ad sales dollars. There are others who will do a better job then you in specific story genres, or in super-serving individual communities. Still others will outmatch you in video, or create a better platform to facilitate local business. As hockey legend Wayne Gretzky said about his success: “I don’t go where the puck is, but where it’s going to be.” I hope you’ll leverage your experience to have the community tell you where they want you to be.\n\nI’m glad you’re here, Jeff. Now strike up The Washington Post March and get to work.\n\nLike this post? Sign up for our Daily Update here",

  "latent_1739": "+ T -\n\nПоделиться:\n\nФото: из личного архива матери погибшего\n\nПавел Никулин рассказывает историю гибели десантника Николая Курасова, за издевательства над которым его сослуживца только оштрафовали\n\nФотография на память\n\nРядовой Багаутдинов служил в ВДВ в военной части Уссурийска. Рядового Багаутдинова боялись сослуживцы и старались ему не перечить. Согласно материалам уголовного дела, в январе 2015 года рядовой Багаутдинов решил похвастаться перед друзьями и заставил семерых сослуживцев выстроиться лицом к стене без маек. На их спинах он хотел написать пеной для бритья слово «Татарин».\n\nУголовное дело по обвинению бывшего военнослужащего Багаутдинова Р.Р. Фото: из личного архива матери погибшего\n\n«Если ты, русская тварь, не встанешь, я тебя уничтожу прям здесь», — такими словами, согласно материалам дела, Багаутдинов требовал от военнослужащих в/ч 71289 воздушно-десантных войск подчиниться его воле, чтобы запечатлеть их на снимке.\n\nОдин из парней отказался сниматься: «Мой дед не затем воевал, чтобы ты меня унижал!» Багаутдинов, как говорится в материалах уголовного дела, переубедил сослуживца своеобразно: повалил на пол и несколько раз ударил ногой в висок, приговаривая: «Твое место в этом строю, русский».\n\nМетод оказался действенным. Фотография Багаутдинова на фоне сослуживцев собрала на его странице «ВКонтакте» много одобрительных комментариев и лайков.\n\n«Он чувствовал себя королем во взводе, пользовался непререкаемым авторитетом, как у военнослужащих по призыву, так и по контракту <…> Постоянно заставлял отжиматься <…>, наносил удары тыльной стороной ладони по шее сзади. От данных ударов была сильная боль, но синяков не оставалось», — вспоминали в показаниях сослуживцы Багаутдинова.\n\nСломанный нос сержанта\n\nРядовой Коля Курасов поступил в уссурийскую воинскую часть из учебки через полгода после этой истории — 28 мая 2015 года. Курасов мечтал служить, гордился тем, что его взяли именно в ВДВ. Молодой, сильный и уверенный в себе рядовой Курасов еще в учебке зарекомендовал себя жестким и справедливым парнем: сослуживцы помнят, как он отказался подчиняться незаконным требованиям сержанта и сломал тому нос.\n\nРядовой Курасов не понравился рядовому Багаутдинову, а рядовой Багаутдинов не понравился рядовому Курасову. Такие вещи случаются, и это, в общем-то, не катастрофа. Однако в этой истории был нюанс. Рядовой Багаутдинов, которому до дембеля оставалось всего ничего, решил перевоспитать рядового Курасова.\n\n«Больше всего Багаутдинов не любил Курасова, потому что Николай по прибытии в роту поставил себя как опытного военнослужащего, пришедшего из учебки, а Багаутдинова это раздражало. Каждый день Багаутдинов подзывал Курасова и бил», — рассказывали сослуживцы военным следователям.\n\nПодобное обращение Коля терпел не долго. 18 июня он сбежал в Уссурийск к друзьям из Сельхозакадемии, в которой учился до армии. Днем Курасов уже был на пороге общаги и ждал, пока спустятся приятели. На их глазах Колю скрутили подоспевшие офицеры, затолкали в машину и увезли в часть.\n\nНиколай Курасов. Фото: из личного архива матери погибшего\n\nВот как это описал один из очевидцев: «Из автомобиля вышли четыре человека, один из которых был в гражданской форме одежды, он сразу пошел в сторону общежития, а трое военнослужащих подбежали к нам, самый здоровый из них, с внешностью бурята, сказал Николаю: «Че, обезьяна, добегался?» — оглушил его ударом ладоней обеих рук по ушам и нанес один удар кулаком правой руки в область солнечного сплетения, затащил его в машину, и они уехали. Все это произошло так быстро, что мы даже не успели опомниться».\n\n«Моего сына нашли повешенным…»\n\nНа следующий день после побега Курасов увидел мать, которой и рассказал о причине побега. Офицеры вроде бы с пониманием отнеслись к ситуации и перевели Колю в медроту. Обещали, что он будет звонить домой.\n\n«22 июня в 7:30 мне на мобильный телефон позвонил командир моего сына и долго молчал в трубку. Когда трубку взял мой муж, он ему сказал, что моего сына нашли повешенным», — вспоминала Оксана Михайлова в показаниях.\n\nКоля висел в душевой на петле, сделанной из лямок вещмешка, скрученных «восьмеркой». В трусах и тельняшке. С глубоким страгуляционным следом на шее.\n\nВ материалах уголовного дела говорится, что его нашли уже холодным, но почему-то решили вытащить из петли, не дожидаясь следователей.\n\nМать погибшего солдата уверена, что Колю убили. Отомстили за то, что не стал подчиняться дедам. Однако следствие и суд не установили виновных в гибели рядового Курасова.\n\nЛямки вещмешка, из которых была сделана петля, в которой нашли рядового Николая Курасова. Фото: из личного архива матери погибшего\n\nБагаутдинова, который был на скамье подсудимых, судили за скандальное фото со словом «Татарин» («возбуждение ненависти либо вражды, а равно унижение человеческого достоинства, путем применения физического насилия по отношению к группе лиц, по признаку национальности, совершенные публично с использованием сети «Интернет») и за короткую стычку с Колей (неуставщина) — сослуживцы подтвердили, что видели, как он несколько раз бил Курасова кулаком.\n\nВесь процесс юристы фонда «Право матери» обращали внимание суда и государственного обвинителя на противоречия в материалах дела и неверную квалификацию предъявленного обвинения.

А они верили и боролись. И вместо колонии-поселения (так первоначально «наказали» виновного за моего Колю), они посадили злодея на пять лет и восемь месяцев реального срока. Ни один адвокат не работал бы по моему делу так долго, с таким упорством и такой верой в правду». В фонде убеждены, что дело о гибели Коли Курасова касается нас всех.

  "latent_1808": "It doesn’t look any better in the light of day I guess. While losing to the best team out there shouldn’t carry too much shame, you still feel the Hawks had a hand in their own destruction. We’ve been here for four exits, they’ve all been different. 2009 was simply not being ready and being outclassed, and that was the beginning. 2011 hurt because it was Vancouver and the Hawks were so close to pulling off that upset, but they really had no business even getting to a Game 7 and needed the Canucks to turn off for two games to do so. The Hawks wouldn’t have gone much farther that year anyway.\n\nIt’s a little similar to 2012, where you definitely felt the Hawks left something out there. That was also self-inflicted, or partly, due to Crawford’s bad OT goals, a roster with holes again, and a great performance from Mike Smith.\n\nBut we have to sort out the rubble, so let’s do so.\n\nThe seeds of this defeat were sewn last July and August and into training camp. We’ve been saying it all year, really. It’s when Stan Bowman decided to basically stand still and watch the rest of the West try and catch him instead of maintain the distance. Handzus was re-signed, Bolland and Frolik were launched for picks (which is still probably the right move), and no new faces were brought in. Counting on career years again from so many of the players the Hawks got it from in 2013 seemed a risk.\n\nAnd yet, that’s ever so slightly on the harsh side for Stan. Not that he’s blameless, because he’s not. However, multiple times last summer, in interviews before, at, and after the draft and free agency, Stan repeatedly said that it was time to start filling holes with the kids in the system. That was the only way the Hawks could maintain their excellence long-term in a cap era, which is correct. And repeatedly, he highlighted Brandon Pirri leading the AHL in scoring and how he had earned his chance with the big club.\n\nThe Hawks showed up at training camp (and this was before Pirri got hurt, mind), and the first thing Joel Quenneville did was install Brandon Saad at center. And he didn’t know that Saad had never played center before. I feel like we didn’t make a big deal out of this at the time, and we should have paid more attention. It spoke to a disconnection between coach and GM (again), as well as the mad-scientist nature of the head coach, whether it’s beneficial to his team or not.\n\nBut the season started, and we all became blinded by the brilliance of the Hawks top end. Toews, Sharp, Kane, and Hossa were all scoring, Keith looked to be back on form, Hjalmarsson was at least as good this year as he was last and maybe better, and that’s more than enough to win a lot of hockey games in the first half of a regular season.\n\nAnd yet, when you looked a little deeper, there were some signs that all was not well, In 2013, the Hawks had a third line that all were on pace for a 17-20 goal season had it been a full one in Bickell-Shaw-Stalberg. They were a forechecking nightmare for teams. That wasn’t there this year, and from the off. Shaw was Shaw, but coming off knee surgery and some misuse from Q, Bickell wasn’t the same. They didn’t have a regular winger for a while. Morin came up in November for about seven games, combined really well with Saad, and then was never seen again until March.\n\nThe Hawks had Frolik and Kruger on the 4th line. Fro was replaced by Ben Smith, which wasn’t much of a dropoff in the end. But when Smith was needed elsewhere, it basically became a lineup whack-a-mole game with problems popping up whenever another one was plugged.\n\nTrying to fix this, Versteeg was traded for. It’s easy to criticize now, and should be. At the time when you got over the “getting the band back together” aspect, it seemed odd that Dale Tallon–who had acquired Versteeg twice–was so ready to get rid of him that he’d eat half his salary. Versteeg was also coming off knee surgery. And really, no one thought it would end up this bad.\n\nStill, Versteeg spent most of the regular season on the top six, even when he didn’t produce. I can’t fathom that’s what Stan had in mind. He spent it on the other side of Kane and Pirri, which was an odd place for Pirri. I still wonder what Pirri would have looked like if given two-way forwards in Hossa and Sharp. We know what Kane would have done with Toews and Saad. Was this really maximizing the roster? Or was Q setting up a kid he clearly didn’t like to fail?\n\nSadly, the Versteeg trade handcuffed Stan when it came to the cap, and he was basically out of moves. But it wasn’t just that. Handzus, carrying an 8th d-man, Bollig, all of these contracts erased could have opened up just enough to do something at the deadline to solidify down the middle. It didn’t happen.\n\nStan did get Peter Regin, and every time he was deployed at center (which he wasn’t always) looked effective. He had feet and brains, which is not a combination most of the bottom six could boast. I’ll grudgingly, very grudgingly, accept that maybe Morin and Nordstrom had too big of faults in their game to be trusted in the playoffs (very, very grudgingly). But the non-use of Regin is borderline criminal, and it came home to roost in this series when the Hawks were exposed for depth, especially down the middle.\n\nAnd yet, their stars almost pulled it out. Corey Crawford and Jonathan Toews got them out against the Blues (with some help from Kane). Crawford and Toews and Hossa did it again against Minnesota (again with some late help from Kane once he got away from Handzus). But we could see that it wasn’t the normal way the Hawks usually beat teams. They were surviving, not triumphing. The warning signs were there.\n\nIn the end, Toews simply couldn’t overcome Kopitar for seven games. The Kings top line got better as the series went along. The Hawks’ didn’t. And even though Kane and Saad nearly rescued it, it wasn’t enough. And it wasn’t enough because the Hawks decided to not have enough. Even Regin could have made a small difference in this series, and considering how close it was, a small difference may have been all that was needed. Even if it was just giving the other guys just enough rest to give them just enough additional punch.\n\nThe Kings didn’t do much in the offseason either. But after blooding Toffoli last year, and Pearson this year, and making the trade for Gaborik, look at how they ate up the difference in speed to the Hawks from last year. It doesn’t take an overhaul from year to year. But it does take tweaking from within and outside the organization.\n\nSo what now? A lot of it is automatic. Handzus will retire (though that won’t stop Q from playing him). Brookbank will walk. Teuvo Teravainen and Stephen Johns will be inserted immediately, which will make the Hawks deeper at forward with just that. What excites me most about Teuvo, and he won’t be Nicklas Backstrom but he could put up 45-50 points, which for a 2C on the Hawks seems like Valhalla, is that he locks things into place. It doesn’t make too much sense for Kane and Teuvo to play together, which puts Kane with Toews all season and Teuvo with Hossa. Should be a thing.\n\nThere are other moves coming. The obvious and likely one is Oduya to be moved at the draft. He slowed down during the year, the Hawks need cap space, and Stan has shown a tendency to move a guy a year before his deal is up to recoup picks. It opens up a spot for Johns, though the Hawks will be replacing a transition d-man with someone who’s going to be more of a stay-at-home guy (though Johns does have offensive talent). So the Hawks will have to sort out who will be their third puck-mover, a model they need. Maybe Clendening gets a look on the third pairing, but I doubt it.\n\nThe real ballsy move would be to listen on Seabrook, who has put up two years of underwhelming play. But that would be a far bigger splash than Stan has ever made. The free agent market for d-men this summer is awful, and you could basically name your price if #7 were on the block. But again, don’t see it.\n\nThe Hawks also have to start to plan how they transition from Hossa and Sharp. Saad looks to be your Hossa replacement down the road, obviously. But those two are going to be 36 and 33 next season, and there’s only a couple seasons left when you can count on them to be some of the best players in the league. It doesn’t have to be next year, but things should start to be put in place.\n\nBut mostly, the Hawks need to streamline their GM’s and coach’s relationship, because it’s just been off for years. They seem to be playing at different games, and then it seems like Stan folds to Q’s wishes. Maybe he fears a real power struggle will see Q win out with McD and Rocky, and that’s probably true. But there are other kids besides Teravainen and Johns who could contribute at points next season. I doubt Morin would ever consider re-signing, but if he did there’s one. McNeill and Danault and Ross and Nordstrom could come up for air as well, and when they do they have to be used if for no other reason to see what they are.\n\nStan’s also going to have to get his veteran free agency signing right, and this has been a weakness of his. He looks to be a pretty good drafter, and his trades have worked out more often than they haven’t. But the guy he signs in the summer to just add a little something have generally not worked out. Rozsival is about the only one that did. The Hawks will need a piece or two from outside the organization, and they still won’t have enough financial flexibility to trade their way out of it if Stan bones it again.\n\nSummer too early. Hopefully Stan makes it one we can at least use to look forward to next year.",
  "latent_1952": "Deciding whether to make a deal with the devil is always a dilemma born of desperation, and it seems to be the grim choice facing the Central American nation of El Salvador and its Catholic leadership today.\n\nCiting figures from the country’s National Civil Police, media outlets reported on Monday that at least 481 people were murdered in El Salvador in March, an average of 16 homicides every day, mostly related to conflict among rival criminal gangs. That’s a stunning tally for a country of just 6 million people, and represents a 52 percent spike over the same month last year.\n\nThe carnage is mostly the result of the collapse of a truce between El Salvador’s two largest gangs, MS-13 and Barrio 18. Given estimates that gang membership in the country may be as high as 65,000, any uptick in hostility is devastating. Experts believe that if something doesn’t change by year’s end, El Salvador will displace its neighbor Honduras as the world’s most dangerous nation outside a war zone.\n\nBack in 2012, the leadership of the Catholic Church was split over whether to take part in negotiations involving gang leaders and government officials that led to the truce.\n\nBishop Fabio Colindres, who heads the country’s military diocese, agreed to serve as a backdoor mediator. InSight Crime, a Colombia-based foundation that studies organized crime in the Americas, reported that his participation was crucial in convincing both the public and political elites that détente was in the national interest.\n\nYet Colindres was disowned by the leaders of the bishops’ conference. After the truce was reached, the conference released a statement saying that it “has not produced any benefits for the honorable and hard-working population.”\n\nIn effect, the gangs agreed to curb violence in exchange for concessions such as better prison conditions. Murder rates fell, but polls showed the deal was widely unpopular, in part because gang members may have stopped killing each other, but they didn’t refrain from crime that affects ordinary people, such as robbery, kidnapping, and extortion, nor did they stop slugging it out with police. At least 40 police officers were killed in 2014 alone.\n\n“The ceasefire meant the gangs could stop killing each other and concentrate their operations on extorting the rest of us,” Elena Sanchez, a fruit stall owner, told the UK-based Telegraph in February. “Let them kill each other and give the rest of us a break.”\n\nIn one measure of popular frustration, a group of businessmen in El Salvador announced in January that they had hired Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York mayor famed for his “zero tolerance” approach to petty crime, to dispatch a fact-finding mission to propose ways to make crackdowns more effective.\n\nOthers, however, believe that the only way to solve the problem is through a revival of talks with the gangs, and many in that camp are looking to the Catholic Church to take the lead as the country’s most trusted social institution.\n\n“I think they’re the only partner with enough credibility to make it happen,” said Héctor Silva, a Salvadoran author and research fellow at American University, in a February interview with Reuters.\n\nSo far, the bishops’ line seems to be “yes” to dialogue, but only through official government channels. They do not appear prepared to act on their own.\n\nIn February, Auxiliary Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chávez of San Salvador said the Church is open to dialogue with gang members, though not “negotiations,” especially at the pastoral level. Given that Chávez was a close collaborator of El Salvador’s revered Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was killed in 1980 and who will be beatified as a martyr in May, he has wide moral authority.\n\n“Dialogue should be open to everyone, and everyone has to be an actor in this peace process,” Chávez told reporters in mid-February.\n\nChávez pointed out that El Salvador’s civil war during the 1980s and 90s was finally ended not by ramped-up military efforts, but talks between the government and rebel groups.\n\n“When one wants to find solutions to violence by using more violence, it won’t work,” he said. “We’ve got to break the molds and change paradigms, or else the deaths will keep piling up, increasing the pain of the families.”\n\nAfter Chávez spoke, his boss, Archbishop José Luis Escobar Alas of San Salvador, clarified that while the doors of the Church are always open, Church leaders will not take part in any “secret” talks. That was likely a reference to the fact that certain politicians have tried to set themselves up as informal mediators, even though the government of leftist President Salvador Sánchez Cerén so far has ruled out direct negotiations.\n\nAny role for the Church, Escobar said, can only come through a transparent government initiative.\n\nIn part, the bishops’ reluctance to take the lead may reflect a split at the grassroots over whether dialogue is the only hope to stop the killing, or whether it simply emboldens hardened criminals to hold the threat of another rampage over the country’s head.\n\nThere are also real perils for Church personnel who try to act as mediators, and not just the risk of violence.\n\nLast year, a Catholic priest named Rev. Antonio Rodriguez, known as “Padre Toño”, was forced to make a deal with prosecutors who charged him with being an accessory to Barrio 18 leaders, allegedly smuggling cell phones into their jails. Rodriguez claimed he was trying to persuade them to uphold the truce, but ended up having to leave the country.\n\nThere’s also the danger that public opinion will turn an attempted peacemaker into a villain if a deal falls apart. When Colindres washed and kissed the feet of gang members during an Easter rite in 2014, the media excoriated him for coddling criminals. He pulled out of the dialogue and refuses to discuss the issue today.\n\nFelix Arevalo, a Baptist pastor in San Salvador, says many church leaders fear backlash from their flocks if they reach out to the gangs.\n\n“The church responds to a religious marketplace that doesn’t demand a call to forgive our enemies or work for peace even at the cost of our lives,” Arevalo told The Christian Century in March. “The market demands a vindictive god, a repressive god, so that’s what the church offers.”\n\nMoreover, gang violence is so widespread that it often spills over to the churches.\n\nAs Carlos Colorado has written at Tim’s El Salvador Blog, in 2014 alone, six members of an Evangelical church were killed in Tacuba; the Pentecostal Elim Church reported attacks against its members; an 84-year-old guard at the historic “Don Rua” church, a Catholic parish, was murdered, and a man was shot dead at “La Luz del Mundo” Evangelical Church. Churchgoers complain of being hassled before and after services, and some stay away out of fear.\n\nMuch of that violence may be random, but observers believe some gang leaders target Christian activists, especially ministers and other church personnel who try to persuade Salvadoran youth not to join.\n\nWhatever the explanation, there now appears to be a chicken-and-egg dynamic — the Church won’t get involved unless the government acts first, and the government needs political cover from the Church in order to act.\n\nLeanne Rikkers of FESPAD, a Salvadoran human rights organization, said a truce won’t last without the government’s support, and a blessing from the Church would provide essential political cover.\n\n“It’s setting a tone that this isn’t a political issue, it’s a moral issue, it’s a social issue, it’s a human rights issue,” Rikkers said. “For the Church to play that role is very important.”\n\nThe tension comes as the Church in El Salvador prepares for Romero’s May 23 beatification ceremony in San Salvador, which is expected to be one of the largest public events in the country’s history.\n\nSlain for his outspoken opposition to human rights abuses and government oppression, Romero became an icon of the progressive liberation theology movement in Catholicism that sought to place the Church on the side of the poor in struggles for social change.\n\nFor outsiders, Romero’s beatification likely will be a celebration of the past and the other martyrs of El Salvador’s civil war, including four American missionary nuns raped and killed by a military death squad in 1980 and six Jesuit priests, along with their housekeeper and her daughter, slain by the military in 1989.\n\nFor Salvadorans themselves, however, the focus may be more on the present, shaped by the realities of what InSight Crime calls “a criminal dynamic that is taking on overtones of a low-intensity war.”\n\nFacing blood in the streets and a perhaps understandably cautious body of bishops, the burning question for locals posed by the beatification may be, “What would Romero do?”",
  "latent_2058": "Pipes and bongs for sale.\n\nOperation Pipe Dreams was the code-name for a U.S. nationwide investigation in 2003 targeting businesses selling drug paraphernalia, mostly marijuana pipes and bongs, under a little-used statute (21 U.S.C. § 863(a)). Due to the reluctance of state law-enforcement agencies to contribute resources to the operation, most cases were filed in Iowa and Pennsylvania, taking advantage of the statute's prohibition on the use of \"the mails or any other facility of interstate commerce to transport drug paraphernalia.\"[1]\n\nHundreds of businesses and homes were raided as a result of Operation Pipe Dreams.[2] Fifty five people were named in indictments and charged with trafficking of illegal drug paraphernalia. While 54 of the 55 individuals charged were sentenced to fines and home detentions, actor Tommy Chong was sentenced September 11, 2003, to 9 months in a federal prison, a fine of $20,000, forfeiture of $103,000, and a year of probation. Chong was charged for his part in financing and promoting Chong Glass Works/Nice Dreams, California-based companies started by his son Paris. Unlike most shops selling bongs, Nice Dreams specialized in selling high-end bongs as collectible works of art. The Chong Glass Works employed 25 glass blowers who were paid $30/hour to produce 100 pipes a day.\n\nNice Dreams had a policy in place for refusing to sell bongs to states where the statute was being enforced. Federal agents, disguised as head-shop owners, pressured Paris Chong to sell them his pipes and deliver them through the mail to a fictitious shop in the Pittsburgh suburb of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. When Paris persistently refused, agents went to the place of business in person and ordered a massive quantity of out of stock merchandise. The merchandise was crafted but not picked up and sat idle in the warehouse as federal agents again pressured Paris to ship it. To get the merchandise out of his warehouse, Paris eventually agreed to ship it. In a Plea bargain, Chong agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia in exchange for non-prosecution of his wife, Shelby, and his son, Paris. Federal Prosecution admitted to being harsher on Chong in retaliation, citing Chong's movies as trivializing \"law enforcement efforts to combat drug trafficking and use.\"[3]\n\nThe estimated cost of Operation Pipe Dreams was over $12 million and included the resources of 2,000 law enforcement officers.[1][4]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

  "latent_2103": "For those unaware, today marks the 20th anniversary of the release of Super Mario Bros. 3 in North America. Having sold over 18 million copies worldwide, it still stands as one of the best-selling video games of all time - and that's not even accounting for the various remakes and re-releases of the game that have been released over the years.\n\nAfter a two-year development period, Super Mario Bros. 3 was released in Japan in October of 1988 to rave reviews and massive sales. The game was originally scheduled to be released in North America in the same year, but a serious shortage of ROM chips caused a rather lengthy 16 month delay. While this was certainly not good news for gamers anxious to get their hands on the newest Super Mario Bros. release, it did give Nintendo a chance to do some creative marketing and advertising using one of the longest video game commercials in history.\n\nThe 1989 movie The Wizard has long been called basically a 90 minute promo for Nintendo products, namely Super Mario Bros. 3. While the movie was panned for the most part, it represents a milestone for American game fans as it was their first opportunity to really see Super Mario Bros. 3 in action before its upcoming release two months later in February.\n\nAs a gamer, who could forget the immortal words of the Video Game Armageddon announcer Steven Grives as he announced \"So I give you - Super Mario Bros. 3!\" as the game popped up on the playing screens for all to see. That's the moment when the hype train officially pulled out of the station and anticipation for the upcoming release of the game reached an all-new height.\n\nVery few games in the history of video gaming have experienced the type of pre-release anticipation that Super Mario Bros. 3 enjoyed. The year and a half delay of the game's release in North America due to a shortage of ROM chips might have caused gamers a long wait to finally play the third installment of the Super Mario Bros. series, but it also managed to generate enough excitement to make the game one of the biggest selling video games in history.\n\nSo here we sit, 20 years to the day of the game's American release and the game is still just as fresh and fun as it ever was. Many of the ideas introduced in the game have gone on to become staples of the series, some even making an appearance in this past year's hit release of New Super Mario Bros. Wii.\n\nIn the end, what more can you say about a game as legendary and revered as Super Mario Bros. 3 that hasn't already been said many times over.

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nWASHINGTON - It's not a particularly strategic location, the United States and its allies never pledged to defend it, and few people outside the region had even heard of it before this month.\n\nBut the symbolism of US-led airstrikes failing to stop Islamic State militants from overrunning the Syrian city of Kobani could provide an early setback to US President Barack Obama's three-week old Syria air campaign - far beyond its battlefield importance.\n\nIf Islamic State seizes full control of the city - which US officials acknowledge is possible in coming days - it would be able to boast that it has withstood American air power. A US-led coalition has launched 50 strikes against militant positions around the city, most of those in the last four days.Islamic State also would be able to free up thousands of fighters to pursue territorial gains elsewhere in Syria and Iraq, analysts said.Inevitable questions would arise over Obama's pledge to keep US ground troops out of the fight and the strength of his international coalition. Turkey, whose border abuts Kobani, has declined to join military action against Islamic State.\"Judging the overall coalition from a single town in northern Syria ... is slightly unfair,\" said Shashank Joshi of London's Royal United Services Institute. \"But I think it will dent overall confidence in the coalition and it will concern many people as to whether the US can really stop this movement.\"A Kobani victory would also provide valuable propaganda for the Islamic State, which has proved adept at providing packaged video footage of its fighters in action, while the United States can only produce fuzzy pictures of air-launched bombs and missile blowing up often unidentifiable objects on the ground.Jeff White of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said Islamic State will \"claim it has been able to do this in the face of a US-led bombing campaign.\" The group's supporters \"will find that uplifting\" and its opponents depressing, White said.The city's fate also holds importance for Syria's Kurds, who have enjoyed a semi-independent region that includes Kobani after President Bashar Assad's grip on his country loosened.For Turkey, the loss of Kobani would appear to be a mixed blessing.Ankara opposes both Assad and Kurdish independence, and has done nothing to aid in Kobani's defense. But if the city falls, Islamic State will have stitched up a 250-kilometer (155-mile) stretch of territory along the Turkish border, according to some analyst estimates.Kobani has riveted international attention largely because of its proximity to Turkey - and television cameras there have captured the fighting just across the border.On Friday, Kurdish forces and Islamic State fighters were reported to be engaged in street battles within the city. A UN envoy said he feared a massacre of thousands of people if Islamic State was victorious.While Obama has said his aim is to degrade and ultimately defeat the Islamic State group, his first priority appears to be limiting its advance in Iraq. The air strikes in Syria are designed in part to deprive the group of safe haven there.US officials say putting so much emphasis on a single city misrepresents the US-led air campaign, which will take time. Much also depends on moderate Syrian rebels that Washington will train and equip, as well as US-backed Iraqi security forces.\"To hang Kobani around the military's neck represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the elements of the strategy we're pursuing and limits of military power in pursuing that strategy,\" said a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity.US officials, echoed by defense analysts, point out that Islamic State's siege of Kobani has forced the group to bring its military hardware out in the open, where warplanes have attacked it daily.\"They seem to really want Kobani and have their flags flying over it,\" a second US official said. \"They are paying a very heavy price.\"The US government says there will be no change in Obama's strategy - which rules out US troops in ground combat in both Iraq and Syria - if Kobani falls.But if it turns out that coalition air power alone was unable to help the Kurds hold Kobani, that \"might prompt a redefinition\" of Obama's \"no boots on the ground\" pledge, said retired veteran US diplomat James Dobbins.Dobbins, now at the Rand Corporation think tank, predicted the limits of air power around Kobani would accelerate a debate within the administration over deploying advisers and forward air controllers on the ground - but in Iraq, where they would partner with Iraqi security forces, rather than in Syria.White, of the Washington Institute, said Obama's lengthy timeline for battling Islamic State might also come into question.\"They're fighting the war on their terms,\" he said of Islamic State. \"Their timeline and our timeline don't coincide.\"\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

Suffice it to say that that is A LOT of permutations. “That’s actually a lot more than the total number of atoms in the universe!” he writes.\n\nLuckily, there’s a better way to solve the problem. Mehyar uses a program called Concorde that whittles down the possibility space by using algorithm branches, allowing it figure out what is closest to an exact optimum path as possible. “Since we don’t have that many nodes, and the distance metric (symmetric geometric distance) is relatively simple,” the coder said.

  "latent_2604": "Kano, Nigeria - She was taken out of primary school at the age of 12 to marry a man in his 40s whom she had never met before. At first, Balaraba Ramat Yakubu enjoyed the presents she received at the wedding and the golden ornaments decorating her new home, but she had no idea what marriage was about.\n\nToday, that illiterate girl who didn't even know how to boil water and who, one year and eight months after the wedding, was finally sent back to her father's house in disgrace, has become one of northern Nigeria's most well-known writers and the first female Hausa-language author to be translated into English.\n\n\"If you know where I came from, you'll realise how much I have fought,\" says the 57-year-old author of nine novels.\n\nResentment resounds in her voice when she speaks of the end of her first marriage. \"It still pains me,\" she says. \"My husband never told me that he loved me, that he wanted me. And then one day someone just came and took me back to my parents.\n\n\"He said I was too young. Didn't he know that when he married a child?\"\n\nYakubu used this traumatic experience in her novel Wa Zai Auri Jahila? (Who Would Marry an Ignorant Woman?), published in 1990, in which 13-year-old Abu gets pulled out of school to be married off to a big-bellied man more than three times her age.\n\nBut like Yakubu, Abu does not remain a victim: She finds a better life through education.\n\nThe book is a statement against child marriage as well as a plea for girls' education, something that was not the norm during Yakubu's childhood in Kano, the largest city in Nigeria's predominantly-Muslim north. Girls in her father's family were not allowed a Western education; they were sent to Quranic schools until they were ready to marry - preferably before they had their first menstrual period.\n\nRead: Meet the Nigerian woman taking on Boko Haram\n\nAccording to a National Literacy Survey from 2010, almost half of the women in northern Nigeria cannot read or write in any language.\n\nThe only reason Yakubu attended primary school at all was because her mother had sent her there in secret. At the time, she recalls, she was the only girl among her grandfather's 80 female grandchildren who went to primary school. When her father discovered it, his response was the arranged marriage.\n\nHer older brother, Murtala, was vehemently opposed to the wedding, but could not stop it. He was the one who had encouraged her mother to send his little sister to primary school in the first place. \"My brother had only my best interest in mind,\" says Yakubu, who still does not like to talk about his death. Forty years ago, her brother, who was by then Nigeria's military ruler, was assassinated in his car on the way to Dodan Barracks in Lagos.\n\nYakubu was 17 years old when her brother died. Until today, she refuses to read anything about Murtala Muhammed's murder, and she has never visited Lagos' National Museum, which exhibits the bullet-riddled Mercedes in which her brother was shot. But she misses him every day.\n\nCoconspirator\n\nAfter her first divorce, her mother again became her co-conspirator. Yakubu had pleaded with her father to allow her to enrol for knitting and sewing courses. What she didn't tell him, though, was that those courses had introduced her to a centre for adult education.\n\nSo when she went out with her sewing machine, it was actually to learn how to read and write Hausa, the language of the largest ethnic group and the lingua franca in the north of Nigeria. \"Only my mother knew,\" Yakubu remembers. \"She helped cover for me when my father asked where I was.\"\n\nIn the meantime, she sewed as many baby dresses as she could in order to sell, this serving as an alibi for all the time she spent away from home.\n\nWhen one day her father found her primary school diploma in her bag, he reacted by revealing to his daughter that he'd found another suitor. Yakubu was 15, but gladly accepted the marriage: She was happy to have completed elementary education and felt she was now mature enough to face a relationship.\n\nVery quickly, though, it became clear that she had learned too much to fit into the role of the obedient wife. Always reading the newspapers and asking questions, always looking up words she didn't know, she was too independent for her spouse's liking. In this marriage, she had her first child, a son, but after three years, she was again sent back to her parents.\n\nWhen she returned home, she announced to her father that this time she was insisting on continuing her education. And he accepted. \"Maybe because he'd grown older, he was now much softer. That was my hallelujah moment,\" she says.\n\nAt 18, she started her studies at the Kano State Agency for Mass Education, where she would eventually teach Hausa to other women.\n\nGoing Places: Girls' Education in Ghana\n\nAble to provide for herself and with a fulfilling career, Yakubu still hadn't given up on matrimony. But in Hausa society, a single adult woman is not respected, and she tried marriage two more times and had five children in total. Her fourth and final marriage, which she describes as a happy one, ended when her husband decided to take a second wife. \"I knew what I wanted now and refused to take the abuse that I'd taken before,\" she explains.\n\nNow, she is no longer looking for a man, even though she knows how the community perceives her.\n\n\"A happy divorcee is viewed with suspicion. People describe me as strong-headed because I don't need a man.\"\n\nRomance novels\n\nThe bookshelves in her modest two-bedroom bungalow display all nine of her novels - well-known titles, some of which are even listed in the secondary school curriculum.\n\n\"These days, I'm fortunate: When people see my name on something, they want to read it,\" Yakubu says, leaning back in the couch in her sitting room and rearranging her white chador.\n\nHer popularity did not come overnight. After she published her first novel in 1987, religious leaders would preach against her, and she would receive threatening letters denouncing her and her children, which she described as \"the most hurtful thing you can do to a mother\".\n\nAs a female Hausa writer, Yakubu is seen as one of the pioneers of the \"soyayya\" genre. These romance novels (soyayya means love) written by northern Nigerian women, have become very popular among female readers in that part of the country. At every market in Kano, stalls sell these books and female customers - from veiled schoolgirls to grandmothers - can be seen browsing through the books.\n\nWhen I write, I feel lifted. I grew up with a strong father whom I could not confront. My books gave me a window to express myself. I write my stories as if I was in your house, or at your neighbours'. Women recognise them. I feel I have an obligation to society to tell those stories that otherwise would not have been told. Balaraba Ramat Yakubu, author\n\nThe books tell everyday stories of the lives of northern women and address issues like rape, polygamy and domestic violence.\n\nEven though soyayya novels are deeply pious in tone and portray marriage as the single most important goal in a woman's life, in the strict Islamic north of Nigeria - where senators defend the right to marry 13-year-old girls, and where, especially in the lower-income rural areas, women are expected to remain indoors - these entertaining and affordable books challenge taboos and empower women.\n\nNowadays, soyayya stories are even broadcast on radio, giving the female authors an almost star-like status in communities where women traditionally don't play significant public roles.\n\nEven for the authors, the experience is empowering. Yakubu explains in English, every once in a while resorting to Hausa when her words fail her: \"When I write, I feel lifted. I grew up with a strong father whom I could not confront. My books gave me a window to express myself. I write my stories as if I was in your house, or at your neighbours'. Women recognise them. I feel I have an obligation to society to tell those stories that otherwise would not have been told.\"\n\nLost in her story\n\nWhen Yakubu starts writing, she writes everywhere: in the kitchen, in the car, and even on her phone when there is no pen nearby. Her grown-up son Muhammed remembers how he and his siblings would know their mother was in her writing mode. They would find her on a mat in the living room, resting on a pillow: a pen in her hand, lost in her story.\n\nHer children knew better than to try something naughty though, because however enthralled their mother might seem, she always kept an eye on whatever her offspring were up to, Muhammed adds.\n\nWith a smile, his mother recounts how she involved her children in the writing process. \"My handwriting is bad, like an old doctor's. So I used to let my children copy what I'd written. That's why I was certain I wasn't doing anything wrong, and I knew Allah would see that, too. Do you think I'd write anything unfit for my children's eyes?\"\n\nExperts describe Yakubu's style of popular fiction as transcending the level of the general soyayya novel, but for a long time, only readers of Hausa could enjoy her work. This changed in 2012, when Indian publisher Blaft translated her second book as Sin is a Puppy That Follows You Home. This made her the first female Hausa writer to be translated into English, and since then, she says, she has not been able to keep count of the number of journalists and researchers who have come to see her to discuss Hausa literature.\n\nIncidentally, the translated title was also her first book to be made into a movie. Kano has a lively Hausa-language film industry: It is not uncommon in the city to stumble upon a film crew on the street and the DVDs of local movies are among the traffic hawkers' best-selling products.\n\nYakubu was involved in the production process of her book's movie, and subsequently, she took greater interest in the film industry as she started producing her own projects. Recently, she had gone scouting for a location for her new movie, an epic about Hausa royalty a century ago. Asked for the reason she chose this subject, she says: \"Only learned people know about Kano history. I want all our people to know. Without knowledge of your past, you don't know your roots, and you can't stand up for your rights.\"\n\nTrauma counselling\n\nThat Yakubu's achievements go beyond the entertainment industry becomes clear when you visit her at her office at the Murtala Muhammed Foundation, where she is a programme officer coordinating trauma counselling. Over the past few years, with the rise of Boko Haram, her job has become almost entirely about supporting the victims of bomb blasts.\n\nWith her team, Yakubu goes to meet the wounded in hospital and identifies who to refer to counsellors. That isn't easy because most of them refuse to talk. \"They often say, 'What good is talking? You can't bring back the dead or return my body parts.'\"\n\nYakubu understands. She feels her own traumatic experiences make it easier to communicate with these casualties. \"I know how it is to feel powerless and unable to speak out.\"\n\nHer own struggle to regain control over her life and claim her voice as a woman has made Yakubu an outspoken advocate of women's rights. She sees northern women claiming more and more public territory. At one time, she was the only female writer in Kano; now, the local association for women authors that she founded in 2005 counts more than 200 members.\n\nAnd she can name many more examples like that. \"These days, we have women in politics, business and the military. We even have female pilots. To the West, it might not seem like much. But to women here, it is progress.\"\n\nWith the enrolment of girls in schools and universities on the rise, she is optimistic that the position of women will improve. The next generation of women will continue the struggle more effectively, she thinks.\n\n\"When I was fighting, I did so with passion because I lacked an education. But the young women today will fight with knowledge.\"",
  "latent_2614": "The withdrawal of a senior intelligence adviser after an online campaign to prevent him from taking office has ignited a debate over whether powerful pro-Israel lobbying interests are exercising outsize influence over who serves in the Obama administration.\n\nWhen Charles W. Freeman Jr. stepped away Tuesday from an appointment to chair the National Intelligence Council -- which oversees the production of reports that represent the view of the nation's 16 intelligence agencies -- he decried in an e-mail \"the barrage of libelous distortions of my record [that] would not cease upon my entry into office,\" and he was blunt about whom he considers responsible.\n\n\"The libels on me and their easily traceable email trails show conclusively that there is a powerful lobby determined to prevent any view other than its own from being aired, still less to factor in American understanding of trends and events in the Middle East,\" Freeman wrote.\n\nReferring to what he called \"the Israel Lobby,\" he added: \"The aim of this Lobby is control of the policy process through the exercise of a veto over the appointment of people who dispute the wisdom of its views.\" One result of this, he said, is \"the inability of the American public to discuss, or the government to consider, any option for US policies in the Middle East opposed by the ruling faction in Israeli politics.\"\n\nFreeman's angry rhetoric notwithstanding, the controversy surrounding the former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia was broader than just Middle East politics. Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair's choice of Freeman prompted a storm of complaints about his recent commercial connections to China and questions about whether he was too forgiving of that nation's leaders.\n\nBut most of the online attention focused on Freeman's work for the Middle East Policy Council, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that is funded in part by Saudi money, and his past critical statements about Israel. The latter included a 2005 speech he gave to the National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations, where he referred to Israel's \"high-handed and self-defeating policies\" stemming from the \"occupation and settlement of Arab lands,\" which he called \"inherently violent.\"\n\nOnly a few Jewish organizations came out publicly against Freeman's appointment, but a handful of pro-Israeli bloggers and employees of other organizations worked behind the scenes to raise concerns with members of Congress, their staffs and the media.\n\nFor example, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), often described as the most influential pro-Israel lobbying group in Washington, \"took no position on this matter and did not lobby the Hill on it,\" spokesman Josh Block said.\n\nBut Block responded to reporters' questions and provided critical material about Freeman, albeit always on background, meaning his comments could not be attributed to him, according to three journalists who spoke to him. Asked about this yesterday, Block replied: \"As is the case with many, many issues every day, when there is general media interest in a subject, I often provide publicly available information to journalists on background.\"\n\nYesterday, the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, which tried to derail Freeman's appointment, applauded his withdrawal. But it added: \"We think Israel and any presumed 'lobby' had far less effect on the outcome than the common-sensical belief that the person who is the gatekeeper of intelligence information for the President of the United States should be unencumbered by payments from foreign governments.\"\n\nThere was plenty of debate about that within the blogosphere immediately after Freeman's withdrawal and the publication of his e-mail.\n\nJonathan Chait wrote irreverently on his New Republic blog, \"The old spin was that Freeman's nomination, and the failure of his critics, shows how evil the Israel lobby is. . . . The new spin will be that Freeman's, ahem, resignation shows the Israel lobby is even more powerful and sinister than we thought.\"",
  "latent_2741": "by Paul Bass | May 4, 2009 7:28 AM | Permalink | Comments (25)\n\nMaking parallels to the Nuremberg trials, U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd told a gathering of liberal bloggers in New Haven he’d support bringing charges against any Bush administration officials found responsible for the policy of waterboarding terrorism suspects.\n\nThe five-term Connecticut senator made the comments Sunday at The Playwright, his latest New Haven stop in what has become a nonstop Dodd Career Resuscitation Tour in the wake of recent damaging press disclosures.\n\n“Not to prosecute people and pursue them when these acts occurred,” he said following the gathering, “is in a sense to invite them to do it again in a future administration.”\n\nThe event was as notable for what Dodd said — the torture remarks; a vow not “to get burned again” on executive bonuses — as for where he said it. A week after the last D.C.-based reporter from a Connecticut newspaper was laid off, Dodd turned to local bloggers to help communicate with constituents back home.\n\nIt’s “Torture”\n\nToward the end of the hour-long afternoon session in a second-floor room at the Temple Street pub, veteran blogger Al Robinson of My Left Nutmeg asked Dodd a two-part question: Is waterboarding, the near-drowning technique used by the CIA interrogators on al Qaeda suspects, a form of torture? And does the senator believe that Bush administration officials who OK’d the technique should be held accountable?\n\nThe issue has exploded to prominence in Washington (in between news of a Senate defection, a flu possible pandemic, and a Supreme Court retirement) since the Obama administration released memos last month showing the CIA waterboarded two suspects 266 times, long after receiving any useful information.\n\n“I believe waterboarding is torture,” Dodd responded. Not only was it torture — it didn’t work, he said. He noted that one suspect was waterboarded 183 times. “How effective could that be after the 90th?”\n\nDodd supported a call by Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont to have a select committee investigate the case. Now that President Obama has released the memos, they should be put to use rather than ignored, he argued.\n\n“If people in fact did something that was illegal they should be pursued,” Dodd said, no matter how high up in the Bush administration the trail leads. He spoke of the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals after World War II in making the case that people responsible for the torture should be prosecuted; Dodd’s father was a prosecutor at the trials.\n\nClick on the play arrow at the top of this story to watch his response.\n\nLeahy arguing for select committee to review.\n\nPlaywright, The Sequel\n\nWhen the session ended, Dodd spoke of why he had his staff organize it. He noted that last week the Connecticut Post laid off D.C. correspondent Peter Urban. “We have no one [left at the Capitol] — zero — covering a seven-member delegation” for readers back home, he said. Even when he’s back in Connecticut he sees fewer reporters at events than in the past. Meanwhile, the “universe” of bloggers is growing, getting more diverse, and playing a role in communicating with voters.\n\nDodd and five staffers sat around a table prepared, and little utilized, for drinks and food with the five bloggers who attended. Pictured from left are Tessa Marquis of Milford Democrats, among other sites; “CT Bob”; Edward Anderson; and Al Robinson. One blogger (Bob) ordered a draft; Dodd had a Splenda-sweetened coffee; a staffer ordered a soda; and Anderson brought in a Starbucks cup. (Also there was Gabe Rosenberg of CT Local Politics.)That was it. A waiter brought in two baskets of bread which remained covered atop the room’s bar counter.\n\nThe beer was flowing more prodigiously, and the atmosphere was more electric, when many of those same bloggers assembled to participate in a different Senate campaign. They came to pay homage to proto-liberal blogger Markos Moulitsas Zuniga of the Daily Kos website and to Ned Lamont, the insurgent Democrat whom the bloggers were at the time helping to raise money and visibility. (Click here to read that story; Lamont went on to defeat Lieberman in a Democratic primary, then lose the general election when Lieberman ran as an independent.)\n\nIt was clear from Sunday afternoon’s more subdued gathering that the group of bloggers is inclined to support rather than trash the latest incumbent senator from the state in danger of losing his seat. The questions were for the most part supportive of Dodd’s stands, especially his bill to limit credit-card companies’ predatory practices. Dodd’s bill passed the Banking Committee last week; he predicted a tough fight before the full Senate. And he enlisted the bloggers in getting the word out. (Read about the bill here.)\n\nUnlike at a mainstream press conference, there were no “gotcha” questions, and few sound bites. Dodd and the bloggers dissected the credit-card bill, the bank bailout, and other issues in depth, at a leisurely pace.\n\nIn the Irish-themed pub, there were no questions about the latest scandal that threatens to sink Dodd’s career next year, a profitable land deal in Ireland tied to a businessman on whose behalf the senator won a presidential pardon. (Read about that here.)\n\nThere were no questions about the story in that day’s Courant about the $500,000 a year Dodd’s wife is pulling in serving on corporate boards.\n\nNor were there questions about Dodd’s receipt of two mortgages on favorable terms from the head of a subprime lender he was supposed to regulate as chair of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nBut there were lots of real questions, not softballs. Like when Robinson asked Dodd if he has learned anything from the episode that first made his favorability ratings tank: an amendment he pushed that enabled AIG execs to collect bonuses out of government bailout money. Public outrage was so intense that the normally untouchable Dodd, whose term expires in 2010, is now running behind Republican Rob Simmons in the polls.\n\nDodd was ready to respond to Robinson’s question, with no hint of defensiveness.\n\nThe answer: He “won’t get burned again.”\n\nHe said he plans to play an independent role in analyzing the regulations that the Treasury Department draws up based on the amendment that passed last fall.\n\nHe repeated the theme that he had agreed to the provision that allowed the bonuses as part of a larger amendment in which he inserted strong pro-taxpayer protections; that the Treasury Department pushed for it at a time when senators were urged to act fast to prevent an imminent economic collapse; and that no other senators objected, either.\n\nIn short, he argued, he was left out to dry by the Obama administration. But he also said that moving forward he would act differently.\n\n“You [Treasury] tell me what you want to do, and I’ll tell you whether I think it’s right or not,” Dodd said. He vowed he wouldn’t “nod and say that sounds good to me. I’ve been down that road again. I won’t do that again.”\n\nDodd said he’s “not hostile” to performance-based bonuses that reward execs for coming in and turning around a troubled bank. He said he does flatly reject retention bonuses with taxpayer money: “It’s a phony argument that nobody else will do these things. A lot of people who have been laid off in this business will be happy to take the job.”",

And I can only assume that maybe this is an attempt to take that strategy further, not just report on this, but actually manufacture this.”\n\nMonths after reporting on those campaigns, which he described as “information warfare,” Chen began to notice something odd about many of the online accounts he had followed during his research.\n\n“A very interesting thing happened,” Chen said during a December podcast with Longform. “I created this list of the Russian trolls when I was researching, and I check on it once in a while, still. And a lot of them turned into conservative accounts, like fake conservatives. I don’t know what’s going on, but they’re all tweeting about Donald Trump and stuff.”\n\nChen said he couldn’t determine who was behind those pro-Russian online accounts posing as American conservatives, but he has some idea what motivated them.\n\n“I feel like it’s some kind of really opaque strategy of electing Donald Trump to undermine the U.S. or something — like (a) false flag kind of thing,” Chen said. “You know, that’s how I started thinking about all this stuff after being in Russia.”",

  "latent_3315": "The PostgreSQL logo. Same family as PHP's mascot!\n\nFor the past few years, I've been intending to kick the tires of PostgreSQL, an open source RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management System) that's often used in place of MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, MS SQL, or other SQL-compliant servers. Drupal 7 worked with PostgreSQL, but official support was a bit lacking. For Drupal 8, daily automated test builds are finally being run on MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL, so many of the more annoying bugs that caused non-MySQL database engines to fail have finally been fixed!\n\nWith Drupal VM, one of my goals is to be able to replicate almost any kind of server environment locally, supporting all of the most popular software. Developers have already been able to choose Apache or Nginx, Memcached, or Redis, Varnish, Solr or Elasticsearch, and many other options depending on their needs. Today I finally had the time to nail down PostgreSQL support, so now developers can choose which database engine they'd like—MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, or even SQLite!\n\nAs of Drupal VM 3.3.0, all four are supported out of the box, though for MariaDB or PostgreSQL, you need to adjust a couple settings in your config.yml before provisioning.\n\nIf you want to build a VM running Drupal 8 on PostgreSQL, the process is pretty simple:\n\nDownload Drupal VM and follow the Quick Start Guide. Before running vagrant up , create a config.yml file with the contents:\n\n---\n\ndrupalvm_database: pgsql\n\nRun vagrant up .\n\nAfter a few minutes, you should have a new Drupal 8 site running on top of PostgreSQL!\n\nA few caveats\n\nYou should note that, just like with support for Apache vs. Nginx1, there are far fewer Drupal sites running on PostgreSQL than on MySQL (or MariaDB), so if you choose to use PostgreSQL, you'll likely encounter a bump in the road at some point. For example, to get PostgreSQL working at all with Drupal, the database has to use an older PostgreSQL default output method that uses ASCII instead of hex (the default since PostgreSQL 9.0) for transmission.\n\nIf you're planning on digging deeper in to PostgreSQL with Drupal (especially if you need to support things like spatial and geographic objects, or full-text search, and don't want to add on Apache Solr or something like it), you should read through this meta issue for Drupal 8: [meta] Remaining Drupal 8 PostgreSQL issues.\n\nLearn More\n\n1 Historically, Apache was used by the vast majority of Drupal sites, so many Drupal features, documentation, and hosting providers assume Apache and either don't consider Nginx configuration, or give it 'second-class' status. That's not to say it's _not_supported... just that you often need to do some of your own due diligence to get everything working smoothly and securely when not using the default option!",

  "latent_3550": "Adalberto Toledo | Senior Staff Writer\n\n@aldot29\n\nEditor’s Note: This story has been edited throughout for clarity. The facts of the story have not changed. Readers should know some of the details and web links within this story are graphic.\n\nIn the early part of 2016, a pornographic blog on Tumblr of a woman named Valerie Nystrom, a former UNT student, found its way to the fingertips of many North Texas students.\n\nNot included among the account’s posts are the details of a relationship she had with a man named Joshua Jackson. According to documents, the North Texas Trafficking Task Force received reports that a woman — who was referred to as “V.N.” — was the victim of sexual trafficking.\n\nJackson is alleged to have forced Nystrom into “commercial sex acts,” but authorities have not yet determined whether that is true. And people close to both Jackson and Nystrom describe their relationship as a two-way street, though it was turbulent and complicated.\n\nNystrom allegedly lived with Jackson in fall 2012, according to an April 28 affidavit from the U.S. attorney’s office. On April 27, Texas and U.S. authorities arrested Jackson in Wichita Falls, Texas, and charged him with acquiring firearms (a violation of his felony probation) and state felony theft. He was also accused of trafficking Nystrom.\n\nOn May 18, U.S. attorneys filed an indictment of Jackson for the gun charges. Jackson is due in court August 24 to begin hearings for his gun charges. He has not been indicted for the sexual trafficking allegations.\n\nThe affidavit associated with the arrest said “V.N.” she enrolled at UNT in fall 2012 and moved into a dorm when she was 18. According to the affidavit, the pair began living together in Kerr Hall, the setting for many pornographic videos found in Nystrom’s blog. Nystrom said Jackson used “force, fraud and coercion” to make her engage in commercial sex acts.\n\nNystrom declined to comment, and efforts to reach Jackson for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nThe blog shows various pornographic posts, among which are videos of Nystrom having sex in a UNT residence hall, later confirmed in a video to be Kerr Hall. The videos are filmed secretly and vary between handheld and stationary shooting. Posts on Nystrom’s blog attribute the people holding the camera to “Erin,” “Evan” and “Joseph.”\n\n“It’s nearly unimaginable to me that a long term thing like this could have happened in a dorm,” UNT President Neal Smatresk said. “All protection available would’ve been afforded and all of our past policies would have disallowed this.”\n\nThe blog’s first post was on Feb. 1 and its last post was April 25. The videos posted to the blog show more than one location, all of them being places Nystrom and Jackson lived, including their most recent residence together: an apartment complex off Highway 121 in Grapevine.\n\nTony Avera, 27, a former roommate of Nystrom and Jackson’s, said he never saw anything suspicious and would describe the whole situation around Jackson’s arrest as “stupid,” the weapons found with Jackson during the arrest for “protection.” He added Jackson himself did not own the guns he saw around the Grapevine apartment, alleging that another roommate Devan Jacob Endert owned them. Endert could not be reached for comment.\n\nHe also said allegations that Nystrom was forced into commercial sex acts were far-fetched.\n\n“I didn’t know she was doing anything like that [prostitution], and if she was it wasn’t anything she was doing against her will,” Avera said. “I lived with them and I lived around them both and there were no signs of this at all. She wasn’t like beaten or anything. He wasn’t abusive toward her.”\n\nAnime obsessed\n\nNystrom and Jackson met in 2012 at an anime convention in Dallas, the affidavit said. They frequented other anime events across Texas, even getting engaged during SanJapan 2015, a San Antonio anime convention.\n\nFor both, anime was a huge part of their lives. Jackson wanted to be professional cosplayer. Nysyrom managed Jackson’s cosplay efforts.\n\nAccording to the U.S. attorney’s office affidavit, in late fall 2015, Nystrom said Jackson forced her to lie naked on a bed and used a Taser on her stomach, chest and genitals.\n\nAvera, the roommate, described their relationship as rocky. He added that Nystrom lived in an apartment in Grapevine even after she and Jackson broke up in January 2016. She left later that month.\n\nDuring this time, Jackson was coming under a lot of scrutiny from the cosplaying community. Jackson had claimed he was the inspiration for the character Fox Alistair, a character in the late Monty Oum’s 3D anime-influenced animated web series RWBY.\n\nHe was also attacked for claiming credit on cosplay costumes and materials he had purchased from a vendor with whom he had a long business relationship.\n\nAshley Jordan, a friend of Jackson’s from a foam fighting group called Sleeping Samurai, said she had moved to Pittsburgh two months before Jackson met Nystrom. She added she had not kept in contact with him for many years, but received “very vague and erratic messages” from him days before his arrest.\n\n“He said his life was in danger and I suggested he call the police, but he went silent afterwards,” Jordan said. “Personally, I’m not interested in getting involved in something as erratic and dangerous as this all seemed, so I backed off.”\n\nJordan said because he seemed like such a good friend to people, a lot of people would be shocked by the arrest and “white knight for him.” She added there was always a lot of “drama” behind him, and that he “latched onto fantastical ideas easily.”\n\n“This guy, Josh, loved dramatics. He wanted life to be as intense as anime and fancied himself a main character,” Jordan said. “Looking back after [about] four years and more experience, I can see that he embellished things or likely lied about a lot.”\n\nIt was his lies that made him unpopular in the cosplay community, and soon thereafter arguments started between him and Nystrom, Avera said. He said there were problems between Jackson and Nystrom during the time between their break up and her leaving their residence.\n\nAvera said Jackson met Dominique Wagoner, who declined comment, at an anime convention after breaking off the engagement with Nystrom and soon after started dating. During this time, Nystrom and Endert also dated, until Endert broke things off before she finally left the Grapevine apartment.\n\nAn established escort\n\nA close friend of Jackson’s said Jackson didn’t know anything about Nystrom becoming an escort. The source, who said he met Jackson during the mid-2000s, asked to remain anonymous out of fear that his connection with Jackson would jeopardize his career.\n\nHe said Jackson maintained he was unaware of Nystrom’s posts on eccie.net, a fast-growing online community of “escorts, hobbyists and providers” with escort reviews, chats, galleries and discussion forums.\n\nThe source added Jackson thought Nystrom’s escort business was “non-existent” prior to their break up. After the break-up, he said, Jackson “accepted the idea that there was prostitution,” but insisted he hadn’t known anything about it.\n\n“I didn’t believe him,” the source said. “You shared a bed with someone for five years and they then had sex for money in it for five years, and you didn’t know about it? It doesn’t make sense.”\n\nSince June 2013, Nystrom has consistently posted on ECCIE, all of the addresses she gives out being places her and Jackson lived, according to Jackson’s close friend.\n\nIn a Feb. 2 ECCIE thread Nystrom started, she said she had been “outted by a hobbiest” (sic) who told everyone in her home town of Muenster, Texas. In the post, she added that she would start going by her real name, Valerie, instead of “CJ.” She said “it’s still me, I have no point in hiding anymore… I’m not sure how to recover from being outted (sic) besides to stop hiding” and asked for advice on the forum.\n\nIn the same thread, she spoke about the person who videotaped her sexual acts. She describes them as a “transitioning female/male” who no one knew about, but she called them her “girlfriend/boyfriend.” She said in the post, however, that because she started dating someone else, they had to reach another agreement, and finally end the collaboration altogether.\n\n“The problem is, I started dating another guy in the process, along with another girl. So I began paying her/him to record my sessions for security reasons,” Nystrom said in the post. “Yes, it was for my own personal taste, but it was fun seeing if anyone noticed my little plaything hiding in the closet. After we broke up, I bought a hidden camera speaker set, so I no longer needed ‘another person.’”\n\nIn the same post, she said she found it difficult getting her roommate out of the house while she had sex and said that two weeks prior to Feb. 2, two of her roommates “caught [her] in the act,” and subsequently kicked her out. She said she robbed them, took their dog Kuro, all evidence anyone could “use on [her],” and left. She also mentioned she went to a “crisis center” and had been uploading her videos because, in her words, “in-case (sic) it went to court I have it said they were making me do it… sadly the justice system is in my favor being a pretty white female.”\n\nIn the same thread, Nystrom claims she made $120,000 from escorting, and got 82 to 88 percent of her business from ECCIE. She wrote ECCIE alone made her $8,000 per month. About the videos, she said: “I’m posting the videos to get people to ask curtain (sic) questions… all of my roommates knew… so if I go down I will take them down with me…”\n\nThough he suspected, the source never knew her escorting was as extensive as it was. He said while visiting the Grapevine apartment, both Jackson and Nystrom said they had a “house-call” for “massage therapy” and that he not be there, along with their roommates. In a YouTube video posted to the John Smith channel May 19 titled “Joshtruth,” the unidentified voice runs through many of the false claims Jackson has made around the cosplay community, including his claim of being a “professional masseuse.”\n\nThe source also said this wasn’t the first time Jackson was involved with somebody tied to prostitution.\n\n“What alarmed me about Valerie was that this was a pattern,” the source said. “After Josh and another girl had officially broken up and the relationship was unsalvageable, then it came out that she was a prostitute. While I suspected Valerie of being the prostitute prior to them breaking up, it never officially came out of Josh’s mouth until after they broke up. I was like, ‘Wait a minute, you broke up with another girl that’s a prostitute?”\n\nNystrom said she sought legal advice as per the content of the videos being filmed in Kerr Hall, but said her counsel assured her she was safe as she no longer attended UNT.\n\nOn Feb. 8, Nystrom posted on ECCIE that she was safe with her parents at their house in Denison, and three days later a post on her blog titled “Valentine’s Day roleplay?” she invites someone to “‘break’ into [her] house” and have sex with her, then saying she is “giving consent right now.” The address would be given in a private message, but was later put on the blog in an April 12 post.\n\nSources close to both Nystrom and Jackson speculate on the authorship of the blog, the posts to PornHub and the ECCIE account. The anonymous source said Nystrom had told him she believed Josh was uploading the PornHub videos, which were talked about both in the ECCIE website and in her blog. Additionally, all of the PornHub uploads and raunchy blog posts appeared online after Jackson and Nystrom broke up.\n\nOn ECCIE, members commented on the similarity between Jackson and Nystrom’s writing style. One account, Chateau Becot, wrote “even a… monkey can see the writing tempos, grammar patterns, etc. are the same. What’s the purpose of this charade?”\n\nJosh’s side of the story\n\nWhen Jackson was arrested on April 27 and his story subsequently published May 20 by multiple media sources, chatter arose in the anime community. The same anime fans who questioned his claims and brought to light his lies were unsurprised of the arrest, while others worried.\n\nHis main Facebook account was for a while inactive, but began posting again June 12 with a cryptic letter written by a “shadow,” a pseudonym Jackson often used. But on June 13, a long post on Jackson’s Facebook wall addressed accusations made against him in the anime circles. The post also talks about Nystrom’s abuse accusations.\n\nThe post is said to have been posted by Cheryl Lawrence — described by Avera as Samurai Titan’s “auntie,” and by Jackson as his “godmother… [his] mom…” Lawrence could not be reached for comment but since June 12 has been posting updates she receives from Jackson while imprisoned at Seagoville Federal Correctional Facility.\n\n“I never forced anyone to do anything. It’s literally my M.O.” the post on Jackson’s account read. “You can’t force anyone, especially Val[erie], the feisty redhead, to do anything she wants to do, but that doesn’t make good news.”\n\nHe said it was Nystrom who wrote Jackson’s biographies on his social media accounts, which claimed he was the inspiration for Fox Alistair. Jackson also claimed the locations in the affidavit were also those of major anime conventions who she planned the visits to, since Nystrom was Jackson’s manager. He also states the reason for their break up: Nystrom had been sleeping with Endert.\n\nIt also said Endert made a false insurance claim on the guns found with Jackson at the time of his arrest, and in a post from June 20 said he is “not be[ing] charged with any kind of sex crimes or human trafficking” and has a pending charge for unlawful possession of firearms which he said “is currently unproven.”\n\nOf Nystrom, Jackson wrote in the June 13 post and addressed her directly. He said she “wanted to control [him]” and claimed he has a “staged call now proving [she] tried to manipulate [them] into admitting guilt for a bogus crime.”\n\n“[Nystrom] reminded me that I was so stupid in love. I always talked about her,” Jackson wrote in the June 13 post. “I was separated from everyone I love for four years, piece by piece. But as I said, that doesn’t make a good news story.”\n\nContributed to the report: Scott Sidway | News Editor\n\nFeatured Image: 1413 Maple St. Tomas Gonzalez | Visuals Editor",
  "latent_3665": "Dropbox is doing away with Mailbox, the email app it acquired in March 2013, and Carousel, the company's attempt at a standalone photo management app. The company says that it's making this decision now to focus more directly on the primary Dropbox app and the collaborative features it's known for. \"The Carousel and Mailbox teams have built products that are loved by many people and their work will continue to have an impact,\" wrote Dropbox's founder / CEO Drew Houston and CTO Arash Ferdowsi in a blog post. \"We’ll be taking key features from Carousel back to the place where your photos live — in the Dropbox app. We’ll also be using what we’ve learned from Mailbox to build new ways to communicate and collaborate on Dropbox.\"\n\nMailbox will shut down on February 26th, with Carousel following the next month on March 31st. Dropbox says it's giving Carousel extra time so that users can download their photos and move them elsewhere if they so choose. \"If you have conversations or shared albums you want to save from Carousel, we’ll provide a simple export tool early next year,\" the company notes.\n\nBoth apps have seen little development in recent months, allowing competition from bigger rivals to move ahead of Dropbox's software. Mailbox was effectively abandoned on both iOS and Android months ago, and even the Twitter account has gone silent. Other third-party email apps like Microsoft's Outlook and Google Inbox have built upon the unique swipe and time management features that Mailbox introduced. The company acknowledges as much, saying \"many of its innovations are now ubiquitous across the industry.\"\n\nSimilarly, Google Photos and Apple Photos have made Dropbox's Carousel app somewhat useless by comparison. Dropbox says it'll bring some of Carousel's better features to the main app \"in the coming months.\" So there's the closure you might've been looking for; it just would've been nice to see this happen a few months sooner.\n\nPhoto storage: How Google Photos solved our photo backup nightmare",
  "latent_3727": "National Review in February 2016 published “Against Trump,” a special issue that made a reasoned case for why conservatives should oppose Donald Trump’s nomination as the Republican candidate for president. Nearly two-dozen conservative writers and influencers weighed in; most of them cogently—and correctly—explained that Trump was not a “true conservative.” He had supported progressive causes in the past (including abortion and single-payer health care), and did not possess the intellectual mooring that conservatives value. Some writers faulted Trump for his boorish, impulsive temperament and populist rhetoric.\n\nIt was a measured assessment by fair-minded people, some of whom—such as Cal Thomas and Thomas Sowell—have helped attract millions of devotees to the conservative movement. Young, energetic newcomers, including Ben Domenech and Katie Pavlich were also featured. Some highlights:\n\nBen Domenech (editor, The Federalist): “Conservatives should reject Trump’s hollow, Euro-style identity politics. But conservatives have far more to learn from his campaign than many might like to admit. The Trump voter is moderate, disaffected, with patriotic instincts. He feels disconnected from the GOP and other broken public institutions, left behind by a national political elite that no longer believes he matters.”\n\nMark Helprin (novelist): “He doesn’t know the Constitution, history, law, political philosophy, nuclear strategy, diplomacy, defense, economics beyond real estate, or even, despite his low-level-mafioso comportment, how ordinary people live.”\n\nKatie Pavlich (editor, Townhall): “Trump’s liberal positions aren’t in the distant past—he has openly promoted them on the campaign trail. Conservatives have a serious decision to make. Do we truly believe in our long-held principles and insist that politicians have records demonstrating fealty to them?”\n\nOf course, Trump went on to win both the nomination and the election. Several of the writers, grown-ups who love their country more than they love proving they were right, managed to move on in life, staying true to their conservative principles while praising and criticizing the president as the occasion warranted.\n\nBut a handful of other alleged conservatives, who joined forces before the general election to form the “NeverTrump” movement, saw an opportunity. Rather than keeping a much-needed policy check on an unpredictable president and gobsmacked Congress, they positioned themselves as “conservative” Trump foes, and, in the process, boosted their number of followers on social media and number of appearances on cable news shows.\n\nPeople such as Bill Kristol, Jennifer Rubin, and Bret Stephens have carved out a niche for themselves as the go-to source for reporters to get blistering commentary about Trump, or his administration, or his family, or his congressional allies, or his voters. Kristol’s number of Twitter followers has nearly tripled, as he churns out hourly rants that veer from impeachment pleas to far-fetched conspiracy theories on Russia, Mike Pence, and Trump’s inner circle. They promote the darkest narrative, not just of Trumpism, but of Republicans in general, mimicking the same, weary warnings Democrats have shrieked for decades—that Republicans are racist, sexist, homophobic, and plain stupid. These self-proclaimed guardians of America’s modern conservative legacy have ceased talking about anything of substance. They are as reactionary and emotive as high school sophomores.\n\nIt is all Trump, all the time. In the process, they have abandoned both their party and their principles.\n\nThis past week proves how unhinged, dishonest, and untethered to conservatism some NeverTrumpers have become. Not only are they backing away from a fundamental conservative belief—the constitutionally-protected right to bear arms (Stephens last month wrote a column supporting the repeal of the Second Amendment)—they rooted for, then celebrated, Ralph Northam’s gubernatorial win in Virginia.\n\nLet’s start with the Democrats’ big win on Tuesday. On Election Day morning, Evan McMullin, Kristol’s handpicked puppet to challenge Trump as an independent last year, tweeted this:\n\n.@EdWGillespie was one of the good guys, but now he peddles fear and white nationalism. It’s better for VA and America that he not prevail. — Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) November 7, 2017\n\n(Side note: On what planet does this dullard have 400k “conservative” Twitter followers? Does he know he’s being used? That these people aren’t who they say they are?)\n\nKristol followed-up with a non-endorsement endorsement of Northam as well:\n\nWhatever the case for or against Gillespie, VA has something like the 6th lowest crime rate and 14th lowest unemployment rate in the nation. https://t.co/kb0nS3M4x8 — Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) November 7, 2017\n\nKristol’s wife, Susan, donated to Northam’s campaign, and made no secret about her support for a candidate who wants to protect Obamacare, allow abortion-on-demand, and repeal concealed carry:\n\nNow that the Virginia GOP and Ed Gillespie are falsely accusing Ralph Northam of supporting the MS-13 gang, this tweet bears repeating. https://t.co/N63DvfGn8Z — Susan Kristol (@SusanKristol) October 7, 2017\n\nJennifer Rubin, who has the gall to call herself a “conservative blogger,” and the Washington Post has the gall to present her as such, spent the past few weeks mocking prayer, demonizing the NRA, defending the estate tax, and smearing Ed Gillespie. In her post-election piece, Rubin wrote (I literally cannot stop laughing as I read it):\n\nThe mood of the country a year after Trump’s victory may not be as anti-government as some thought. Instead of unrelenting hostility toward government, verging on nihilism, we see voters going for pro-government candidates, even ones seeking to expand health care. You never know what you stand to lose until you look into the abyss and see the loss of a politically sane and functional government.\n\nDo it with me: LOL\n\nShe wasn’t the only one dancing in the NeverTrump end zone. Kristol, Stephens, Rick Wilson, and other devoted NeverTrumpers posted and retweeted the election news in an “I-told-you-so” way that had nothing to do with conservatism and everything to do with political revenge. Fox News’s Brit Hume took notice of the celebration, and tweeted, “this is what the never-Trump movement is becoming—a cheering section against Republicans.” Stephens stepped up to defend his NeverTrump compatriots in what could be the most dishonest tweet of the day:\n\nThat’s right, @brithume. Because we Never-Trumpers have fidelity to principles, not party. https://t.co/tyvqDHUpEh — Bret Stephens (@BretStephensNYT) November 8, 2017\n\n(Keep in mind, Stephens not only wants the Second Amendment repealed, he became a recent climate-change convert after years of calling it a sham.)\n\nHume fired back:\n\nA leading never-Trumper acknowledges that the movement has indeed become a cheering section against Republicans. Note the chest-thumping. https://t.co/0veTm9GlaR — Brit Hume (@brithume) November 8, 2017\n\nThe fray was not unnoticed. Erick Erickson, a contributor to NR’s “Against Trump” issue, summed it all up: “I’ve wanted to say NeverTrump died with the election, but there really are Republicans now who’d cheer on the devil if Trump said he believed in God.”\n\nIndeed.\n\nSo, where do these NeverTrumpers go from here? There seems to be a gradual split in the ranks and a recognition that the most fervent among them have lost their senses. There is also no compelling strategy to “take back” the GOP with any policy platform or candidate development effort. (The best they could do is come up with a letter to support Robert Mueller. Not exactly a winning message for 2018.)\n\nKristol is rooting for the implosion of the GOP because that’s what he predicted would happen if Trump was elected. With a history of poor political prognostication, Kristol is hell-bent on making sure the Republican Party pays the price for nominating and electing Trump, even if it means the other side, with its destructive agenda of progressive policies, wins. Kristol, Rubin, Stephens, are now de facto, if not actual, liberals. We should stop allowing them to get away with calling themselves anything but that; the media will rub them in our faces until we do.\n\nSoon, however, the Virginia election will be a memory, these NeverTrumpers’ social-media fist-bumping will end, and they will still be left with a president they detest, an electorate they ridicule, and lost integrity they won’t be able to recover.",
  "latent_3746": "Although Donald Trump's presidential campaign has understandably garnered more headlines, the campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is truly the one worth parsing. Americans have welcomed racist demagogues before, but an avowed socialist? The most successful presidential campaign by a democratic socialist was that of Sanders's hero, Eugene V. Debs, in 1912. Debs won 6% of the vote. In the most recent CBS/New York Times poll, Sanders was pulling down 41% support from Democrats, and other polls show him running even or ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nOn the national stage, the Sanders phenomenon seems new; the closest antecedent is the campaign that socialist author Upton Sinclair waged for governor of California in 1934. In the depths of the Depression, just one year after Franklin Roosevelt became president, Sinclair switched his party registration from Socialist to Democrat, a change unaccompanied, however, by shifts in his beliefs or ideology.",
  "latent_3796": "In Greek mythology, a phoenix is a long-lived bird that is cyclically regenerated or reborn. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor. The phoenix typically dies by fire and decomposes before being born again.\n\nThat seems to be the process the Phoenix Suns ensue during their NBA history. They have seasons where they advance deep into the postseason, then their record would drop to the bottom of the Western Conference only to rise a couple of years later. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Suns enjoyed several successful seasons, making the playoffs eight seasons in a row and the NBA Finals in 1976 where they lost to the Boston Celtics. In 1987, three team members (James Edwards, Jay Humphries and Grant Gondrezick) were indicted on drug-related charges. With a drug scandal and the loss of promising young center Nick Vanos (killed in a plane crash), the franchise reached turmoil both on and off the court.\n\nIn 1988, the Suns acquired point guard Kevin Johnson from the Cleveland Cavaliers, Mark West, and Tyrone Corbin in exchange for All-Star power forward Larry Nance. This was the beginning of a franchise-record 13 consecutive playoff appearances. In 2003, when all the star players on the Suns roster either retired, became free agents or were traded, the Suns dropped to a 29-53 record.\n\nThe Suns were mostly successful during the Charles Barkley and Steve Nash/Amare Stoudemire eras where they celebrated winning seasons and playoff runs. The Suns appeared in the NBA Finals in 1993 where Charles Barkley and company lost to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. From 2010 to 2013 the Suns’ winning percentage gradually dropped each season and they ended the 2013 season with a 25–57 win-loss record. It was the second-worst record in franchise history, behind only their inaugural season.\n\nDrastic changes were made in the offseason last year. The Suns fired general manager Lance Blanks and hired former Celtics assistant GM Ryan McDonough as their new GM. In May, the organization hired former player Jeff Hornacek as their head coach to replace interim head coach Lindsey Hunter. A day later, the Suns hired Washington Wizards director of player personnel Pat Connelly and former Lakers assistant general manager Ronnie Lester as new master talent evaluators for the Suns.\n\nWith the major moves made in the front office, signs of drastic movements in the team roster began to surface. The Suns drafted center Alex Len from the University of Maryland with their fifth pick and power forward Alex Oriakhi from the University of Missouri with their 57th pick. They agreed to trade Jared Dudley to the Los Angeles Clippers and a 2014 second-round pick to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for point guard Eric Bledsoe and small forward Caron Butler. The Suns also agreed to trade Luis Scola to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Gerald Green, Miles Plumlee, and a 2014 lottery protected first round pick. The Suns would later trade Butler to the Bucks in exchange for center Viacheslav Kravtsov and point guard Ish Smith. In addition, the team also waived one of their biggest signings from last season, Michael Beasley. Finally, before the 2013-14 NBA season, the Suns traded center Marcin Gortat, guards Shannon Brown, Kendall Marshall, and Malcolm Lee to the Washington Wizards for veteran forward/center Emeka Okafor and a top-12 protected 2014 first-round draft pick.\n\nDespite many predictions from sports analysts from ESPN, Sports Illustrated, and USA Today indicating the team would be worst in the league, the Suns started out the new year with a 19–11 record — including a 10–3 record in December. Their success deserves thanks not only to the improved performances from players that were with the team last season, but also from some of their newest players such as Eric Bledsoe and Gerald Green. The Phoenix Suns currently sit in eighth position in the Western Conference playoffs race. Their record is 43-29 with a 24-13 home record. If the Suns reach the postseason, it would most likely be as a lower seed, making them an underdog going in, which is a positive feeling for the Suns, who weren’t expected to reach such success this season.\n\nOne of the reasons the Phoenix have been such a threat to opponents is the depth they have in their roster. Coach Hornacek has a lot of different options to choose from, meaning he can piece together different lineups in the event of injury or undesirable player performance.\n\nOne huge positive for the Sun is that their starters have been performing great this season. “They’ve all done something more than they’ve done last year,” Coach Hornacek said about his crew. In the backcourt is Goran Dragic and Bledsoe. They are the two leaders offensively, but when Bledsoe was out because of his knee surgery, shooting guard Gerald Green performed amazingly.\n\nIn their 128-122 win against the Oklahoma City Thunder on March 6, Green had a career high 41 points. So far this season, he is shooting lights out from beyond the arc and has been a constant momentum changer with his big-time highlight dunking skills. They have proven time and time again that they can compete against the best teams in the league. The only teams the Suns have had difficulty with are the two 2013 NBA Finals teams – the Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs; they have also struggled against the Memphis Grizzlies (the Suns are a combined 1-7 against the three teams).\n\nAlso shooting hot from beyond the arc is veteran big man Channing Frye. With his height, it’s a plus for him to have the ability to shoot from long distance. He’s making 42.9 percent of his threes from the top of the key and 43.2 percent from the right wing of the court. Frye helps in spreading the floor and opening the lane to the basket. Since he can bring the taller guys outside of the paint, it allows players like Green and Dragic to hit an open lane to the hoop.\n\nThe Suns’ bench is also performing very well. The Morris brothers, Markieff and Marcus, have done a great job coming off the bench. Markieff has been a big name in the discussion for Sixth Man of the Year this season. Statistically, when Markieff scores at least 20 points, the Suns are 10-4. When younger brother Marcus scores 15 or more points, they are even better at 12-3. Both players do a great job of knocking down mid-range jumpers, shooting threes, and rebounding effectively. This team has a lot of talent on the offensive end, but they wouldn’t be as successful if they didn’t have a lock-down defender in small forward P.J. Tucker. He has shut down superstars time and time again; from Houston’s James Harden, OKC’s Kevin Durant and Pacers’ Paul George – Tucker has stepped up and answered the bell this season.\n\nCan the Phoenix Suns make a great run in the playoff this season and shock the NBA community? They surely can, but they have to make it into the playoffs first. The Suns are currently tied with the Dallas Mavericks for the eighth spot and it will be a dogfight as the last ten games draw to a close. No matter how this season ends for the Suns, they have been reborn and looking forward to great heights, just like the mythical phoenix that dons their uniform and logo.",
  "latent_3832": "The Suffolk County District Attorney's Office in New York doled out $3.25 million in bonuses to prosecutors from its asset forfeiture fund since 2012, according to records obtained by Newsday through a Freedom of Information request.\n\nNewsday reported that the funds were $500,000 more than previously reported, leading to consternation from local legislators:\n\nBonus recipients included deputy chief homicide prosecutor Robert Biancavilla, who received a total of $108,886 between 2012 and 2017, and division chief Edward Heilig and top public corruption prosecutor Christopher McPartland, who each received $73,000, according to records obtained from county Comptroller John Kennedy's office through the Freedom of Information Law [...] On Tuesday, the legislature will hold a public hearing on a bill by Legis. Robert Calarco (D-Patchogue) to require asset forfeiture expenditures, including by the district attorney's office and the police, sheriff's and probation departments, to be approved by the Public Safety Committee [...] \"Asset forfeiture money that comes into this county counts into the millions of dollars,\" Calarco said. \"That's a lot of money to be spent at the sole discretion of an individual with no oversight.\"\n\nAccording to Newsday, the U.S. Attorney's Office has subpoenaed the Suffolk County D.A. for more records on the bonuses.\n\nThe probe is ongoing fallout from the investigation of former Suffolk County Police Chief James Burke. Burke was sentenced this year to 46 months in federal prison for the 2012 beating of a young man who had stolen a duffel bag full of pornography and sex toys from the chief's unlocked SUV and the coverup of the beating. Former Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota and McPartland have been indicted for their alleged role in the coverup. Spota resigned a day after his indictment.\n\nDuffel bags full of porno aside, the bonuses reveal one of the more problematic aspects of asset forfeiture. Law enforcement groups say asset forfeiture is a vital tool to disrupt organized drug trafficking. However, civil liberties advocates argue that lax reporting requirements, and the fact that asset forfeiture proceeds often flow directly into police and prosecutor budgets, create oversight-free expense accounts and perverse profit incentives.\n\nAs I wrote in September, recent news investigations have revealed several instances asset forfeiture accounts being used as off-the-books revenue streams:\n\nPhiladelphia Weekly, in collaboration with City & State PA, reported Wednesday that the local D.A.'s office had spent $7 million in asset forfeiture funds over the last five years, including \"at least one contract that appears to have violated city ethics guidelines—construction work awarded to a company linked to one of the DA's own staff detectives.\" [...] Meanwhile, Cincinnati's City Beat published a similar investigation into Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters' forfeiture piggy bank. City Beat found that the prosecutor office's $1.7 million forfeiture fund \"has been tapped regularly for mundane purchases and, on two occasions, sketchy consulting contracts that Deters won't discuss.\"\n\nThe Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning law firm that has challenged forfeiture laws in several states, released a report this year finding that 26 states have little to no transparency requirements for asset forfeiture. Fourteen states \"do not appear to require any form of property tracking, leaving in doubt even such basic questions as what was seized and how much it was worth, who seized it, when it was seized, where it was seized, and why it was seized.\"\n\nWithout stricter oversight and reporting requirements, the public must take it on faith that police and prosecutors in places like Suffolk County are being scrupulous with the money they seize from them. In this case, a Suffolk County prosecutor facing criminal charges for covering up the civil rights violations of a U.S. citizen received more than $70,000 in bonuses for his job performance.\n\nWho knows what else is hiding in the forfeiture accounts—and duffel bags—of the public officials sworn to protect us?",
  "latent_3842": "Fans of '80s rock know him as the front man of DEVO. Movie buffs know his soundtrack contributions to The Royal Tenenbaums and Moonrise Kingdom. Now the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver has something from Mark Mothersbaugh few have – his visual art.\n\nMyopia is the first comprehensive presentation of Mothersbaugh's widely-heard music alongside his little-known art. The retrospective's title comes from Mothersbaugh's own condition, a diagnosis of nearsightedness he got in second grade.\n\nCarrie Saldo visits 'Myopia' at the Denver MCA\n\n\"I always considered myself first and foremost a visual artist and had this ongoing body of work and did gallery shows and only now is it being revealed,\" Mothersbaugh said with a lilt in his voice.\n\nAs his broader body of work is made manifest patrons will find examples of the DEVO co-founder's drawing, filmmaking painting, sculpture and, of course, music. The exhibit also illuminates the new wave band as much more than five dudes jamming in red plastic hats.\n\n\"It was an art project that was multimedia, said MCA Denver Director Adam Lerner, who conceived the project in collaboration with Mothersbaugh.\"It was literary, it was film, it was costuming, it was performing. It was never meant to be just a band.\"\n\nTo showcase that, three sections are devoted to the band - born out of Mothersbaugh's and Jerry Casale's reaction to the Kent State massacres which took while students there.\n\n\"What we took away from [Kent State] was that the way you change things isn't through rebellion in a capitalistic country,\" Mothersbaugh recalled. \"You change it through influence and subversion and you do it like Burger King does it or Madison Avenue does it.\"\n\nWith his method identified, Mothersbaugh swapped cheeseburgers and haute couture for things he wanted to peddle: music and art. Created and refined over 40 years, his product consumes the entirety of the museum's 27,000 square feet. All of that space is devoted to what director Adam Lerner sees as the importance of exposing the public to the various talents Mothersbaugh possesses.\n\n\"In many ways he's working and inspiring people to find their own creative individual voice in a world that's dominated by, sort of, technology, what is dominated by consumerism and mass-production,\" said Lerner.\n\nAs Mothersbaugh has explored his own identity within broader society the result has often been fantastical in nature as filmmaker Wes Anderson, a collaborator and friend, has noted.\n\n\"…His work has always been unified and singular,\" Anderson writes in the exhibit's companion book. \"Perhaps a result of the simple fact that it all comes from the same exotic and densely populated alien planet: his Brain.\"\n\nThe product of Mothersbaugh's grey matter is scheduled for more than just a lone stop in Denver. It will tour five additional museums through 2017.\n\nArts District is a collaboration of KUNC, RMPBS, and KUVO",

  "latent_4196": "Recent requests by \"Serial\" podcast subject Adnan Syed to have post-conviction proceedings in his 15-year-old murder case reopened in Baltimore Circuit Court — in part so that a new alibi witness can testify on his behalf — are \"meritless\" and should be denied, according to attorneys for the state.\n\nIn a 34-page motion filed with the court Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General Thiruvendran Vignarajah argued that reopening the proceedings so the court can hear from Asia McClain, the alleged witness, would be \"inconsequential theater and not in the interest of justice.\"\n\nSyed was convicted in 2000 of murder in the death of his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, and is serving a life sentence. His case gained worldwide attention because of \"Serial,\" a 12-episode podcast and offshoot of the \"This American Life\" public radio program that revisited the evidence and Syed's defense in the case.\n\nVignarajah said in the filing that McClain's testimony would have no bearing on Syed's claim — still pending before the Maryland Court of Special Appeals — that he should be granted a new trial because of poor representation by his prior attorney. Vignarajah also wrote that allegations that one of the original prosecutors improperly dissuaded McClain from testifying are \"preposterous.\"\n\nIn addition, Vignarajah challenged as \"misleading\" a contention by Syed's new attorney, C. Justin Brown, that his previous attorney, M Cristina Gutierrez, failed to properly challenge phone records from cellular carrier AT&T that prosecutors relied upon to place Syed at Leakin Park when authorities believe Lee's body was buried in 1999.\n\nLee and McClain were Syed's Woodlawn High School classmates.\n\nBrown said in a filing last month that prosecutors used incoming calls to Syed's cellphone even though AT&T warned about the accuracy of cell tower data on a fax cover sheet to Baltimore police. Vignarajah wrote that the fax sheet actually referred to an entirely different set of documents.\n\nBrown said he hadn't seen the state's motion as of Wednesday night but would be \"reviewing it and considering our next step.\"\n\nThe Court of Special Appeals agreed in February to hear Syed's appeal of a lower court ruling that denied his request for a new trial.\n\nkrector@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/rectorsun",
  "latent_4337": "President Barack Obama speaks at church services at Vermont Avenue Baptist Church in Washington. AP\n\nLast April, federal judge Barbara Crabb found that the National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional, writing that it \"goes beyond mere 'acknowledgment' of religion because its sole purpose is to encourage all citizens to engage in prayer, an inherently religious exercise that serves no secular function in this context.\"\n\nToday, however, a federal appeals court panel voted 3-0 to overturn that ruling. The decision was based on the finding that the group that challenged the law did not have standing to do so.\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by a group of atheists and agnostics called the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which argued that it violated the separation of church and state.\n\nThe National Day of Prayer was established by Congress in 1952, and in 1988 was set as the first Thursday in May. By law, the president must proclaim a national day of prayer every year. Despite the initial ruling President Obama proclaimed a National Day of Prayer last year; in his proclamation, he said in part, \"In prayer, we have expressed gratitude and humility, sought guidance and forgiveness, and received inspiration and assistance, both in good times and in bad.\" He also called on Americans to \"pray, or otherwise give thanks, in accordance with their own faiths and consciences, for our many freedoms and blessings.\"\n\nThe administration, which appealed the initial ruling, argued that the National Day of Prayer was legal because it simply acknowledged the role of religion in the United States. The ruling finding the day unconstitutional sparked outrage last year from some lawmakers, among them Texas Republican Lamar Smith, who asked, \"What's next? Declaring the federal holiday for Christmas unconstitutional?\"\n\nIn asserting that the Freedom From Religion Foundation lacked standing, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit said that \"unless all limits on standing are to be abandoned, a feeling of alienation cannot suffice as injury in fact.\" It found there was no injury in part because the proclamation can essentially be ignored by an individual.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation said it would seek a rehearing before the full appeals court.\n\n\"Congress and the president of the United States have no business telling me or any other citizen to pray, 'to turn to God in prayer at churches,' much less setting aside an entire day for prayer every year and even telling me what to pray about,\" said Foundation Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor.\n\nThe social conservative group The Family Research Council, meanwhile, applauded the ruling.\n\n\"Today's ruling sends a message to Judge Barbara Crabb and any other activist judge who would rewrite the Constitution to advance a hostile treatment of religion in public life,\" said the group's president, Tony Perkins.",
  "latent_4417": "Russell Street Report Tale of the Tape Michael Thomas Could Be Round 2 Target\n\nWith the Baltimore Ravens currently holding the sixth overall pick in next week’s NFL Draft, the thinking among most fans and experts is that they will take a defensive player, an offensive lineman, or Ohio State running back Ezekiel Elliott.\n\nThe crop of skill position players on offense is lacking in terms of top-10 talent, but Elliott’s name gets thrown into the ring. However, a safe bet would be to project the Ravens to draft either one of the elite defensive players or Ole Miss tackle Laremy Tunsil.\n\nOne position that is shaping up to not be in play is wide receiver. Laquon Treadwell of Ole Miss is this draft’s best receiver prospect, but no receiver is currently projected to be selected as high as sixth overall.\n\nThat does not rule out an early selection of a wide receiver by Baltimore, however. If things go as planned and the Ravens do not select a wide receiver in round one, starting in round two, a pass catcher may be in play.\n\nRight now, Baltimore’s crop of wide receivers is respectable, but needs improvement. Steve Smith Sr. is entering his final NFL season and coming off a torn achilles, Mike Wallace is only on a two-year deal and Breshad Perriman is healing at a slower pace than a Terrence Cody 40-yard dash.\n\nCome 2017, when Smith Sr. is retired and Wallace will be entering the final year of his contract, the Ravens will need to reload at wide receiver.\n\nSo why not get ahead of the curve this year?\n\nIf the Ravens land a solid choice in the first round, then a player such as Ohio State’s Michael Thomas could be of interest in round two, if available.\n\nProjected to go anywhere from the late 1st round to early 2nd, Baltimore could be a sweet spot for Thomas.\n\nDuring his final two seasons at Ohio State, Thomas was as consistent as can be, hauling in nine touchdown grabs each year and becoming a focal point of the passing game.\n\nHis college production mixed with his elite size and strength make for an intriguing prospect.\n\nIn a rather small wide receiver class, Thomas’ 6’3, 212-pound frame stands out. He’s no slouch when it comes to talent, either.\n\nFar from a speed threat (4.57 40-yard dash), the best way to describe Thomas is that he is a technician. As a true outside receiver, Thomas mixes his distinguished route running and after-the-catch skills to present himself as a player who can be a starter for an NFL offense.\n\nFrom the “technician” side of things, look no further than Thomas’ effortless footwork against one-on-one coverage.\n\nThomas is not the type of player to separate downfield, or do work on screens and hitches. Rather he makes his living by gaining separation less than 15 yards from the line of scrimmage, and then doing his damage after the catch.\n\nBy creating separation in the short passing game, Thomas not only allows himself ample space to make the reception, but also has plenty of open field to work with post-reception.\n\nThe skill set of Thomas would mesh well with Baltimore’s current slate of receivers. With Wallace and Perriman as the speed options, a player like Thomas can work underneath and closer to the line of scrimmage.\n\nDoing the dirty work, whether it may be a short route or a post over the middle and into traffic, is Thomas’ game.\n\nHe is more polished from a route tree perspective than Baylor’s Corey Coleman, and runs laps on Notre Dame’s Will Fuller in terms of versatility.\n\nWith home run hitters in Wallace and Perriman already on the roster, perhaps going the route of a diverse player in the mold of Thomas would help round out Baltimore’s group of wide receivers.\n\nDepending on how next Thursday night plays out for the Ravens, Thomas may be too good to pass up at the top of round two, if available.",

  "latent_4490": "For other people named John Linnell, see John Linnell (disambiguation)\n\nJohn Sidney Linnell (born June 12, 1959) is an American musician, known primarily as one half of the Brooklyn-based alternative rock band They Might Be Giants.[2] In addition to singing and songwriting, he plays accordion, baritone and bass saxophone, clarinet, and keyboards for the group.\n\nLinnell's lyrics include strange subject matter and word play. Persistent themes include aging, delusional behavior, bad relationships, death, and the personification of inanimate objects. Conversely, the accompanying melodies are usually cascading and upbeat.[3][4]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nJohn Linnell was born in New York City, to father Zenos Linnell, a psychiatrist, and mother Kathleen.[3] When Linnell was a child, Walt Kelly's Songs of the Pogo album made a strong impression on his musical sensibilities. The album contained lyrics that relied heavily on puns and word play, which Linnell appreciated. In particular, he recalls \"Lines Upon a Tranquil Brow\", which later became part of They Might Be Giants's live repertoire.[5][6] At an early age, Linnell and his family relocated to Lincoln, Massachusetts, where he attended Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School. Here, he worked on the school newspaper, the Promethean, and met John Flansburgh. The two occasionally collaborated on home-recording projects.[3]\n\nLinnell studied English for a semester at the University of Massachusetts Amherst before dropping out to pursue a career in music.[7]\n\nMusical career [ edit ]\n\nEarly work [ edit ]\n\nIn high school, Linnell played with a band called The Baggs.[5] Prior to finding success in the alternative rock scene, Linnell was also involved with The Mundanes, a Rhode Island-based new wave band. Linnell played keyboards and saxophone for the group.[8] Because of his unsatisfactory minor role in the band, and under the pressure of The Mundanes' unsuccessful search for a record deal, Linnell began leisurely recording music with John Flansburgh.[7][9] His family did not support the transition from what they considered to be a more professional band to an experimental one.[3]\n\n1982–present: They Might Be Giants [ edit ]\n\nLinnell (left) and John Flansburgh\n\nLinnell co-founded They Might Be Giants in 1982 with high school friend John Flansburgh. While the two split singing and songwriting duties roughly in half, Linnell's songs enjoyed the most commercial success in their early years: singles like \"Don't Let's Start\" and \"Ana Ng\" introduced the band to college radio, and they made waves on the Billboard charts in 1990 with \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\".[3][10] John Linnell generally writes songs, sings, plays accordion, keyboards, and various woodwind instruments for the band.\n\nLinnell described his role in the group during an interview for Splatter Effect in 1994:\n\n“ I have a personal, a real obsession, with melody and harmony. I can really never get enough of that kind of thing. I don't think too much about the cultural context of what we're doing. I think John [Flansburgh] is more on that end of it. He thinks more in terms of the larger picture, the larger meaning of what we're doing. I'm more into the technical end: the chords and the rhythms and the melodies. ”\n\nIn December 2005, the band began to produce a twice-monthly podcast. Early on, Linnell frequently contributed humorous spoken-word pieces to the program.\n\n1994–1999: Solo work [ edit ]\n\nSince 1994, Linnell has done some solo work: in that year he released the State Songs EP, which he expanded to a full-length album in 1999. The concept of the State Songs project is intentionally misleading: U.S. states feature prominently in the title and chorus of each song, but have very little to do with their actual narratives. \"Montana\", for instance, is about the insane ramblings of somebody who is about to die; \"Idaho\" explores a famous rock story in which John Lennon, having consumed hallucinogenic drugs, believed he could drive his house; \"South Carolina\" is about getting rich as a result of a bicycle accident.[11]\n\nOther side-projects include the limited-release House of Mayors EP in 1996 through the Hello CD of the Month Club and in 1997 a flexi disc of the song \"Olive the Other Reindeer\" accompanying promotional copies of the children's books, Olive, the Other Reindeer. Linnell has also appeared as a guest musician – often as an accordionist – on a number of musical efforts by other artists, including Suzanne Vega's Days of Open Hand and David Byrne's Grown Backwards.[12][13]\n\nLinnell provided the singing voice for the Other Father character in the 2009 film Coraline, for which They Might Be Giants wrote the \"Other Father Song\", included on the film's soundtrack.[14]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nJohn Linnell is married and has one son, Henry,[3] who appeared as a performer on They Might Be Giants' children's albums Here Come the ABCs and Here Come the 123s.[15][16]\n\nPeople magazine poll [ edit ]\n\nIn a People magazine online poll – \"The Most Beautiful People of 1998\" – John Linnell finished ninth (with 4,189 votes, eight ahead of Sarah Michelle Gellar, and 1,038 behind Madonna). He responded to the curious poll results with an op-ed piece in The New York Times:[17]\n\n“ I had already gotten wind of the existence of the poll a few days earlier when I read that Leonardo DiCaprio had been knocked out of the No. 1 spot by a dark horse named Hank the Angry, Drunken Dwarf. The on-line voters, it seemed, had a new, more evolved definition of beauty that gave low marks to standard celebrity good looks. What they really valued was a person's inner beauty. Anyway, that's what I told myself as I went on line to see the results firsthand. ”\n\nHe went on to say, of online voting:\n\n“ It has been suggested that the Internet might be a good way to vote for our elected officials. If my experience is any guide, though, it appears there are still a few bugs to be worked out before you'll be able to elect the next President while sitting at home in your underwear, unless you want Shecky Greene running the country. ”",

  "latent_4535": "It’s a Jolly Holiday on Main Street! It’s open everyone, it’s open! We’ve been waiting patiently or maybe not so patiently for the new Jolly Holiday Bakery to open since it’s cute signs started enticing us months ago.\n\nYesterday, the Jolly Holiday Bakery, a counter service eatery, soft opened in Disneyland with a “Grand Opening” planned for Saturday, January 7th. I am happy to announce that I was there yesterday morning on the very first day of service and everything was spit spot!\n\nWe’re covering both breakfast AND lunch at the bakery in this post, so stay tuned for dozens of mouth-watering photos of what’s available…like these!!\n\nThese are just teasers, though! Read through the rest of the post to see more yummy pics!\n\nAtmosphere\n\nWhen walking up to Jolly Holiday, I noticed that it was a completely full house with the line wrapping around out the door. It was prime breakfast time and with this being the only eatery open on Main Street, it was the place to be. Not to worry though, the line moves quick and once inside, it splits into two lines with multiple speedy cashiers ready to take care of business! There is plenty of outdoor seating & even with a long line, there were many available tables to choose from.\n\nWhile in line, the decor is distractingly adorable, so that makes it go even quicker! My absolute favorite thing to see were the stained glass penguins on the windows which looked so pretty from both the outside and inside.\n\nUpon entering the bakery, I immediately noticed the detail of the room. The ceilings, light fixtures, wallpaper boarders, trim, it’s all there and it’s all practically perfect in every way!\n\nSince the line split in two, there was twice as much decor too look at which means I had to inspect both lines and excuse myself in front of strangers waiting in line to take some photo. Each line had a display case that held Mary Poppins themed decor. The display cases also doubled as condiment centers, which I thought was clever.\n\nSo besides the cleverly disguised display/condiment centers, there were also some adorable pieces adorning the walls. My favorite were the silhouettes of Mary Poppins along with Jane and Michael Banks, initials and all. I wonder if one of the Main Street silhouette artists did them? They’re even in the same frames that the silhouette store sells!\n\nAnother adorable item adorning the wall of Jolly Holiday is this super cute painting that features sayings/song lyrics from Mary Poppins. I took the time to read each one and as I did my mind immediately had me watching the scene from which it was taken. AND a big thanks goes out to DFB reader JR, for tipping us off that this tree mural is an homage to a former mural that once graced the walls of the old Plaza Pavilion, more details can be found here.\n\nAnd for the final art piece before you place your order… A beautiful mosaic on the floor. This is such a fun well thought out addition to the restaurant as it depicts the chalk painting that Mary Poppins, Bert, Jane & Michael hopped into for the Jolly Holiday scene. The mosaic is located on the ground in the center of the bakery just before you are directed to the register to place your order. A very friendly Cast Member pointed this out to me!\n\nEats\n\nThe menu at Jolly Holiday features items that are all served after 10:30am. However the cases are full of baked goods including substantial items like Ham & Cheese Quiche that can be ordered and eaten for breakfast at an earlier hour.\n\nFrom the line, you can see the bakery cases that are filled to the brim with yummy treats. Some old favorites that made their way down from the recently closed Blue Ribbon Bakery and some new that I’d never seen before. Here’s a tour of the baked goodness.\n\nAfter checking out everything in the cases my friend and I decided on a few early morning treats to try. We purchased a Ham & Cheese Quiche, a Chocolate Mickey Tart, and a Strawberry Lemon Cupcake. To drink we tried the Practically Perfect Punch and the Abuelita (Mexican Hot Chocolate). It was before 10:30, so we decided to taste test these items and then get back in line at around 11:00 for the lunch items! Awesome plan, right?\n\nLet’s start with our drinks. The “Practically Perfect Punch” was up first. I was sold by the name before I even asked what was in it. The menu out front says “Merry Cherry Lemonade” but inside there is no sign of it, it’s Practically Perfect Punch… Regardless the punch is awesome. It’s pomegranite limeade that is a perfect blend of sweet and tart without being too sweet. I really enjoyed it!\n\nThe Abuelita, which is a Mexican Hot Chocolate was also fantastic. It’s basically a dark chocolate hot chocolate with a cinnamon flavor. It’s topped with whipped cream and served up warm. Really tasty!\n\nA full line of coffee drinks are also available and served all day.\n\nNow that we had some great beverages, it was time to dig into the food. The Ham & Cheese Quiche was first. It was served warm and had a great texture. The cheese was melty, and the pieces of ham were flavorful. The crust was also nice. Not too flaky, but not to hard, it was easy to cut through and had a nice buttery taste to it.\n\nAfter out “entree” it was time for the first treat. The Mickey Shaped Chocolate Tart. I’ve never seen these at the Disneyland Resort, so I’m going to assume they are new. The tart has a Mickey shaped cookie type crust, it’s filled with a thick chocolate mousse and topped with a white chocolate Mickey face. So cute and tasty to boot. The mousse was really smooth and not too rich. Both my friend and I really enjoyed this one!\n\nAfter Mickey, we tried out the Strawberry Lemon Cupcake. It was moist lemon cake topped with whipped cream frosting, pink chocolate shavings, and sweet strawberries. I was worried this one was going to be too sweet, but it really wasn’t. I also thought it would taste artificial, but again, I was wrong. It was a light fruity flavor and was quite delightful. I love to see new cupcake flavors, especially the fruity flavors!\n\nSO, now that it’s after 10:30am, it’s time to get back into line for some lunch eats. All of Jolly Holiday’s foods are pre-made, not made to order. They are prepared in the kitchen and then placed in the display cases and are warmed up as you order them. There is a cute vintage looking stove that appears to house the “soups” of the day, but I didn’t actually see them being served from the stove.\n\nAfter 10:30, the display cases are re-arranged to display the lunch items. I did like the fact that you could view your food options prior to ordering them. There was even a dessert added that wasn’t there earlier in the morning, seasonal fruit pies, which happened to be apple! Other items in the cases included the following.\n\nWith all of these delicious looking items, it was really hard to choose. We narrowed it down to the Jolly Holiday Combo, the Angus Roast Beef Salad, the Waldorf Chicken Sandwich, and a dessert that wasn’t in the case earlier, a Mini Apple Pie! The presentation of the food is very cute, all dishes are served on a tray with a “newspaper” lining that appears to be a vintage newspaper from January 17th. I was curious to see if this date was significant in Disney (particularly Mary Poppins) history so I checked out This Day in Disney History to find that there are several Disney events that took place that day. I have no idea if this date was chosen on purpose, it would sure be fun to know.\n\nAfter trying to interpret the newspaper with no avail, we dug into the Jolly Holiday Combo, a Toasted Cheese Sandwich with Tomato Basil Soup. It looked delicious and sounded delicious & these are two of my favorite foods, so I was very excited. Unfortunately, this one was a bit of a let down. The cheese in our sandwich wasn’t melty at all, in fact it was kind of hard and plastic-like. I did LOVE the idea of it served in three “finger” type pieces for dipping, but I wouldn’t order this again unless I was promised melty cheese. The soup was also just OK to me. It was a bit bland and almost to creamy. Not enough tomato flavor for my taste. I was really sad when trying this one but not to worry, things were about to turn around completely!\n\nNext up was the Angus Beef Salad with Blue Cheese Dressing; Iceberg Lettuce with Red and Yellow Tomatoes and Pickled Onions. It was fabulous. The beef was cooked just right and the ingredients in the salad were fresh. We really enjoyed the pickled onions, what an interesting ingredient and really really tasty. The salad is served with a breadstick that was also nice. Soft and fresh; it accompanied the salad perfectly.\n\nLast “meal” up was the Waldorf Chicken Sandwich. My absolute favorite item of the day. I am a huge chicken salad sandwich fan and this one was fantastic. Apples, Walnuts, Celery and Dried Cranberries (aka Craisins) served up on a fresh Brioche Roll, I was in heaven. It was sweet in flavor with tons of white meat chicken chunks in the mix. The bread was very soft and not at all flaky like a croissant can be, what a nice change to add the Brioche roll. The sandwich comes with a nice piece of butter lettuce and what appear to be homemade chips (I didn’t confirm) that were served warm, crisp and salty.\n\nAfter stuffing ourselves with all of this deliciousness, we had to make room for the grand finale, the seasonal fruit pie, which was a mini apple pie, lattice crust and all. The minute I saw this in the case, I knew I had to try it because it reminded me of the awesome mini blueberry pie over at Hungry Bear! I’m glad we chose this one, because it was just as good if not better than the blueberry one. Served warm, the layers upon layers of apples and cinnamon were literally one of the tastiest treats I have had at Disneyland. Like an old fashioned pie you’d picture winning a bake off. Really that good. The only thing that could make it better would be a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream, but Chef Oscar told us there was no ice cream on the premises!\n\nAs we were finishing up our meal, Chef Oscar walked up to us to say hello and chat. It was great to see him (even though I had just seen him less than a week ago at Carnation Cafe) at his new “temporary” location. You could tell he was excited about the new digs, he walked around smiling and greeting every single person at every single table. He really is the ultimate Disney Food Ambassador.\n\nAND for one last fun tip check out the exit sign on your way out. See that cute penguin? If you stand in just the right position, he’s climbing the Matterhorn.\n\nOverall\n\nOverall, I am really excited about the Jolly Holiday Bakery, besides my non-melty cheese on the toasted cheese sandwich, everything was excellent. I am very excited to go back to try the other items on the menu and also sample some of the desserts that I’ve never had. The details and design of the restaurant were refreshing and fun. But it’s not like I’m biased or anything… 😉\n\nHeather Sievers is the Disney Food Blog’s Dining in Disneyland columnist.

But it also marks the first night of Ramadan, a month-long religious fast during which many Muslims refrain from ingesting food and liquids from sunrise until sunset.\n\nMuslim players competing in the World Cup, then, face a tough choice, as fulfilling the requirements of their religion may affect their performance on the soccer pitch. In Brazil’s timezone, believers who wish to observe the holiday will have to spend approximately 13.5 hours per day fasting. While athletes’ bodies are fine-tuned instruments, that’s still no easy feat when you’re burning up as many calories as international soccer stars do during the World Cup.\n\nRamadan observance could affect a decent number of World Cup teams: Among the 16 remaining squads, France, Nigeria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and Nigeria all have more than one Muslim on their squad, while the Algerian national team is made up exclusively of Muslim players.\n\nMuslim players have some options, though. FIFA Chief Medical Officer Jiri Dvorak suggested at a Monday media briefing that players observing Ramadan can ask religious authorities for an exemption and make up for the missed fast days at a later time. And during the 2012 Olympics, the United Arab Emirates’ soccer team was exempted from fasting during the tournament by the country’s highest religious body.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nIndeed, Germany’s Mesut Ozil, who is of Turkish descent, has already told the press that he will not take part in Ramadan because he “is working.” A spokesman for the Swiss team, meanwhile, has said that none of its players will fast during the competition.\n\nMuslim players who do choose to fast during Ramadan and the World Cup, however, could face a tough next few weeks. While observing Ramadan, players would have to adjust their daily habits to its requirements: eating and hydrating before the sun rises and then again only after sunset. They would spend the hours in between, a period during which they may have to play a match, with no nourishment at all.\n\nBut according to research conducted by the FIFA medical team and others, fasting players can still compete at the top of their games.\n\n“We have made extensive studies of players during Ramadan, and the conclusion was that if Ramadan is followed appropriately, there will be no reduction in the physical performances of players,” Dvorak said during the Monday media briefing. “We have done extensive studies and nothing worries us.”\n\nAnd a report from the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information found that fasting players can take some practical steps to ensure their performance does not suffer on the pitch.\n\n“The available evidence indicates that high-level athletes can maintain performance during Ramadan if physical training, food and fluid intake, and sleep are appropriate and well controlled,” says a 2012 report by the NCBI. “Individualized monitoring of athletes may help to prevent fatigue and overtraining and to reduce the risk of consequent illness and injury.”\n\nThat NCBI report recommends athletes observing Ramadan train close to meal times. It also emphasizes the importance of adequate sleep throughout the fast. On top of that, a separate 2013 NCBI report advises athletes to include fat in their pre-dawn meal. The immediate fluid deficit that accumulates throughout the day can usually be reversed when athletes ingest fluids at night, the 2013 report adds.\n\nThe reports do emphasize that the effects of the fast on athletes vary with the sport, the season, and athletes’ personal habits. The sweltering heat in Brazil at this time of year, it should be said, will not make observant Muslim players’ task any easier.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.",

  "latent_4585": "The Zamboni is a given in NHL rinks, but so is Tommy McVie.\n\n“This is my 60th year of pro hockey,” said McVie, currently a scout for the Boston Bruins. Before that he was head coach of the Winnipeg Jets, Washington Capitals, New Jersey Devils and an assistant to Brian Sutter with the Bruins.\n\nMcVie is 80 years old, and the colourful character who was once a minor-league pro teammate of Mark Messier’s dad Doug in the 1960s — when they played together with the WHL Portland Buckaroos — is still working.\n\nHow much longer will the NHL’s oldest scout do this?\n\n“I never leave a job until I’m fired. It could happen any day. I’ve been fired seven times,” laughed McVie, who scouts the Western Conference teams for the Bruins.\n\n“One day, a guy’s interviewing me and he says, ‘I’m looking at your bio as a player and it says you were traded five times. And it says you’ve been fired seven times as a coach.’ He says to me, ‘You ever thought of quitting?’ I said, ‘Hell, no, hockey’s the only thing I’m good at.’ ’’\n\nMcVie is in terrific shape for an octogenarian. There’s not a hotel gym he hasn’t spent time in, and looks like he could bench-press Connor McDavid.\n\nHe loves hockey rinks even more than gyms.\n\n“He’s a lifer,” said Detroit’s Western pro scout Bruce Haralson. “All of his friends are in this business. We’re like a family, even though we work for different teams.”\n\nHe’s not tired of grading players who could be his great-grandkids. “I’ve never hung around with old people. I’ve never lived anywhere where old people live. I’m around dressing rooms with kids. I don’t dress like an old man. I’m not all bent over,” he said.\n\nThe travel doesn’t bug him, either.\n\n“Are you kidding? Gets me out of the house. I can’t stay home. My late wife used to say, ‘You love hockey more than you love me.’ I said, ‘Yeah, but I love you more than I love baseball.’ ’’\n\n“Believe it or not, I lived in the Holiday Inn, Room 424 in Portland, Maine, for five years when I was coaching there (New Jersey’s AHL farm team). When I coached the Jets in Winnipeg, I lived at the Viscount Gort for two years. Room 200. That’s seven years I spent in a hotel room,” he said.\n\nWhy didn’t get he get an apartment?\n\n“Why bother. I used to say, ‘If you fire me, I can have my stuff from my hotel room and be out of town in 30 minutes, unless I have stuff at the cleaners. Then maybe it’s an hour, and I’m gone,’ ” said McVie.\n\nMcVie has a funny story for every night of the week, like the one from training camp when he coached the Devils a few decades ago. “One day Bob Butera, president of the team, comes into the dressing room and asks who this guy helping out (trainer) Keith Parker is. Parker says, ‘his name’s Norman Bates … says he’s just working training camp. Says he doesn’t really need the job. Says he owns a motel with his mother outside of town,” guffawed McVie.\n\n“Next day, Mr. (John) McMullen, the owner, comes up and sees the guy go by him and asks Bob Butera who the new guy is. Butera says “He’s, uh, Norman Bates. He and his mother own a motel outside of town.’ Mr. McMullen says, ‘Are you bleeping crazy?’ A week later Butera, who was an attorney, was gone, and here comes Lou Lamoriello in (as president),” said McVie.\n\n“Hockey wasn’t Butera’s business.”\n\nNeither were movies, obviously.\n\nShort Shifts:\n\nSt. Louis coach Ken Hitchcock isn’t writing off ex-Oilers winger Magnus Paajarvi. “When we’ve sent him down to Chicago (AHL Wolves) in the past, he’s the most dominant player in that league because he’s able to create his own space. He controlled hockey games. He comes up here and still has the attitude that he’s playing with people who are better than him. If he solves that issue like he does at the American league level, he’ll be a good player here.”\n\nBig problem in Columbus is in net with the former Vezina winner Sergei Bobrovsky. It’s a red flag when Goalie Bob publicly says he has no confidence right now. He has a beer-league .830 save percentage and 5.05 goal average in four games.\n\nScratching Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin for sleeping in and missing a morning skate took some nerve, but coach Barry Trotz is wired that way. Back in 1986, Leafs captain Rick Vaive got scolded the same way. He had a few pops with his buddy John Anderson — who was playing for the Quebec Nordiques against the North Stars the night before the Leafs played them in Minnesota — and Vaive missed a morning meeting. He was scratched and cantankerous owner Harold Ballard ripped him.\n\nDetroit forward Dylan Larkin, who made the Wings at 19 and has been playing with Henrik Zetterberg and Justin Abdelkader on their top line, looks like a draft-day steal at No. 15 in 2014. “He’s got some of Jonathan Toews in him; he’s mature beyond his age. He’s going to be a first-line centre when Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk are gone,” said a long-time Eastern Conference scout. Datsyuk, who had off-season ankle surgery, is skating now and will probably be back the first or second week of November.\n\nSean Burke, the goalie whisperer in Arizona before leaving at the end of last season to look for management jobs elsewhere, is coming off double hip-replacement surgery. He is scouting for Team Europe, part of the 2016 World Cup of Hockey.\n\nMike Smith is the hottest NHL goalie, stopping 104 of his 106 shots faced in three wins for the Coyotes. “It’s awesome. He’s got so much talent,” said Devan Dubnyk of his former Phoenix partner, who had a pretty rocky 2014-15 season.\n\njmatheson@edmontonjournal.com\n\nTwitter.com/nhlbymatty",

  "latent_4652": "Multiple Wall Street pros have been talking up September in recent days, but the market gives just a 19.9 percent probability of a hike then. December is about a coin flip, with traders anticipating a funds rate of 0.47 percent from the current 0.4 percent. The CME says that equates to a 47.8 percent chance.\n\nThe principal question, then, will be what kind of signals the Federal Open Market Committee sends in the post-meeting statement.\n\nAt the June meeting, the committee surprised the market when it conceded that its original estimation of four hikes this year was wrong, cutting the new projection to two. The statement did not include a \"balance of risks\" mention that the market considers pivotal in gauging the sentiment of Fed officials, nor did it give a rate timetable, like the \"next meeting\" language it included last October, the meeting before it hiked.\n\nA deluge of economic data follows the FOMC meeting, including an estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product, revisions to 2015 GDP and the employment cost index report. In addition, the Kansas City Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, summit in August. It should be noted that much of the data on which the Fed will rely for this week's meeting covered the period before the June Brexit vote.\n\n\"Policymakers will have an incentive to keep their options open, and plenty of opportunities to guide market expectations, should they need to,\" Goldman Sachs economists Zach Pandl and Jan Hatzius said in a note to clients. Goldman sees a 25 percent chance of a September hike and 40 percent in December, which adds up to a two-thirds probability of one move before the end of the year.\n\nAs for the financial markets, stocks have been on a monthlong run and have staged an 18 percent rally off the February lows. Bond yields remain muted, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note well off its July 8 low but still sharply down for the year, most recently trading at 1.56 percent.\n\nThe Fed, though, still finds reasons to keep rates anchored in crisis territory as it has added global financial stability as an unofficial third mandate on top of its two official duties of price stability and maximum employment. Inflation is low but rising gradually, while many economists believe the labor market is nearing capacity, despite a slowdown.\n\nThe central bank is now left to chart a difficult course, with markets doubting that policy will normalize anytime soon. The next month with a better than 50 percent probability is March 2017, with a hike not fully priced in until December 2017.\n\nFed officials, however, continue to insist that rate hikes will be appropriate sometime soon.\n\n\"There are only so many times you can do that and say the facts have changed and we're changing our mind,\" said North, the Euler Hermes economist. \"It may be rational a time or two. If you keep doing that, your credibility does indeed get hit. That becomes a problem for them.\"",
  "latent_4679": "Helena Bonham Carter and Edward Norton in \"Fight Club\" Gen X and the big self-help lie: In furious middle age, a \"Life Reimagined\" feels impossibly out of reach The optimistic gospel of individual fulfillment in mid-life is completely out of touch with our reality now\n\nIt is 2016, and all reports about the state of things are rosy. Scientists tell us that the midlife crisis doesn’t really exist. The New York Times runs an unusually optimistic article proclaiming that — brace yourself — the economy is chugging along beautifully. By all accounts, we should all be as happy as Snow White swept up in that whirlwind of chirping birds and spring cleaning.\n\nBut you don’t have to look far to see that people in middle age are, actually, historically angry, more like “Falling Down”’s William Foster in a rage-filled rampage. Just think about the Sanders-Trump upsurge — one thing that unifies both teams is anger, even fury. It’s not all that rare to hear a particularly angry middle-aged grouser hope that Trump wins in order to see the whole system exposed and watch it crumble. That’s not just anger, that’s angry to the point of extreme nihilism. This isn’t all racially driven -— wages are flat, the safety net has frayed, and the one percent is still making out like bandits. Banks that were too big to fail are even bigger.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBarbara Bradley Hagerty, a former NPR correspondent and the author of the new book “Life Reimagined: The Science, Art, and Opportunity of Midlife,” floats into this tumultuous period like Pollyanna. Part memoir and part scientific exploration, the book takes a hard look at what keeps people ticking when things look bleak. In the wake of the trials and traumas of middle age, Bradley Hagerty arrives with a hopeful message: You can think and act your way out of the soul-crushing blandness of the middle years, and all you need is a bit of imagination.\n\nThere’s no question that some of what she writes is true: A positive attitude does help people cope with crisis. Reorienting your sense of self around serving others — which some of her case studies have done — is good for everyone involved. Certainly, she’s not imagining the fact that some Americans have pivoted and moved into a productive period. And Bradley Hagerty writes well and, as anyone who’s heard her NPR reports knows, tells stories engagingly.\n\nBut it’s a message that can feel like a slap in the face for some Generation Xers, many of whom, post-recession, have found themselves in competition with Millennials for low wages and nonexistent job security. Many of us were just hitting what should have been the most productive part of our careers, and the most stable, even boring, time in our lives.\n\nJust looking at the cover, chirpy bright yellow dotted with scientific looking sprinkles, seems like a slap in the face for many of us still reeling. How can this cheerful book even exist?\n\nWell, for one, Bradley Hagerty herself identifies as a Baby Boomer, (though she’s at the tail end of the boom). She grew up during the years of plenty and had nearly two decades at one employer — experiences an Xer can only envy.\n\nHonestly, after reading David Brooks’ cloying take on it in the New York Times, I was prepared to dislike this book. At the beginning, it was pretty easy. There are the peppy replies to Bradley Hagerty’s queries on NPR’s Facebook page, like the one from a laid-off professional: “I have used up most of my savings. I am not sure where my next job will be. I am currently working a retail job and just wrote a TV pilot. I am having the time of my life.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMuch of Bradley Hagerty’s book is a spin through the recent studies on midlife and happiness psychology, which has now turned its back on moment-by-moment fulfillment and toward meaning and purpose as a way to lead a successful life. Like Gretchen Rubin’s “The Happiness Project,” the author sets out to test some of the latest prescriptions — only this time it’s for a meaningful midlife and beyond. Not surprisingly for anyone who’s been paying attention, there is a strong push toward building a strong social network, creating short- and long-term goals, and having the right mindset.\n\nIt’s not until the chapter “When Bad Stuff Happens,” especially the section on “post-traumatic growth” that the book surprisingly begins to speak more directly to our particularly difficult times. According to Bradley Hagerty, “PTG is a cousin to resilience, but more of a thug: meaner, more brutal, more devastating — and more transformative.” In order to move away from the trauma and toward the growth, according to two psychologists from the University of North Carolina in Charlotte, there needs to be a dramatic change of bedrock beliefs.\n\nWhile Bradley Hagerty’s examples are of individuals rebuilding their lives, much of the country is in a state of post-traumatic shock and needs to do something similar. Perhaps the reason why people are so angry is that our bedrock beliefs have not changed even though so many of us are living very different lives than we might have imagined we would. Chucking it all to work a minimum wage job and write a screenplay on the side, as freeing and fulfilling as that may be, is not exactly the answer for most of us who want to ensure that we’re not in some kind of bargain-basement assisted care facility in our later years. There is a need for a reframing of our ideals — and that, I would guess, is why we are reaching for extreme answers.\n\nBradley Hagerty delivers some excellent advice about longevity and having a purposeful life. Many of us are still in crisis, however, and only the more comfortable among us have the luxury of thinking ahead. As the author states, the earlier you start, the better, because you never know how long you have.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBut where we are right now feels like turmoil — and it feels very precarious, the total opposite of what we were raised to expect from middle age. Seven million homes have been foreclosed since the Great Recession, and there were even more layoffs. Some of these people have pulled their lives together, but these kinds of setbacks are tougher to recover from than “Life Reimagined” lets on. And while Bradley Hagerty offers good suggestions for individuals seeking a way out, she avoids stoking anger or urging a larger movement of the dispossessed. This is where her Boomer roots become clear. She’s trying to help people, but she’s part of a generation that went from broad social movements to the gospel of individual fulfillment, and it shows in her book.\n\nSome of the people who’ve bounced back are skilled and resourceful; some were just lucky. If you’re still trying to regain your footing, these stories are not as inspirational as they are annoying. A lot of Americans long for a Trump or a Sanders. We are aching for a revolution. We are in the middle of figuring out — post-recession — what we believe. Maybe, someday, we can think more positive thoughts and start planning for that 10K run. Right now, though, we’re still traumatized. Being told we need to make more friends doesn’t really help.",
  "latent_4754": "Tissue Culture or Micropropagation\n\nFor questions about any terms in this article, please see the Tissue Culture Glossary. To learn more and converse with other tissue culture experts, be sure to join the FlytrapCare Tissue Culture Forums.\n\nTissue culture, also known as micropropagation, is a propagation method used to produce plants under sterile conditions. This method uses plant explants (plant parts) or seeds that have been sterilized before being placed in containers with a growing medium (usually a gel) that has some nutrients added. The explants or seeds, the containers and the medium have all been sterilized, and this (if successful) prevents any cut or torn tissue, or the entire explant or seed itself, from becoming infected with a microorganism of some kind and rotting during the time these plant parts require to become rooted or to multiply.\n\nMany types of seeds germinated in these conditions tend to grow very fast compared to being sowed in standard growing media outside of sterile, enclosed containers. Using plant tissue, it is possible to grow exact copies of the donor plant. This is extremely useful for plants that genetically have desirable traits because one can create many clones of a particular plant much faster than traditional propagation methods like cuttings, pullings or divisions.\n\nThe sterile nutrient media usually contains a nutrient solution (typically salts and vitamins), sucrose (sugar), hormones (optional), antibiotics (optional), and a solidifying or gelling agent such as agar (a product of seaweed).\n\nFour stages of plant tissue culture have been defined by a scientific pioneer in the field, Toshio Murashige, professor emeritus of the University of California at Riverside:\n\nStage I. Establishment of an aseptic (sterile) culture.\n\nStage II. The multiplication of propagules (a propagule is any part of a plant used to make or become new plants).\n\nStage III. Preparation of propagules for successful transfer to soil (rooting and “hardening” (acclimating) outside of sterile conditions in regular growing media).\n\nStage IV. Establishment in soil (or other appropriate growing medium).\n\nTissue Culture Versus Traditional Propagation\n\nThe main difference between tissue culture and propagation done by cuttings, pullings, divisions or seeds is that the plants grow faster (the nutritious gel medium helps) and one can multiply them rapidly by giving them the right hormones and dividing them regularly. In theory, you can create an infinite number of plants from just one piece of tissue, and many plants in a relatively brief period of time. Below is a picture, courtesy of Jens Brettschneider, showing the difference in growth rate and plant size of seeds started at the same time, at left in tissue culture, and at right in traditional potting media.\n\nTissue Culture Supplies\n\nThe beauty of tissue culture is that you probably have most of everything you need to get started in your home already. Here’s a list of supplies that should get you started:\n\nBaby food jars (tall ones are better). You need lots of them. I got a ton of them for $20 off of Craigslist. Also check with your local recycle center and day care centers.\n\nPhyto Caps (go ahead and get 100 of them) for capping the baby food jars. They’re autoclavable (can be put on the jars and put in a pressure cooker without exploding or melting) and can be purchased from http://www.phytotechlab.com/\n\nLong forceps (at least 6 inches, 8 inches is better). You can order one from Carol Stiff if you can’t find one in a store: Home tissue culture supplies\n\nMedia – Murashige and Skoog (MS) with vitamins\n\nA good pH (acidity/alkalinity) meter. You can use paper litmus strips, but they are very hard to get an accurate measurement with.\n\nA smidgen spoon measuring set\n\nA good pipette set or disposable glass or plastic pipettes (also spelled pipets): disposable plastic pipets\n\nA pressure cooker for sterilizing media and instruments.\n\nThe basic stuff that you probably already have around the house including bleach, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, sugar, distilled water, baking soda, vinegar and a teaspoon measuring set.\n\nSome sort of hood to work under. I use a 30 gallon aquarium laid on its side. Many people use a plastic storage bin, upside down with a hole cut out of the side. Laminar Flow Hoods are the ultimate work areas, but are somewhat expensive.\n\nA spray bottle to mist the inside of the work area.\n\nAny other hormones or chemicals that you want to work with. Many people use BAP for callus induction and IBA for root growth stimulation. I’ve read scholarly articles that say kinetin works great for callus induction on Dionaea. Make sure you decide on these before you place your order with Phytotech because they charge an arm and a leg for shipping, so you’re better off not placing multiple orders with them. I also recommend Plant Preservative Mixture (PPM), an antibiotic: it helps to kill any disease causing microorganisms that may have survived the initial sterilization procedures. PPM can be ordered through Carol or directly from the PPM website: PPM for tissue culture\n\nBuying supplies\n\nI highly recommend that you join the Home Tissue Culture Group run by Carol Stiff, http://www.kitchenculturekit.com/, and purchase a kit to start with. It is a non-profit organization focused on helping people learn the skills needed to successfully tissue culture at home. She also sells nearly all supplies you would ever need and certainly more than enough to get started in the hobby of home tissue culture.\n\nAnother similar site that sells kits and supplies is http://www.planttc.com/.\n\nPhytotech Labs, http://www.phytotechlab.com/, is a great source for all tissue culture equipment. Their prices are competitive and they have good service. Here are a few more similar sites that sell to home tissue culturers.\n\nPlant Preservative Mixture (PPM) can be purchased from here: http://www.ppm4plant-tc.com/. It is almost a requirement to use PPM unless you are starting the hobby with a laminar flow hood, which is unlikely.\n\nPreparing media\n\nIf you order a kit from the Kitchen Culture Kit site by Carol Stiff, you’ll get all the instructions you need for preparing media. Media preparation is somewhat dependent on the type of plant species you’re attempting to put into tissue culture. Many species of plants can be cultured on full strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) with vitamins. For carnivorous plants, it’s best to use 1/2 or 1/3 MS with vitamins. There are, of course, other types of media that could work as well, but for simplicity sake, let’s just discuss using MS.\n\nList of ingredients for preparing 1 liter of Dionaea muscipula (Venus fly trap) medium:\n\n1/2 MS medium with vitamins (one half of a 1 liter packet or 2.2 grams). Most Tissue Culture Techs uses 1/3 MS for Carnivorous plants with great results.\n\n2 tablespoons of table sugar (about 30g)\n\n1 ml of BAP (1 mg/ml) – leave this out for seeds. It’s even optional for explants. Dionaea explants will form callus without it.\n\n1 ml of PPM\n\nAgar\n\nDistilled water\n\nVinegar and baking soda.\n\nSteps to make media:\n\nFill a 1 quart or 1 liter container with 3 cups of water. Add MS medium (1/2 packet or 2.2 grams) and 2 tablespoons of table sugar and mix well. Measure 1 ml of BAP and 1ml of PPM and add them to the solution. Add food coloring (if desired) to indicate BAP media. Add enough water to bring the media mixture to exactly 1 liter Test the pH. A pH between 5 and 6 is preferred with 5.6 to 5.8 being optimal. If the pH is too low (“acidic”) add a VERY small amount of baking soda to the solution, remix it well and remeasure.\n\nIf the pH is too high (“basic”) add a few drops of vinegar to the solution, remix it well and remeasure.\n\nContinue doing this until you reach the desired pH. Once the desired pH is reached, start dispensing the media to the baby food jars. (NOTE: Some people add the agar first, but in my experience this causes some jars to be too soft while others are rock hard. I’ve found it better to add the agar after dispensing). You can put in 25ml or 50 ml into each jar. Add the agar to the jars. For 25 ml of media, I use a “smidgen” spoonful and for 30ml to 50ml I use a “pinch” spoonful either level (for 30ml) or heaping (for 50ml). NOTE: You can also add the agar or other gelling agent (Gelcarin GP812, etc.) to the media before dispensing to the baby food jars. Agar isn’t soluble in water at room temperature so you’ll have to heat the media to near a boil to dissolve it. Gelcarin is soluble in water at room temperature, so you can add it before dispensing. For most applications I use between 6g and 8g of gelling agent per liter of media. Cap the jars and place them in the pressure cooker, microwave or other autoclave device in preparation for sterilization.\n\nFrank Tromble of the Home Tissue Culture Group made an excellent video tutorial for making media:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsB-NuT1F2E\n\nBe sure to check out all of Frank’s amazing tissue culture videos that he’s uploaded to YouTube. Or join the Home Tissue Culture Group and get a DVD with all of them compiled on it.\n\nSterilizing media\n\nSince you’ll be preparing the media in the kitchen or your work area in the open air, the media will almost certainly have contaminants in it, including bacteria and/or mold spores. In order to prevent these contaminants from “crashing” or taking over the culture and outgrowing any other tissue in it, you’ll have to sterilize the media\n\nMedia sterilization can be done in the microwave or in a pressure cooker. I’ve only ever used a pressure cooker because, in my opinion, it’s a much more reliable method. If using the microwave, you can end up boiling the media over or not getting it sterilized completely. There’s a fine line you have to walk when using the microwave, so I’ve just avoided it.\n\nA pressure cooker, on the other hand, provides stable temperature and pressure which will kill spores. Any standard pressure cooker is set to work at 15 PSI. Some of the better models have pressure control so that you can set them to run at different pressures. For the purpose of sterilizing media, 15 PSI is perfect. The amount of time to run the pressure cooker depends on how much media you have in each of the jars. I typically put 30ml to 40ml of media in each jar and run the pressure cooker for 25 minutes. Below is a table copied from a PhytoTech Lab pamphlet with appropriate sterilization times based on the amount of volume per vessel:\n\nMINIMUM AUTOCLAVING TIME FOR PLANT TISSUE CULTURE MEDIA Volume of Medium per Vessel (mL) Minimum Autoclaving (min) Volume of Mediumper Vessel (mL) Minimum Autoclaving (min) 25 20 500 35 50 25 1000 40 100 28 2000 48 250 31 4000 63\n\nSterilizing explants (plant tissue)\n\nPerhaps the most important part of having success with explants is selecting the right tissue and starting with clean tissue. To dramatically increase your odds of success with an explant, keep the plant that you plan to harvest the explant from growing in very clean conditions. You can even cover it with a plastic bag or grow it indoors under lights. Rain and wind carry all kinds of bacteria and mold spores in them and onto the plant, making it very hard to get clean without killing the plant tissue. Select a piece of tissue that’s clean, young and appears to be disease free.\n\nI alter the exposure times to the sterilization chemicals depending on the size of the tissue. If the tissue is larger or thicker (like flower stalks) I let it soak longer. If it’s thin or small (like most leaves) I decrease the soak time. So it’s more of an art than a hard science when it comes to sterilizing tissue. However, here are the basic steps of my sterilization technique:\n\nHarvest the cleanest, youngest piece of tissue you can. I’ve been growing any plants that I want to put into TC indoors to help keep them clean. Thoroughly rinse the tissue under warm running water for 20 to 30 minutes. I usually start the wash with antibacterial soap that has triclosan in it (either Dial complete or a similar generic brand). Then after some time (15 minutes?) washing/soaking in the soapy water, I just run it under water. Quick dip in 91% alcohol. For small pieces of tissue I skip this step because it seems to me that alcohol can quickly kill the tissue. Transfer to 3% H2O2. For small tissue, leave it in for 3 to 5 minutes. Larger tissue, 5 to 7 minutes. I shake the container vigorously during this time. Transfer to 200ml of 10% to 20% bleach (I change it between 10%, 15% and 20% and it doesn’t seem to make much of a difference) with 6 to 8 drops of Tween 20. Again, the amount of time in the bleach varies depending on the size of the tissue, but it usually ranges from 6 minutes to 12 minutes. I shake the container vigorously during this time. Two 3 to 5 minute rinses in sterile water and then transfer to media.\n\nOne important thing to note is that I keep my forceps in rubbing alcohol (isopropyl) to keep them sterile. Before I handle the tissue, however, I move the tips of the forceps into the flame of an alcohol lamp and then rinse them in sterile water. The first time I attempted TC, I failed to do this which resulted in small amounts of alcohol being on the tissue and getting on the media. That’s one main reason my first few attempts at TC were such epic failures. BE SURE TO RINSE THE ALCOHOL OFF OF YOUR FORCEPS BEFORE PUTTING THE TISSUE INTO THE VESSEL.\n\nAgar and other Gelling Agents\n\nAgar is a gelatinous substance derived from seaweed. See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar\n\nIt is primarily used for “firming up” media. You add it in powder form to the media, heat it to a boiling temperature to melt the agar, and then when the media cools back down, it “gels.” The purpose of agar is to provide a stable partially-solid surface on which the explant or seeds can rest and anchor themselves (when and if roots grow) without being immersed, but still have it soft enough so that nutrients and water may be extracted from it.\n\nAnother gelling agent that’s becoming more widely used is Gelcarin GP812, or carrageenan. It is much clearer than agar when it sets up and it has a different consistency. It’s much easier for it to break apart, so in larger vessels, it may be better to use agar.\n\nThere are other gelling agents that are available including gellan gums, agarose, alginic acid and more. I’ve only used agar and Gelcarin and both of them are inexpensive and work well.\n\nMurashige and Skoog media with agar and hormones added\n\nFor those people that are lazy (just kidding), there are pre-made media mixes that you can purchase. If you are unsure what kind of media you have, you can figure it out by seeing how much the package tells you to add for 1L of media. If it is just the MS media, it will be 4.33g/L, if it contains agar, it will be 9-12 g/L.\n\nLaminar Flow Hoods\n\nLaminar flow hoods are ideal, but they aren’t necessary for starters. They are expensive and most people simply can’t afford to spend $500+ on a piece of equipment when starting a hobby. Many people have had excellent results without the use of expensive flow hoods. Working in overturned plastic containers with the side cut out or aquariums laid on their side are very good methods.\n\nBuilding a Laminar Flow Hood\n\nConstruction a Laminar Flow Hood takes some good planning, and you need to source a couple of expensive items (HEPA filter, blower), but it is possible. See these threads for ideas:\n\nHow to build your own Laminar Flow Hood\n\nFlow Hood Finished…Almost\n\nFlow Hood – Build Thread\n\nMy flow hood\n\nGrowing and Multiplying in vitro Plants\n\nOnce you’ve successfully established an explant or seed in vitro, the fun begins! Plants should be grown under moderate lighting on a fairly long photo period. I like using two 32 watt T8 bulbs with a 6500 kelvin color temperature on a 16 hour photo period placed about a foot away from the cultures. I try to keep the temperature stable around 78°F (25°C) and, at a minimum, always between 72°F (22°C) and 82°F (28°C). Most species of carnivorous plants will grow quickly with this set up on the proper media.\n\nWhen the plants start slowing in growth or the jar gets full of tissue, you’ll need to “replate” or “subculture” (propagate) that tissue. Prepare your desired media and, in your sterile work area, remove the tissue from the jar it’s growing in. If you simply need to replate (transfer the tissue to a new jar with fresh media without dividing), then just pull it out of the old jar and place it in the new media jar. If you need to divide and “subculture” the tissue, then you’ll have to have a sterile work area to set it on so it can be divided or cut into pieces.\n\nI typically put a dinner plate into the pressure cooker along with some paper towels wrapped in aluminum foil. I use the plate and paper towels as my sterile work bench for dividing tissue. For Dionaea muscipula, or the Venus Fly Trap, it’s usually fairly easy to simply pull apart the tissue into manageable pieces and then put those into new cultures. Sometimes it’s necessary to use a scalpel (surgeon’s knife) to cut the tissue into pieces and then plate it onto new media.\n\nVenus fly traps will form callus (lumpy tissue growth from which many plants grow) and multiply fine on 50% MS with no hormones at all, but many other species of carnivorous plants need plant growth regulators (PGRs) to grow faster and/or divide. The amount and type of PGR you use is dependent on the desired result. You’ll have to experiment to figure out what concentration and which PGR gives you the growth you’re looking for. A fairly well known multiplication media for Drosera and Venus fly traps is 50% Murashige and Skoog (MS) media with full MS vitamins, 30g/L sugar, pH of 5.6 and 0.5mg/L of Kinetin.\n\nPre transplant\n\nThis stage involves treating the plantlets/shoots produced to encourage root growth and “hardening.” It is performed in vitro, or in a sterile “test tube” environment.\n\nRoot growth does not always occur in the earlier stages in plant cell culture, and is of course a requirement for successful plant growth after the micropropagation procedure. It is often performed in vitro by transferring the plantlets to a growth medium containing auxin(s) which stimulate root initiation. The pretransplant stage is not always performed; Some plants are micropropagated and grown in culture and normal cuttings are made that are then rooted ex vitro.\n\n“Hardening” refers to the preparation of the plants for a natural growth environment. Until this stage, the plantlets have been grown in “ideal” conditions, designed to encourage rapid growth. Due to lack of necessity, the plants are likely to be highly susceptible to disease and often do not have fully functional dermal coverings and will be inefficient in their use of water and energy. In vitro conditions are high in humidity and plants grown under these condition do not form a working cuticle and stomata that keep the plant from drying out, so when taken out of culture the plantlets need time to adjust to more natural environmental conditions. Hardening typically involves slowly weaning the plantlets from a consistent high-humidity, low light, warm environment to an environment with variable humidity, light and temperature, and more like the natural environment of the plant. This process often requires that the humidity be maintained at a high level initially with regular mist watering or conditions in which there is little moving air and the humidity can be somewhat contained or localized (by placing a ventilated plastic covering over the plants for some days or weeks, for example).\n\nEx Vitro\n\nThe key to successfully transferring your in-vitro plantlets into soil is to be very fastidious about washing off all the TC media from the roots.\n\nPlace the plantlet under running, tepid water, and use the force of the water to thoroughly dissolve off all the old media. If this is not done, then molds will frequently feed on the remaining gel media, take hold and overpower your plants.\n\nAfter planting out, treat the plants the same as they were treated while still in-vitro. A humidity tent made with a plastic bag will help the plants acclimatize. Let them stay sealed for a week or so. You can then gradually open up the bag over the course of another week to get the plants used to lower humidity. However, be sure to keep them out of direct sunlight during this time or their comfortable ex-vitro nursery may become a solar oven that bakes and kills them.Once they are “hardened off” properly, you can treat them as any other soil-grown plant.\n\nOther Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are the colors I see in some people’s culture media?\n\nThese are simply food colouring added in to be able to distinguish different media types, or hormones added to the media. One exception to this is the addition of activated charcoal which will make the media a dark grey-black colour.\n\nWhat are Plant Hormones?\n\nPlant hormones, also know and plant growth regulator or PGRs, are signal molecules produced within the plant at extremely low concentrations. Plant hormones regulate cellular processes and growth of the plant in various ways. In tissue culture, plant hormones are added to the media to promote a certain type of growth (division, root formation, etc.) depending on what is desired by the propagator at the time.\n\nHow do I sterilize seeds?\n\nMost species of carnivorous plant seeds are relatively easily sterilized. For first time tissue culturers, I would definitely recommend starting with seeds as explants can be very difficult to properly sterilize. One can hone their tissue culture skills with seeds and then move onto explants when they have a good sterile technique.\n\nI’ve used the same procedure for Dionaea, Drosera, Darlingtonia, Cephalotus and Sarracenia seeds and it works really well.\n\nQuick dip in 91% ethanol alcohol. 2 to 3 minutes in 3% Hydrogen Peroxide. Soak in 10% bleach. 6 minutes for Drosera and Cephalotus, 10 minutes for Dionaea seed, 12 minutes for Sarracenia. 3 minute rinse in sterile water Transfer to media – I use forceps to pick up each individual seed. A wire ring works well too.\n\nI have also successfully sterilized Dionaea seed by simply doing a 10 minute soak in 10% bleach followed by a 3 minute rinse in sterile water and the transferring to media.\n\nHow do I sterilize water?\n\nThe same way that you sterilize the media, in a pressure cooker or a microwave.\n\nHow do I make 10% Bleach?\n\nFor making small amounts, mix 10 ml of bleach to 90 ml distilled/RO water. I usually sterilize the water in the pressure cooker first.\n\nHow do I make 3% Hydrogen Peroxide?\n\n3% Hydrogen Peroxide is readily available in pharmacies and drug stores.\n\nDo I have to use PPM?\n\nYou can either use PPM or make a media without it. There is less chance of contamination when using PPM.\n\nWhat is a callus?\n\nA callus of cells is a mass of undifferentiated plant cells. It often starts as a lumpy growth on existing tissue and can develop into odd-looking, perhaps “hairy” masses as many tiny plantlets begin to emerge from the callus.\n\nWhat is activated charcoal?\n\nCharcoal which has been treated to remove hydrocarbons and to increase its adsorptive properties. It acts by condensing and holding a gas or solute onto its surface; thus inhibitory substances in nutrient medium may be adsorbed to charcoal included in the medium. Rooting factors such as phenolamines present as contaminants in charcoal may stimulate growth in vitro. Its addition to rooting medium may stimulate root initiation in some plant species. Activated charcoal may differ in origin and in composition. cf charcoal; phenolic exudation.\n\nHow long does it take to see callus formation on an explant?\n\nIt all depends on the species of plants and which part you use for the explant. It can show up in a matter of days, but it could take months.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nFlytrapCare Tissue Culture Forum\n\nhttp://www.omnisterra.com/botany/cp/slides/tc/tc.htm",

  "latent_4931": "Booming Solar Energy Halted by Hawaii Utility Because Sun Produces Too Much Power!\n\nLet’s try to summarize this astounding Scientific American article that symbolizes the tentacles of the fossil fuel industry and utility companies in perpetuating destructive climate change.\n\nActually, the header and sub-headline of the piece sum it up nicely: “A Solar Boom so Successful, It’s Been Halted: Photovoltaics proved so successful in Hawaii that the local utility, [the Hawaiin Electric Company] (HECO), has instituted policies to block further expansion.”\n\nHawaiin residents are investing their own money to save longterm costs and the environment. The result is that they are producing a surplus of solar energy beyond what they can use in their homes. This extra energy is supposed to be diverted back into the power grid to save money on HECO’s reliance on oil and to reduce global warming.\n\nNow the US does have an aged electrical grid and HECO makes the claim that the surge in solar energy production by homeowners is creating safety problems:\n\nHawaiian Electric Co., or HECO, in September told solar contractors on Oahu that the island’s solar boom is creating problems. On many circuits, the utility said, there’s so much solar energy that it poses a threat to the system and a safety issue. Studies are needed on whether grid upgrades are necessary. If they are, residents adding solar must foot the bill. And starting immediately, contractors and residents would need permission to connect most small rooftop systems to the grid.\n\nThe result is that an alternative renewable energy source that could help save the planet and reduce energy costs dramatically (in the long run, particularly as solar technology becomes less expensive) is dead in its tracks in Hawaii:\n\nThe policy change halted what has been a solar surge in Hawaii. Installations there jumped 169 percent last year from 2011. More than 4 percent of households have photovoltaics. Hawaii last year led the nation in the portion of its electricity that comes from solar, with 2.6 percent.\n\nNow, a nation that cannot invest in fixing its electrical grid — if you believe the utility company excuse for basically shutting down solar expansion in Hawaii — is a nation that is not the greatest on earth, but one doomed to failure while its energy policy is dictated by the profiteering, environmentally toxic fossil fuel industry and utility companies.\n\nAmidst the approval of a tar sands pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia in Canada — and the already flowing earth-killing oil into the US (accelerating with the opening of the southern leg of the Keystone XL Pipeline next month) — the use of renewable non-polluting energy courtesy of the sun should be one of the nation’s highest priority.\n\nBut, as usual, the “economic royalists” (as Thom Hartmann calls them) can’t make enough money off an energy source that is free after an initial investment:\n\nCharles Wang, with the Hawaii ECO Project, at a solar conference in San Diego earlier this month warned people from other states that Hawaii is a “cautionary tale” and “something that you will face down the road in your marketplaces.”\n\n“I am from the future,” Wang told a room of industry and environmental representatives. “The utility is that 800-pound gorilla. If you push it to the corner of the room, it’s going to fight back. That’s what’s happening right now.”\n\nSome residential users are even buying expensive battery storage units to save up surplus solar energy and sidestep the issue of “grid certification,” meaning, in essence, renewable energy is being kept from replacing fossil fuel produced electricity as a public power source.\n\nWhen you watch those programs that try to piece together how ancient civilizations disappeared through archeological digs, the fossil fuel/utility greed and assault on the environment in Hawaii — symbolized by aging grids — will be a telling sign of what became of an empire that choked on its wallet and blocked out the sun.",
  "latent_4940": "Give Me My Remote Forever FOREVER Finale Post-Mortem: Ioan Gruffudd on the Finale’s ‘Jaw-Dropping’ Shocks\n\nFOREVER Finale Post-Mortem: Ioan Gruffudd on the Finale’s ‘Jaw-Dropping’ Shocks\n\n[This post contains spoilers for FOREVER’s first season finale. Please don’t read this piece until you’ve seen “The Last Death of Henry Morgan.”]\n\nFOREVER’s Henry spent all of the season trying to hide his immortality from Jo — much to the chagrin of Abe — but the jig may be up: after Adam shot Henry (in an attempt to either kill him or out his secret), Henry survived and popped back up in the water. Unfortunately for him, when he died, he left behind his watch, and an old photo of himself, Abe, and Abigail…which Jo found, and confronted him about.\n\nThough the season ended with Henry, reluctantly, telling Jo, “It’s a long story,” fans don’t know exactly what he’ll tell her. And for FOREVER star Ioan Gruffudd, getting to that final scene was a shocking experience for him, too.\n\n“My initial instinct was jaw-dropping, mouth agape,” he laughed. “Which was the right instinct to have. You want the audience to have that feeling of, ‘How on Earth is Henry going to explain himself?’ That was my first instinct. My second instinct was, ‘Oh, no! Does he have to reveal the secret to her? How are we going to do a second season if she knows his secret?’ And then the third was, ‘Of course we’re going to find a very clever way of getting him out of this, and I can’t wait to see it.'”\n\n“The end of the show is what should happen,” he continued. “That we, the audience, are left salivating for more.”\n\nIf Gruffudd has his way, he does hope Henry finds a way to keep his secret on the down low.\n\n“Here’s my point: where is the tension of the show if Jo knows his secret?” he questioned. “If Jo knows his secret, we just go on these great adventures and solve crimes every week, and she rolls her eyes, and Henry’s an immortal. The important thing is this secret doesn’t come out. What we’ve said in the past is that someone who has a special power that is exposed, they become the fodder of media attention, the scrutiny of scientists, and they become a guinea pig or a lab rat. Henry has been hanged, he’s been burned at the stake, he’s been thrown in prison, he’s been thrown into an asylum. So it’s very important that this secret doesn’t come out.”\n\nComplicating matters is the fact that Jo and Henry have been inching together, romantically.\n\n“I think it would be interesting, if they were to get together, that she doesn’t know his secret,” Gruffudd said. “How fun would that be to be together in a relationship, but hold this lie? That would be a whole other different relationship. Would that make Henry an empathetic character, would we start to dislike Henry because he’s lying to her the whole time? Or would we delight in the fact that he’s keeping it from her when they’re together? If the lie were to be exposed when they were together, what a horrible, horrible state of affairs that would be.”\n\nAs for Henry’s other big event in the finale, Gruffudd admitted he was a little bit bummed that Henry was able to get one over on his nemesis, Adam, and made him “locked in” via a coma.\n\n“It’s sort of disappointing in a way, because one of his greatest adversaries is taken care of, to a point,” he conceded. “He’s managed to subdue him for the time being. It opens up the question of are there other people like him? Now that he knows Adam exists, are there more out there of immortals? I think that would be an interesting exploration for next season.”\n\n–\n\nWhat did you think of FOREVER’s finale?\n\nRelated:\n\nFOREVER: Ioan Gruffudd Previews Henry’s Attempt to Protect Jo in the ‘Emotional’ Finale\n\nFOREVER Season 1 Finale Photos: ‘The Last Death of Henry Morgan’\n\nFOREVER: ‘The Night in Question’ Teases\n\nFOREVER: John Noble to Guest Star\n\nFollow @GiveMeMyRemote and @marisaroffman on Twitter for the latest TV news.

  "latent_5161": "Sarah Palin’s meandering, fiery, sarcastic, patriotic and blustery speech endorsing Donald J. Trump for president on Tuesday in Ames, Iowa, does not easily submit to categorization.\n\nIt has been described as performance art, a filibuster, even slam poetry.

  "latent_5164": "Police in Mesquite, Texas have dropped a charge against an unarmed man who was arrested and shot by police after officers believed he was burglarizing his own car.\n\nLyndo Jones, 31, was sitting inside his truck in a parking lot on the evening of November 8, struggling with a malfunctioning car alarm, when police arrived and instructed him to exit the vehicle. Officials said they were responding to reports of a possible car burglary after someone nearby reported hearing the alarm.\n\nAfter “ma[king] contact” with Jones, Jones exited his vehicle voluntarily. Officers said a scuffle ensued.\n\n“An altercation, a scuffle began and the individual ended up being shot,” Mesquite Police Department spokesman Lt. Brian Parrish told reporters afterward. Parrish claimed it had taken three officers to “subdue” Jones and that he had allegedly tried to “run.”\n\n“He was actively trying to stand up and get out of the area,” Parrish said, noting that the officers had held Jones down until paramedics arrived. Justifying the actions of the officer who shot Jones — 10-year police veteran Derick Wiley — he added, “The situation was that Mr. Jones didn’t give the officer ample opportunity to start an investigation.”\n\nPolice charged him with evading arrest. The charge was later dropped on Tuesday, six days after Jones was shot by police. Parrish told ThinkProgress that the decision to dismiss the charge was made to “hopefully assist in his medical recovery” and that the charge “may be revisited at a later time.”\n\n“It’s not getting pushed aside,” he said. “Right now, it’s more important for [Jones] to heal.”\n\nJones’ attorneys have disputed the official police account.\n\n“Within 10 seconds of their arrival, he had been shot it the stomach. While on the street suffering from his wound, officers attempted to perform a cavity search and he reacted to that, and he was shot a second time in this back,” Jones’ lawyer, Lee Merritt, told Dallas–Fort Worth ABC affiliate WFAA8. Merritt claimed that police had also conveniently left out the fact that the truck Jones had been sitting in was his own in their initial public reports.\n\n“That was not a mistake. That was an intentional misrepresentation to the public,” he added. “…That truck was his. How can you burglarize your own car?”\n\nAccording to reports, Jones was treated for his wounds at Baylor Medical Center in Dallas and was handcuffed to the bed. (Baylor health spokespersons told ThinkProgress that there was no one at that facility by that name and declined to comment, although it’s common for hospitals to withhold any information on a patient — including their presence — if the patient requests anonymity.) Jones’ other lawyer, Justin Moore, said he was also forcibly removed by hospital security after arriving and demanding to sit in on an interview police were conducting with Jones, without attorneys present, a violation of his constitutional right to counsel.\n\nPolice say they did nothing wrong in speaking to Jones without his lawyers. “He’s a potential complainant in a shooting,” Parrish told ThinkProgress, adding that officers had not spoken to Jones about the charge against him. “There’s no requirement his lawyers be present for that.”\n\nDuring his hospital stay, Jones was also reportedly barred from seeing his family, as police stated he was a security risk.\n\n“We have a child together, and he hasn’t seen her in a whole week and he loves his daughter,” Tierra Burns, the mother of one of Jones’ children, told WFAA8. “He always loved his daughter. …He didn’t deserve what happened to him at all.”\n\nFor his part, despite his anger, Jones believes he’s simply lucky to be alive.\n\n“It’s not right,” he said, speaking with the media on Tuesday night. “That wasn’t right for me to be handcuffed to a bed, then moved from a room, then asked a thousand questions [without] my lawyer. …I don’t why somebody would do that. Why? I didn’t do nothing to you or did anything.”\n\nHe added, “I’m feeling thankful. I get to go home and see my kids. I have not seen them for a long period of time. I’m thankful. I’m alive. I’m thankful to everyone who reached out or said kind words — and the nurses in there, the doctors and nurses, they did good.”\n\nJones said he will not be able to return to work, where he does manual labor, or lift up his children “for a period of time” as a result of his injuries.\n\nThe Mesquite Police Department and the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office have stated than an investigation into the shooting is ongoing. Investigators plan to interview Wiley, who has been placed on administrative leave.",

Waite and Nahas looked dangerous every time they went near the footy, and grabbed a pair of goals apiece for the term, as the lead jumped out to a game-high 43 points.\n\nLate goals to Stewart and the recalled Rhys Palmer kept GWS in touch however, and if not for some terrible finishing, the Giants could have been closer than the five-goal half-time margin.\n\nThe long break seemed to help the Kangaroos, who kicked three of the first four goals of the third term and looked to be well on top, but the plucky Giants refused to go away.\n\nThey kicked three in a row to finish the quarter and a third for Palmer seconds before the siren cut the Roos' lead to just 23 points with a quarter to play.\n\nJust as they had done for the previous three, North Melbourne started the quarter with more intensity, and snuffed out any chance of a Giants comeback with goals to Nahas and the classy Shaun Higgins.\n\nGWS barely managed to get the footy in its half of the ground as the more experienced North kept control of the game, the Roos now 6-6 for the season.\n\nDebutant Jack Steele battles for the ball on Saturday.

  "latent_5250": "By producing compelling online content and interfacing directly with its customers, Netflix is holding a powerful card—and I’m not talking about its Emmy-award-winning show. Rather than playing this card, Netflix is asking the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to intervene in its dealings with Internet service providers (ISPs). Before delving into Netflix’s potential counter-strategy and the need (if any) for regulatory intervention, a bit of background is in order.\n\nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler announced last week that the agency is launching a new investigation of “interconnection” agreements, which as the name suggests, govern connections between Internet networks. Interconnection has taken center stage since Netflix struck deals with Comcast and Verizon in February; prior to those direct connections with ISPs, Netflix paid “transit” providers such as Cogent and Level 3 to obtain access to the ISPs’ networks. Presently, interconnection arrangements are governed by private contracts.\n\nInterconnection issues are not implicated in the FCC’s pending Open Internet proceeding, which addresses the treatment of traffic within an ISP’s network, as opposed to on its doorstep. Yet some companies are trying to conflate the issues and leverage the religious fervor and grassroots political machines of the net neutrality movement. Adding to the drama is Netflix’s suggestion that it was forced to accept terms for direct connections at gunpoint; according to some accounts, the counter-parties were purposefully degrading the quality of the connection with Netflix until Netflix coughed up some cash.\n\nIs there a constructive role for the regulator? The Progressive Policy Institute (a D.C. think tank with which I am affiliated) held a conference on interconnection last month, and invited Wharton Professor Kevin Werbach to make the case for FCC regulation of interconnection. At the conference and in his writings, Werbach cited some classic interconnection showdowns, including Comcast-Level 3 and Verizon-Cogent, as the basis for intervention: A benevolent referee could resolve these disputes quickly, Werbach argues, and get traffic flowing to Internet customers.\n\nTo evaluate the potential benefits of intervention, I looked into these disputes and was surprised by what I found: Based on historical frequencies, the likelihood of a dispute between networks is rare, and the likelihood of a dispute leading to a service outage for consumers is even rarer. By my count, there have been just six major interconnection disputes since 2002 (five of which involved Cogent)—about one every other year—and the average number of days without service across these disputes was close to zero. In other words, even when these disputes occur, traffic generally continues to flow pursuant to a standstill agreement while the dispute is worked out. Unless something has radically tipped the balance of power in the Internet ecosystem, history suggests that the benefits of the FCC’s intervening in these affairs—in terms of forgone service outages—are likely small.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, inserting the FCC into these negotiations could impose significant costs on society. For example, mandatory interconnection at regulated rates could undermine the incentive of ISPs to expand or enhance broadband networks. Some have blamed mandatory roaming for certain wireless operators’ decision not to build out in high-cost areas (but rather rely on roaming). Moreover, the FCC’s assistance could discourage access-seeking networks, including transit providers and some large content providers such as Google, from expanding their networks into last-mile services. According to this cost-benefit analysis, the FCC should stay out of these affairs.\n\nTwo other considerations should give the Chairman pause about intervening on interconnection. First, for customers who are hooked on Netflix exclusive content, such as House of Cards or Orange Is the New Black, Netflix is the “must-have” network. I could access the Internet at super-fast speeds through my cable operator or my telephone provider (and soon through my mobile device), but there is no good substitute for what Netflix is producing. So if push came to shove, and my ISP started fooling with my Netflix connection, I would consider switching ISPs to see whether Frank Underwood maintains his presidency or Piper Chapman gets out of jail. Although this choice in super-fast connections is not available to all customers—by the FCC’s latest count, nearly three-quarters of U.S. households are served by two or more wireline ISPs with download speeds of at least 6 Mbps—the choice is available to enough households to make the ISPs think twice about degrading Netflix.\n\nSecond, Netflix has a potent counter-strategy that, if deployed, could be significantly more powerful in its dealing with ISPs than regulation: By charging its subscribers different prices based on their ISP, Netflix can gently steer its customers to “low-priced” ISPs—that is, ISPs that charge low or no interconnection fees. For example, Google Fiber, an ISP with a limited national footprint, recently announced that it would abstain from charging Netflix (or any content provider) an interconnection fee.\n\nLike a credit card, Google Fiber is best understood as a “platform provider” that connects end users with content providers. When certain credit cards sought to impose relatively higher fees on merchants, merchants countered by imposing surcharges (or discounts) on the merchandise to steer customers to the lower-priced cards. Some large banks responded by imposing a “no-surcharge rule” on merchants, forcing merchants to charge the same price for goods regardless of which card was used. Following the abolition of no-surcharge rules in Australia (a similar movement is afoot in the United States), the number of merchants surcharging payment card transactions has increased steadily over time, leading to a significant reduction in merchant transaction fees.\n\nApplying that lesson here, Netflix could charge Google’s customers a discount (say $6.99 per month as opposed to its standard $7.99 charge) for Netflix service. Alternatively, Netflix could charge customers of a high-priced ISP a surcharge (say $9.99 per month). By revealing to its subscribers the identity of the low-priced ISP, this counter-strategy could temper the interconnection charge of the high-priced ISP. Unlike cable networks, which rely on the cable operator to interface with the video customer, Netflix and other online providers are customer-facing and thus wield significantly greater bargaining power in their dealings with the platform provider—as long as they are willing to use it.\n\nI asked a Netflix spokesperson at a recent Aspen Institute event whether Netflix has contemplated this counter-strategy. His answer, which begins at about 1:50:32 on the video, was (1) he has at least considered it, but (2) the interconnection fee charged by ISPs to date was “so small” in relation to Netflix’s content costs that a surcharge would not make sense. Admittedly, my question was tough, but this answer does not engender much sympathy for Netflix's plight.\n\nBefore seeking further regulatory intervention, Netflix should avail itself of all potential counter-strategies in its dealings with ISPs. To do anything less is to ask the FCC to carry your water. As Frank Underwood put it, “There is but one rule: Hunt or be hunted.” Netflix is holding a powerful trump card that potentially obviates the need for regulation, but it seems disinclined to use it. Until Netflix has gone on the hunt and failed, the Chairman should shelve interconnection rules and focus his attention on the Open Internet rules now pending before him.\n\nTwitter: @halsinger",

Quite literally in Clarkson’s case – he had to kill an entire farm to make his car!\n\nEven if some people have claimed that the show got off to a bumpy start (especially after its second episode), the latest instalment just proves how brilliant these three can be and what they achieve thanks to their chemistry: good fun, banter and car disasters.\n\nThe main theme of this episode centres on the men creating new cars by replacing most of their parts with sustainable materials, to then test them and see if they worked (spoiler alert: not really).\n\nHammond created his out of plants, making it look like a nice garden; Clarkson’s contained the remains of several dead animals in every possible form, making it look like something Immortan Joe from Mad Max would drive; and May’s…well, we’ll get back to him, but his very first attempt was a mud car that fell apart two seconds after he started driving it.\n\nMay is a lovable chap though, and he gets points for trying – even if the other two spent the entire episode cracking up with everything he did.\n\nWe got to have it all with this episode, and “Enviro-mental” was quite a fitting title: the whole sustainable thing was a complete disaster, but viewers will probably cry with laughter at the trio’s insane ideas and their fights, that only show they are having the time of their lives.\n\nIt makes you want to watch the next episode straight away!\n\nInside-and-outside-the-tent moments:",

The daily adds —\n\nTen months after it was set up, the disappearance of this bohemian enclave from an area of skyscrapers that house the world’s largest banks will herald the end of the Occupy phenomenon in Europe.\n\nThe expulsion of Frankfurt’s indignados has come in the wake of the break-up of similar protest camps in London (February 2012), Paris (December 2011) and Madrid (June), points out the French daily. Although “here and there […], there are some remaining tents,” the movement that began last year, and which deplores “the power of capitalism, money and banks […] has failed to have an impact,” in Europe, argues La Croix, which notably blames the loss of momentum on “the lack of an overall coordinating strategy.”\n\nThe daily notes that the decline of the movement has come at a time when “the conditions that gave birth to the Occupy protests still prevail.” The German political scientist, Tadzio Müller, believes: “Other movements will emerge,” but adds that the question of “where to construct social power” remains unanswered.",
  "latent_5957": "Is Cory Hall a candidate for OSU coach?\n\nBY KERRY EGGERS/PORTLAND TRIBUNE/Interim says he'll stay loyal no matter what happens in search\n\nLast Monday, as Scott Barnes addressed the media in the wake of Gary Andersen's resignation as head football coach at Oregon State, he didn't mention interim coach Cory Hall as a candidate for Andersen's replacement.\n\nSo I sought out Barnes afterward and asked the athletic director what chance Hall would have of being back on the coaching staff next season.\n\n\"I will tell you unequivocably, I will be an incredible advocate for Cory Hall,\" Barnes said. \"And that will mean a lot.\"\n\nI took that to mean that, to whoever Barnes hired after a \"national search,\" he would strongly suggest that the head coach retain Hall on his staff.\n\nSo after last Saturday's 36-33 loss to Colorado, I asked Barnes if he'd changed his mind about Hall — if, in fact, he now considered Hall a viable candidate for the head coaching job.\n\n\"My original comment on that was, we'll leave this wide open,\" Barnes said Monday. \"That's where we sit now.\n\n\"I can't say enough about the job Cory has done as it relates to what I'd hoped — galvanize and inspire. He has the trust and the respect of those young men. That was apparent Saturday.\n\n\"My stance hasn't changed. This is a wide-open search, and I'll leave it at that.\"\n\nI could be wrong, but it sure seemed that the implication from Barnes was that, while he was appreciative Hall was taking over the program in mid-stream, he would be looking elsewhere for a permanent coach.\n\nAnd who could blame him? Hall, 40, is in his second season coaching cornerbacks at Oregon State. He has never been even a coordinator at the college level. Three years ago, Hall was an intern for Andersen at Wisconsin. Less than a decade ago, he was defensive coordinator at a middle school in Los Angeles.\n\nExperience is critical at the major-college level, so I get where Hall wouldn't meet the criteria Barnes is looking for.\n\nI'm not suggesting Hall should get the permanent head job. He did a masterful job rallying the troops and putting together a plan that nearly pulled off an upset of the Buffaloes.\n\nIt's entirely possible, however, that the jolt of energy created a perfect storm and lifted the Beavers to the synergy that was evident last Saturday at Reser Stadium. That could wear off, and the Beavers could revert to the team that couldn't put together a competitive complete game against their previous five FBS opponents. Even if we continue to see the new, improved Beavers, envisioning a 1-11 season is not farfetched.\n\nIt's important, though, that Hall be considered a viable candidate for at least one reason.\n\nThe letter-of-intent signing date has been moved up significantly — from the first week in February to Dec. 20. Hall and his staff will be out recruiting during the bye week. They'll be selling Oregon State football with or without them. It's a very uncomfortable, if unavoidable, position.\n\nThe Beavers have nine verbal commits for a recruiting class that will max out at about 18 signees. They'd like to hang on to the commits. Hall has reached out to all of them in the past week, offering as much reassurance as he can.\n\n\"I've received a lot of support from the current commits,\" he said.\n\nBarnes says he has also talked via phone with several of the commits.\n\n\"We've received very good responses from them,\" he said.\n\nThe Beavers haven't lost any of the commits yet, but that's probably unavoidable, too. Recruits decide on a school as much for the coaching staff as for anything else.\n\nHall, more than the other coaches, is important in this. If he returns — as head coach, defensive coordinator or just as cornerbacks coach — there's a connection with which the recruits can identify. Hall was considered the best recruiter on Andersen's staff. He is charismatic and an excellent representative for the university.\n\nThere's no question Hall wants to be considered for the head coaching job next season. He has enjoyed his time at Oregon State. Cory and wife, Sarah, have two children together and a third, a boy, on the way. They consider Corvallis an excellent place to raise their kids.\n\nBut Hall is savvy enough to play the good soldier.\n\n\"Would I like to lead Beaver Nation for the next 10 to 15 years?\" he asked rhetorically. \"Absolutely. I think everybody knows that, or I wouldn't have stepped into this role.\n\n\"But do I think Scott will make the best decision for Oregon state football? Yes, I do. If those plans do not include Cory Hall, I have 100 percent faith and confidence in the decision Scott and Mr. (Ed) Ray (the school president) will make.\"\n\nBarnes is already at work in the hiring process. He has a search firm lined up, which will identify candidates. He understands the importance of making a hire well in advance of the Dec. 20 signing date.\n\n\"We have a jump on things,\" Barnes said. \"We're happy to be able to start the process in some form. Depending on the candidates and where we stand at the end of the season, we'll want to strike very quickly — literally, as the season ends.\"\n\nWe'll see what happens with the Beavers the rest of the season. For now, Barnes would be wise to assure recruits that Hall will be back in some form — even as an assistant — next season, and remains a candidate for the head job. Hall's body of work has shown he deserves that.\n\n\"I don't know what will happen,\" Barnes said. \"Our search is wide open. But Cory is doing exactly what I'd hoped he'd do as a leader.\"\n\nWhatever happens, Hall said he will remain a loyalist.\n\n\"I'm a loyal type of guy,\" he said. \"And I'm going to be loyal to Oregon State.\"\n\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

  "latent_6078": "When the first Harry Potter movie came out in 2001 the idea of the Daily Prophet, a newspaper that contains moving pictures, qualified as magic. A Kickstarter campaign by Ynvisible, a Lisbon-based technology firm, is bringing that magic to life with its displays, held together with paper-thin circuitry.\n\nScore. Ynvisible\n\nYnvisible’s offering, called Printoo, is a bunch of paper-thin circuit boards. Imagine the Arduino board, perhaps the most popular do-it-yourself micro-controller used by tinkerers, but thinner and lighter. The Printoo modules are flexible, meaning they can be bent, folded and attached to any object—cans, clothes, toys—and come with both LEDs as well as flat, flexible “electrochromatic” displays for output. The idea obviously caught the imagination of the DIY community. The Printoo Kickstarter achieved its goal of $20,000 within four days of going live. It has exceed $31,000 at the time of this writing, with another 24 days before it closes.\n\nPrintable, or flexible, electronics have been around for years, but have never taken off in mainstream consumer goods, with the notable exception of the Duracell battery power tester. Several companies, including the Scandinavian Thinfilm and American Soligie, make products for a narrow range of customers—security professionals, medical researchers, logistics. Ynvisible itself has been in printable electronics since 2006, and has served a small range of corporate customers, such as L’oreal. The industry is tiny. Xerox PARC estimates the global market for printable electronics is just $1 billion.\n\nIt bends, but doesn’t break. Ynvisible\n\n“I wouldn’t say there is yet a clear success case in the industry,” says Ynvisible product manager Manuel Camara. The idea behind the Kickstarter campaign, therefore, was to bring the technology to early adopters so they could figure out wider applications for it. And the company intentionally set a low goal—Ynvisible assumed research and investment as internal costs—to encourage its success.\n\nTo make Printoo familiar, Camara and his team adapted it to work with Arduino, which hobbyists have used to make everything from Twitter-enabled coffee pots to shoelaces that tie themselves. That meant compromising on flatness—Arduino connectors are pretty chunky relative to thin film, but gives it much greater versatility and ease of use. Camara says Ynvisible’s “vision” is to “bring everyday objects to life.” For that to happen, it isn’t just processing power that needs to get cheaper and smaller, which it has, but the input and output mechanisms also need to be smaller and easily adaptable. Ynvisible is betting there is a broad market for such technology. The roaring success of its Kickstarter campaign is an early validation of that belief.",
  "latent_6112": "Ohio Sec. of State: Electronic voting machines don't meet basic standards David Edwards and Muriel Kane\n\nPublished: Tuesday December 18, 2007\n\ndel.icio.us |\n\nPrint This Email This If you thought controversy over voting machines was a thing of the past, think again. Just in time for the 2008 election season, Colorado has decertified hundreds of faulty electronic voting machines for being error-prone and easily hacked. This news comes on the heels a massive study in Ohio that also found critical flaws in Buckeye State's voting machines. Yesterday, Colorado Secretary of State Mike Coffman decertified three of the four voting equipment manufacturers allowed in the state -- affecting six of Colorado's 10 most populous counties -- for their inaccuracy and for the ease with which they could be hacked. Today, he backtracked slightly, noting that some of machines could still be used in November if a software patch was installed. Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner spoke to MSNBC about Ohio's study, where teams were able to pick locks to access memory cards and use hand-held devices to plug false vote counts into machines. They also concluded that hacker could break into the machines with \"a magnet and a PDA.\" \"We learned that there are critical security flaws,\" she says, \"because these machines are essentially computer-based voting equipment, and they don't have the basic industry-required standards for security that we would use on computers that we use for banking or communications or other things in our everyday life.\" Brunner has recommended that for the March primary, counties with touch-screen machines allow voters to request a paper ballot that can be scanned optically. She also reminded voters that they can vote through the mail using absentee ballots. In the long run, Ohio may move to optical-scan ballots that would be checked by machine but also deposited in a ballot box and counted at the Board of Elections. Brunner also proposed an early voting period 15 days before elections at vote centers located throughout the state.\n\nThis video is from MSNBC's News Live, broadcast on December 18, 2007.",

The power hungry egomaniac has shared his love for Stalinist methods that shaped his political style.\n\nThe Wrecking Crew:\n\nWhat concerned Norquist were the tactics of seizing and holding power, which he adapted straight from the playbook of Joseph Stalin. Or, as he put it: First, we want to remove liberal personnel from the political process. Then we want to capture those positions of power and influence for conservatives. Stalin taught the importance of this principle. He was running the personnel department, while Trotsky was fighting the White Army. When push came to shove for control of the Soviet Union, Stalin won. His people were in place and Trotsky’s were not. . . . With this principle in mind, conservatives must do all they can to make sure that they get jobs in Washington. Frank, Thomas (2010-04-01). The Wrecking Crew: How Conservatives Rule (p. 128).\n\nNorquist holds in admiration a man who murdered millions of people to stay in power. That's wonderful, isn't it? He also started the hellish K Street Project which turned DC into a partisan bloodbath with his pal Tom DeLay after the corrupt Bugman became Majority Leader.\n\nOne way was to start ensuring that the new GOP agenda of radical deregulation, tax and spending cuts, and generally reducing government earned the financial support they thought it deserved. In 1995, DeLay famously compiled a list of the 400 largest PACs, along with the amounts and percentages of money they had recently given to each party. Lobbyists were invited into DeLay's office and shown their place in \"friendly\" or \"unfriendly\" columns. (\"If you want to play in our revolution,\" DeLay told The Washington Post, \"you have to live by our rules.\") Another was to oust Democrats from trade associations, what DeLay and Norquist dubbed \"the K Street Strategy.\"...read on\n\nSince the tea party won seats in the House in 2010, Grover has gotten all the credit for the conservative resurgence in Congress by the Beltway Villagers and now, CBS joining the crowd. What was very revealing about this interview is the rank hypocrisy in the world in which Norquist inhabits. He terrifies Republican politicians into signing his tax pledge and then promises a swift death for their political career if they renounce it or vote for any type of measure that includes revenue increases of any measure by the federal government even if they have nothing to do with taxes. Steve Croft said his reign of terror had the GOP by the short hairs because he can crush them coming and going. Boy, did Grover love that one, but when he was asked to make his donor list public for transparency, he turned into a typical Republican hypocrite.\n\n60 Minutes: (This interview originally broadcast Nov. 20, 2011, but I just watched it.)\n\nSimpson also wants to know where Norquist and Americans for Tax Reform, with its multimillion dollar budget gets its money. Simpson: When you get this powerful, and he is, then it's, 'Where do you get your scratch, Grover?' Is it two people? Is it 10 million people? The American people demand to know where you get your money, Grover babe. But under federal law, Grover babe, as Simpson calls him, and Americans for Tax Reform, a nonprofit organization, aren't required to disclose the identity of its contributors. So the finances of a group that demands transparency in government are opaque. Isn't that convenient? Norquist says the money comes from direct mail and other grassroots fundraising efforts. But a significant portion appears to come from wealthy individuals, foundations and corporate interests. Kroft: In the interest of transparency, would you disclose your major donors? Norquist: I-- I would not-- I don't know. Haven't thought of it. It doesn't really matter because what we do is what we do. I guess I would argue, thinking back on it, we've had times when people who are contributors to us were literally threatened by senators and congressmen. Kroft: So you're protecting the corporate interests from harassment and threats? Norquist: Well, protecting me and anyone who wants to participate in American politics. You don't want people threatened because they wanna fight against higher taxes. Over the years, some of his group's lobbying activities have stretched into areas that are not generally associated with preventing tax hikes. He has lobbied the State Department on behalf of the controversial Keystone pipeline and has dipped into areas like communications law, raising suspicions that the \"Leave Us Alone Coalition\" includes a lot of wealthy and powerful interests. His reputation also took a hit a few years ago because of his close association with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. But none of the insinuations of impropriety have ever stuck.\n\nHe doesn't want people who are active in his politics threatened for promoting the fight against higher taxes, but makes his living threatening those who don't toe his company line. Not only that, he then tries to make the voters the heavies in all of this by saying it's them carrying out the political death sentence for GOP pols.\n\nNorquist: The pledge is not to me. It's to the voters. So an elected official who says, 'I think I wanna break my pledge,' he doesn't look at me and say that. He looks at his voters and says that. That's why some of them look at their voters, don't wanna say that, and they go, \"Well, how 'bout you? Could you release me from my pledge?\" No, no. I can't help you. Kroft: But you-- Norquist: You didn't promise me anything. Kroft: But you're the keeper of the pledge. Norquist: We remind your voters that you took the pledge. Kroft: You are the ones that are-- Norquist: That's true. Kroft: --gonna retaliate if they break the pledge. Norquist: Oh, no, no, no. The voters will retaliate. We may inform the voters. But let's say the voters all want -- Kroft: Inform the voters with hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign or educational - Norquist: Nineteen-- Kroft:--expenditures to point out the fact that they broke the pledge. Norquist: If necessary. Kroft: But you make it pretty clear. If someone breaks the pledge, you're gonna do everything you can to get rid of them. Norquist: To educate the voters that they raise taxes. And again, we educate people-- Kroft: To get rid of them. Norquist: To encourage them to go into another line of work, like shoplifting or bank robbing, where they have to do their own stealing. Kroft: You've got them by the shorthairs. Norquist: The voters do. Yeah.\n\nIt must be nice to be a conservative bully since the media never holds them accountable.",

Foreign-policy decisions made for the past seven years have turned out to be a complete fiasco. Since the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, the footprint of the West in the Middle East and South-East Asia has been enormous and overall a complete disaster. Some policymakers in Washington, Paris, London and Berlin are fully aware of this, even though they would never acknowledge it in a public statement.\n\nThe ISIS jihadist mercenary army that Russia, Iran and Hezbollah have to fight now in Syria and Iraq was largely created, with the full knowledge and support of the West, by their regional allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The Saudi man in charge of Syria’s dossier was the now-disgraced Prince Bandar (AKA Bandar-Bush). There are so many conflicting narratives in Washington that it is hard to pinpoint who is in charge of the situation with ISIS in both Syria and Iraq. But it is clearly not the so called leader of the free world. The key moment for Putin to green light his military operation in Syria was unquestionably the visit of Israel’s PM Netanyahu to Moscow a couple of weeks ago. Israel and Turkey, the two regional players, allies of the West with real armies, had to be consulted and more or less on board before a full-blown Russian and Iranian military involvement could occur in Syria. It is likely that both Netanyahu and Erdogan gave Putin the explicit guarantee that they would not interfere with Russia’s military operations in the works. They are indeed staying on the sideline and, in the case of Turkey, not assisting ISIS or al-Nusra anymore.\n\nThe influence of Saudi Arabia and Qatar is about to be downgraded\n\nSaudis and Qataris sold Washington the notion that the methods to topple of Gaddafi in Libya could be easily applied to topple Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The so-called Arab Spring of 2011 was hijacked by Sunni autocrats and Washington neocons to turn the energy of a movement into regime-change policy. What they did, in reality, was finance and arm a 70,000-strong jihadist foreign legion with territorial ambition. They have weapons to fight and plenty of resources through the oil fields under their control. ISIS is the latest Frankenstein of the West and their Gulf-State allies. The battle-hardened jihadist soldiers of fortune are their own masters and have an agenda of territorial expansion to recreate a Caliphate.\n\nIt is likely that the Americans, their European and regional Sunni allies will stay on the sideline while Russia, Iraqi Shiite militias under command of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, and Hezbollah fight ISIS. The West will be quite happy to stay out of the way. The narrative in Washington is full of contradictions. While Mr. Obama is more or less stuck in his 2013 talking point of “Assad must go,” Joe Biden on October 2, 2015 admitted that since 2011, it has always been a challenge to find “some moderate Syrian able to fight Assad.” As matter of fact, moderates of the so-called Free Syrian Army have always been harder to find than a needle in a giant hay stack.\n\nSo far, Russia’s plan in Syria has been astute and correct. Russian jets have been degrading ISIS strongholds, command centers, ammunition depots and oil fields. Once this is achieved, it is likely that a ground operation will start. Russian troops and whatever is left of Assad’s forces will come from the Allawite-controlled north, while Hezbollah will move more forces from Lebanon in the west. In a coordinated fashion, Iraqi Shiite militias and even Iraqi troops, under Iranian command, will come from the south to take back ISIS-controlled areas of Iraq. The jihadist army will have nowhere to go, but they are likely to be formidable opponents using their tanks and armored vehicles, all proudly made in the USA, and they will have snipers in position blending into the ruins of Syria. Regardless, if the coalition of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah commit enough troops on the ground, they should unquestionably prevail.\n\nWhat could be the geopolitical outcome of Russia’s regained role in the Middle East?\n\nAt the start of the so-called Syrian revolution against Assad, Russia’s mistake in dealing with Bashar al-Assad was not to put pressure on him to sideline his mercurial and borderline sociopath brother Maher al-Assad. Syria is destroyed: it is literally tabula rasa. The best outcome, which might be the only option, will be to structure Syria as a federation with a map that follows sectarian divisions, which have become extreme. Once ISIS is defeated by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Syria will need something like the Marshall plan that was conceived to rebuild West Germany after World War II. The leading culprits of the destruction such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the US, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Turkey should contribute the most. Perhaps then, millions of Syrian refugees can come back from Turkey, Jordan and elsewhere and start a slow process of rebuilding and relearning to cohabit despite the bloodshed, trauma, and misery that they have experienced.\n\nIn Iraq, the same process of reconciliation must take place between Shiites and Sunnis. Once the Russian-led coalition prevails against the jihadists, Iran will probably gain a lot of regional geopolitical clout, in direct proportion to the likely diminished influence of Saudi Arabia — currently meddling in Yemen’s affairs — and Qatar. Perhaps the regain of influence of Russia in the Middle East will be a source of stability for the region. After all, Syria has been an ally of Russia in the region since 1946 and, during that time, it was not a source of major regional conflict in the Middle East. Ultimately, it is in the interest of Washington and even more Europe that this coalition of Russia, Iran, Iraq’s Shiite militia and Hezbollah succeed in crushing ISIS and flushing it out. Meanwhile, while Putin is playing a shrewd geopolitical chess game, the West is playing checkers.\n\nEditor’s Note: For more from Gilbert Mercier on the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, read The Orwellian Empire, available as a paperback from Amazon.",

  "latent_6552": "The offensive and defensive line battles are always the highlight of padded practices to me. They best embody the physical nature of football and highlight an aspect of play that we all seem to agree is critical but have a difficult time watching in live broadcasts.\n\nThe Vikings, in particular, have an interesting dynamic with their trench play. The defensive line could be the best in the NFL while the offensive line is attempting to pull itself together to make sure it’s not one of the worst.\n\nTo that end, I’ve been logging success and failure in the one-on-one drills to see which linemen stand out, combining it with what I can see in team drills to give an update on camp performance.\n\nDefensive Linemen\n\nStanding out more than anyone else is Everson Griffen. He’s won rep after rep in team drills and one-on-one and consistently gets to the quarterback (or orange cone representing the quarterback). He’s won on inside moves, outside moves, with bull rushes and so on. Griffen has blown up running plays and interrupted passing lanes. He’s been dominant.\n\nDanielle Hunter has been showing as well. The Vikings have been switching he and Griffen from right to left throughout camp and both have been successful attacking either side. Hunter has been winning with speed in camp mostly, which isn’t to say he hasn’t demonstrated excellent bend, too. He hasn’t been nearly as successful as Griffen in one-on-ones, but his losses have been close and his wins pretty big.\n\nProbably the most successful one-on-one player has been Linval Joseph. That’s to be expected, given that his role demands double-teams and one-on-ones inherently do not create that opportunity. He’s won every rep against the centers and many of them pretty easily. More important is his performance in 11-on-11 drills, where he’s done a good job with his primary duty: keeping the linebackers clean against the run.\n\nJOSEPH on his job: \"Just be unselfish, keep the linebackers free. Once they're free, I can get off a block and make a play.\" — KFAN1003 (@KFAN1003) July 31, 2017\n\nEric Kendricks has been adept at creating tackles near or behind the line of scrimmage and a good chunk of that responsibility can be given to Joseph, who has demanded enough attention that the guards are having some difficulty getting free and into the second level. Not that anyone was worried, but Joseph certainly seems to be maintaining his form.\n\nThe three-technique battle isn’t getting much play from a lot of media, and that’s a little understandable but disappointing. Right now the competition seems to solely be between Tom Johnson and Datone Jones. If first-team reps are any indication, Johnson is the favorite of the two.\n\nAs far as the one-on-one drills go, Jones is doing a better job. In fairness, there have only been about four reps for each — but the quality of their competition is not too different. Johnson has played against Alex Boone three times and Joe Berger once while Jones has taken reps against Boone once, Berger twice and Austin Shepherd once.\n\nTo his credit, Jones demolished Shepherd on that rep, and the other three reps against the starting offensive line were OK — a win and two close losses. Johnson had issues with Boone and didn’t look as powerful of a pass-rusher as Jones did against the same competition. Not only that, Johnson logged two penalties in those drills responding to hard counts.\n\nI think in eleven-on-eleven drills that Jones looked better as well, especially against the run. While there’s no sign yet that Jones is anything more than an average three technique tackle, there’s little sign he’s much less than that as well. At the moment, that’s a pretty good sign for a player who is more well-rounded than the nickel specialist Johnson.\n\nThe next-most relevant player is probably Brian Robison. Robison looks bigger than last year and I wouldn’t be surprised if they were planning on using him like the Bengals used Wallace Gilberry when Zimmer was with them — a defensive end/tackle that was used to fill in the defensive tackle depth problem that developed for the Bengals one year but ended up becoming an effective rotational option. He’s rushed up the middle as often as he has outside, though usually as a stand-up player.\n\nHe has had occasion to beat Mike Remmers, Nick Easton, Berger and Jeremiah Sirles, with his only loss in one-on-ones, strangely to Willie Beavers. He’s done a good job disrupting the interior in nickel situations and has generated pretty significant pressure throughout camp.\n\nStephen Weatherly looks like the primary backup defensive end and seems to have slotted himself into the fourth defensive end spot despite spending most of the year on the practice squad last year. He hasn’t been as good in one-on-ones as I’d have hoped and only has one winning rep, against Shepherd. There aren’t many notes of his performances in eleven-on-eleven drills, which likely he means he hasn’t made much headway there. Despite all of that, the general impression I have of him is mildly positive — though that could be built on a successful first few days in rookie camp, as there’s not much he’s done since the pads have come on.\n\nThe second-team nose tackle has been Shamar Stephen and were it not for his excellent performances in camp so far, I’d have expected Jaleel Johnson to have supplanted his spot on the depth chart at this point. Stephen has been excellent at keeping the linebackers clean against the second-string offensive line, and it’s fairly clear that his natural position is at the nose. He hasn’t won much in one-on-ones and has a few penalties in those drills, too. Hopefully, any disparity between his team drill performance and his individual drill performance gets cleared up one way or the other so it becomes easier to see what happens—he should be doing better against the centers than he is.\n\nThe standouts among the third-string defensive line are Tashawn Bower and Ifeadi Odenigbo. Odenigbo, unfortunately, fell prey to an injury, but before then was doing extremely well. He has been burning Aviante Collins in team drills, and does well on inside twists. He consistently sheds the opposing tackle for a stop in the run game and can seem to get around the edge with some quickness.\n\nBower has been doing well, too. He’s been beating up on Sirles and in team drills has generated several tackles for loss and has created some pressure, too. I’ve only logged two one-on-one drills with Bower, and they sort of cancel each other out — a win against Sirles and a loss to Collins — but his presence in team drills is clear.\n\nBoth Bower and Odenigbo seem like better run-stoppers than pass-rushers, but I would give the edge to Odenigbo between the two because he seems more consistently capable of generating a pass rush.\n\nSam McCaskill has been asked to step into Odenigbo’s place and I can tell that he’d been relegated to the fourth string for a reason. He hasn’t been that impressive and has been one of the worst performers in individual drills. He’s been thrown to the ground and hasn’t made up for any of his disadvantages with speed or agility.\n\nThe third-string defensive tackles have some interesting names as well. Jaleel Johnson is the most intriguing, as the fourth-round pick. In team drills, he’s done a good job controlling the point of attack and has made good plays against Freddie Tagaloa, Zac Kerin and Danny Isidora, including at least one quarterback “sack.”\n\nHe hasn’t won many individual reps in the OL-DL drills, but he also hasn’t lost by much, crowding the pocket even on reps where he’s lost. Every rep for him seems to be very close to a win and his team play showcases good overall ability. He gets his hands up when the ball is about to leave the pocket and can create pass breakups there, too.\n\nBetween Will Sutton, Chunky Clements and Dylan Bradley, Sutton has been getting more snaps but has also run hot-and-cold. On some days, he looks slow and unlikely to push the pocket. On other days, he generates a sack and a pass breakup in the first 30 minutes of practice. Overall, he’s been an average performer in individual drills against below-average competition, with more liabilities than assets in team drills.\n\nBradley and Clements have both had pretty limited reps in team drills and one-on-ones, and they’ve been about equal. I’ve noticed more movement from Bradley, but also a higher likelihood of getting pushed out of run plays. Neither of them stuck out to me too much positively or negatively.\n\nOffensive Line\n\nIf you’ve read enough about the defensive ends, you probably are getting a sense of how the tackles are performing in camp. Without Riley Reiff healthy, it’s generally difficult to get a sense of how big the problem really is — two bad offensive linemen is twice as bad as one bad offensive lineman and possibly even worse than that after taking into account schematic considerations.\n\nRemmers has had two fairly awful days and one pretty good day, which kind of feels like a summary of his career. Constantly burned in pass protection by one of two speedy defensive ends, Remmers hasn’t shown much in team drills that will instill confidence in Vikings fans. He’s certainly been an able run blocker, which is clearly an upgrade from before, but there are certainly occasions where he’ll lock on to a linebacker and let them disengage too early.\n\nWhen he’s aggressive in pass protection, it seems like he can succeed. He had the very first rep I saw in one-on-ones and it was against Hunter. He won the rep by finding a way to punch first despite a length disadvantage and closing the gap faster than Hunter expected. But for the most part, he’s been an able run defender with pass protection issues.\n\nAs for Rashod Hill, I think what we’ve seen of him has been largely positive in the team setting, and he seems to be outplaying what may be expected of a backup offensive tackle. That said, he’s still getting toasted by the talented defensive ends the Vikings throw at him on a somewhat consistent basis, especially in one-on-ones. He’s performing better than Remmers is in those drills but he’s really outshining him in team drills, where he’s done an able, though not fully satisfactory, job of keeping the pocket clear of pressure.\n\nWere I to evaluate him as a starter, I’d be disappointed. If and when Reiff is healthy, the Vikings may want to consider a right tackle competition between Rashod Hill and Remmers despite having just signed Remmers to a five-year deal.\n\nBy far the best offensive lineman is Boone. He’s only lost one rep in individual drills and in team drills is doing a good job showing movement and power, pulling on runs to either lay influence blocks or lead power-type plays and meeting linebackers at the line of scrimmage. That movement is good to see, and even though he’ll lose every so often to Tom Johnson, he’s generally been the aggressor and has been pretty good about creating running lanes and preventing the pocket from collapsing.\n\nBerger, unfortunately, doesn’t seem to be playing to the level he had last year. I don’t think he’s fallen off or anything, but he’s more consistently been on the losing side of one-on-one drills and hasn’t kept the pocket clean as much as he had in the prior year of play or training camp. He started out padded practices by winning reps against Tom Johnson and Jones, but generally, his wins have been close and his losses have been somewhat big.\n\nI don’t expect, based on these performances, that he’ll be a liability as a guard for the team, but I do think we should probably see a lower quality of play than we have in years past — unless, of course, we’re overreacting to a few days of training camp. With a week of this consistent feeling from me, I kind of doubt it, but it’s well within the realm of possible outcomes.\n\nAs for the center battle, it’s nice to see Pat Elflein has had more control of his snaps than he did early on. Otherwise, it would be a pretty consistently clear contest in favor of Easton. Instead, his shotgun snaps have become more reliable and he’s been a very able blocker since partially resolving this issue. He’s won more reps than Easton in individual drills and I think he’s held his own more as a pass protector and run blocker than Easton in the team-level work they’ve done. Easton has taken more reps with the ones and that’s worth noting, but even when only looking at the known quality players they’ve played against, Elflein seems to come out ahead.\n\nEaston hasn’t been awful or anything; both Easton and Elflein have lost every rep they’ve had against Linval Joseph. Instead, it’s when they play Jones, Stephen or Jaleel Johnson that Elflein outdoes Easton. Not only that, Elflein was perhaps the closest to winning a rep against Joseph and that has to count for something. Easton’s best quality is second-level movement and we haven’t seen many opportunities for that in camp so far. When it comes to that, we may see him outdoing Elflein, but I don’t think that will necessarily be the case, given Elflein’s strong background with that skill.\n\nThe most interesting backup to me so far has been Beavers. He was not a pick that I liked and I thought the Vikings made a mistake grabbing him in the draft. I felt vindicated in that assumption when the Vikings cut him, but after a year on the practice squad and some time on an active roster, he seems to have developed quite a bit. I think what I’ve seen from him in camp has been largely pretty good. He’s won reps against Robison and Weatherly as well as third-string competition like McCaskill.\n\nThat’s not to say he’s perfect; he’s lost reps to Weatherly and Anthony Barr and in team drills hasn’t been as good as he has in individual drills. He is back to playing tackle and maybe he really does fit better there despite a weak college resume at that position.\n\nIsidora seems to be the offensive counterpart to Sutton in that he’s been hot-and-cold. He does a better job getting his hands inside than he did in college and that’s paying off. He’s won a few reps against some pretty decent competition and with only one loss in the one-on-one drills so far, he’s setting a good tone for himself. Unfortunately, he does make some pretty big mistakes with whiffs in pass protection occasionally and some pretty poor aiming at the second level in the running game. Overall, I think his play is encouraging.\n\nSirles has been disappointing as well. After a strong preseason at tackle last year, the hope was that he’d be able to turn his spot-starts into reliability for a beleaguered Vikings offensive line, but he instead contributed to its shoddiness — except at guard. Unfortunately, he’s not playing guard right now and continues to suffer at tackle. With several false starts throughout camp and generally poor pass protection, he might be the worst-performing tackle in camp. That might be why Mike Zimmer’s response to a question about the depth of the offensive tackle unit for the Vikings was to hope that the tackles would stay healthy. We’ve been able to heap praise upon Bower and Odenigbo for their pass-rushing and run-stopping prowess in large part because they’ve done it against Sirles.\n\nT.J. Clemmings has been a bit up-and-down, which I think is a pretty good sign after two seasons of play with the arrow pointing down on a pretty frequent basis. While I haven’t been enamored with his team play, it hasn’t been as bad as year’s past. Add to that a fairly average performance in individual drills against players like Jones and Jaleel Johnson and there’s upside there. He did have the worst rep of any player in one-on-ones after getting cleared out by Clements, but those are baseline level expectations from Vikings fans at this point, and it makes sense to focus on how he’s improving, if he indeed continues this pace in camp.\n\nAmong the third-team offensive linemen, we can’t say there have been enough reps to create solid conclusions. Generally speaking, I’ve been very impressed with Zac Kerin, who has won every individual one-on-one rep he’s had and has had some good moments in team drills. The worst performer thus far has probably been Shepherd, who has lost most of his reps in individual drills (with one win against Sutton). In team drills, I’ve noticed issues with him handling Jones and not securing his blocks at the second level.\n\nFreddie Tagaloa has been a yo-yo in the same sense as Sutton and Isidora, with good days and bad days. After a strong rookie camp showing, I think his level of play has quieted down. He’s won and lost individual reps against Dylan Bradley and in team drills either shows great movement with pass protection and second-level capability or disappointing instincts to prevent the pocket from collapsing.\n\nI wish I had seen more of Aviante Collins and Reid Fragel over the past several days, but I’m left with not very many reps from the two of them, with Collins continuing his disappointing performance from the rookie period and Fragel remaining a mystery to me. I hope to see more of them as camp continues.\n\nRelated",

  "latent_6698": "On October 10, 2013, the Cassini spacecraft took an image of Saturn that is unlike anything we’ve ever seen from Earth:\n\nIt’s unlike any view of Saturn we’ve ever seen from Earth because it’s a view we can never see from Earth! Cassini captured Saturn and it’s rings from high above the planet’s northern hemisphere on October 10, 2013. The image shown here is actually a composite of several mosaic images of Saturn and its rings taken in red, green, and blue filters.\n\nAnd what an image it is! In a rare glimpse we see Saturn as its own planet, detached from its rings. Of course, we already knew that about Saturn, but seeing it this way seems to add a whole new…well…perspective.\n\nThe image reveals some striking features of the planet. At the north pole is a 1,250 mile-(2,000 kilometers) wide vortex with wind speeds up to 330 mph (150 meters per second). There’s no land mass on Saturn to break this storm and it’s likely that it’s been there since long before Cassini ever arrived, and will probably remain there for centuries to come.\n\nThe storm sits at the center of a complex region known as the hexagon, shown in light blue in this image. Each side of the hexagon is over 8,600 miles (13,800 km) in length – more than the diameter of Earth itself! For some reason though, there is no similar hexagon in Saturn’s southern hemisphere.\n\nLooking at the rest of the image, the first thing that jumped out at me was that you could still clearly see the night side of the planet. That’s because Saturn is being illuminated by the rest of the ring system itself!\n\nHad they been able to, I’m sure NASA would have processed the images and shared it with the public in a press release. But due to the government shutdown, no image was produced. Fortunately, the raw data is public and Gordan Ugarkovic at UnmannedSpaceFlight.com created this spectacular image on his own initiative.\n\nOn a personal note, I’m extremely grateful for this image because it was taken on October 10, my birthday.

  "latent_6736": "It’s official: The influential Koch brothers have thrown their weight behind Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, CNN reported Wednesday. Fiorina will gain access to a large pool of funding from conservative groups with the endorsement.\n\nThe Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, an umbrella organization that funds many conservative groups backed by the industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch, announced that Fiorina will be one of five candidates it backs. The group had previously backed Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker before he dropped out of the race in September.\n\n\"Governor Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina and Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio are leading a thoughtful and substantive discussion on the issues and we look forward to hearing more about their vision for the country,\" said James Davis, a Freedom Partners spokesman, according to CNN.\n\nDespite backing Fiorina in her unsuccessful 2010 California Senate race against incumbent Barbara Boxer, the Koch brothers waited with their endorsement in this race. Fiorina’s own campaign manager has previously worked for the Koch group.\n\nThe Koch brothers have long been on the receiving end of complaints about using their vast financial resources to influence politics in the U.S. Some have estimated the brothers will be throwing $1 billion into the 2016 presidential race through various groups.\n\nThe endorsement comes at an important moment as more donors have started warming to the former chief executive of technology company Hewlett-Packard and viewing her as a potentially viable candidate. Fiorina’s campaign started out slowly with approximately $5 million in donations during the summer months, Reuters reported.\n\nFiorina’s performance at last month’s Republican debate drew praise, especially for her responses to Donald Trump's bombastic remarks. Trump criticized Fiorina’s appearance before the debate.\n\n\"I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,\" Fiorina said coolly in response. She was the only woman on the crowded GOP stage.",

  "latent_6973": "Global health experts largely applauded Dr. Kim’s nomination, and he has scooped up the endorsement of a number of prominent commentators, like the development economist Jeffrey Sachs. Europe is expected to back him in that the United States supported the candidacy of Christine Lagarde, the former French finance minister, for managing director of the International Monetary Fund last year.\n\nMs. Okonjo-Iweala and Mr. Ocampo were carefully vetted and specifically chosen for their long résumés and expertise in development and international economic negotiation. African governments lobbied the Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, to encourage Ms. Okonjo-Iweala to run; the Group of 11 emerging economies pushed for Mr. Ocampo.\n\nMs. Okonjo-Iweala was a World Bank managing director — working directly beneath the president — from 2007 until last July. In Nigeria, she has fought to reduce the country’s debt, gain greater access to international credit markets and battle corruption.\n\nMr. Ocampo served as finance minister and the head of the Colombian central bank, and led the arm of the United Nations that facilitates economic development.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Ocampo expressed some initial hesitancy to enter the race, given the odds. “It is a relatively unbalanced competition,” he said with a laugh.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut he said his four decades of experience in development and international policy made him an excellent candidate. “I thought the developing-country candidates who were suitable for the job should be in the race,” he said. “I felt a responsibility to put a stone in the road toward a democratic process.”\n\nSpeaking by telephone from New Delhi, where she was attending the BRICS meeting of leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, Ms. Okonjo-Iweala also called for a merit-based, transparent selection process, suggesting a televised debate for herself, Mr. Ocampo and Dr. Kim.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“I have tremendous respect for Dr. Kim,” she said. “But you’re looking for the best. You’re not just looking for the acceptable. I can’t believe what I’m hearing: Is this the same West that talks about democracy, openness, and meritocracy, and it’s like it has already been decided!”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In an opinion piece published in The Financial Times, Dr. Kim called for an “open, inclusive” bank, saying, “If the World Bank is to promote inclusive development, it must give developing nations a greater voice.” He is currently on a “listening tour” through Ethiopia, China, Japan, India, Brazil and Mexico.\n\nDr. Kim, who is 52, has not yet outlined his goals for the World Bank. A senior administration official indicated that Mr. Obama chose him for his data-driven development approach, hands-on experience in developing countries and focus on the world’s very poor. The administration also wanted a practitioner rather than a banker or a politician, officials said.\n\nMs. Okonjo-Iweala said that she hoped to make the World Bank more “nimble” in responding to developing countries’ needs and to be able to give loans or other forms of support in days or weeks rather than in months or years. She also called on the bank to improve its focus on alleviating unemployment, particularly among the young.\n\n“There is an opportunity for a demographic dividend” for emerging economies where a large proportion of the population is under 30, she said. “The World Bank is the premier institution to support young people, with all of its instruments to create jobs, build infrastructure and invest in human infrastructure,” like schools and hospitals.\n\nShe said she had the necessary experience and familiarity with the World Bank to do that. “Doing grass-roots development work is wonderful,” Ms. Okonjo-Iweala said. “But ultimately, this is about making tough choices that effect millions of lives. And I’ve done that. And I can hit the ground running because I know how to make this institution work for the world’s poor.”\n\nMr. Ocampo said he planned to make the World Bank more responsive to international development goals. “There are issues related to low-income countries which should always be the priority of the World Bank,” Mr. Ocampo said. “But there are also issues for middle-income countries that are increasingly the bank’s concerns, related to global public goods.” He said the World Bank should work more closely with the United Nations to make progress on issues like corruption and climate change.",

  "latent_7084": "Image copyright SWA\n\nA decade of strong growth in Scotch whisky exports came to an end last year as overseas sales fell, according to new figures.\n\nThe Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) said HM Revenue and Customs data showed exports fell 7% to £3.95bn in 2014.\n\nThe decline was in part due to a sharp drop in exports to the USA, the biggest market for Scotch by value, where sales fell by 9% to £748m.\n\nThe volume of global exports also fell by 3%, to 1.19 billion 70cl bottles.\n\nSWA blamed the decline on \"weaker economic conditions and political volatility\" in some markets.\n\nBut it remained upbeat about the future, arguing that the long-term outlook for the sector was good with underlying strong growth in most emerging markets.\n\nIn Asia, Taiwan saw exports jump 36% to £197m, partly as a result of the growing popularity of single malts.\n\nExports to India were up 29% to £89m, despite a 150% import tariff.\n\nTop six Scotch whisky export markets by value - 2014\n\n1. USA £750m (-9%)\n\n2. France £445m (+2%)\n\n3. Singapore £201m (-39%)\n\n4. Taiwan £197m (+36%)\n\n5. Spain £166m (-8%)\n\n6. Germany £141m (-18%)\n\nBut there was a mixed picture in emerging markets. Exports by volume to Mexico grew 5% to 42.8 million bottles, while value fell by 10% in that market.\n\nThere was a similar trend in Brazil, with volumes flat but value down 20%.\n\nThe important hub market of the United Arab Emirates continued to boom, with exports up 27% by value.\n\nHowever, exports to the major regional hub of Singapore fell by 39% in value to £200m.\n\nSWA said this was partly down to the ongoing austerity campaign in China - the final destination for much of the Scotch shipped from the UK to Singapore.\n\nDirect exports to China, the 26th largest market by value, fell 23% to £39m.\n\nImage copyright SWA\n\nSWA said the 9% fall in exports to the USA was due partly to stock adjustments and an increasingly competitive spirits market.\n\nExports to France, the biggest market by volume and second biggest by value, were up 2% to £445m, suggesting that the French market was stabilising after Scotch was hit by a tax increase in 2012.\n\nOne encouraging sign for the industry was that global exports appeared to perform better in the second half of last year.\n\nSWA chief executive David Frost said: \"Economic and political factors in some important markets held back Scotch whisky exports in 2014 after a decade of strong growth.\n\n\"It shows that the industry's success cannot be taken for granted and that we must continue to argue for more open markets and ambitious trade deals that tackle barriers to market access.\n\n\"The long-term fundamentals remain strong, with consumers in emerging markets wanting to buy Scotch whisky as a high-quality and authentic product with a strong reputation and clear provenance.\n\n\"This drives the strong investment in Scotch whisky production in Scotland and the significant interest in entering the sector.\"",

Democrats vow to oppose any wall funding, and many Republicans are also wary of his plans for a massive brick-and-mortar barrier.\n\nThe Border Patrol and local police would establish a buffer zone around the construction site if necessary, the U.S. official said. The San Diego police and sheriff’s departments said Monday they will respect constitutional rights to free speech and assembly for any peaceful, law-abiding protesters.\n\nEnrique Morones, executive director of Border Angels, said his group plans to protest.\n\n“There will be a lot of different activity — protests, prayer vigils — on both sides of the wall,” said Morones, whose immigrant advocacy group is based in San Diego. “We pray and hope that they’re peaceful.”\n\nMichael Evangelista-Ysasaga, chief executive of The Penna Group LLC, a general contractor in Fort Worth, Texas, said he has received about a dozen death threats since publicly expressing interest in bidding, including one from a woman who told him she hired a private investigator to trail him.\n\nEvangelista-Ysasaga said he bid in part because he wants broad immigration reform. Securing the border, he said, is a prerequisite for granting a path to citizenship to millions in the U.S. illegally.\n\n“We didn’t enter this lightly,” he said. “We looked at it and said we have to be a productive part of the solution.”\n\nBuilding a wall on the Mexican border was a cornerstone of Trump’s presidential campaign and a flashpoint for his detractors. The multibillion-dollar project along the 2,000-mile border has many outspoken critics, including the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico, which said last week that Mexican companies expressing interest were betraying their country.",

  "latent_7296": "STILLWATER, Okla. -- Sometime in late June, in an Omaha parking lot, Mike Gundy was booking it across the asphalt. He was in town for his son's baseball tournament and had College World Series tickets. Dressed in street clothes, with nary an Oklahoma State logo, he figured he'd enjoy some anonymity among the college baseball fans. He was wrong.\n\nA pair of tailgating fans, one from LSU and one from Cal State Fullerton, spotted the man's now-famous mullet.\n\n\"Hey, Coach!\" one yelled as the other excitedly joined in. \"I'm a man! I'm 40!\"\n\n\"Can you believe that?\" Gundy recalls, laughing as he sits in his office at Boone Pickens Stadium a few weeks later. \"I didn't tell them that it ain't even accurate now. I'm still a man. But I'm about to be 50.\"\n\nA decade ago, Gundy -- then a red-faced quadragenarian hothead -- launched a few million YouTube views, and nearly that many birthday cakes, with one of college football's first true viral moments and perhaps the most famous postgame rant in sports history. One that, like a great movie, is still eminently quotable:\n\n\"I DON'T READ THE NEWSPAPER: BECAUSE IT'S GARBAGE!\"\n\n\"HE'S FAT!\"\n\n\"THAT AIN'T TRUE!\"\n\n\"MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE!\"\n\nAnd, of course:\n\n\"I'M A MAN, I'M 40!\"\n\nYes, as of Saturday, the kid who set all those Oklahoma high school and Oklahoma State passing records, the cocky and wide-eyed guy who was 37 when he became head coach at his alma mater, will be 50.\n\n\"I see that guy on that video and I see a guy who was going to work every single day with his fists clenched, feeling like he's gotta scrap for every single inch every single day,\" Gundy says now. He can't recall the last time he watched the clip voluntarily, but he doesn't have to. That stalking, shouting, pointing man is permanently embedded on the memory card of his mind. \"Don't misunderstand, we're still fighting for everything we get around here. But if you could go back in time, I would want to put my arm around that guy and say, 'Hey dude, it's going to be OK.' Because here we are a decade later, and you know what?\" Gundy pauses and points out the window of his office into the stadium below. \"It is pretty OK, isn't it?\"\n\nThat office overlooks a stadium that's been enclosed and ringed with luxury boxes. The office lobby is draped in trophies, including awards for 17 bowl wins over 115 years of football played. Gundy was involved in 10 of those wins, as quarterback for two, assistant coach for one and head coach for seven. He also had a hand in bringing the Heisman Trophy to Stillwater, or more accurately, handoffs to the man who won it, Barry Sanders. Now there is much chatter in Stillwater and elsewhere that Gundy might be coaching the school's second Heisman winner, quarterback and NFL draft buzz-generator Mason Rudolph.\n\nEditor's Picks College football's top 10 viral moments of the past 10 years Ten years have passed since Mike Gundy became college football's first true viral sensation when he yelled, \"I'm a man! I'm 40!\" at a reporter during a postgame news conference. Here are our 10 favorite viral moments to surface since then.\n\n\"I have been on this campus and in this stadium my entire adult life,\" explains the man who arrived as a freshman from Midwest City, Oklahoma, in the summer of 1987. \"I like the mindset of a place like Oklahoma State. I think it's the same mindset you have to have if you're at Michigan State or Georgia Tech or Auburn, the underdog guys. You're not the brand name. You're not always on the tip of everybody's tongue. Nothing's handed to you because you're not the flagship or whatever you want to call it.\n\n\"It's not easy and never has been easy. But I can tell you this, when you finally have some success, when you win those battles and look into the eyes of the folks who have stuck with it through some really bad times -- man, that's a feeling like nothing else.\"\n\nIn mid-June, he finally ended a wrestling match with his boss, legendary golf coach-turned-athletic director Mike Holder, signing a five-year contract extension that will pay Gundy more than $4.2 million annually. The biggest sticking point during the negotiation wasn't about Gundy's salary. For two years he continually walked out of Holder's office, demanding that his coaching and support staffs be raised off the bottom rung of the Big 12's payroll standings. They were, and the resulting pep in their collective steps has added a visible pride to his own stride.\n\n\"When you walk around here and you see what's happened to this place and this program, and you saw where it was -- you lived it like I have, like my teammates did, like my staff has, like my players did just a few years ago. Getting over that hump, man, that ain't a hump. It's a damn mountain.\"\n\nMike Gundy's rant was called \"out of bounds\" and \"completely inappropriate\" by the media but would eventually endear him to recruits. Jeff Johnson/Icon Sportswire\n\nIt's not a stretch to say that the day the crest of that mountain finally came within sight was Sept. 22, 2007. That's when the tirade happened. Gundy walked into his normal postgame media session after a game that had been anything but normal, a 49-45 track meet victory over Texas Tech. When he stalked into the room, he was toting a copy of that morning's Daily Oklahoman. He was angry over a column in that paper about his benching of quarterback Bobby Reid.\n\nThe author, Jenni Carlson, was in the room and Gundy knew it. Pacing the floor like an angry animal, he unleashed the three-minute, 15-second tirade with scathing remarks that started with, \"I want to talk about this article right here,\" ended with, \"It makes me want to puke,\" and reached its crescendo with \"Come after me! I'm a man! I'm 40!\"\n\nLost now to the smudges of history's rearview mirror is the venomous reception Gundy received at the time. He came off as a bully. A desperate, too-young head coach coming off a road loss to Troy. Berry Tramel, a longtime anchor of Oklahoma sportswriting, said Gundy was \"out of bounds.\" Football Writers Association of America president Mike Griffith publicly declared the coach's conduct as \"completely inappropriate.\" Former FWAA president Dennis Dodd wrote about a coach who complained about lack of attention for his team but then flipped out \"when someone dares pull the curtain back to take a peek ... a 13-15 coach at a program that no one outside his clandestine world cares about.\" ESPN The Magazine published a roundhouse kick of a story in which Reid, who'd transferred to Texas Southern, said the incident \"basically ended my life.\"\n\n\"That whole thing was harder than people remember, and honestly, it was harder for a lot of people than I realized at the time,\" Gundy says now.\n\nFor all its viral notoriety, the timing seemed disastrous. YouTube was approaching its third birthday and was just beginning to catch fire. Facebook, only one year older, was taking over college campuses. In September 2007, millions of people were buying their first iPhones. ESPN had only recently promoted SportsCenter from a few-times-a-day studio show to a 24-hour machine.\n\nImages and audio of a pointing, preaching football coach were no longer merely fodder for local newscasts. Now they belonged to the world.\n\n\"I remember coming into the press room after Mike was done with his press conference, like I did after every game, and immediately it was weird,\" recalls Larry Fedora, then Gundy's offensive coordinator and currently North Carolina's head coach. No one had any questions, not even after a 49-point performance. Instead, the media members just stared, shell-shocked by what they'd just witnessed. When Fedora got home that evening, he grabbed a drink and a cigar and crossed the cul-de-sac to Gundy's house. \"I knocked on the door and said, 'What the hell happened in your press conference?' He invited me in and said, 'I'll show you. It's already on YouTube.' And I was like, 'OK, but what the hell is a YouTube?' We didn't really know what the term 'viral sensation' meant. But it sounded pretty bad.\"\n\nInitially, it was. Then it wasn't.\n\nAs the views counter clicked upward, the reaction to the coach with a face as orange as his team colors began to shift. When Gundy and his staff hit the road for recruiting, they were greeted by parents and grandparents embracing what the coach had done. \"I go in, and somebody would say, 'Coach, I want him to play for you because I saw what you did,'\" Gundy said. \"And most of the time it was a minority home, where we all know in America they still feel like they're getting cheated. That's life. We can all try to act like that's not true, but it's true. Which, I could give a s--- if they're white, black, whatever. I want good kids. But if they think there's a head coach that's white who comes in there, and they really believe he's really going to fight for their son, that's to their advantage. That's powerful. I don't ever want to let that family down.\"\n\nArmed with Heisman candidate Mason Rudolph, Gundy has a playoff contender entering the 2017 season. Ken Murray/Icon Sportswire\n\nThe next season, anchored by a top-25 recruiting class that included Dez Bryant, the Cowboys won nine games for the first time in five years and only the second time since Gundy was in the OSU backfield with Sanders. From 2001 to 2007, Oklahoma State posted seven nine-win seasons. Gundy's teams have done that in seven of the last nine years.\n\nDuring that time, he has made peace with Reid. The former player reached out in 2011 and they \"cleared the air.\" Reid joined the OSU staff two years later, working in quality control for two seasons. Gundy's relationship with Carlson is apparent to anyone who watches an Oklahoma State press conference online. There's never been a formal apology or conversation between them, but as the 10th anniversary of their shared moment approaches, their working relationship is just that, a working relationship.\n\nIt's all part of what Gundy describes as \"10 years of realizing you aren't right about everything all of the time.\" When he took over his alma mater's football program from Les Miles in 2005, he was an insomniac and serial micromanager. He spent eight hours a day being offensive coordinator and eight hours a day dominating every room he walked into, whether it was telling the equipment crew the proper way to inflate footballs or rewriting the midweek playbooks presented to him by his assistant coaches. The frazzled man they saw flying off the handle behind closed doors looked an awful lot like the guy stomping around the podium, waving a newspaper on YouTube.\n\n\"We all dream of being the boss, but then when you become the boss it's a lot more to handle than you expected, I don't care who you are,\" says West Virginia head coach Dana Holgorsen, who spent 2010 as Oklahoma State's offensive coordinator, hired -- like Fedora before him -- to take a load off Gundy's offensive mind. \"I think he made mistakes juggling all that. I know he did because we talked about it. I was like, I won't do that. Then I get here and I totally messed some stuff up. He was quick to give me hell about that. But he learned and I learned, and one day it's like, I think I'm getting the hang of this deal.\"\n\n\"My first three years I was terrible about that, especially the 'I told you so' part,\" Gundy said. \"I'd tell someone, 'You'd better not try that play because it ain't gonna work,' and if it didn't I'd be up in their business on Monday: 'See? That didn't work! I told you so!' Well, guess what, young Coach Gundy? None of it worked. Why? Because I was a young dumbass. You can't do it all yourself. It's moving too fast. I don't care if you're 40 or 50. Now I try to hire the best people, let them do their thing and get out of their way.\"\n\nThe 10 years since the rant have taught Gundy to trade in the pedal-to-the-metal and CYA for CEO. He moves from department to department, taking the temperature of every room. He spends practices taking in a 30,000-foot perspective from a 50-foot tower. Those practices are downright light and fluffy compared to the jawbreaker sessions he used to map out. The Cowboys haven't run a full-tackle \"kick his ass\" practice in nine years, and as a result have seen less fatigue and more success down the homestretch of seasons.\n\nHe's now as much physiologist as football strategist, talking less about spreads and coverage reads and more about sleep studies, heart loads, GPS step-tracking and mental health. He pores over sociology studies of millennials: \"What motivated me when I was playing, that doesn't work anymore.\" He attends leadership conferences, reads whatever he can on Bill Belichick, and recently befriended Connecticut women's basketball coach Geno Auriemma. \"I know I've worn him out, but I'm fascinated that a man who has literally won everything there is to win can stay so motivated.\"\n\nDon't misunderstand here. The fire is still there. There are still short-fuse moments, particularly when OSU's quarterback play is bad, as it was in 2014 prior to the pulling of Rudolph's redshirt. Now they are notable because they are the exception and not the modus operandi.\n\n\"I do what we call a turd check. I go into the room with the roster on the board and say, 'We got any turds up here?' We used to have a ton of them. Now we hardly have any. But when we do, we go into my office and talk. You know, 'What's going on, man?' It's not yelling, it's just asking what's wrong and asking what can we do.\"\n\nThere are still mountains to scramble over. The sting still lingers from a missed opportunity to make the BCS National Championship in 2011. He's still beaten Oklahoma only twice in a dozen tries. At the end of every OSU season, there always seems to be that one missing piece that makes the year feel unsatisfying.\n\nBut at 50, even the less fun parts of the job feel pretty damn fun. Certainly, more fun than they were at 40. The fun parts -- hunting rattlesnakes on Twitter, doing mullet critiques on SportsCenter, beating Texas and winning bowl games -- they're really fun. That's why he wanted the new, longer contract, the one that will get him to at least 55: \"One day they might find someone they think can do this better than me. But that ain't right now. Right now is fun.\"\n\nThe line that divides having fun and not, between screaming all the time versus pausing to appreciate life a little more, can be found slashed through the box on the calendar that reads: Sept. 22, 2007.\n\n\"You know, I don't hear it like I used to. I don't see T-shirts or birthday cakes or any of that anymore. But I still hear it from you guys in the media. And I do still get it when I'm on the road recruiting. At the time it happened, you would have never thought you'd ever hear anyone say this, but you know what?\"\n\nMike Gundy, on the eve of 50, draws his lips up into a WTH grin and shakes his head.\n\n\"'I'm a man, I'm 40' is the best thing that ever happened to Oklahoma State football.\"",
  "latent_7310": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nThis story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nNearly a third of the world’s population is now exposed to climatic conditions that produce deadly heat waves, as the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere makes it “almost inevitable” that vast areas of the planet will face rising fatalities from high temperatures, new research has found.\n\nClimate change has escalated the heat wave risk across the globe, the study states, with nearly half of the world’s population set to suffer periods of deadly heat by the end of the century even if greenhouse gases are radically cut.\n\n“For heat waves, our options are now between bad or terrible,” said Camilo Mora, an academic at the University of Hawaii and lead author of the study.\n\nHigh temperatures are currently baking large swaths of the southwestern United States, with the National Weather Service (NWS) issuing an excessive-heat warning for Phoenix, Arizona, which is set to reach 119 degrees F (48.3 degrees C) on Monday.\n\nThe heat warning extends across much of Arizona and up through the heart of California, with Palm Springs’ forecast a toasty 116 degrees F on Monday and Sacramento set to reach 107 degrees F.\n\nThe NWS warned the abnormal warmth would “significantly increase the potential for heat-related illness” and advised residents to drink more water, seek shade and recognize the early symptoms of heat stroke, such as nausea and a racing pulse.\n\nMora’s research shows that the overall risk of heat-related illness or death has climbed steadily since 1980, with around 30 percent of the world’s population now living in climatic conditions that deliver deadly temperatures at least 20 days a year.\n\nThe proportion of people at risk worldwide will grow to 48 percent by 2100 even if emissions are drastically reduced, while around three-quarters of the global population will be under threat by then if greenhouse gases are not curbed at all.\n\n“Finding so many cases of heat-related deaths was mind blowing, especially as they often don’t get much attention because they last for just a few days and then people moved on,” Mora said.\n\n“Dying in a heat wave is like being slowly cooked—it’s pure torture. The young and elderly are at particular risk, but we found that this heat can kill soldiers, athletes, everyone.”\n\nThe study, published in Nature Climate Change, analyzed more than 1,900 cases of fatalities associated with heat waves in 36 countries over the past four decades. By looking at heat and humidity during such lethal episodes, researchers worked out a threshold beyond which conditions become deadly.\n\nThis time period includes the European heat wave of 2003, which fueled forest fires in several countries and caused the River Danube in Serbia to plummet so far that submerged World War II tanks and bombs were revealed. An estimated 20,000 people died; a subsequent study suggested the number was as high as 70,000.\n\nA further 10,000 died in Moscow because of scorching weather in 2010. In 1995, Chicago suffered a five-day burst of heat that resulted in more than 700 deaths.\n\nHowever, most heat-related deaths do not occur during such widely covered disasters. Phoenix, for example, suffered an unusually hot spell last June that resulted in the deaths of at least four people. Hyperthermia, an excess of body heat, can lead to heat stroke and a potential inflammatory response that can kill.\n\nMora said the threshold to deadly conditions caries from place to place, with some people dying in temperatures as low as 23 degrees C. A crucial factor, he said, was the humidity level combined with the heat.\n\n“Your sweat doesn’t evaporate if it is very humid, so heat accumulates in your body instead,” Mora said. “People can then suffer heat toxicity, which is like sunburn on the inside of your body. The blood rushes to the skin to cool you down so there’s less blood going to the organs. A common killer is when the lining of your gut breaks down and leaks toxins into the rest of your body.”\n\nGlobal warming is a potent instigator of deadly heat, with research from the University of California-Irvine this month finding the probability of a heat wave killing in excess of 100 people in India has doubled because of a 0.5 degree C increase in temperature over the past 50 years.\n\n“The impact of global climate change is not a specter on the horizon. It’s real, and it’s being felt now all over the planet,” said Amir AghaKouchak, UCI associate professor and co-author of that study.\n\n“It’s particularly alarming that the adverse effects are pummeling the world’s most vulnerable populations.”\n\nElevated temperatures and dry conditions have been exacerbated by the clearing of trees, which provide shade and cooling moisture, in urban areas. Mora said that while adaption such as government heat warnings and the increased use of air conditioning has helped reduce deaths, this was not a viable long-term solution.\n\n“The heat means that we are becoming prisoners in our own homes—you go to Houston, Texas, in the summer and there’s no one outside,” he said.\n\n“Also, the increased use of air conditioning means that electrical grids fail, as has happened in New York City, Australia, and Saudi Arabia. We need to prevent heat waves rather than just trying to adapt to them.”",

  "latent_7507": "More tests, more results! Follow The Food Lab on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nGet the Recipe Extra-Crunchy Potato Chips\n\nOk—that whole small-batch, \"kettle-cooked\" potato chip thing? I get it. I just don't like it.\n\nSure, I like the idea of thick-cut potatoes slowly bubbling in a copper pot carefully stirred by an old-timey craftsman wielding a well-worn spoon with honest, workingman's hands until the chips reach crisp, golden brown perfection. But to be honest, the vast majority of kettle-style chips simply taste burnt to me (anyone else with me here?). I suppose it has to do with a potato chip equivalent of the Pizza Cognition Theory that states: \"The first slice of pizza a child sees and tastes, becomes, for him, pizza.\"\n\nHaving been raised on thin, crisp, pale yellow, super-salty Wise brand chips (remember when there used to be a riddle on every bag?), that's my image of how a chip should look and taste. Fundamentally, a chip should not be any sort of brown, nor the flavors that come with it. I want my chips to be subtle, tasting only of potato, grease, and salt.\n\nOn the other hand, kettle chips do have one great thing to offer: crunch. The industrial chips of my youth were tasty, but really, they were more crisp than crunchy. In my mind, the ideal chip would combine both of these elements; The blond color and straight-forward salty potato flavor of a thin, old-school chip, and the hefty crunch of a kettle chip.\n\nAnd since there currently aren't any of them on the market, the only thing I could do was try to make them myself.\n\nCrunch Time\n\nSome quick testing immediately answered the question of what it takes to make chips crunchy: it's the thickness.\n\nI fried up a couple batches of chips in 325°F peanut oil, slicing the same potato on a mandoline at different settings. At 1/32nd of an inch, the chips were paper-thin; Thin enough to read through. They cooked extremely fast, and had a tendency to burn. At 1/16th, they were closer to a normal potato chip. Mildly crisp, but not shatteringly crunchy. 1/8th inch chips were the way to go. Thin enough that they didn't come off as tough, but thick enough to add some real heft and weight to the crunch.\n\nBut glance back at that picture, and you immediately see the problem I saw: It was far too dark. Let me explain why.\n\nA chip gets crisp through two processes. First, as the chip heats, water within the individual cells vaporize—this vaporizing bubbles are what you see as fried foods cooked. Next, hot oil moves into the empty spaces left behind. Essential, you are dehydrating the chip, and then filling it up with oil.*\n\n*one of the reasons why fried chips taste so much better than baked chips is because when baking, you get dehydration, but not oil saturation.\n\nA potato also contains starch and simple sugars, both of which undergo the process of caramelization when heated to high temperatures for a prolonged period of time. So my chip was getting too dark because by the time the it had dehydrated and crisped, the sugars had caramelized far too deeply, acquiring the brown (and sometimes burnt) flavors that are such a turn-off for me.\n\nWhat if I just cooked it a bit less? No good. Unless I cooked all of the water out of it, it quickly turned soggy.\n\nAs long as you see bubbles when the chip is submerged, there's still water in there, so I knew that in the future, every batch of chips must be cooked until the bubbling completely stops.\n\nHere's the dilemma: In order to get my chips crisp, I must remove water and replace it with hot oil. But hot oil causes starches and sugars to brown, giving my chips an off flavor.\n\nThe fact that I want my chip crisp and I need to use oil to get there is a given, which leaves me only one choice: get rid of those excess starches and sugars.\n\nWashed Out\n\nThe first step to getting rid of excess starches was a simple one: I just washed it away.\n\nAs soon as you cut open a potato, its cells rupture, releasing exposing starch molecules, simple sugars, and a number of enzymes. One of these enzymes, tyrosinase reacts in the presence of oxygen creating the characteristic brown discoloration you see on apples and potatoes.\n\nHere are two potato slices. One of them has been rinsed in a few changes of cold water, while the one of the right was placed directly on the plate.\n\nThe deep discoloration of the one on the right is an indicator that tyrosinase—and by extension all of the other starches and sugars that were inside those potato cells with it—are still alive and kicking. The one on the left, on the other hand, has had at least most of the junk rinsed off of its surface.\n\nFrying these two potato slices side-by-side confirms this theory:\n\nBut neither one of those chips is quite as blond as I'd like it to be. You see, starch's relationship with potatoes runs pretty deep—it takes more than a simple rinse to separate the two. And when gentle coaxing doesn't work to get rid of it, I prefer to take the John Rambo approach: just blast'em.\n\nI learned back when I was experimenting with french fries that a quick par-cook in boiling water before frying help accomplish this goal: heating up starch granules in the presence of water causes them to absorb water and expand. Eventually, like little water balloons, they burst, expelling the starch into the water where it can be safely dumped down the drain.\n\nWould the same technique work for my chips?\n\nI sliced and rinsed another batch, then plunged them into a pot of boiling water and cooked them as long as I could before they began to show signs of falling apart (as pectin reaches higher temperatures, its glue-like powers eventually break down). I then drained them on a clean kitchen towel, and dropped them into the hot oil until they stopped bubbling. Better, I thought, but still not quite where I wanted them to be. They were still coming out light golden in the center with the very edges turning quite dark.\n\nI needed a way to be able to boil the potato chips a little longer in order to expel even more starch, without allowing them to disintegrate. Now, this may seem like cheating, but here's a secret: I knew the answer already, because I had the exact same dilemma with those french fries (shhh... don't tell) . Here's what I discovered there:\n\nEveryone who's ever baked an apple pie knows that different apples cook differently. Some retain their shape, while others turn to mush. The difference largely has to do with their acidity. Thus super tart apples like Granny Smith will stay fully intact, while sweeter apples like a Macoun will almost completely dissolve. Just like a potato, apple cells are held together by pectin. Moral of the story: acid slows the breakdown of pectin.\n\nI sliced and rinsed one last batch of chips, this time parboiling them in a pot of vinegar-spiked water, allowing me to increase their boiling time from two minutes up to a full three before draining and frying them.\n\nHere are the mugshots. From left to right, you've got vinegar-boiled potatoes, regular boiled potatoes, simply rinsed potatoes, and potatoes that were fried immediately after cutting.\n\nAs you can see, the vinegar-boiled-then-fried potato chips were a resounding success. As crisp and crunchy as any of them, with the subtle, mild taste of the potato chips of my youth. Unlike with the french fries, which retain some internal moisture, because potato chips are cooked completely dry, the vinegar flavor doesn't come through at all—just pure, unadulterated, greasy (and I mean that in a good way), salty, potato flavor.\n\nNow that's what The Food Lab is all about—observing the similarity between apple pies, french fries, and potato chips, and taking lessons from one to help solve problems in the other.\n\nAnd darn it, there I went and did it again. I keep promising myself I'll be less long-winded next time, but nope. Now I don't even have the room to tell you about the fun tinkering I've been doing with the French onion dip I'm about to dunk these into... But I'll leave you with this question: What do crispy chicken skin and caramelized onions have to do with each other?\n\nContinue here for our recipe for Extra-Crunchy Potato Chips\n\nAbout the author: J.

  "latent_7559": "I’m so excited to share my low carb pho recipe with you!\n\nPho is one of my favorite foods ever and is the ultimate comfort food to me. I have so many memories tied to this dish. My husband and I went on our official first date at a hole-in-the-wall pho restaurant after I raved and raved about the soup. I’ve trekked to the local pho joint mid-hangover with my BFFs knowing at the end of our journey we’d all feel 300% better. My sister and I regularly frequented one spot simply because she thought the server was cute and we would talk about what their hypothetical child, Minjiffany, would look like (Minji + Tiffany – I still remember, Tiff!). So many good things come to mind!\n\nUnfortunately, pho is as noodley as they come. The dish is traditionally served with rice noodles, which have a MILLION carbs in them. Well, not a million but close enough. Just 1 cup of rice noodles has 42 net carbs! That’s roughly equivalent to a candy bar. Psh. No. Not anymore, pho.\n\nOr so I thought! You see, after all these years of devouring pho left and right, I had never learned how to make it myself at home. I always swung by my favorite pho place whenever I got a hankering for beef noodle soup; it had become like fast food to me. After going keto, I started to miss my beloved soup, and I just had to make a low carb pho to curb my cravings.\n\nI had learned to make a pretty good bone broth with my pressure cooker but hadn’t experimented with pho broth ever before – let alone a low carb pho broth. It usually takes hours (and hours and hours) to simmer on the stovetop, but I don’t have time for that. At all. I contemplated picking up pho to-go and just tossing out the noodles, but I have a hard time trusting that the broth they make doesn’t have sugar in it. Hint: it does.\n\nSo out comes the Instant Pot , using this recipe for reference and I begin constructing my game plan to perfect my version of low carb pho.\n\nThe Low Carb Pho Recipe\n\nRice noodles are out, obviously. I decide Shirataki Noodles are my best-bet to substitute for many reasons. First of all, they have NO carbs! Zip, zero, none. Although they only have 30 calories in an entire bag, Shirataki Noodles are actually quite filling. They also have the same underlying texture and appearance I’m looking for; there’s a little bite to the noodle, and if you choose the long, skinny spaghetti-like strands it looks pretty darn close to the real deal. I have had great success using them for low carb Asian dishes, including stir-fry recipes and even fried rice. I was pretty confident they would work well in a noodle soup, but it turned out better than I had imagined! For this dish, you don’t have to do much with the noodles, just rinse them off in water and strain.\n\nFor the broth, I parboil the bones for 15 minutes to remove impurities and increase clarity of the soup. Then I throw everything broth-related into the instant pot: the bones, onion, ginger, fish sauce, and water. I set my pressure cooker for 2 hours on high. When it’s done, I just strain it! You could then use it immediately or make it ahead of time, freeze and boil when you’re ready to use it.\n\nNow, I could just straight up drink this broth because it’s so good. But it wouldn’t entirely be pho without all the fixings now, would it?\n\nPho Fixings:\n\nLime – A squirt from a lime wedge usually does the trick with minimal amount of carbs\n\n– A squirt from a lime wedge usually does the trick with minimal amount of carbs Sriracha – It’s delicious, I know.

Use what you like, just be sure to track the carbs for whatever you add. (My low carb veggie list can help you with that!) Meat – A-OK on keto. Select a traditional cut of meat or get creative! Up to you!\n\nThe fixings are all optional dependent on preference and taste. A well-constructed broth usually doesn’t need much, so I leave a lot of the sauces out when I enjoy the way my broth turns out. Play around with it to find your perfect combo!\n\nThere’s a variety of meats to include in traditional pho as this post over at Serious Eats illustrates, but my personal preference is to use raw flank steak shaved paper thin. You can ask your local butcher to cut it for you or buy a side of the raw beef at your closest pho joint – but I guarantee you’ll get more bang for your buck at the butcher. When you are ready to serve, place the meat in the steaming hot broth in your bowl to let it gradually cook. Then add in the rest of your ingredients.\n\nTo serve, place your meat of choice and shirataki noodles in a large bowl and cover in piping hot broth. I would recommend tasting your broth before adding any sauces – you may like it just the way it is. Taste first, then season! Add your desired fixings, mix and slurp away! Enjoy your low carb pho!\n\nI like to plate the pho fixings separately in a community style bowl or plate to share with my family, that way we can all pick our favorite additions to the soup and I don’t have to worry about keeping everyone’s order straight. Even my toddler loves this dish! She demands “SOUP! SOUP! SOUP!” Like mother, like daughter.\n\nIf you don’t have a pressure cooker, you could just use the stovetop method. But I would seriously consider getting one to save you some prep time in the kitchen. It’s much easier to stick to a diet when you can prepare things on the fly and make things as uncomplicated as possible. I use an electric pressure cooker called the Instant Pot so I can set it and forget it instead of staring at the stovetop. I’m a bit of an Instant Pot evangelist since getting one for my birthday last year, I use it constantly and preach to my friends and family about it. But there are plenty other pressure cookers out there that will get the job done!\n\nWhat is your favorite comfort food that you are missing on the keto diet?

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) had a simple message for Republicans and their corporate backers that Democrats and the left will fight and they will win.\n\nSen. Warren began by discussing her fight five years ago to begin the CFPB. She talked about how the big banks would hate the financial reforms she proposed. She said that the experts thought they would fail, and they won. She said, “We won, because you got in the fight…You called out sleazy lobbyists and powerful politicians.” Sen. Warren said that the CFPB is proof of how democracy can work in the 21st Century, “If we push back hard, we can win.” She added, “When we united our voices, we can win.”\n\nSen. Warren said, “We don’t win every time, but we are learning to win.” She added that we can’t win what we don’t fight for. Warren said that many corporations use their money and resources to capture Washington. She said that they want to tilt the rules in their favor and leave everyone else behind. She said a kid gets caught with pot and goes to jail while big banks launder drug money. She said, “The game is rigged, and it isn’t right.”\n\nWarren talked about how corporations rig the game with lobbyist and Republican friends in Congress. She talked about the special gifts that corporations get through trade deals that they can’t get in Congress. Warren said that trade deals are done in secret because if people knew about them, they would be opposed.\n\nShe said when conservatives talk about opportunity they mean the opportunity for the rich to get richer and the powerful to get more powerful. Warren said, “We can whine about it. We can whimper about it, or we can fight back. I’m ready to fight back. Sen. Warren said that this is a fight over values. Sen. Warren described the values fight using the same language as President Obama. The difference is the Republican value of I’ve got mine versus the American value of working together for all.\n\nSen. Warren said, We believe in science, and that means that we have a responsibility to protect the Earth and we will fight for it…We believe that no one should work full time and live in poverty. That means raising the minimum wage, and we will fight for it.” She mentioned fighting for student loan reform, protecting Social Security, Medicare, and pensions. Warren said, “We believe in equal pay for equal work, and we will fight for it.” She added, “We believe that corporations are not people, and women have a right to their bodies. We will overturn Hobby Lobby and we will fight for it.”\n\nFor some reason, Sen. Warren couldn’t muster the fire that we have seen in some of her other speeches, but she was solid in expressing the values of the Democratic Party. Warren seemed to be in a hurry. She repeatedly stopped the audience from delaying her remarked with prolonged cheers. That was what was so striking about her speech. Many of the attendees at Netroots, who dislike Obama and love Warren didn’t seem to notice that she uses much of the same language as the president. There isn’t much difference positionally between Warren and Hillary, with the exception that Clinton has a moderate brand, and Warren is known for being more to the left.\n\nSen. Warren isn’t going to run for president, but she has become the soul of the Democratic effort to keep the Senate in 2014. She represents the rise of women in the Democratic Party. She isn’t afraid to take on Mitch McConnell and the Republican. Her speech at Netroots demonstrated the refinement of her strategy and voice as she is becoming a national force for Democratic and liberal values.\n\nIf you’re ready to read more from the unbossed and unbought Politicus team, sign up for our newsletter here!

  "latent_7856": "Following two months of meetings and discussions with the Board of Dundee United, we (the Board of Arab TRUST and the Committee of the Federation of DUSC) feel that we now must update our members.\n\nIt is with regret that we have to make such a statement. However, we feel that following the discussions held we have no other option and it is our duty to do so as shareholders in the club and as elected members of the committees of fans representative bodies.\n\nDespite numerous meetings between 15th January and 26th March with members of the Board of DUFC, the General Manager and the First Team Manager, we remain worried as to how our club is being managed.\n\nAn initial meeting between the Committee of the Federation and Derek Robertson plus David Southern of DUFC was held on 15th January. At this, they informed the Committee of the need to cut costs at the club and indicated that season ticket prices/gate prices would have to rise in 2015/16.\n\nThe Federation stated at this meeting that given the \"feel-good factor\" at the club at that point they saw any season ticket price rise as being detrimental; however, if this was based on an overall cost management requirement for the club they would discuss the reasoning behind the proposed price increase, when available, with their members. David explained that the club were carrying out a cost management exercise to get the Club to a break even position, without relying on transfer income, by May 2016 with season ticket price rises forming part of this. Over a month later, the Chairman of DUFC announced in the local press that season ticket prices were to be frozen. Given the discussions, we were puzzled by this announcement.\n\nTwo weeks later, the DUFC AGM was held on 29th January where a number of questions were asked which the Board of DUFC could not answer. We were hugely unimpressed by this, particularly as none of the questions were particularly challenging, for example, how many signed players did the club have? Most worryingly, at the meeting Stephen Thompson stated that he would not allow any investment in the club that would take his personal shareholding below 51%.\n\nSubsequent to the AGM and the sale of two of our established first team players (Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven) on February 1st, and with the perceived disquiet of the fans around this sale given it was just a few weeks before our appearance in a major Cup Final, a meeting was arranged by the club for us to meet with Jackie McNamara, Derek Robertson and David Southern on 10th February. Although Jackie spoke very well and gave his vision for taking the club forward again, the meeting did not provide us with any comfort as to the overall management of the club.\n\nOn 3rd March, we received the following from Derek Robertson on behalf of the DUFC Board “I understand that both supporters groups wish clarity on various matters and the purpose of the meeting therefore is to provide you with an early opportunity to address any such issues directly with the Chairman and the Board.\n\n\"In order for you to get the most out of this meeting, and for us to provide the appropriate level of detail required, it would be helpful if you could forward me a list of priority questions before Friday.” It was then suggested by the club that a meeting could be held after the launch of the GA Engineering Arena on 6th March, unfortunately most of the members of our respective Boards and Committee were unavailable at that date. We therefore suggested a meeting shortly after this and submitted our questions to Stephen Thompson by letter on the afternoon of 6th March.\n\nWe finally received a written response to these on 24th March, after, disappointingly, having had to prompt the DUFC Board to provide a response to these on 20th March following unsuccessful communication regarding a meeting.\n\nIn the letter of 6th March, we submitted 22 questions, which can be grouped into the following topics: Thompson family shareholding/investment in the club, debt management, cost control, football strategy and remuneration. Despite a written response and a meeting with Stephen Thompson, Derek Robertson and David Southern on 26th March, a number of our questions remain unanswered. We are puzzled as to why this is the case, as we were clear we required a response to each question.\n\nAt the meeting on 26th March, we were told yet again that costs would be managed downwards. This is despite having been told the same story for a number of years and seeing no progress. In fact, the operating costs of DUFC have remained relatively consistent for the last seven years. As such, we remain sceptical as to whether any progress will be made in the current and future financial years without detriment to the playing side of the club. Positively, and contrary to the statement made at the AGM on 29th January, Stephen Thompson announced that he would now welcome investment in the club through wider share ownership. However, he was wary of a level of investment that would take the Thompson family shareholding below 75%.\n\nThere are three key points that we feel all Dundee United fans should be aware of:\n\n- Firstly, we were shocked to find out that a huge amount of ‘commission’ has been paid to unnamed parties from the sale of 4 players – Gauld, Robertson, Armstrong and Mackay-Steven. We believe this figure to be in excess of £500k. This does not include payments to players, agents or other clubs. When all of these various payments are totalled, over 25% of the £6.3m in fees received has not been kept in the club.\n\n- Secondly, despite the sales of the four players noted above, the Board of DUFC does not believe that this is yet sufficient to pay all current remaining debt.\n\n- Thirdly, the amount of investment in the club by the Thompson family is not £5m as has been widely reported. This includes payments of over £1m made to buy out previous shareholders and soft loans to the club, the latter of which have been steadily repaid in the last few years. The actual investment, as confirmed by Stephen Thompson, is nearer £3.5m. Of this, the Thompson family hold nearly 85,000 shares in the club, which are valued (as agreed by the club's auditors) at £33 a share. We believe that if the Thompson family were to sell their shares, they could recoup a significant proportion of the money they have invested.\n\nAt the meeting on 26th March, it was agreed that we would reconvene with the Board of DUFC in June to reflect on any progress made in improving the management of the club. At this future meeting it should become clear the scale of the operating loss which will be incurred in the current financial year.\n\nGiven the points above, we believe that changes are required as to how Dundee United is managed. We want our club to be successful and stable, both on and off the park. Both ArabTRUST and the Federation wish only the best for Dundee United; the club is deep within our hearts and we hope that by the time we formally meet again with the Board of DUFC that the necessary changes have been made to improve the management of the club and allow us in the future to prosper on the field.",

View Full Caption DNAinfo/Ed Komenda\n\nILLINOIS MEDICAL DISTRICT — From his hospital bed, Scott Jacobson has replayed the three sentences he remembers screaming at the driver of the beat-up SUV that tried to run him over Monday.\n\n“Why are you doing this?”\n\n“Why won’t you put on your brakes?”\n\n“You’re killing me.”\n\nSince Monday night, when emergency workers pulled the 47-year-old McKinley Park man and his 1970s Motobecane bicycle from underneath a 2000 Dodge Durango near 35th and Lowe, Jacobson has been in Stroger Hospital's intensive care unit.\n\nAround 11 a.m. Friday, nurses put fresh bandages on his hands and right shoulder. His road rash was so bad after the accident you could see muscle and bone.\n\nMetal pins and screws now hold together his pelvis, broken in three places when the Durango came to a stop, trapping Jacobson under the SUV’s oil pan.\n\n“It was really just very strange,” Jacobson said, feeling loopy from pain medication. “I keep hearing the line in my head, pleading with somebody to not run me over.”\n\nThe accident happened around 6 p.m. Monday. After dropping off his two sons at De La Salle for wrestling practice, Jacobson was riding home.\n\nRolling west down 35th Street, Jacobson watched 26-year-old Joshua Thomas, of Parkway Gardens, pull the black Durango to the side of the road. It looked like he was trying to park.\n\nJacobson tried to pass near Lowe, but the SUV “erratically” whipped on the road.\n\nThe Durango plowed into Jacobson.\n\n“My bicycle wedged under the back portion by the rear differential, and my body balled up and lifted the the front of the car up by the oil pan,” Jacobson said. “I had the full weight of the engine on top of my body.”\n\nJacobson screamed for Thomas to stop.\n\n“The car kept dragging me and dragging me and dragging me,” Jacobson said. “I thought I was dead.”\n\nThomas finally stopped the SUV in front of the firehouse at 35th and Lowe. All the yelling and screaming caught the attention of some nearby firefighters.\n\nBystanders ran to Jacobson, still pinned beneath the SUV’s oil pan.\n\n“Get this car off me,” Jacobson remembers saying. “Get it off me.”\n\nChicago firefighters help Scott Jacobson. [Submitted]\n\nFreed from the Durango, Jacobson felt the pain surge through his body, covered in blood and cuts. A tree branch even pierced his arm.\n\nPolice arrested Thomas, who now stands charged with reckless driving, making an improper U-turn and failing to be cautious around pedestrian in the roadway. He was released on bond Tuesday.\n\nThomas was also driving with a revoked license — a detail that makes Jacobson think the driver tried to run him over to get away.\n\n“It felt so personal,” Jacobson said. “I felt the insanity of someone doing something directly to me knowing that they were controlling that thing that was destroying me.”\n\nJoshua Thomas, 26, stands charged with reckless driving and driving on a revoked license . [Chicago Police]\n\nDoctors expect Jacobson to recover from his injuries within the next six months.\n\nFollowing the accident, Bridgeport residents launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for Jacobson’s medical treatment. As of Friday afternoon, the campaign has raised over $21,000.\n\nFor more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here:",

Anthony’s example made the point that $100 worth of bitcoin today may not equal the same amount tomorrow.\n\nAnd while the task force has no plans — at this time, at least — to enact regulations on digital currency, some members of the community are refreshed to see government officials seeking input from the public.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service recently took flak for releasing a federal income tax guidance in which it instructed taxpayers to declare their bitcoin holdings as property for federal tax purposes.

  "latent_8352": "ODESSA, Ukraine — In the Ukrainian tourist destination of Odessa, a port on the Black Sea, holidaymakers mingle with internally displaced people from the country’s war-torn east, local Roma, students, and economic migrants from Central Asia and the Caucasus, Africa and Asia.\n\nYet the air carries something less healthy than sea breezes: tuberculosis.\n\nOdessa has the highest rate of TB in Ukraine, with 110 cases per 100,000 people in 2016, and rising fast. Closely linked with migration, instability and poverty, controlling this airborne disease takes on additional urgency this year as Ukraine seeks to integrate into Europe thanks to a new visa-free regime. Part of a migration corridor from Central Asia and the Caucasus to Russia and Western Europe, Ukraine has at least 5 million citizens working abroad, according to its foreign ministry: in Poland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Russia and Germany. Another 1.5 million people have been internally displaced by the war in the east of the country.\n\n“Ukraine should pay special attention to TB because it’s a very sensitive topic for Europe” — Alexey Bobrik, World Health Organization’s technical officer\n\n“Ukraine should pay special attention to TB because it’s a very sensitive topic for Europe,” said Alexey Bobrik, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) technical officer for HIV, TB and viral hepatitis in Ukraine. “I’m talking about global security and transmission of TB through borders.”\n\nTuberculosis was largely wiped out in Western Europe in the early 20th century through treatment, improved health monitoring and awareness, and higher living standards. Since the Soviet Union collapsed the disease has returned with a vengeance in former Soviet states. Ukraine declared a TB epidemic in 1995.\n\nSince then, the country has received huge amounts of international aid to tackle TB and its twin epidemic, HIV. But weak political will and chronic distrust of the country’s corrupt health system has held back progress. While overall TB rates are gradually falling, in places like Odessa they continue to rise. More worryingly, Ukraine is one of the leading countries in the world for multi-drug resistant (MDR) forms of TB, which do not respond to traditional treatment.\n\nA quarter of newly diagnosed cases of TB in Ukraine in 2016 were MDR-TB, according to WHO. Cure rates for resistant forms are the lowest among all MDR-TB burden countries: 38 percent. In Odessa, where TB-HIV co-infection is rife, the overall TB cure rate last year was just 43 percent. “That basically shows you how effective the health system is here, which is a shame for a European country,” Bobrik said.\n\nUnchanged system\n\nUkraine’s TB system has changed little since Soviet times. It’s based on in-patient treatment lasting months or even years in TB clinics and sanatoriums, often located in once-beautiful historical buildings that are in disrepair and unsuited to modern infectious disease control and patient needs.\n\n“We can’t provide proper treatment conditions,” said Dr. Oksana Leonenko-Brodetskaya, who heads Odessa city’s TB clinic. It's housed in a peeling pink classical building in the city center. “We’ve no individual isolated wards, and no phasing system of existing wards, and so cross-infection occurs.”\n\nAccording to modern international standards, isolated in-patient treatment is not the answer to TB anyway — early and accurate diagnosis, early treatment and retention of patients on an ambulatory basis is. Most patients stop being infectious within days or weeks of starting treatment. In a country with no job or social security, and in a city like Odessa with a large migrant population, expecting patients to stay for months in poorly equipped hospitals is unrealistic, unnecessary and hugely expensive.\n\n\"Ukraine can’t afford it,” Bobrik said. “You can spend your funding on TB dispensaries and a lot of health workers who sit in these dispensaries and don’t go to patients. Or instead of that, you can create an out-patient model.”\n\nRetaining out-patients requires a change of approach. More than 20 percent of newly diagnosed patients in Odessa in 2016 were migrants and non-residents of the city. Many — although far from all — are among the most disadvantaged members of society: the homeless, drug users, former prisoners. The stigma around TB is another reason patients try not to be associated with TB treatment centers.\n\n“They all try to disappear,” Leonenko-Brodetskaya said of her patients, claiming many register with false addresses and fall off the grid as soon as they start to feel better.\n\nEveryone concerned with TB in Odessa speaks about a taxi driver or a market trader still working with active TB and a fake health certificate, because they can’t afford to stop. The stories may be apocryphal but Maria Kochetova, who spent three months in a TB ward earlier this year, recalled patients there who stopped taking medication, checked out early or simply disappeared. Even among patients, there’s an instinct to blame other patients for spread of the disease.\n\nKochetova also recalled several patients dying of a disease which, if caught early enough, should be treatable. Kochetova’s doctors didn’t expect her to survive either. The 34-year-old called an ambulance only after weeks of what she told herself was flu. She’d never considered herself at risk from TB: She wasn’t homeless; she didn’t use drugs; she had a regular job as a cleaner.\n\nDoctors told her it started with an earlier bout of pneumonia she’d left untreated because she couldn’t afford it.\n\n“It’d cost money if I ended up in hospital,” she said. “I’m not the only one who does this; everyone keeps going until they fall down because they know hospital is so expensive.”\n\n'Free' treatment\n\nUkrainian health care is theoretically free. In practice, patients pay for services and medication through an entrenched system of kickbacks to medical staff trying to supplement painfully low salaries. Kochetova was fortunate that once she did end up in hospital, her active TB was diagnosed within three days instead of three weeks, and TB treatment is genuinely free. But during those three days, she says she had to pay more than 1,000 Ukrainian hryvnia (€33) for various services — that’s two weeks' wages for a junior medical worker.\n\n“They fleece you for everything,” she said.\n\nNon-hospitalized patients have to make daily trips to clinics to get medicines, which are supposed to be taken under observation to ensure patients complete treatment courses of up to two years for MDR-TB. Failure to complete courses leads not just to further illness but to more development of drug-resistant forms. The daily travel is onerous, especially for those with no income or fixed living place, or from rural areas.\n\nPrograms run by state clinics and nongovernment organizations in Odessa provide a solution: psycho-social support and incentives for patients to adhere to treatment by bringing medicines to their homes and providing other aid such as food parcels, bus tickets or mobile phone credit. Odessa city has also tried to incentivize medical staff. Under a pioneer bonus system to boost primary care diagnosis rates, family GPs receive 2,000 hryvnia (€66) for every fast, accurate TB diagnosis and referral. Last year, city authorities paid 200 bonuses from the 1,113 newly diagnosed cases.\n\nIn future, the city wants to keep TB treatment and monitoring within the ambulatory primary health care system, with bonuses for medical staff based on successful treatment outcomes.\n\nThese innovations are in line with overall Ukraine health reforms now in legislative limbo. These would change the old Soviet centralized model of funding institutions based on number of staff and hospital beds irrespective of numbers of patients and their needs, to patient-centered, results-based funding. Regions would have more autonomy to allocate funds to primary medicine, and to NGOs to provide services. The reforms should make most key health services genuinely free for patients.\n\nAlthough backed by the EU and by international agencies that have largely underwritten Ukraine’s TB and HIV programming, parliament shelved the draft financing laws until the fall, and there is widespread opposition. In Odessa’s medical community, the reforms are surrounded by doubt and rumor, from fears they will cut jobs, to accusations that their real purpose is to sell off valuable real estate now used as clinics.\n\nExamples from other post-Soviet and eastern bloc countries show that the transition to a new model is indeed painful, but can be achieved. With the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria — Ukraine’s main health donor funding the majority of HIV and TB response — due to pull out of the region in 2020, Ukraine has little time left to find a domestic answer to its epidemics and its failing health system.\n\n“For Eastern Europe it’s a particularly acute issue,” said Michel Kazatchkine, former director of the Global Fund. “Increasing epidemics, low coverage with treatment and prevention, no readiness and in some cases no willingness to pay for services for vulnerable people … nothing is ready.”\n\nIn his current role as U.N. special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Kazatchkine is lobbying for health reform in Ukraine to ease the transition once external funding stops.\n\n“I would be less pessimistic than I was a year-and-a-half ago because I see changes. I’m seeing more political commitment,” he said. “AIDS and TB are on the agenda.”",

The first true USA Ultimate rankings will be released next Wednesday. There is a lot of season left and many of these results will start to settle in after Stanford Invite and Tally Classic this weekend.\n\nStill, there are some eye-popping results in this first look. The Northwest is currently sitting with four bids, thanks to a strong performance from Victoria at the Santa Barbara Invite and even better results from Oregon, Washington, and UBC at SBI and Presidents’ Day Invite. The South Central has three bids, but Texas is sitting all the way back at #28. Right now, the region is relying on the undefeated #19 TCU to haul in that third bid.\n\nAnd the Southeast, which pulled down four bids last year, is currently staring at only two, with 2015 powerhouses Central Florida and FSU sitting at #47 and #50, respectively. And, once again, the Southwest is painfully close to two bids, but UCSB is sitting just outside the cutoff at #20 and Cal Poly SLO not far behind them at #24.\n\nIt goes without saying that this weekend’s tournaments — particularly the Stanford Invite — will have a huge impact on the rankings. The Southwest could really help themselves; they have a realistic shot at three bids. The South Central also could be in for a big year. If TCU stays hot and #21 Arkansas or Texas gets some big wins, they will climb the ladder. And don’t forget: Missouri hasn’t played any games yet but are ranked in the Ultiworld Top 25.\n\nFinally, can the Southeast climb out of the hole? It’s a long road back for FSU and UCF. Both teams will have a chance to chip into their deficit with strong results this weekend on opposite coasts.\n\nWomen’s Division\n\nThe rankings below include teams with at least one sanctioned game. We used a lower cutoff to more appropriately rank Whitman, who blew out so many teams at their first and only tournament that they did not meet the five game cutoff. The rest of the rankings are largely unchanged using n=1 or n=5.\n\nRank Team Region Rating #1 Central Florida SE 2775.51 #2 Stanford SW 2499.45 #3 Oregon NW 2407.91 #4 UCLA SW 2398.98 #5 Whitman NW 2398.96 #6 Minnesota NC 2331.80 #7 Pittsburgh OV 2297.74 #8 Michigan GL 2200.13 #9 Ohio State OV 2155.74 #10 Washington NW 2150.00 #11 Virginia AC 2149.45 #12 Notre Dame GL 2118.09 #13 California SW 2094.87 #14 Wisconsin NC 2038.86 #15 Colorado College SC 2036.63 #16 Colorado SC 2029.40 #17 California-Davis SW 2025.06 #18 Tufts NE 2010.54 #19 Western Washington NW 2007.34 #20 California-San Diego SW 2002.26 #21 Maryland AC 2000.01 #22 Southern California SW 1987.20 #23 North Carolina AC 1979.75 #24 Texas SC 1974.41 #25 Penn State OV 1944.21 #26 Florida State SE 1901.62 #27 Northeastern NE 1884.72 #28 North Carolina-Wilmington AC 1872.54 #29 Kansas SC 1824.76 #30 Liberty AC 1808.89 #31 Clemson AC 1793.43 #32 Victoria NW 1760.72 #33 Dartmouth NE 1742.79 #34 Delaware AC 1739.58 #35 Georgia Tech SE 1713.18 #36 Florida SE 1684.26 #37 Northwestern GL 1638.35 #38 Carleton College NC 1620.79 #39 Colorado State SC 1618.18 #40 James Madison AC 1576.19 #41 MIT NE 1566.80 #42 Case Western Reserve OV 1541.23 #43 Washington University SC 1530.19 #44 Auburn SE 1528.96 #45 Cal Poly-SLO SW 1519.21 #46 Akron OV 1492.29 #47 Georgia SE 1481.68 #48 Iowa NC 1425.86 #49 Georgetown AC 1425.77 #50 Pennsylvania OV 1411.15\n\nImplied Bid Allocation\n\nAtlantic Coast: 1 bid\n\nGreat Lakes: 2 bids\n\nMetro East: 1 bid\n\nNew England: 1 bid\n\nNorth Central: 2 bids\n\nNorthwest: 4 bids\n\nOhio Valley: 2 bids\n\nSouth Central: 2 bids\n\nSoutheast: 1 bids\n\nSouthwest: 4 bids\n\nDiscussion\n\nObviously, these rankings are early and approximated, and while they’ll give us a pretty good idea of what the picture is, the exact details might move a little. As more results come in, especially connective results that Centex, Stanford Invite, and Northwest Challenge provide, that will change the rankings, as will the decay function for January and February results.\n\nAnother big change to the rankings? The addition of British Columbia. Having not yet played, with their planned debut at the Stanford Invite likely to be impacted by weather, UBC will surely shove some teams down. That also means the Northwest’s four bids could move back up to five, as it was last season, although Western Washington is pretty close to the bubble as is.\n\nThe big winner is clearly the Southwest, who has wrangled four bids early on, with two teams positioned within striking distance of yet another bid! UCLA and Stanford have done as expected, but Cal and UC-Davis clock in at #13 and #17, respectively, a major coup for the region and a return to form for the once-mighty Southwest. Centex looms large for the second tier teams.\n\nA region to watch could be the Atlantic Coast. While they sit with only a single bid at this point, they have three other top 30 D-I teams and a few just beyond that. Maryland, North Carolina, and UNC-Wilmington don’t have a ton of other opportunities to impress and will need to make use of what chances they do have.\n\nThere are also a couple of potential big movers and shakers to keep an eye on. Dartmouth’s weak QCTU has them in a hole, but they could make up a lot of ground with a strong Northwest Challenge. Kansas has also had a slow start, but could make waves if they win Centex again. QCTU also hurt Carleton, but the legacy program has Stanford and Northwest Challenge on the docket and chances to earn back a lot of the points they’ve ceded.",
  "latent_8680": "Jérôme Jean Louis Marie Lejeune (13 June 1926 – 3 April 1994) was a French pediatrician and geneticist, best known for discovering the link of diseases to chromosome abnormalities and for his subsequent opposition to prenatal diagnosis and abortion.[1]\n\nBiography [ edit ]\n\nDiscovering trisomy 21 [ edit ]\n\nIn 1958, while working in Raymond Turpin’s laboratory with Marthe Gautier, Jérôme Lejeune reported that he had discovered that Down syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. According to Lejeune's laboratory notebooks he made the observation demonstrating the link on 22 May 1958. The discovery was published by the French Academy of Sciences with Lejeune as first author, Gautier as second author and Turpin as senior author.[2] In 2009 co-author Gautier claimed that the discovery was based on fibroblast tissue samples that she had prepared and noticed the discrepancy in chromosome count on.[3] This discovery was the first time that a defect in intellectual development was shown to be linked to chromosomal abnormalities.[4][5]\n\nOrigins of the discovery [ edit ]\n\nIn the early 1950s, Lejeune joined the department headed by Turpin, who suggested that Lejeune focus his research on the causes of Down syndrome. As early as 1953, the two men showed a connection between an individual’s characteristics and his or her dermatoglyphs–the fingerprints and lines on the hand. The structure of these lines, which remain the same throughout the individual's life, is determined during the earliest stages of embryo development. As Lejeune and Turpin studied the hands of children with Down syndrome, they deduced that their dermatoglyphic anomalies appeared during embryo formation. After making many more observations, Lejeune concluded that the anomalies resulted from a chromosomal accident. Using a new tissue culture technique brought back from the United States by his colleague Marthe Gautier, Lejeune began working with her to count the number of chromosomes in children with Down syndrome.\n\nThe laboratory notebook begun by Lejeune on 10 July 1957 indicates that on 22 May 1958 he succeeded in showing, for the first time, the presence of 47 chromosomes in a child with Down syndrome. This was two years after Tjio and Levan had proven that the human species has 46 chromosomes. On 13 June 1958, Lejeune identified an additional case, and a photo of the karyotype met with skeptical interest at the International Congress of Genetics in Montreal. The international community did not grasp the full impact of his discovery until 26 January 1959, when the French Academy of Sciences published the team’s first paper presenting three case studies of children with Down syndrome.[2]\n\nOn 16 March 1959, another presentation to the Academy of Sciences confirmed the team's initial publication, this time covering nine cases. In April 1959, the English team of Brown and Jacobs corroborated these results, citing the initial January 1959 publication by Lejeune, Gautier, and Turpin. “Mongolism” had become trisomy 21. The discovery opened up a new field of investigation for modern genetics and laid the foundation for a new discipline: cytogenetics.\n\nGautier disputes his claim as the first discoverer of trisomy 21.[6] She has stated in interviews and in a 2009 article in the journal Médecine Sciences that she worked without assistance from Lejeune to develop the necessary cytological and histological resources and techniques, and used these to prepare microscope slides showing the trisomy. By her account, Lejeune took her slides away under the pretence of having them photographed for her, but instead presented them as his own work at a conference and in a subsequent publication.[6][7][8] From the available published evidence it is clear that both Lejeune and Gautier contributed significantly to the discovery, but it remains unclear who was first.[9][10] In a personal letter from 5 November 1958 to Gautier, Lejeune wrote appreciatively about 'your preparations' that were instrumental to the discovery,[6] and Gautier appeared as co-author on two seminal papers: one on the discovery of trisomy 21[2] and a second one about the cell culture techniques that Gautier had learned during a scholarship (1955–1956) at Harvard, Boston which made the discovery possible.[11]\n\nLater research and recognition [ edit ]\n\nContinuing his work in genetics, Lejeune described several other diseases related to chromosomal abnormalities. In 1963 he identified Cri du Chat syndrome, caused by a missing segment in the short arm of chromosome 5, and in 1966 he described 18q-Syndrome, which results from loss of the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 18. Lejeune also discovered the Dr phenotype (a malformation syndrome in which a ring-shaped chromosome replaces chromosome 13), and he identified trisomies on chromosome 9 in 1970 and chromosome 8 in 1971.\n\nIn a 1963 presentation before the French Academy of Sciences, Lejeune showed that monosomy—the absence of a specific segment of the genome—could also result in a clinically recognizable disease. Several years later, a group of American scientists came to Paris to conduct an independent investigation of Lejeune’s discovery, and in 1962 the President of the United States personally presented him with the Kennedy Prize. In 1964, the first chair of human genetics was created at the Paris School of Medicine, and Lejeune was named to fill it. The appointment was highly unusual: Only a groundbreaking discovery allowed a candidate to be named a professor of medicine without successfully completing a competitive residency examination.\n\nIn 1969, Lejeune's work earned him the William Allan Award, granted by the American Society of Human Genetics, the world’s highest honor in genetics[citation needed]. As of 2013 he was the only Frenchman to have won it.[12]\n\nPro-life work [ edit ]\n\nAlthough Lejeune’s discoveries paved the way for new therapeutic research into how changes in gene copy number could cause disease, they also led to the development of prenatal diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities and thence to abortions of affected pregnancies. This was very distressing to Lejeune, a devout Catholic, and led him to begin his fight for the pro-life cause.\n\nLejeune opposed the authorization in 1967 for women to use contraception as well as the Peyret laws in 1970 to render legal the interruption of pregnancy in case of fetal abnormalities. He also opposed the Veil Law (\"Loi Veil\" 1975) authorizing voluntary interruption of pregnancy.[13][14]\n\nAfter receiving the Allan prize, Lejeune gave a talk to his colleagues which concluded by explicitly questioning the morality of abortion, an unpopular viewpoint in the profession. In a letter to his wife, Lejeune wrote \"today, I lost my Nobel prize in Medicine\".[citation needed]\n\nIn 1975, after one of his public appearances in Paris on the beginning of life, Lejeune met Wanda Poltawska, director of the Catholic Institute for the Family in Krakow. Later that year, Poltawska contacted Lejeune twice, asking him to speak at conferences on the beginning of life that she was organizing with one of her close friends, Monsignor Karol Wojtyla, then Cardinal-Archbishop of Krakow. On 16 October 1978 Wojtyla was elected Pope John Paul II.\n\nAfterward, Lejeune regularly traveled to Rome to meet with the Pope, to attend meetings of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and to participate in other church events, such as the 1987 Synod of Bishops. The Pope wanted to name Lejeune as the president of a new pontifical academy that was dear to his heart: the Pontifical Academy for Life.[15] Lejeune painstakingly drafted its bylaws and the oath of the Servants of Life that each member of the Academy must take.\n\nLejeune was diagnosed with lung cancer in November 1993. He served as president of the Academy for only a few weeks before his death in April 1994.\n\nA few years later, during his visit to Paris for World Youth Day 1997, John Paul II visited Lejeune’s grave in Châlo-Saint-Mars. Lejeune has been named \"Servant of God\" by the Catholic Church, and his cause for sainthood is being postulated by the Abbey of Saint Wandrille in France.\n\nHonors, awards and credentials [ edit ]\n\nJérôme Lejeune received many distinctions during his lifetime. He was a member of:\n\nLejeune held honorary doctorates from:\n\nHis international positions included:\n\nConsulting expert on human genetics (1962)\n\nInternational Commission on Radiological Protection\n\nCommittee member (1963)\n\nUnited Nations French expert to the Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation\n\nBibliography [ edit ]",

This may be related to its Pokédex entries, several of which mention Bronzong's natural power to summon rain clouds.\n\nOrigin\n\nBronzong is based on a dōtaku, Japanese bells which were believed to have been used to pray for good harvests. They are often decorated with patterns representing nature and were buried, occasionally with bronze mirrors and weapons, in isolated locations. Bronzong and the fact that it evolves from Bronzor also seems to be based on an old Japanese myth present in the book Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things by Lafcadio Hearn. The priests of Mugenyama wanted to forge a bell for their temple, so they asked the local women to donate their bronze mirrors for this purpose. A woman contributed her mirror, but later regretted it. Because of her repentance, the mirror wouldn't melt in the furnace until she killed herself. Before her suicide, she said that whoever would break the bell would be given great wealth by her ghost. A multitude of people tried to break the bell by ringing it furiously, so the tired priests managed to roll it down a hill into a swamp.

  "latent_9144": "Barry Mattacott, marketing director at security specialist Wick Hill Group, looks at the security risks of linking more and more smart devices to our networks. Are we just creating ever more vulnerable endpoints in today’s world of the Internet of Things?\n\nBack in the good old days, we nailed the front door up tight with a firewall and we knew, that with good security on our gateway, our network was safe from the nasties of the outside world. But those pesky kids in their bedrooms, not to mention state sponsored cybercriminals, worked out that they could circumnavigate our state-of- the-art firewall by looking for a way in at the opposite end of our network - the endpoint.\n\nBarry Mattacott, marketing director Wick Hill\n\nSo now we all agree that securing the endpoint is essential, but just where is it and what does it look like?\n\nSince those early days, there has been a massive proliferation of endpoints and security issues have grown alongside them. You can't go anywhere or do anything without risking an infection.\n\nA recent survey found that almost two thirds of USB sticks that were lost/found on public transport were infected with malware. I guess this raises several issues. Definitely, don't plug any old USB stick you find into your computer - that's how Stuxnet got its start in life after all. The survey also begs the question, of why so many of these USB sticks are infected. Could it be that people are deliberately infecting USBs and \"losing\" them?\n\nInfected USBs can today be considered a fairly traditional attack vector, along with code attached to downloaded files and drive-bys leaping out of infected websites to get you. The security industry has made a pile of cash developing products to protect us and it's all fairly much in hand.\n\nBut now we have a game changer because endpoints aren’t the same as they were. Firstly, we had the revolution that was the mobile endpoint. Mobile phones and tablets are now huge players on our networks. They have effectively put network endpoints in our pockets and allowed us to take them down the pub and lose them.\n\nThe technology to protect them has been available for some time, but the adoption has been woefully slow. You would have thought US Federal Agencies would be right on top of it, but a 2015 survey found 61 percent of agencies do not apply their network security policies to mobile devices!\n\nSo what does the future hold for the endpoint? Without doubt, the Internet of Things (IoT) means they are going to be everywhere! Network attached security systems that give you video pictures of your front door and allow callers to leave recorded messages, are essentially connecting your door bell to your main processor (home PC). Your Hive controlled heating system is connecting you to the Internet.\n\nDespite these being serious systems, many have arrived on our networks and in our homes with gaping holes in their security. British Gas took a thrashing in the national press when their control system was found to be a burglar's dream, easily allowing access to the heating schedule, which could tell them if the owner was at home, or even if they were away for an extended period of time.\n\nEven cars have become endpoints. Until recently they were fairly much self-contained. Yes, they communicated with the Internet and manufacturers’ control networks and as such they were hackable. We saw hackers demonstrate that they could take control of a Jeep and run it off the road. This triggered a recall of 1.4 million cars by Chrysler in order to patch the operating system. But they were somebody else's problem in that they didn't communicate with your network, so were not one of your endpoints.\n\nBut car manufacturers, including Ford, are developing on-board systems to allow you to carry out vital activities like turning on your smart kettle whilst on the road. This requires them to connect via the Internet to your own network.\n\nOn the one hand, that kettle might be ever so smart in that it carries significantly more processing power than the 64 Kb memory operating at 0.043 MHz in the Apollo guidance system that put man on the moon. On the other hand, it's not smart enough to be fully secured against man-in-the-middle attacks that will allow a hacker to penetrate your network. And once they are in, will they be able to access your car sitting in the driveway and steal it? It doesn't really matter how secure Ford makes your car, if your kettle is going to leave the door open.\n\nWhy? Why is it that the Internet of Things is so woefully behind the curve regarding security?\n\nTo start with, your average kettle manufacturer doesn't have a great pedigree in network security. They might make an awesomely efficient kettle but in the current climate they will find it difficult to find and employ a suitable security expert. They are also in a rush. They have just come up with the world saving idea of adding internet connectivity to your kettle, so obviously they are in a huge rush to get it to market before everyone else thinks of it and beats them to it. And of course, functionality will always beat security. No one wants to go through multi-factor authentication every time they want a cup of tea.\n\nSo what can you do about it? Purchase (and attach to your network) with care. When it comes to the Internet of Things, you are putting your trust in the hands of others. There is little that you personally can do to ensure that your TV, kettle, car, fridge, etc., etc. is secure. One piece of advice is to look out for names that you feel you can trust with security.\n\nManufacturers are starting to come up with solutions for these gaping security holes. Gemalto, for example, is emerging as a front runner in the field of IoT security. They have hardware modules, platforms and service solutions that allow you to connect and protect any machine-to-machine or electronic consumer device. They are currently working with all sorts of OEMs, mobile network operators and industrial manufacturers in various markets. http://www.gemalto.com/iot\n\nBarracuda Networks felt the need to bring out a brand new range of products designed to protect the Internet of Things and Machine to Machine connectivity. Their S Series currently includes Barracuda NextGen Firewall Secure Connector 1 (SC1) and the Barracuda NextGen Secure Access Concentrator (SAC). These two appliances will make it a lot easier and infinitely more secure for enterprises to benefit from and roll-out largescale deployments of devices like Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), point-of-sale kiosks, wind power stations and networked industrial machines in remote locations. https://www.barracuda.com/products/nextgenfirewall-s\n\nAnother well-known name in security, Kaspersky Lab, is making a move in the automotive space and is currently in talks with most of the world’s car manufacturers, particularly around the area of securing self-driving cars. They are looking to secure not only the industrial controls of the production process but also the connected car.\n\nKaspersky Lab is coming at this from a great place as they are already involved in protecting Ferrari. Aside from the usual endpoint protection they also integrate with existing complex infrastructure, including industrial technologies and mobile devices. In future, if your car is protected by Kaspersky, then you can probably be pretty sure your kettle can’t steal it! http://www.techworld.com/news/startups/kaspersky-looks-secure-self-driving-cars-factories-theyre-made-in-3615206/\n\nYou can also do some research on good old Google. Thinking about stuffing a EZCast Streamer in your TV’s USB port? A quick check online will find a recent report from Check Point which revealed that the wi-fi network the EZCast sets up, can easily be breached, allowing the attacker access to your main network, where they can wreak havoc or steal confidential data. So don't be in a rush to buy. And check it out before you do. http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/EZCast_Report_Check_Point.pdf\n\nOne important thing to check is whether the firmware on the product you are buying can be updated. Users of SimpliSafe wireless home alarm systems recently found out that the system is stupidly easy to hack with basic sniffing equipment, allowing its PIN to be grabbed from 30 metres away. But to really rub salt into the wounds, the hardware apparently cannot be patched or updated to overcome the vulnerability, which leaves owners with no choice but to junk their system. http://thehackernews.com/2016/02/hack-home-security-alarm.html\n\nSo what’s the best tactic if you don’t want to fall victim to security weaknesses in your clever consumer devices, intelligent cars and machine-to-machine equipment which makeup the Internet of Things? The best advice would be to try and resist the frivolous items like kettles and door bells and stick to things made by reputable manufacturers, preferably ones that have some sort of pedigree in networking.\n\nENDS\n\nAbout the author\n\nBarry Mattacott is marketing director of Wick Hill Group, which is based in Woking, Surrey and Hamburg Germany.

Two months later, the new White House pick tweeted a National Journal article about Trump endorsing Newt Gingrich in the 2012 race: “Odd guy. So smart with no judgment.”\n\nThe deleted tweets were spotted by freelance journalist Josh Billinson, who Scaramucci briefly blocked.\n\n“I'm just shocked he hadn't deleted them earlier,” Billinson told The Daily Beast. “That he could've been in the running for communications director and not even thought to check what he had publicly said about Trump in the past is wild to me.”\n\nIn December 2015, Scaramucci attacked Trump's call for a border wall between Mexico and the U.S.\n\n\"Walls don't work. Never have never will. The Berlin Wall 1961-1989 don't fall for it,\" he tweeted, above a picture of the wall.\n\nScaramucci, a Wall Street millionaire, also donated to Obama and Clinton's presidential campaigns. Scaramucci gave $5,600 to Obama in 2008 and $4,600 to Clinton in 2007. (Scaramucci wrote in November 2011 that he voted for Obama and Bill Clinton.)\n\nAhead of the 2016 election, Scaramucci said he hoped Clinton would be the next president.\n\n“I hope she runs [in 2016], she is incredibly competent,” he tweeted in April 2012, adding she was \"the real deal.\"\n\n“I like Hillary,\" he also tweeted. \"Have to go with the best athlete. We need to turn this around.” Another tweet said a “Hillary run makes everyone better.”\n\nHe responded to a tweet from Vanity Fair asking “When did Hillary Clinton Become the Coolest Person on the Planet?” by writing: “When she stopped caring about her image.”\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

As soon as Scaramucci was named, Sean Spicer quit as White House communications director.\n\nA month after his critical tweets, Scaramucci citing robocalls Trump made for the Romney campaign.\n\n“Kudos to The Donald for making Gov Romney's journey to the 45th Presidency a touch easier. His support has been invaluable,” he tweeted in March 2012.\n\nScaramucci endorsed Scott Walker and then Jeb Bush before joining the Trump Finance Committee in May 2016.\n\nThe new comms director tweeted that Bush “will make a great president” in 2015.\n\n— Joanna Purpich contributed to this report.",

Really.”\n\nClinton, in the best preview yet of her campaign’s general election strategy, also unleashed on the presumptive Republican nominee for his charged rhetoric.\n\n“We need a president who will use the bully pulpit to stand up for working families. But the last thing we need is a bully in the pulpit,” Clinton said to big applause.\n\nClinton frequently slams Trump on his immigration proposals and repeated much of her line of attack against him on Monday.\n\n“What kind of country would we be if we let Donald Trump rip our families apart? We have to reject this wrong vision for America with a strong, clear voice,” Clinton told the labor group, which endorsed her last year.\n\nClinton said that Trump’s plan to deport more than 11 million undocumented immigrants would not only affect union families, but also the many Latinos she’s met across the country who are concerned about what a Trump presidency could mean for them.\n\nShe specifically mentioned her meeting with a young Latina girl named Karla Ortiz, whose parents are at risk for deportation. In February, Ortiz tearfully told Clinton about her situation. Clinton promised to do everything she could to protect the girl’s parents and told her: “Let me do the worrying.”\n\nThe Clinton campaign turned the poignant moment into an ad ahead of the Nevada caucuses.\n\nIf elected, the former secretary of state has promised to build on President Obama’s executive actions and introduce comprehensive immigration reform during her first 100 days in office.\n\nOn Monday, Clinton also hit Trump for saying wages are “too high” in America. If he traveled the country talking to voters the way she did, Clinton argued, “maybe he would finally open his ears and listen to what working people everywhere are saying, that America needs a raise.”\n\nAfter calling Trump out on several other issues, including paid family leave, Clinton emphasized the need for unity in her own party.\n\nAs she continues to battle Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in upcoming primary states like California and New Jersey, she made her ultimate objective clear: “We are going to unify the Democratic Party and stop Donald Trump!”",
  "latent_10189": "Photo by Clarissa Wei\n\nQ in downtown Los Angeles is the city's newest sushi bar. It's an omakase-only joint-- which means you pay the fee and for the rest of the dinner, you trust the chef that he'll be serving you only the best.\n\nThe food starts at $165 per person, so it won't become a regular part of anyone's restaurant rotation. But, while there are plenty of other high-end, exorbitantly priced sushi bars, (Urasawa in Beverly Hills, for example, cinches the title for the second most expensive restaurant in the United States) Q distinguishes itself for being one of the few places out there serving Edomae-style sushi. It's a style that originates from the Edo period, where simplicity was paramount.\n\nA history lesson:\n\nWhat we commonly know as raw fish over rice is actually fairly recent even to the Japanese culture. Sushi, which means sour in Japanese, was initially a way to preserve and ferment fish. No raw fish was involved. The protein would be stuffed with salt, stored, weighed down by a stone and left to dry for six months. It started out in Southeast Asia along the Mekong River, spread up China to Yunnan, and then made its way up to Japan.\n\nRice was then added in the process, but the makers would discard it after the fermentation period was over. Soon vinegar was introduced into the mix, and it wasn't until the Edo period in the 18th century that what we now know as sushi -- raw fish over rice -- was invented.\n\nIt was initially a fast food item, meant to be eaten quickly, as refrigeration wasn't readily available back then. According to Yoko Isassi, a Japanese food historian and cooking class teacher in Los Angeles, it was primarily because of the constant building fires in the Edo period. \"Because of the fires, there was always construction,\" she said. \"To feed those construction workers, there were many food stalls on the street. Soba, tempura, and sushi, or what we call Edomae-sushi, were the popular selections on the street.\"\n\nAs time progressed and as refrigeration became more prolific, so did the sushi. Today, colorful rolls dotted with various hues of mayonnaise and hot sauces grace our sushi counters.\n\nOtoro no Tataki from Spain\n\nThere are few traditionalists, even in Japan. Chef Hiroyuki Naruke, who owned a six-seat Tokyo restaurant, was one of few -- known for his Edomae-style preparation methods. \"Although Edomae nowadays can mean just a slice of raw fish with rice, Edomae-style sushi chefs have more pride to serve the best of the best,\" Isassi said.\n\nNaruke was discovered by sushi enthusiasts from the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. They fished him (pun intended) out of Tokyo to Los Angeles following the 2011 tsunami and fears of contaminated fish. As of December, he's now here in downtown Los Angeles at an intimate 26-seat space restaurant. Q, named after Quinn, is all about preserving the purity of Edomae-style sushi.\n\nFor example, Naruke is adamant on using red vinegar for his rice. \"Red vinegar was the more common vinegar back then,\" Isassi explained, \"It's tinted just a little bit so it won't color the rice much.\n\nHe adds a pinch of salt and unlike other joints, forgoes the use of sugar, \"Edomae-style doesn't use much sugar at all,\" Isassi said. \"It's all about balance of rice, vinegar and salt. Some chefs claim that rice was naturally sweeter in old days and therefore there was no need to use sugar.\"\n\nThere are also certain fish preparation techniques unique to Edomae sushi chefs.\n\n\"They used seasonal fish that was caught in the Tokyo Bay area,\" she said. \"Eel is cut from the back as opposed to belly side which was common in Kansai, Kyoto, and Osaka area. Tokyo, or Edo, was a samurai society and cutting the belly was a taboo. There are popular clams in Edomae, but those are prohibited from being exported to the States. Some curing or cooking was actually done to most of the fishes as there were no refrigerator back then.\"\n\nQ imports its fish from around the world, though their uni comes from San Diego, and abalone is sourced from Santa Barbara. During one sitting, we had three dishes from Spain, red snapper from New Zealand, and geoduck and aoyagi (a yellow round clam) from Boston. A typically meal runs 20 courses long. Wasabi isn't just handed to you; it's carefully glazed on top. Some bites come brushed with a hint of miso and others, a delicate soy sauce. You're expected to eat the pieces in one bite. The entire process is remarkably simplistic and if you pay close attention -- invaluably educational.\n\n521 W 7th Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90014.\n\nAnago | Photo by Clarissa Wei\n\nKohada (marinated gizzard shard) | Photo by Clarissa Wei\n\nUni from San Diego | Photo by Clarissa Wei\n\nAkami zuke from Spain | Photo by Clarissa Wei\n\nChutoro from Spain | Photo by Clarissa Wei\n\nHirame Kobujime from South Korea | Photo by Clarissa Wei",
  "latent_10317": "A new study finds that if the racial wealth divide is left unaddressed, the median wealth for black Americans will fall to $0 by 2053, with Latino Americans reaching the same median wealth two decades later.\n\nAccording to the report by the Institute for Policy Studies and Prosperity Now, the wealth gap between people of color and their white counterparts is showing no sign of narrowing in the coming years—even as racial demographics in the U.S. are rapidly shifting, with people of color projected to make up the majority of the population by 2043.\n\nIn the next three years, black households are projected to lose 18 percent of their median net worth, while white families are expected to gain about three percent more wealth.\n\nThe report, \"The Road to Zero-Wealth,\" defines middle-class wealth as a household net worth of $68,000 to $204,000, and notes the disconnect between income and wealth: a median income for one's racial background does not guarantee entry into the middle-class.\n\n\"White households in the middle income quintile—those earning $37,201-61,328 annually—own nearly eight times as much wealth ($86,100) as Black middle-income earners ($11,000) and ten times that of their Latino counterparts ($8,600),\" write the authors.\n\nBlack Americans are also unable to accumulate middle class wealth even with high levels of education:\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts\n\nIf we consider educational attainment—often considered as the \"great equalizer\" between the rich and the poor and between families of different racial and ethnic backgrounds—White families whose head of household holds a high school diploma have nearly enough wealth ($64,200) to be considered middle class. A typical Black or Latino family whose head of household has a college degree however, owns just $37,600 and $32,600, respectively, in wealth.\n\nIn addition to impact of income inequality on individual families, the racial wealth gap has increasingly dire implications for the overall economy if, as the authors project, the majority of Americans aren't able to enter the middle class:\n\nIf the racial wealth divide continues to accelerate, the economic conditions of black and Latino households will have an increasingly adverse impact on the economy writ large, because the majority of U.S. households will no longer have enough wealth to stake their claim in the middle class.\n\nThe report emphasizes the severe economic disadvantage black Americans had throughout the 20th century as the middle class grew. While the G.I. bill offered millions of veterans and their families access to home ownership, higher education, and business loans, the authority of individual states to implement the bill with little oversight led to \"pervasive racial discrimination in which service members of color were more likely to be denied access to a range of benefits that greatly expanded the American middle class.\" Meanwhile, black Americans have been subjected to redlining and other discriminatory practices, creating a vicious cycle in which households are refused credit as a penalty for living in low-income areas—in turn making it impossible, in many cases, to move into the middle class.\n\nTo combat the growing racial wealth divide and to keep it from resulting in a further-weakened middle class, the study urges, among other things, a correction of the country's \"upside-down\" tax structure in which the government would \"stop subsidizing those who are already wealthy and start investing in opportunities for low-wealth families to build wealth.\"\n\n\"The growing racial wealth divide documented in this report is not a natural phenomenon, but rather the result of contemporary and historical public policies that were intentionally or thoughtlessly designed to help White households get ahead at the expense and exclusion of households of color,\" the report reads. \"Although public policy has been a significant contributor to the divide, the good news is that public policy can also help to close the divide.\"",
  "latent_10338": "Some people are fans of the Miami Dolphins. But many, many more people are NOT fans of the Miami Dolphins. This 2012 Deadspin NFL team preview is for those in the latter group. Read the other Why Your Team Sucks 2012 previews here.\n\n1. They just can't wait to ruin Ryan Tannehill. There's nothing more enjoyable than watching an NFL team draft a project quarterback, swear to keep that project QB tethered to the bench for at least a year, and then IMMEDIATELY throw out those plans before the season has even started. The Dolphins reached to draft Ryan Tannehill because they didn't have the ammo to move up and draft shovel-ready QBs like RG3 and Andrew Luck. It's like drafting in your fantasy league, realizing you need a wideout, watching all the good ones get selected in front of you, and then settling for Doug Baldwin (NOTE: I tried to use a Dolphins wideout for this analogy, unfortunately the Dolphins have no wideouts. Literally. I'm told they'll be using inflatable wideouts for the majority of this season). No one is EXCITED to draft Ryan Tannehill. Drafting Ryan Tannehill is something you do after drinking too much and intentionally doing something to hurt yourself. NFL Network Mike Mayock said Tannehill is \"at least a year away from being a functional NFL quarterback.\" Oh goody. Sounds fantastic. NEVER DRAFT A WHITE QB JUST BECAUSE HE CAN RUN FAST.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an ideal situation, the Dolphins would let Tannehill ride the bench for a year and THEN let him go out and suck the way we all know he will. Instead, they've decided to stick him out there this season, with no one to throw to and no possible hope for success. NFL teams never seem to heed the lessons of David Carr. Time and again, they take a young passer and happily let opponents dismantle his psyche bit by bit. By the end of this season, Tannehill will be throwing passes with his eyes closed from the fetal position.\n\n2. Dan Snyder Jr. Dolphins owner Stephen Ross is fucking terrible. Here's a man who spent last season trying to sell minority stakes in the club to celebrities as a way of boosting the team's profile. Because the average football fan is eight times more likely to attend a game if they know that Gloria Estefan is a one-percent shareholder. Ross also declared that he'd like to see the team change uniforms after watching the Marlins rebrand themselves. Because you should always take cues from the Marlins when it comes to things of that nature. I'm very excited for the team to erect a giant Carmen Miranda statue in the end zone. If Tannehill hits the statue, everyone at the stadium receives a free can of Fanta.\n\nAnd those are among the more trivial of errors committed by Ross. He fucked up the Jim Harbaugh courtship. He left Tony Sparano out to rot in front of his players for the equivalent of a full season. He was so openly desperate to sign Peyton Manning that should have stood out on the Sun Life Stadium sidewalk in fishnets, flashing his rectal warts to passing motorists. He somehow lost out on Jeff Fisher to the Rams—THE RAMS! Have you seen the Rams lately? They're dying. They have a shit roster and they play in a shit stadium in the shittiest town imaginable. Jeff Fisher turned down a chance to live in Miami for THAT. That's how awful Stephen Ross is. At least when Dan Snyder makes an asshole move, he makes a BIG asshole move. He has asshole flair. Stephen Ross is a wannabe Dan Snyder, which has to be the single most pathetic thing a human being can be. But hey, at least the stadium has a nightclub. Jeeeesus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrew Magary writes for Deadspin and Gawker. He's also a correspondent for GQ. Follow him on Twitter @drewmagary and email him at drew@deadspin.com.\n\n3. The Ocho Experiment. Consider how desperate you have to be at wideout to sign a player like Ocho, who was so clearly washed up by last season. Every throw directed at Chad Johnson last season felt like an act of charity. Ocho may be gone now, but I promise you: If there's any team out there desperate enough to sign Donovan McNabb, it's these Dolphins. Jeff Ireleand can tell from the soup ads that his mother isn't a whore. The Dolphins' cluelessness is terrifying to behold. This is a team whose best offensive weapon—by far—is Reggie Bush. Reggie Bush was the 12th most important skill player in New Orleans. In Miami, he's fucking Superman. They're doomed.\n\n4. Those goddamn '72 Dolphins. Does anyone like these people anymore? I don't think even Dolphins fans like the '72 Dolphins anymore. At this point, they only serve to illuminate the franchise's current atrociousness. All I think about when I think about the Dolphins now is A.) fuck the '72 Dolphins, B.) that Hootie song, and C.) EINHORN IS FINKLE, FINKLE IS EINHORN. That's the entirety of their identity right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in many ways, that's the kind of team that Miami deserves. Miami doesn't deserve a hallowed football tradition. Miami deserves ANGUISH. I've been to South Beach. It's an overpriced strip mall. And I think you users of the Internet are already well aware of the dangers that Florida itself presents to modern society: zombies, serial killers, coke dealer massacres, eight-year-olds arrested for DUI, crocodile attacks... Florida is the waste product of America's digestive system. That's why it comes out of our bottom. It's not America's wang, as so popularly noted. It's America's turtle, poking out of our asshole until hopefully, one day, it breaks off into the water and gets flushed down. And hopefully, the Dolphins will sink with it.\n\n5. Hear it from Dolphins fans!\n\nJeff:\n\nEvery two seasons or so, Miami trades away some practice squad hustler or third string overachiever to the Jets or Pats for next to nothing, only to have that fucker gleefully shred our penises in a meat grinder. If OJ Simpson and Casey Anthony had a baby, that kid would be a more popular Floridian than Jeff Ireland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEric:\n\nFUCK YOU SABAN\n\nMike:\n\nI bought season tickets last year (sadist) and ever since then have enjoyed some of the many \"benefits\" offered to season ticket holders. My favorite is where we get random automated telephone calls to our cell phones to remind us about a teleconference with season ticketholders and... Brian Hartline? As if having a horrible on-field product wasn't enough, now I can add the Dolphins to the long list of assholes that call my cell phone with automated messages (all I had to do was pony up $1000 for two seats for the privilege!!!!). They also try pawning off god awful soccer tickets in the shittiest seats in the stadium to us as another \"perk.\" I immediately claimed my free tickets because I'm a red-blooded American who wants everything that is free regardless of how much I actually don't want it. I immediately went on StubHub to sell the tickets but the four free tickets they gave me were only going to fetch me a measly $28. I hate you, Miami Dolphins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEric:\n\nThe worst part is that I started following this team in 1984 when they went to the Super Bowl. As a kid, you're thinking this is great. We can do this every year, right? Hell no. These guys have bumblefucked their way through the past 28 years doing nothing. I'm still a reluctant fan out of some misguided loyalty. But when do you stop caring about a bunch of fucking assholes that don't resemble the organization that you originally decided to follow for one reason or another? I feel like the whole Dolphins organization is being held hostage by Ray Finkle and there's nothing I can do but feel his gun digging into my hip. You got a t-shirt like that I can buy, Mr. Ross?\n\nDavid:\n\nJeff Ireland is the Todd Akin of football.\n\nChance:\n\nHey, this Wes Welker kid is pretty good. I know, let's trade him to our most dangerous division rivals for a second round pick that we can blow on a halfway decent center who we'll just flip to the Raiders a couple years later for a sixth rounder! I could go on about this team's god-awful trade history in the last decade (fuckin' A.J. Feeley), but it's late and I don't want to write a goddamn essay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan:\n\nIf you walk into a men's room at a truck stop and decide to stick your dick through a glory hole to see what would happen, you are clearly qualified to make the same sort of inept decisions that have plagued my team for decades. Let's take a look at a few. 1. Forcing your Hall of Fame coach into retirement for Jimmy Johnson, only to have him quit and hand the team over to porn-stache Dave Wannstedt. 2. Passing on Drew Brees TWICE! Oh yeah, Culpepper is the much safer choice. You fucking idiots, he was rehabbing at a 24hr Fitness for Christ sakes. 3. Using 2nd round picks on shitty QBs instead of a first rounder: AJ Feeley, Daunte Culpepper, John Beck, Chad Henne 4. Learning about Ricky Williams' hippy drum circle bullshit every game he played AFTER he quit only to return b/c he realized he need cash to travel to 3rd world shitholes. 5. Passing on Mike Tomlin for a guy whose parents named him Cam Cameron. This douche was fired from the football powerhouse Indiana for shitting down his leg. 6. Outside of Shula, our past coaches are horrible. Wannstedt, Bates, Saban, Cameron, Sparano. Little Nicky Saban realized that in the NFL, you have to wait your turn and draft players instead of recruiting them, so he took his ball and went home. 7. Finally, one more note on Saban. Employees were not allowed to look or speak to the coach unless spoken to, and he yelled at a admin assistant for buying the wrong Little Debbie snack cakes. No one can make shit like that up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLauren:\n\nThe Orange Carpet. Why is that a thing? It's the worst, literally the worst.\n\nDan:\n\nIn my lifetime alone, they have lost playoff games 62-7, 38-3, 29-10, 27-0. They have drafted players in the first round named Erik Kumero, Yatil Green, Billy Milner, John Avery, Jamar Fletcher, Jason Allen, and Ted Ginn. They have had Ricky Williams choose weed over them, then take him back like nothing happened. They employed Dave Wannstedt. They employed Cam Cameron as head coach and went 1-15 while fans cried in the stands when they finally won one game (I was there, guys were actually crying).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarlos:\n\nHere's our fight song. Fuck my life.\n\nDylan:\n\nBeing a Dolphins fan is like dating a scumbag. It's like, right before every season, the Dolphins are like, \"Hey, c'mon now baby, don't be like that. We just picked up Cameron Wake, see? I told you we can change.\" And I'll be like, \"Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry, baby.\" Then they have another losing season, and it once again turns into me packing an overnight bag and staying with my friend, who makes us both some tea and pats my back saying, \"He's no good for you, Dylan. You have to leave. You have to be strong.\" And I know it's true, but I just keep going back. I should have listened to my parents and gotten with the Steelers when I had a chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHead Bee Guy:\n\nThis is, without a doubt, the single most boring franchise in the NFL. Other teams may be worse (not frequently), but it's almost as though the Dolphins intentionally structure their team to prevent their fans from having any emotional attachment. Here is a list of interesting things that have happened to the Dolphins over the last decade:\n\n2004: Ricky Williams retires\n\n2008: Playoff appearance\n\n2011: Brandon Marshall stabbed by his wife Additionally, let's not forget that the Dolphins (presumably not under duress) allowed Dave Wannstedt to coach the team for five years. Dave Wannstedt's greatest achievement in almost 20 years as a head coach is a two-point victory in the Meineke Car Care Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatt:\n\nWe are Cleveland with a beach.\n\nDrew:\n\nTo be honest, I'm puzzled as to why the Dolphins never come up in the regular discussions of teams who may move to Los Angeles. The city is made up entirely of retired Jets fans and coked-up, paranoid Exiles who are too busy blaming the thrown rods in their rusted-out Tercels on fucking Castro to bother with the game. What little remains of the fanbase lives in Broward and Palm Beach This is the state of the Miami Dolphins in 2012. The stadium has had more names than Antonio Cromartie has had kids. Our GM is primarily known for asking a potential draft pick if his mother was a hooker. And somehow this little ginger shit—the man who took PAT FUCKING WHITE IN THE SECOND ROUND—gets the reputation from the drooling morons who make up our fanbase for being solid on draft day. Our owner looks like a gargoyle with Down's syndrome, goes after coaches and players he wants with all the tact of a sledgehammer, and apparently thinks he's marketing to 12-year-old girls in 2003 with all of his celebrity owners. I've noted on more than one occasion to fellow fans that Dave Wannstedt remains the most successful head coach of the Post-Johnson Era. And it isn't even really close. Someone should die for that. And then there are the quarterbacks. I've lost count of how many we've had. I knew I had reached the low-point of fandom last year as I watched Chad Henne throw another pick and thought to myself, \"I miss Jay Fiedler.\" Our new coach apparently thought he'd throw fans a bone by taking a quarterback in the First Round this year. This was a mistake. We have traditions here. When we want to reach on a quarterback and saddle ourselves with incompetence for another two years, we'll do it the right way — drafting him in the Second Round and making him sit behind an aging veteran whose shoulder is made of tissue paper. Tannehill's a nice enough kid, but a kid whom anybody with an IQ above room temperature knows is just a yokel-assed Chad Henne with a hotter wife. The truth is that Philbin and whatever poor bastard follows him in 2014 can bring in anybody they want. It won't matter. This team isn't going to have a franchise quarterback again until Marino's dead, which is why from here on out I'm anxiously awaiting the day Marino and Sharpe at long last push Esiason over the edge, and Esiason finally goes postal on live TV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid:\n\nBrian Hartline has worse legs than the horses on \"Luck\".\n\nWanna be part of the Deadspin NFL previews? It's simple. Just email me and give me ample evidence of why your team sucks. I'll throw any good material into the post and give you proper credit. Next team up: THE BILLS.",

A Look at The #1 Country Songs for 2004 Most writers follow their hearts. Only when the song is finished – when they’ve created someone who never existed, in a place that never was, doing something that never happened – do they really begin to think about commercialism and what to pitch to whom. There are other writers, however, who purposefully sit down to “go for the throat;” who hunt for a radio hit and don’t aim at having a #2 song. After all, for most of us, the theory behind joining the world’s second oldest profession (writing for money) is to be the lead dog. Remember if you’re not, the view never changes. Therefore, it’s a good idea to know what propels a song to that most coveted of spots, the one that artists, managers, A&R and promotion people gaze at in rapture . . . numero uno! Only 46 writers stood in the golden circle in 2004, which means more people were struck by lightning in the U.S. than wrote a #1 Country song. Of those 46 writers, six were artists who recorded the songs they participated in. The good news for non-artists, or “stand alone” writers, is that they were responsible for writing two-thirds of those #1 songs. What in Common?\n\nNobody was waltzing at drive time last year as all of the 21 #1 songs were in 4/4 time. As for time-to-title, the majority of #1s used their titles within 60 seconds, (including an average 15-second intro). As far as repetitions-of-title, less was apparently more, as two-thirds (14 total) had only three-to-seven mentions of the title. At the low end were “In A Real Love” (Vassar/Wiseman) with three uses of title and “Suds In The Bucket” (Jenai/Montana) with four. At the high end was “When The Sun Goes Down” (James) with 32. Interestingly, the only one getting his heart broken at #1 was Keith Urban with “You’ll Think of Me” (Powell/Urban). I know in “I Hate Everything” (Harrison/Stegall), the main character lost everything and was living in a shoebox on the side of the road, but that wasn’t George Strait. He managed to learn his lesson from the loser in 3 minutes, 30 seconds and called home just in time to save his marriage, which made Keith Urban the king of lonely last year. Tempo\n\nIf you obeyed the usual A&R requests (Midtempo, Mid-to-Uptempo and Uptempo positive love songs), you had a statistical advantage over your competition, in that those types of songs made up 81 percent of the total #1s for 2004. A third of the year’s #1 songs were Uptempo (7 of 21) and collectively spent 16 weeks at #1. Midtempos numbered five in all and spent a total of 15 weeks at the top. Mid- to Uptempos likewise numbered five and spent seven weeks at #1. While ballads comprised only four of the 21 spots, those that reached the top managed to remain there for 18 weeks. Intro\n\nIntros grew slightly from the old standard of 13 seconds to 15 seconds in 2004. Some much shorter than that were “Redneck Woman” (Rich/Wilson) at .05 seconds and “Suds In The Bucket” (Jenai/Montana) at .06 seconds. Much longer intros were “Live Like You Were Dying” (Nichols/Wiseman) at 23 seconds and “Days Go By” (Powell/Urban) at 26 seconds. Theme and Person\n\nThe themes on Country radio last year were exactly what you would expect from a blue-collar team trying to keep their audience between the ditches. For example, we heard love found (“Suds In The Bucket” . “Watch The World Go By”), love celebrated (“Nothing On But The Radio” . “Remember When” . “In A Real Love”), life lessons (“There Goes My Life” . “I Hate Everything”), patriotism (“American Soldier”), love lost (“You’ll Think Of Me”), drinking (“Whiskey Girl”) and good old-fashioned party (“When The Sun Goes Down” . “Some Beach” . “Girls Lie Too”). Nine of the 21 were morality plays/life lessons; 5 were romantic; 5 were party time; 1 was sad and 1 was patriotic. The five songs that held listeners longer than 30 weeks were all Mid- to Uptempo party time/love songs (“Some Beach” . “Nothing On But The Radio” . “In A Real Love” . “Suds In The Bucket” . “Somebody”). Fifteen of the #1s used the first and second persons (I, me, us, you, we), which is consistent with Country songs being conversational. Chart Longevity\n\nBy the way, for those of you doing the math at home, if 2004′s #1s seemed to spend more than 52 weeks at the top, it’s because they did! “There Goes My Life” (Mobley/Thrasher) actually reached #1 at the end of 2003 and “Some Beach” (Feek/Overstreet) extended its stay into 2005. The records that reached #1 the fastest were “There Goes My Life” (Mobley/Thrasher) in 8 weeks, “When The Sun Goes Down” (James) in 8 weeks and “Live Like You Were Dying” (Nichols/Wiseman) in 6 weeks. (That song spent a huge 19 weeks at #1.) As for total time spent on the charts, those three songs were not even close to being the longest lived. The records that took the longest time to get to #1 were “Somebody” (Berg/Tate/Wright) in 29 weeks, “In A Real Love” (Vassar/Wiseman) in 27 weeks, “Suds In The Bucket” (Jenai/Montana) in 23 weeks and “Nothing On But The Radio” (Blackmon/Hill/Long) in 23 weeks. Song Length\n\nAbout half the chart toppers were longer than 4 minutes, with the other half hovering between 3 to 4 minutes (around 3.30). Interestingly, the number of records over 4 minutes in length is unusual when you consider radio’s increase in advertising minutes per hour and their assertion that songs are the “filler between the jingles.” You would think that radio would jump up and down for 2-minute records. Whatever the reason, song length appeared to be on the rise as compared to 2003. Song Form\n\nSince we were born, one way or another, we have been listening to radio. The song structure, form or shape is embedded in the radio listener’s psyche. As a writer, you can lead the listener outside these structures but only if you satisfy that listener. I have friends who get paid to read movie scripts that have been submitted to major studios. They have told me, that they can tell within three or four pages if a script will make a good film. Introduction of characters, subplots and all the other elements necessary to engage and hold us (the viewers) for two hours and change are craft. Similarly, engaging and holding radio listeners at drive time is a matter of craft. Of the six forms (or shapes or whatever you wish to call them), the most frequently used in 2004 (10 of the 21 songs) was the Fourth form (verse/lift/chorus/verse/lift/chorus/bridge/instrumental or both/lift/chorus). Next (6 of the 21 songs) came Third form (verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/instrumental/chorus), followed by Second form (verse/chorus/verse/chorus/instrumental/chorus). It should be noted that the only two songs to step way outside the usual structures at #1 were Alan Jackson’s “Remember When” (Jackson) and Toby Keith’s “American Solider” (Cannon/Keith). “American Soldier” has four similarly structured verses – the first two treated as verses; the second two lifting melodically to almost become channels ( or pre-choruses, lifts or climbs if you prefer); then a chorus, instrumental and reprise. “Remember When” uses chronology, or time passage, through six verses, treating the song like an AABA (or Fifth form) without the “B” section. For all my time in the music business, it’s always been an artist’s prerogative to break the rules, because it’s his or her career on the line; whereas stand-alone writers have to be content with creatively bending the rules. Other Items to Note\n\nDetail, humor and irony ruled! She was in the backyard – they say it was a little past nine (“Suds In The Bucket”). I was 18 making minimum wage (“In A Real Love”). Don’t you remember the fizz in a pepper (“Back When”)? How about the 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu (“Live Like You Were Dying”)? If your song used detail, with a twist of irony and a dash of humor, your song was a prime candidate for the top spot. Remember troops, the market for country radio is women 25-40 at drive time. Humor, irony and detail appear to be the essential elements in our conversational/story-driven genre. Indeed, the ’04 crop of #1s was almost evenly split (10 conversational / 11 story) and in certain cases they\n\nwere both.\n\nYour Best Shot\n\nThe bottom line? While being a singer/songwriter generally increases your odds of success, in 2004 only six writer-artists (out of the 46 total writers) had #1s – good news for those other 40 writers and the many stand-alone writers out there. So, based on the numbers, here’s your best shot at hitting #1: Start with a conversational/story driven love song laden with humor, irony and detail. Introduce your title within 60 seconds and repeat it no more than seven times. Write in first or second person using 4th or 3rd form. Make your songs Mid- to Uptempo, anywhere from three to four minutes in length. Now of course comes the hard part – getting them recorded and released! The good news for all writers is that if our songs don’t make it, we have so many people we can blame! (Never ourselves of course . . .)

The Song as a Script\n\nYour song is finished.\n\nYou were eloquent.\n\nThe melody flowed.\n\nYou are fulfilled, complete.\n\nYou resound with satisfaction.\n\nYou said everything you wanted to say.\n\nHow could anyone fail to rush to record your song?\n\nWell, not so fast… Your songs may be your little lambs, but when it comes time to send one of them to the market, keep in mind that some people hate lamb chops and others are allergic to wool. So before you proceed, think back… back to before you entered the music business;\n\nback to when you were the audience and went to see singers for fun;\n\nback to when you thought those singers were singing songs they had written about their own lives;\n\nback to when you thought you were catching a glimpse of their inner souls. You were unaware that those inner souls had been crafted for them by Bacharach & David or Holland-Dozier-Holland. Well, just as your favorite TV and movie stars do not write their own scripts, luckily for songwriters, neither do a lot of singers write their own songs. The major difference between actors and singers however is that most actors can change characters from film to film whereas successful singers rarely depart radically from the image they have chosen. That presents the songwriter hurdles that require investigation before rushing into pitch mode. Not only must the song/script be in keeping with the artist’s image but a few music business executives must be persuaded to gamble a million dollars on it. Figuring in the cost of the sessions, (studio, production, musicians, etc) the video, tour support, radio school, stylists and of course radio, you are at a million big ones. Your script has to function on a lot more levels than just entertaining your friends and family. It is a script for a performer to stand on stage and have a linear, lyrical conversation with his or her audience (in my case is that audience is women!). In my opinion, if you are a stand-alone writer – not a performer, not in a band – and you are not writing for women, you are decreasing your chances for success! Our world of entertainment is always ultimately about “The Woman.” With rare exceptions, it is men singing to women and women singing to women. So, the mantra for the songwriter parallels that of the restaurateur. When looking for a restaurant to invest in, there are three factors to consider: location, location, location. Likewise, to be a songwriter, there are three things you should consider: What’s in it for the woman? What’s in it for the woman? What’s in it for the woman? So, when you see the word LISTENER in any of my articles, mentally substitute the word WOMAN. So let’s focus on their perception of your song. Aside from the work being right for the artist, is it a potential hit? Do you get the listener involved in the song quickly? How quickly? Well, try 60 seconds, including introduction. I call it getting the listener to invest in your song. If I am drawn into a writer’s invention, it requires me to identify with (or ideally become) the hero, victim, winner or loser in the piece. In order to lure me/the listener in, it’s better that you speak to me, not about me. Though I dealt with the pronoun (the little big word) in a previous column, let me remind you that when it comes to the song as a script, it is the little huge word. You’ll get my attention faster if the song is about You, I, Us or We, because if it’s about Her, Him or Them, it will be much harder to capture and keep my interest. However, if the song is using the first-person pronoun (you, me, I, etc.) and the central figure is too old, too young, not cool enough or just not the image that the artist, management or label wish to project, you might consider changing to the third-person pronoun (even though the odds are higher for your song not being #1). That way, the artist can sing the song (about being homeless a drunk perhaps) without it reflecting personally on him or her. Next, you must create an expectation and then fulfill that expectation. Pull out some of your favorite songs and look at the titles – pretty average stuff, mostly words or phrases you use every day. However, those titles are the fulfillment of the created expectation. The genius is in the creation of the expectation. Making something commonplace eye-catching – or in the case of the song, ear catching – is your job. I don’t know how many of you have seen an uncut diamond, but they look remarkably unremarkable, rather boring in fact. Only in the hands of someone who has absorbed the craft and mastered the skill of making the mundane sparkle does the seemingly dull come to life. So, surprise me with interesting information, by asking a question with a different twist or by describing a condition, place, person or circumstance using words and phrases that make the ordinary extraordinary. Well, I guess we need to have a checklist for this song that you have chosen to be a script for a specific artist. High on that list is accessibility. How easy is the song to sing? Are you trying to fit three-syllable words into a one-syllable spot? Singer/songwriters do it all the time and get away with it because they are the artists. You cannot. Does its range span three notes or three octaves? Remember that a lot of “artisteests” may have an abundance of charisma, personality and sex appeal but honestly can’t sing very well. Send them the story songs because the more detailed the story, the less melody you need. Remember, the human animal is not very good at hearing more than one moving part at a time and given its preference will always defer to melody. Now, if you’re pitching to divas or vocally well-endowed males, then be big on melody, heavy on monosyllabic words and open vowel sounds (A-E-I-O-U-Y!) and minimum story. What is the song about? Will this artist’s audience identify him or her with this situation or circumstance? Does the artist use this language? Remember all that changes from genre to genre, aside from attitude, is vocabulary and technology. Vocabulary especially is a bond between the artist and the audience. That, by the way, is a huge obstacle for writers crossing to cultures and genres that they are not intimately connected to or understand personally. And finally, have you told the whole story – beginning, middle and end? Have you created an expectation from the opening line, fulfilled that expectation in 60 seconds, added information/detail in the next verse, and spiced it up by adding conflict or calming it down? Have you made the listener laugh, cry, question, cheer, feel any (or all) of a whole range of emotions or just plain old fall in love? Yes? Then take it to the artist – job well done! - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - - #3. The 7:00 A.M. Rule If you’re ready to stop being “warm and fuzzy,” go for the throat and write a hit — read on, you’re ready for “The 7:00 a.m. Rule.” Everybody already thinks you’re crazy anyway, so you might as well be successful and crazy. It will make your mother and your bank manager happy. The Road Test Contrary to popular opinion, songs are not really “sold” in an A&R person’s office at 11:00 a.m., a publisher’s office at 2:00 p.m., a manager’s office at 4:00 p.m., or a coffeehouse, bar, concert or nightclub at 10:00 p.m. After all the work of the creative process – the politics of pitching, the hell of being on hold, the anguish of the recording process, the torment of waiting to be the single – comes the acid test. It’s called “Drive Time.” Drive time occurs between 6:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. on radio stations around the world. It can take the song that your publisher said was a smash, the A&R people said couldn’t miss, the artist hailed as a career maker, and your significant other wept over, and make it just another stain on the great toilet roll of life. Be The “Fish” In order to understand what will happen to your work when it is fed to the listener, it’s essential to think like the listener. When you go fishing, think like the fish. A fish does not bite on a hook because it thinks it is a stainless steel hook; the fish has got to believe it has found lunch. If the bait, for any reason, does not behave like lunch, the fish goes looking elsewhere, and so does the listener. Think about what you want to do at 7:00 a.m. The real answer: nothing. Your car isn’t running right, your kids are driving you crazy, your boss is on your back, you burned your hand on the toaster, and all the while, under a half-dead plant, a collection of transistors and plastic called a radio is relentlessly trying to capture your attention. Target the Listener Remember, songwriters, the listener doesn’t care about you: they care about themselves as you see them. The reason you fell in love with songs before you became caught up in the mechanics of writing was because you identified with the song. You didn’t care if the writer was having a good day or a bad day. Also, the listener is used to receiving information in a certainform. There are definite song structures. The ways that a story isdelivered have been in place longer than any of us have been alive: starting with a killer opening line; having a beginning, middle and end; changing rhyme schemes from verse to chorus; choosing the right pronouns; placing the right metaphor. These and other basic elements of craft are the essential tools of the “hit” writer. Remember, you are born with the gift of perception, but craft is an acquired skill. At 7:00 a.m., the listener is taking no prisoners. You’re going to need all the craft that every other hit writer is bringing to bear. - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - - #4. WHAT PUBLISHERS REALLY WANT Wanted: Young, yet mature, male or female writer/performer; prolific in lyrics & melody; able to produce & pitch own demos; requires little financial support from publisher; has some track record; lives next door to office. The above listing might be the typical Want Ad you would expect a publisher to post (if publishers did, indeed, do such things) when searching to find and sign a new songwriter. Yet, according to a recent Murphy’s Laws survey, the reality is somewhat different. Mark Ford (without whose scrupulous editing and input the Murphy’s Laws column would be a tough read) helped me assemble an informal survey that polled 14Nashvillemusic publishers. Each publisher, within the past twelve months, had placed a hit song on the charts and had signed a new staff writer. The publishers ranked each of the following attributes from 1 to 10 (with 1 being least important and 10 being most important) based on the last writer they signed, not on any particular “wish list.” [Note: averages for each question appear in brackets.] What least motivates a publisher to put out the Welcome Mat According to our survey, the following were of minimal importance to publishers:\n\n20. Marital status [1.0]\n\n19. Gender [1.5]\n\n18. Living in or near another major music center (such as New York or Los Angeles) [1.6]\n\n17. Being a producer [1.9] 16. Being recommended by non-publishers (such as lawyers, managers, A&R) [2.7]\n\n15. Already writing with a recording artist [2.9]\n\n14. Age [3.0] (good news for older writers!)\n\n14. Being pursued by other publishers [3.0]\n\n14. Already writing with publisher’s staffers [3.0]\n\n(I was quite surprised to find that being a producer, writing with an artist and being able to pitch one’s own songs ranked so low.) What somewhat influences a publisher The mid-range results of our survey bore these responses:\n\n13. Being recommended by other songwriters [4.0]\n\n12. Appearance [4.5]\n\n11. Demo quality [4.6]\n\n10. Track record [4.9]\n\n9. Persistence pursuing the deal [5.1]\n\n8. Living in or near Nashville [5.3]\n\n7. Record deal/artist potential [6.0]\n\n6. Ability to co-write [6.2]\n\n6. Ability to perform songs live [6.2]\n\n5. Affordability (amount of draw) [6.3]\n\n(I was surprised that track record, affordability and record deal did not score higher.) The Big Four According to our survey, the following four were the top deal-maker qualities:\n\n4. Ability to write alone [7.5]\n\n3. Ability to write great melodies [8.7]\n\n2. Personality/compatibility with the company [9.0]\n\n1. Ability to write great lyrics [9.6]\n\nThe Nutshell Having examined all of the information in depth, I would like to point out that most of the publishers who responded (all who were asked did so) were not actively looking for writers to sign, and — with the one exception of lyrical ability being the across-the-board, most-desired quality — there were qualities that were a must-have to some that were of no consideration to others. So, in summation: work particularly on your lyrics, hone the rest of your skills, and pray that there will always be room for the odd frog amongst royalty.

KNOW YOUR OWN STRENGTHS One of the top ten questions I get asked by newcomers to the industry is, “How do I get heard in the music business?” Before I can answer that, I have to know exactly what they want to be “heard.” When I ask them about their goals — whether they want to be songwriters or recording artists — the most common response is, “Both.” Listen to the truth The unfortunate truth of the matter is that, while many of the newcomers I counsel may be gifted as songwriters or as singers, very, very few are equally blessed with both talents. While one ability may come rather naturally, the other often needs significant honing. The problem is, not everyone wants to hear the truth. Some great singers (who are average songwriters) can make the really average songs they’ve written shine through the sheer power of their vocal ability. They make the phrase “I love you” sound so good that you almost believe they invented it. In equal numbers come the great songwriters (who are average singers) who have been told by family, friends, lovers, and late-night adoring coffeehouse/honky-tonk buffoons that, despite the fact that their tempo, pitch and teeth are bad, they have star quality. And no matter how badly they sing, their songs are still strong enough to survive a mediocre vocal performance and sound like hits. (This is the only reason karaoke manufacturers are not hunted for sport!) Check your ego at the door The bottom line is: lose your ego. It’s called “absenting of self.” The person most likely to come between you and your career goal is you. Don’t make the best of your talent a donkey for the least of your talent. Get some unbiased feedback from industry pros (available through a variety of NSAI programs), and if you are indeed weaker in one area, focus on your strength. If you’re a great singer — but an average writer — don’t be upset if someone loves your voice but wants you to sing someone else’s songs. Go find those great songs while you learn to become a better writer. By the same token, if you’re a great songwriter — but an average singer — don’t be upset if someone wants to record your songs but passes on you as an artist. Remember, this is called the music “business,” and the business end of our industry knows that the majority of the G.A.P. (Great American Public) just wants to hear great records. They don’t lie awake nights wondering who wrote and/or sang the songs they like on the radio. Be smart If you have a sneaking suspicion that the preceding law even remotely applies to you, then do yourself this favor: picture the music industry as a large building with an entrance for singers on one side, and an entrance for songwriters on the other. Maybe you can’t go through both doors at the same time, but you can concentrate on getting inside through the door that opens the most easily for you. Who knows? Once you’re inside, you can end up just about anywhere. - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - - #6. Overcoming “Writer’s Assumption” I’ve noticed a recurring problem among some of the writers that I’ve been critiquing and teaching lately. I call it “Writer’s Assumption.” Mr. Webster calls it “anything taken for granted; supposition,” and believe me, it can be terminal for any song infected with it. Listeners Aren’t Mindreaders If a stranger walked up to you on a busy street and said, “He left her,” would you care? The answer, of course, is no. Well, that’s exactly what happens when you write a lyric that assumes the listener knows all about the people who populate your mind. When you come up with a song idea, characters and situations immediately spring to life in your head. So when your pen hits the page, your tendency may be to describe the RESULT of the situation you’ve just invented in your brain– i.e., “He left her.” Your listeners, however, won’t care about the result because you haven’t created any characters to care about. Avoid the “Living Room” Syndrome There’s a reason why there are so many “living room” hits. When you sing a song to your friends and family about Uncle Fred joining the Navy, you don’t have to explain to them that Fred, who was bitten by a dog, lost his job, and had his foot nailed to the floor by Aunt Martha, who subsequently ran off with an encyclopedia salesman. Because your listeners already know the background of the story, they are prepared to laugh when you sing “Uncle Fred has a hammock for a bed and makes gravy for the Navy.” Any stranger stumbling upon a family laughing hysterically at this ditty would probably consider commitment papers, not publishing contracts. Your First Verse May Not Be the First Verse Remember, all songs have a beginning, a middle and an end. Some great old writers beat that into my head 30 years ago. It was the rule then, and it’s the rule now. At least 50 percent of the time, when I sit down to write an idea, I mindlessly write the second verse first. Just as I smile in smug satisfaction at a verse well done, the ghost of one of my old mentors jabs me in the brain with a sharp stick and asks, “Well, Shakespeare, just who are these people, and why are they doing this?” Of course, the ghost is right, so I’ll write another verse that answers those questions, and I’ll make it my new first verse. A lot of things change in 30 years: vocabulary, idioms, situations and attitudes. The craft does not. Making a living from what you love doing is a wonderful thing. Half of love, however is respect. You’ll earn respect by doing your job properly, and your job is to communicate the WHOLE story…besides, you’ll hate that sharp stick. Write a hit! - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - - #7. Looking Back on What’s to Come I’m straying from our usual format just a bit because I feel the need to speak to you about how to make your songs stronger in the long-term rather than in the short term. Like most writers starting out in the music business, I was fortunate to have been adopted by several fine veteran writers. Why they took the time to give me a few words of advice, a moment of praise, a hard jab of criticism, or a cold beer of consolation was always a mystery to me. I never quite understood when they told me that a songwriter’s best friend was not an artist, a label, a publisher, or a radio or TV station, but another songwriter. While I worked on my craft, demoed my songs, hunted for a publisher, relentlessly chased that first recording, and hungered for that first hit, those veteran writers were doing all that and more: they were also working tirelessly to protect their copyrights and receive fair compensation for their work. In so doing, they were also looking after my rights and the rights of all fledgling writers. At a recent NSAI’s Pro Division, I was talking to some of my contemporaries when it hit me that we had become them; and the sheep had become the shepherds. Just as our mentors had carried on the fight for copyright protection, so have we been continuing that fight through NSAI. The Next Generation Now as we look forward to another year, remember that the technology coming down the pike will eclipse anything that we have experienced to date. The technology will have one function — to use, in as many ways as possible, the work that we have dedicated our lives to creating. And if the history has taught us anything, it is that since the 1908 Copyright Law was put into place, users of music have done everything in their power to avoid paying creators for their music. That’s why it’s important for you as a songwriter and a creator of music to join us in the battle for copyright protection: so that you will be prepared to take the torch and lead the next generation of creators forward in the age where technology will make it increasingly easier for others to rob us of our work.

So, long after you’re gone — if you have done your job well — your great, great grandchild may be able to afford an operation, a car, or a college education, compliments of you.

The Mighty Pronoun: The Little Big Word Many times, in trying to get the listener’s attention, writers will fixate on song-crafting devices such as story, story development, metaphor, alliteration and imagery, while forgetting to pay attention to the little personal pronouns. HE, SHE, IT, THEY, THEM, US, WE, I, YOU, and ME may not look like much, but they define who does what to whom. They also can affect the writer’s marketablity and, therefore the value of his or her work. First- and Second-Person: The Favorites When seized by an idea, most male writers, upon sitting down to sketch out a scenario for a song, almost automatically start off with “She did or said this or that.” For women, it is often “He did this or that.” Once the character and the type of relationship evolve, it often becomes necessary to change the pronoun. For instance, if the song describes an intense, one-on-one relationship between the singer and another person, the pronouns used are a first- and second-person: YOU, I, ME, US and WE. This frees the third-person pronouns HE, SHE, IT, THEY, THEM to be used as outside influences that compliment or come between, YOU, I, ME, US, and WE. For an example, “I love YOU, but THEY say that we can’t make it.” The song becomes more personal when YOU and I are used. Third-Person Is Best In Some Cases Remember that songs are vehicles for singers who want to communicate with their audiences. When an artist leans over the footlights, and sings “I love her” — who cares? But if the message is “I love YOU” — a rapport is established. Some exceptions to the rule are as follows: If the song is about a total loser, it will definitely be third-person: HE or SHE. No star is going to stand on stage and describe him or herself as a jerk unless it is so tongue-in-cheek that the listeners know that it’s a joke. At seminars or new writers nights, I often hear songs in which the singer is supposed to be a grandparent. Wrong! If you want to get a song like that recorded, it has to be third-person: “Good old Grandpa, HE was… ” or “Good old Grandma, SHE did… ” In the business of grooming artists, image is everything. The words “youthful” to “mature” are used to describe performers with a record deal. You only become old when you get cold and no major label will touch you with a barge pole. When a relationship is really over forever, the pronoun is third person. HE or SHE. For an example, “SHE’s about as gone as a girl can get.” If any love or hope lingers, however, then the pronoun will be second person: YOU. For an example, “I know YOU’re gone forever, but in MY heart… ” (I refer to this as the “Bozo Finds Love And Won’t Let Go” Syndrome. It has been observed that Bozo the Clown and people in love sometimes have a lot in common.) When the singer performing the song is using the audience as a confidante or is telling a friend about a great relationship, it’s third-person: SHE or HE. For an example, “He’s so wonderful.” When one of the characters in a HE or SHE song has a conversation with someone within the song, the pronoun can switch to second-person: YOU. For an example, in John Ims’ “She’s In Love with the Boy,” Mama says in the third verse: “My Daddy said YOU wasn’t worth a lick.” In The Beatles’ “She’s Leaving Home,” they go to “WE gave HER all of our love.” Fight to Avoid Switching The only really major no-no in the use of pronouns occurs when the characters are third-person (HE or SHE) in the verse then suddenly switch to first- or second- person (YOU, I or ME) in the chorus, or vice versa. I would imagine that any writer worth his or her salt would have seen that information written in block letters three feet tall and underlined in red, so I won’t go into that any further. - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - - #9. Co-Writing with Established Songwriters I was having lunch recently with a new writer just signed to his first major publishing deal. He told me that his publisher had been setting up co-writing appointments for him with established writers, and that he had some questions on how to approach writing on such a different level. I thought addressing his two biggest questions here might be useful to writers in similar situations. 1. “Why does my publisher set me up to write with some established writers and not others?” A good publisher has four functions: administrator, banker, promoter, and nurturer. While wearing his nurturer hat, the publisher may target three or four hit writers as co-writers, but may be reluctant to follow through on that writer’s request to work with some other major writers. It’s not that the publisher isn’t being thorough, or that his faith in his new writer is half-hearted. It’s actually a matter of balance. A publisher signs a writer for his strengths (lyrics, music, assembly) and works to develop that writer in areas where he or she may fall a little short of the mark. Using his knowledge of the writers community, the publisher puts the new writer together with someone whose strengths are complementary. It’s pointless, and frustrating, for two great lyricists to sit in a room together trying to find a great melody; likewise, it is equally pointless for two great melody writers to sit waiting for pearls of wisdom to drop from each other’s lips. No one benefits. 2. “Why am I almost always expected to be the one to provide the hook (title) and a large portion of the song when I co-write with established writers?” Bear in mind that co-writing requires an understanding of each others’ approach to writing. The established writer knows almost nothing about his or her new co-writer; whereas the novice generally is very aware of the experienced writer’s form (lyrical and melodic), language, and approach to the hook from radio, video, records, etc. The only way for the established writer to find out about the new co-writer is to walk with him/her through the thought processes which got him from point A to point B. Remember that successful collaboration doesn’t mean that you necessarily have to be best friends. The only important thing is the quality of the song, and if the partnership doesn’t work, don’t worry. There are 800 #1 songwriters in Nashville. Keep trying, there is room for 801. Write a hit! - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - - #10. Making the Most of Your Songwriting Seminar The next time you attend a songwriting seminar, take advantage of some of the tips I’ve discovered — and a few pet peeves I’ve encountered — along the way: 1. Arrive fully prepared. Be ready to take notes. Buy a small, lined, book that does not have removable pages. Also bring two pens or two pencils or both. (The other Murphy’s Law will prevail and at least one of the two won’t work.) 2. Be sociable. It’s important to get to know your fellow participants. There is usually time for coffee and conversation before or after the sessions and during breaks. Remember, these songwriters are your peer group; networking and making contacts with them is essential. Professionals make it part of their lives, you should, too. 3. Hold that thought during panels. You will have at least one burning question ranging from contracts to demo quality. Don’t ask until some part of seminar touches on it. Throwing in a question on publishing when the focus is song crafting will break the momentum and flow that the panel is trying to establish. If your burning question has not been answered at the end of the session, there’s usually a question and answer period provided for just that reason. 4. Take your best shot. Bring your most recent and best shot to the critique session. The mistakes you were making five years ago aren’t as relevant as the ones you are making today. Also, if you had a chance to pitch a song to a major-label artist, I doubt you would choose your second-best or third-best song, so why do so with other professionals? 5. Don’t bail out early. Once your song has been critiqued, don’t just get up and leave. Chances are pretty high that during the session, you will hear a variety of problems similar to the ones you’ve encountered in songs other than the one you had critiqued. Now’s your chance to hear professionals address, and remedy, those mistakes. 6. Be courteous to your critiquers. Once your song has been critiqued, do not give another one to the professionals involved with your group. They have given of their time and expertise to help you, and to expect them to critique another song and correspond with you — especially after they’ve given up a day or weekend that they could have used for at least a dozen other projects — is unreasonable and impolite. Believe me, this a definite “No-No.” Write a hit! - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - - #11. Why Not to Sing Your Own Demos After performing at a songwriters’ showcase recently, an A&R person I’d known for years asked me why — as I obviously sang reasonably well — she had never heard my voice on any of the song demos I’d pitched to her. Here are the four reasons I gave — think about them: 1. Confusion The question will be asked: “Are you looking for an artist deal, or is this just to pitch the artist on the roster?” Bearing in mind that the function of an A&R person is to reject the bulk of what he or she hears, chances are if they don’t like your voice, your song might go down with you. 2. Association Garth Brooks, T. Graham Brown, Kathy Mattea and many more all sang song demos when they first came to town. If they had sung one of your songs when they were starting out, your work and name just might ring a bell when you submit them a song later on their careers. When you are competing with every writer on the planet for attention from a major artist, every edge helps. 3. Insurance Once you are in the studio and the track is going down, listen to how easily the singer locks into the lyric. If at any point, he stumbles on a word or a phrase — re-write immediately. The word “irreconcilable” may be a wonderful word, but there’s probably a better way to say “it’s over.” Remember, if the hot demo singer you are using has a problem with the lyric, so will the artist you are aiming the song at. 4. Personal Preference I hate the sound of my own voice. Write a hit! - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - - #12. The Checklist In the last Murphy’s Law, I discussed assembling your demo for presentation; however, before you dress up your song and walk it out in public, take a long, hard look to make sure you’ve given it the full benefit of your craft. Here is a limited checklist: Check your Checklist: Have you kept your pronouns consistent? If it’s “she” in the verse, it should not be “you” in the chorus (unless you left “she” for “you”).\n\nHave you varied your rhyme scheme from the verse to the chorus to subtly alert the listeners that something (the hook) is coming their way?\n\nIs there a significant change in the melody from the verse to the chorus?\n\nDo the opening couple of lines of the first verse set the stage for the story that follows?\n\nIs the hook in the right place? With rare exceptions, the title/hook is placed at the end of the chorus, not somewhere in the verse or the backyard.\n\nIs the language you use to tell your story contemporary, i.e. would you hear it in normal day-to-day conversation? Don’t Forget: There are several more items on the checklist, but because of restricting space here, I leave you with what I consider the most important point: Is the song satisfying?\n\nDoes it have a beginning, a middle and a end? If the answer to all of the above is yes, demo on. Write a hit! - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - - #13. Your Demos: Dress Them for Success Every time a writer (or writers) finishes a song, the inevitable question comes up: How should this piece of work be demoed? Let’s start by defining what we are taking about. Demo is short for “demonstration,” which Webster’s Dictionary tells us means “an explanation by example, a practical showing of how something works or is used.” So, step back from your song and take a long, hard look at it. What are its strong points, and what is the simplest, most eloquent way to show it off, i.e. to demo it? Start Simply Start with a simple guitar/vocal presentation and apply some logic. If you feel that simple will be enough, then fine. But make sure the guitar playing is excellent, the vocal is solid and well performed (by solid, I mean in tune and in character with the song), and the basic quality of the recording is good — no pops or hiss or dropouts. Embellish When Necessary If the major part of the song is a big chorus, add a harmony part and perhaps a piano. If it’s up-tempo and rhythmic, add an electric guitar and maybe some percussion. Now, there are songs that are great vehicles for records, but need a full demo to show them off. So, take out that second mortgage! Look the Part And finally, aside from clear labeling (the title, your name, telephone number, address, and the copyright notice) and a neatly typed lyric sheet (in upper-case letters), use a good quality cassette when you pitch your song. Don’t put a million dollar dream on a ten-cent tape. Your song is copyrighted for your lifetime plus 50 years, so remember for at least 50 years, the demo you make today will be the only representation of how you really intended your sing to be dressed. Make sure it’s dressed for success. Write a hit! - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - - #14. The Realities of Co-Writing Figure out where you’re going You are going to co-write with someone you have never worked with before, so do your homework. Ask them to give you a tape of 2 or 3 of their songs that they are excited about. This applies even to a hit writer, because past hits may not necessarily reflect his or her current attitude toward writing. If the co-writer is an artist, get a copy of his or her latest recorded work. Ask them if they loved or hated it, because either way, you will have a sense of direction when you sit down to write with them. Be prepared Now, most important of all, bring at least two covered dishes to the picnic: if they don’t like your potato salad, they may love your fried chicken. In other words, your co-writer may not be into a big ballad that day, but may really get off on a foot-stomper. If you both bring a couple of ideas to the session, odds are that out of the four ideas, one will appeal to both of you. Don’t force it If none of the ideas work out, go have lunch or dinner. Talk about the weather or golf or knitting or fishing (not religion or politics) and then book another time a few days down the road to try to write again. If you repeat the process, and it still doesn’t work, you may be better off as good friends than frustrated co-writers. Write a hit! - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - - #15. Drawing Maximum Attention to Your Hook As you go through your song’s story and the verses, check your rhyme scheme. Whatever it is — change it in your chorus. For instance, change an A B A B rhyme scheme to A B C B. The reason you do this is to subtly alert listeners that something important is coming. A change in rhyme scheme combined with the change in melody going into the chorus should have them ready for the hook. A couple of effective ways to get the most out of your hook (90 percent of the time, your title is the final line or hook) are to: 1. Put an internal rhyme immediately preceding the hook line For an example,\n\n“I love you, you love me too,\n\nBut we can’t make it” OR: “I hate your dog, he ate my frog,\n\nAnd now I hate you.”\n\n“And now I hate you” and “But we can’t make it” are the lines you intended to emphasize (i.e your hooks).\n\n2. Don’t rhyme your hook with anything\n\nA great example of this can be found in Larry Henley’s and Jeff Silbar’s “Wind Beneath My Wings.” In their chorus, except for a very subtle implied rhyme with the word “everything,” which is tucked in the middle of the second line (“and everything I’d like to be”), the title stands alone. It’s also, on examination, made very singable by the use of alliteration. The W’s in “Wind Beneath My Wings” really make it soar. (I hope “soar” is spelled right!). Write a hit!\n\n- – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - -\n\n#16. More Tips\n\nAfter the obvious “Don’t give up your regular job,” there are more tips on songwriting than a golfer has excuses. A few that come to mind are:\n\n1. Make sure you’ve told the whole story.\n\nA song should have a beginning, a middle and an end. For an example — you did that, I did this, and now we’re doing that and (INSERT YOUR HOOK HERE.)\n\nA hook is the main idea of a song, and usually, but not always, is the song’s title. Your job as the songwriter is to lead the listeners step by step through the story and deliver them to the hook — totally involved and completely satisfied. Remember that songs generally are either a dialogue between two people or a narrative simply told. After you’ve written your song, look at it all. If you wouldn’t have said it naturally to a lover, friend or enemy the way it’s written, then it probably should be rewritten. Poems make very boring songs.\n\n2. When you’re stuck, try another angle.\n\nFor those of you locked in what professional writers know as “second verse hell,” I will pass on a tip that a wily old writer told me some years ago. If you’ve completed your first verse and chorus, and there seems to be nowhere else to go because you’ve said everything you wanted to say, make the first verse your second verse and write a new verse (to explain how you got to the second verse). This tip works often enough to make it one of the most valuable tips ever given to me.\n\n3. Know when to quit.\n\nFinally, never overwrite. After you’ve told your story, hit your hook and get out. Too much will always be too much.\n\nSo, on those notes, I’m out of here…\n\n- – - – - – - – -\n\n#17. THE “NUT”\n\nThe conclusion, the point, the message, the result of the story or action\n\nFor a song to be a living thing – sought out by singers, entertaining in elevators, delighting dancers or making people sing it for 50 years after you’re dead – it’s important to remember that it must be in perfect balance. A major part of this balance is the ratio of imagery or emotion or story to result. The reason for this Murphy’s Law dealing solely with the “Nut” is that I go through about a hundred songs a week.At clubs, as I listen to writers in the round or on the half-shell, prepare new writers for their first publishing deal or help hit writers search for their next publishing deal, I am up to my ears in imagery, emotion and story. What is missing 90 percent of the time is the essence, the substance, the correct conclusion, the very thing from which mighty oak trees grow … the Nut.\n\nOrigins of the Nut\n\nTo put a historical perspective on this process, and to understand the emergence of today’s songwriter, let’s go back to the dawn of society. There were the hunters, the gatherers, the teachers, the healers, the traders – group after group scrambling to guarantee its place in the community, its spot near the comfort of the fire. From a distance, watching the triumphs and failures of humankind, were the storytellers. They were charged with re-creating, bringing to life, with word or gesture, the profound, profane or comic events of society around them. In order to justify their warm place by the fire, they had to entertain, as well as inform. After all, any fool could come back from the hunt and say, “We killed the Woolly Mastodon,” but the first one to say, “It was a dark and stormy night as the beast towered above us!” had the audience by the . . . ears. The best of these storytellers, scribes and minstrels became minor celebrities welcome at every fire. Striking the perfect balance between imagery and information, fluff and fact, they generally prospered, thriving on the phrase, “Never let the truth stand in the way of a good story.” That information was passed on from the first songwriter on earth to the second songwriter on earth, who passed it on to Harlan Howard . . . at least that’s Harlan’s story!\n\nLead the listener to the Nut\n\nWhen I’m asked to critique a song, no matter how explicit an idea may appear as I read the lyric or listen to the melody, I always ask the writer one question: “What is this REALLY about?” At least half the time,the answer the writer gives me does not appear anywhere in the song to which I have just listened. Therefore, when crafting your songs, make sure you lead the listener to the Nut (the point you’re trying to make), which, many times, is the hook or title of the song. For example:\n\nAfter references to “It must have been cold there in my shadow” and “You always walked a step behind,” Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar lead the listener to the conclusion “If I can fly higher than an eagle / You Are TheWind Beneath My Wings.” In this case, the title could be the Nut, but it could also be stated as “your selflessness makes my achievements possible.”\n\nAfter references to “When I heard that old familiar music start” and “It was like a dam had broken in my heart,” Hugh Prestwood leads the listener to “After I’d forgotten all about us / The Song Remembers When.” In this case, the title could be the Nut, but it could also be stated as “certain songs can trigger certain emotions and memories to make you re-live moments in your life.”\n\nAfter references to “She could telephone, tell a friend, tell a lie about where she’s been” and “Send a pigeon, send a fax, write it on a Post-It pad,” Phil Barnhart, Sam Hogin and Mark D. Sanders lead the listener to “I’d prefer a bad excuse to No News.” In this case, the Nut could be stated as “any type of communication from my loved one would be better than none at all.”\n\n(It’s important not to confuse the Nut with the theme. For me, the theme is best expressed in general terms regarding a struggle on a grand scale, such as right vs. wrong, old vs. young, virtue vs. venal, etc. The Nut, however, is the resolution of that struggle.)\n\nIn addition to being monster hits, each of these songs – as in 99 percent of all hit songs – contains an easily identifiable Nut. In fact, the only exception I can think of is a song like “Unchained Melody,” in which the phrase “unchained melody” occurs nowhere in the song, and the title has no relevance to the song!\n\nLocating the Nut\n\nWhen searching for the Nut in your own songs, co-writing makes the process easier. To make sure your song is on target, read the lyric aloud and ask your co-writer, “What is this song REALLY about?” At that point, if his or her answer is not clear – re-write. When writing by yourself, finish your song, then on a separate piece of paper, write out the Nut in one sentence. Then, the first time you play the song for someone else, ask what he or she thinks the Nut is. If it doesn’t coincide with your assessment, you are wrong. Remember, the listener is always right!\n\nStrive for the “Oow” Factor\n\nJudge your songs by what I call the “Oow” factor. Simply put, it means that it’s not just a GOOD song; it’s SO GOOD that, when you play it for people, they say “OOW!” At that point, you have a perfect song that is in total balance. It uses enough insightful detail to make the situation and the character(s) come to life, but never forgets to perfectly position the Nut: for example, it could be all the reasons that “you are the wind beneath my wings” or that “the song remembers when” or the fact that you can ask anyone you want, but there’s still “no news.” Once you isolate – and clearly communicate – the “Nut,” you’ll be welcome at any fire in any cave in the world.\n\nSo, on those notes, I’m out of here…\n\n- – - – - – - – -\n\n#18. Your Best Bet for a #1 Song\n\nFor a small business owner such as a songwriter/publisher, knowing the market is vital. Budgeting for success means looking at income (when it decides to come in!) and making informed decisions about how to spend it most effectively. Up near the top of the list of expenditures (almost right next to eating) are demo costs. The financial outlay for demonstration recordings has risen to $750 – $1,000 per song. So, if you write 30 songs a year and only have $10,000 in your demo budget, you’re going to have to make some hard choices.\n\nThe Truth about Dogs and Chickens\n\nLet’s say you’ve written this song about a Chicken. You love it! Your mom loves it! The special person in your life loves it! However. . Radio is only playing Dog songs. Fortunately, you’ve also written 4 Dog songs, which everybody loves. Your dilemma? You only have enough money to produce a 3-song demo, but you have 5 songs (4 Dog songs and 1 Chicken song). What do you do? Now, unfortunately, I have suitcases full of demoed Chicken songs, so I know what the songwriter side of me says; however, I noticed early on in life that food is a good thing and that eating makes me happy. So, while grumbling and complaining about how radio should be playing more Chicken songs, I demo three of my four Dog songs so I can continue to support my nasty food habit! In the frustrating war between art and commerce, commerce wins.\n\nLet’s be honest. Though it shouldn’t, radio drives the “commercial” aspect of the songwriting process. (Did I already mention that I like to eat?) It affects just about every decision we make creatively. In March, 1999, country radio did something seismic in nature, which impacted songwriters and publishers dramatically. As an experiment to maintain listenership, Country radio decided to slow the progress of records going up and down the charts in hopes of breeding the kind of familiarity that keeps listeners coming back for more – commercials, that is.\n\nAs a result, I became curious and decided to try an experiment of my own. I started by researching the Billboard Country chart for 1999 and found that a total of 18 songs reached #1. Taking a closer look, I began to wonder: what type of song is reaching the top in this brave new world of radio? A world in which, though yet another ripple effect of deregulation, big radio chains have been allowed to buy up and homogenize most of the “mom and pop” country stations resulting in:\n\nCountry songs being slotted between jingles and musical links that sound like they’re written and performed by Metallica;\n\non-air personalities who, with rare exceptions, really don’t know (or care) about country music, and\n\nan increase in the amount of commercial time that effectively gets rid of two or three records per hour.\n\nBut, I digress! What we began to see on the chart before March is that records did indeed start taking longer to climb and began to linger longer, that is, taking longer to fall off completely. Before March, the total average time a song spent on the chart was 26.5 weeks. After the March changeover, that time increased to 32 weeks – adding more than a month to the life of a song! (In fact, Lonestar’s “Amazed” was on the chart for more than a year.) What kinds of songs enjoyed success? Let’s look at a few dynamics . . . .\n\nAnything in common?\n\nCommon characteristics for the 18 #1s were that all of them were contemporary pop/country; 4/4 in tempo; romantic, primarily humorous, sad, and heartfelt. Half were stories; half were conversations. The average intro was 13.2 seconds.\n\nTempo\n\nLet’s examine the producer/A&R, mantra – “We are looking for mid to up-tempo positive love songs.” Yes, you can say it in your sleep!\n\nSurprisingly, though, ballads accounted for 50% of 1999′s chart toppers, followed by up-tempos at 33% and mid-tempos at 17%. Now, before you crown ballads king, let’s look at the amount of time spent at #1. Even though more ballads made it to #1, they tended to fall off quicker. In fact, up-tempos spent 49% of the year at #1, followed by ballads at 31% and mid-tempos at 20%. So, even though mid- and up-tempos combined accounted for only half of the #1s, they spent a combined 69% of the year in the top spot.\n\nStrangely enough, you had a slightly better chance of having a #1 with a ballad, but spent significantly less time at #1 and on the chart.\n\nMelody\n\n75% of up-tempos went from a linear melody in the verse to a soaring melody in the chorus. Which means, basically, the listener got a story [linear - very little motion, few chord changes] and something to hum at the supermarket [soaring - significant motion and chord changes] in the same song and apparently liked that a lot!\n\nIt is almost impossible to tell a story over a soaring melody because the human animal can only hear one moving part at a time and, given choice, will always defer to melody. So, wherever the writer wants to tell a story, the melody is kept to a minimum.\n\nAs for ballads, five of the nine went from linear to soaring.\n\nForm\n\nSince you were born, radio has given you songs in any one of 6 variations.\n\nAs the writer leads listeners through a song, he or she creates an expectation in the audience’s mind that they are being led through the story to a hook (conclusion) in a way that they are familiar with. The writer can alter the format slightly only as long as the listeners feel informed, included and satisfied (once delivered to the hook/conclusion). If that effect is not achieved, the listeners simply reach for the dial and tune out. The writer has failed structurally.\n\nThat being said, the 18 #1 records in 1999 used only 3 of the 6 forms:\n\n2nd Form: Verse-(Verse Opt.)-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Instrument-Chorus-Etc.\n\n3rd Form: Verse-(Verse Opt.)-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Instrument-Chorus-Out\n\n4th Form: Verse-Lift-Chorus-Verse-Lift-Chorus-Instrumental-(Lift\n\nOpt.)-Chorus\n\n5 of the 6 up-tempos and 50% of all #1s were written in 3rd form. The exception to this in up-tempo was Terri Clark’s “You’re Easy On The Eyes,” which was in 2nd form. This is significant because 3rd form is known as the most forgiving form because you can have a weak line or two in a verse but still have a huge chorus to save you. Plus, there’s a bridge to add information or show the listener the other side of the coin. With mid-tempos, all the forms were equally represented. As far as ballads go, we find that 4 of the 9 ballads were 3rd Form, followed by 3 in 2nd Form and 2 in 4th Form.\n\nPerson and tense\n\n100% of up-tempos were written in first person (I/Me/My).\n\nAdditionally, 72% included the second person (You/Your) and 39% used the third person, generally as a device for conflict. As far as tense goes, 83% of up-tempos were set in the present, with 27% in the past and only 15% in the future.\n\nAs for ballads, 89% used the first person, 89% included the 2nd, and 33% added the third person.\n\nThe artist\n\nLet’s add one more dynamic to this mix. Six of the 18 #1s were written or co-written by the artist, with five of the six being ballads. So the old A&R belief that ballads are artist-driven gains some credence given this information.\n\nYour best shot\n\nSo, you have Dog songs and you have Chicken songs. Where do you spend your demo dollar?\n\nYour best shot for getting a #1 record is to write:\n\nmid- to up-tempo\n\nromantic/humorous or sad/heartfelt theme\n\n4/4 time\n\ncontemporary pop/country style\n\nstory or conversation\n\n1st person or 2nd person\n\n3rd form\n\nlinear melody with a story to a soaring chorus\n\n13 second intro\n\nSo much for Chicken songs!\n\nI would like to acknowledge the invaluable assistance of Phil Goldberg and Chad Green indulging my “need to know” in helping research the above information. Most importantly, thank you, Mark Ford, for massaging and editing my lunatic fringe ramblings into a coherent form.\n\n- – - – - – - – -\n\n#19. A Look At The #1 Songs Of 2002\n\nYou are the smallest business inAmerica. Your product is a vital part of many of the largest businesses in the world (radio, TV, film, restaurants, clubs, hotels, supermarkets, etc.). The only reason they use your product is to make money. They grudgingly pay you a small portion of what you earn them, and you must raise a family, pay bills and create more product on that money. Demos are not cheap; opportunities to pitch your work are few.\n\nThis article is researched knowing that as a creator you write what you want, about what you want, how you choose to write it. However, when you have completed your song, you MUST change hats and become a small business person who understands what big business wants.\n\nI am constantly asked why, when doing my research, I only check out the songs that get to #1 on the charts. I am reminded that there are many wonderful songs that only go Top 5 or even Top 10. Well, back in the early ’70s, my first Country hit (“Good Enough To Be Your Wife” by Jeannie C. Riley) went to #2 and sat under “I Never Promised You A Rose Garden” by Lynn Anderson for a while before slipping back down the charts. Consoled by friends (who put another drink on my tab) that #2 was just as good as #1, I was haunted by the wise words of an old dog sled driver I used to know: “If you ain’t the lead dog, the view never changes.” So with those thoughts in mind, let’s look at what worked for radio at #1 in Country music in the year 2002.\n\nAnything in common?\n\nAbout the only thing that all 21 #1s had in common was the time signature(all were 4/4). I guess that means not a lot of people are waltzing out there — at least not during “drive time.” Something else these songs had in common was their race to the first use of the title. 19 of 21 used the title within the first 60 seconds (including intro!). While we’re on the topic of title use, let’s check out the number of repetitions of the title. The variance (including fades) went from 1.5 repetitions (“These Days” – Robson/Steele/Wells) to 14 repetitions (“Blessed” – James/Lindsey/Verges) with 8 of 21 having five or fewer repetitions, 9 of 21 having six to 10 repetitions and 4 of 21 having 10 or more repetitions of the title. 10 of 21 had five or six repetitions of the title.\n\nTempo and Intro\n\nUptempo songs held 12 of the 21 top spots with mid-tempos at 3 of 21 and ballads at 6 of 21. We have been told since the dawn of radio that 13 seconds is the perfect amount of intro. But, among the total of 21 songs that reached #1 in 2002, the length of intro averaged 14.2 seconds. However, if you remove the exceedingly long intros of “Who’s Your Daddy” — Keith and “The Long Goodbye” — Brady/Keating — whose combined intros totaled 57 seconds — the average intro time was — drum roll, ta-da, 13 seconds!\n\nTheme & Person\n\nThe themes at #1 Country were a blue-collar mix of Love Found (“Somebody Like You” — Urban/Shanks * “Good Morning Beautiful” — Cerney/Lyle * ” Beautiful Mess” — LeMaire/Mills/Minor), Love Celebrated (“Blessed” – James/Lindsey/Verges * “The Good Stuff” — Collins/Wiseman), Love Lost (“I Miss My Friend” — Martin/Nesler/Shapiro * “Bring On The Rain” — Darling/Montana), Patriotism (“Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning)” — Jackson * “Courtesy Of The Red, White And Blue (The Angry American)” — Keith), Drinking (“Ten Rounds With Jose Cuervo” — Beathard/Cannon-Goodman/Heeney) and Fishing (“I’m Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin’ Song)” — Paisley/Rogers). Hey, wait a minute. Love found, love celebrated, love lost, patriotism, drinking, fishing, maybe we’re getting back to real Country mus . . — oops, sorry, lost my head there for a minute. Anyway, the largest percentage of 2002 #1s were about love/relationships. In addition, 16 of all 21 #1s used the first-person pronouns (I, me, you, us) in line with Country songs being conversational and personal.\n\nChart Longevity\n\nRadio’s core audience (women 25-40) did allow themselves to be distracted from the love theme for a little patriotism (“Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)” — Jackson * “Courtesy Of The Red, White And Blue (The Angry American)” — Keith), but only briefly. Both songs were on and off the chart in fewer than 20 weeks. Women also tolerated one of their own finishing second to a bass boat (“I’m Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin’ Song)” — Paisley/Rogers) and letting a man behave badly (“Ten Rounds With Jose Cuervo” — Beathard/Cannon-Goodman/Heeney) for 31 weeks, probably secure in the knowledge that after 10 rounds of tequila, the ? would really feel bad. The other songs that kept the listeners’ attention for 30 or more weeks were all love songs, whether lost, found or celebrated individually or as a family. These 30-plus-week songs totaled 9 of 21.\n\nSong Length\n\nOne noteworthy observation is that there was only one #1 single under 3 minutes (“She’ll Leave You With A Smile” — Blackmon/Knowles) — in fact, 4 were 4 minutes or longer! A full 12 out of 21 #1s on the chart were longer than 3 minutes 30 seconds. Although the dean of Nashville songwriters, Harlan Howard, always said, “Only a dumbass takes more than 3 minutes to tell anything,” in defense of the songwriters, a large number of these songs could have been 3 minutes or much shorter. Some of the fades were a minute or more in length!\n\nSong Form\n\nOther than the larger number of topics writers were allowed to talk about in 2002, there was other good news. The 6th Form or “Rondeau” (or “Rondo” as W.O. Smith called it or “Honky Tonk Form” as Harlan Howard affectionately labeled it) reappeared at #1. (The basic Rondeau is Chorus-Verse-Chorus- Instrumental-Bridge-Chorus.) “Good Morning Beautiful” — Cerney/Lyle, written in Rondeau, held the listener for 26 weeks to get to #1, kept them singing along for six weeks at #1 and entertained them for a further 8 weeks after that in its most perfect structure for a whopping 40 weeks on the chart!\n\nNext came good old 2nd Form\n\n(Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Instrumental-Chorus). This form has been used for decades by Country writers, Rockers and Folkies to tell stories because of its flexibility — you can add verses to tell the whole story if you feel you need them. It therefore comes as no surprise that the patriotic themes of “Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning)” — Jackson and ” Courtesy Of The Red, White And Blue (The Angry American)” – Keith were best told without the frills of bridges, middle 8ths, lifts, channels, pre-choruses, etc.\n\nAnother solid, well-used form that seldom gets to #1 made three appearances. The 5th Form had its time in the sun, well represented by ” Somebody Like You” — Urban/Shanks, “The Cowboy In Me” –Anderson/Steele/Wiseman and “She’ll Leave You With A Smile” — Blackmon/Knowles. (The 5th Form’s major distinction is that there is no chorus; its verses have an AABA structure with the first or last line of the verse being the title/hook.) What “Somebody” and “Cowboy” shared was the addition of an extra verse. The fun thing in any craft is learning the rules and then breaking them — ask Picasso! Some of my personal favorite songs are written in 5th Form –”The Song Remembers When,” “Brown Eyed Girl,” “Somewhere In My Broken Heart” and so many more. I guess they don’t fit the needs of the drive time listener all the time but, hey . . .\n\nThe lion’s share of #1s were written in drive time’s best friends 3rd Form and 4th Form. 3rd Form at its most basic is Verse-(Verse Optional) -Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Instrumental-Chorus. 4th Form is Verse-Lift-Chorus-Verse-Lift-Chorus-(Bridge Optional)-Instrumental-(Lift Optional)-Chorus. Just to illustrate, the most pristine examples of these forms are “I Breathe In, I Breathe Out” — Cagle/Robbin (3rd Form) and ” Living And Living Well” — Martin/Nesler/Shapiro (4th Form). I confess that it’s great to see writers stretch and bend these forms. For instance, a couple of the 4th Form songs left out second verses entirely (“I’m Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin’ Song)” — Paisley/Rogers and “Who’s Your Daddy?” — Keith) yet still satisfied the listener and allowed the writer some freedom to have fun.\n\nOther items to note\n\nSpeaking of fun, HUMOR and IRONY are huge factors in a big radio song. Compound humor and irony with image-inducing detail (“under an old brass paperweight” / “feet on a hardwood floor” / “electric choke”), and you have all these wonderful ear-catching mini-hooks that expertly lead the listener to the real “hook” or logical conclusion. By creating an expectation and then so satisfactorily fulfilling it, the writer delivers.\n\nYour best shot\n\nI could ramble on for pages about how much fun it is to watch writers exercise their craft, but it’s time to cut to the chase. Based on last year’s numbers, what’s your best shot for getting a #1 record this year? As always, it helps to be the artist or to write with the artist, but considering the fact that two-thirds of the #1s in 2002 were not written or co-written by the artist, roll up your sleeves, look at your work and start by selecting love songs with an average length of three minutes to three minutes and thirty seconds, leaning toward mid- to up-tempo, in 4/4 time and in 3rd or 4th Form, using conversational first-person, heavy on humor and irony, packed with ear-catching details. Throw in a 13-second introduction, get your listener to the title in 60 seconds (or less) with the title repeating no more than seven times, and you’re in the running! Remember, when it comes to radio, your job is to hold the listener from the car commercial to the soda jingle through multiple daily repetitions for a minimum of five months (or in the case of “Good Morning Beautiful” — Cerney/Lyle, 10 months!). You must create something so simple that the listener gets it immediately yet so complex that it holds his or her attention for a lifetime. That’s the easy part! Now try getting an artist to record it . . .

The Award was presented by CMA CEO Steve Moore. “The industry has been more than generous with all the Irish, the Canadians, the Norwegians, the Australians, the Dutch, the Germans – everyone who’s come here to play Country Music,” said Murphy. “And it’s always been more than generous with me. You can’t ask for more in life than a chance and an opportunity of someone being fair with you.” The Jo Walker-Meador International Award recognizes outstanding achievement by an individual or company in advocating and supporting Country Music’s marketing development in territories outside the United States. It was named in honor of former CMA Executive Director (1959-1991) and Country Music Hall of Fame member Jo Walker-Meador Listen to “Word on Words” Hit songwriter, publisher, author and former President of the Nashville Songwriters Association International, Ralph Murphy was the featured guest on Nashville Public Television’s production of Word on Words.

John and Ralph will discuss his recently published book Murphy’s Laws of Songwriting, THE BOOK! In easy to grasp terms, Ralph talks about helping arm the songwriter for success by demystifying the process and opening the door to serious professional songwriting. You can listen to the entire program (mp3) by clicking here: http://wnpt.org/productions/wow/podcast/4006_RalphMurphy.mp3 About the book Achieving “hit writer” status has always been a formidable goal for any songwriter. Never more so however than in the 21st century. Catching the ear of the monumentally distracted, fragmented listener has never been more difficult. Getting their attention, inviting them in to your song and keeping them there for long enough for your song to become “their song” requires more than being just a “good” songwriter. Murphy’s Laws of Songwriting “The Book” arms the songwriter for sucess by demystifying the process and opening the door to serious professional songwriting. Hall of fame songwriter Paul Williams said in his review of the book “If there was a hit songwriters secret handshake Da Murphy would probably have included it.” From The Author This book represents a voyage of discovery. As a child, watching the joy/solace/comfort/pure pleasure people took in singing songs, I wanted to write the words and music that became “their song.” I wanted to hear those songs sung in the clubs, on the street, in the car, and in grocery stores. I wanted people dancing, falling in love, falling out of love, skating, or doing dishes to them. In other words, I wanted “hits.” Not just hits but big hits…hits that would last. - Ralph Murphy\n\nC",
  "latent_10433": "First it was marijuana — now, in the category or legalizing unlawful behaviors (that a whole lot of people participate in), Colorado lawmakers are considering the “Idaho stop.” The Idaho stop refers to a law passed in 1982 that allowed Idaho cyclists to treat stop signs like yield signs and red lights like stop signs. It’s a practice that tends to be loved by cyclists — and not-so-loved by drivers.\n\nIntroduced Jan. 18 by Senator Andy Kerr (D-Lakewood), the “safety stop” bill would allow cyclists to pass through intersections without stopping if they slow “to a reasonable speed, [yield] to vehicles and pedestrians, and can safely proceed or make a turn,” the Denver Post reports.\n\n“For most people who drive and don’t ride a bike, absolutely nothing changes,” Kerr, a cyclist, said, according to the Post. “Cyclists can hear and see much better than somebody in a car. And studies done on this show that it’s actually safer overall for both cars and bikes to not sit there at intersections.”\n\nAs Jen Kinney wrote for Next City in December, the Idaho policy made it “legal to do what cyclists already do.” Researchers in Chicago recommended the Idaho stop to city legislators last year after observing cyclists at six intersections. Only 2 percent of those observed made full stops — meanwhile 43 percent made Idaho stops and 55 percent didn’t stop at all.\n\n“What we saw is that cyclists are practicing common sense when it comes to intersections. They want to maintain their momentum but they also want to practice behavior that is in the best interest of their safety,” Jenna Caldwell, one of the DePaul researchers behind the study (and a cyclist herself), told Next City.\n\nA 2010 study from the UC Berkeley School of Public Health found similar results — the Idaho stop is credited with reducing cycling injuries by 14.5 percent the year after it was instituted.\n\nBut not everyone in Colorado is onboard, and one senator told the Post he wants “some kind of immunity for vehicles that might hit the cyclists for doing something like this.”\n\nFor now, though, cycling advocates in Denver and elsewhere around the state are rallying around the bill. And for those opposed to the notorious Idaho stop, at least they can be grateful that no one is proposing a “California stop,” — where everyone, cyclists and drivers alike — roll right on through.",

The cabinet tried to suggest that the transfer, pending approval from Parliament, merely returned Saudi Arabia’s own territory.\n\nSaudi Arabia transferred Tiran and Sanafir to Egyptian control in 1950 amid concerns that Israel might seize them.",
  "latent_10484": "The first shoes crafted specifically for running look nothing like the neon-tinged, rubber soled, breathable athletic sneakers of today. In fact, they look like they might be a weaponized dress shoe straight out of James Bond.\n\nThe oldest example still around from the earliest days of athletic wear is a shoe made by Thomas Dutton and Thorowgood in the early 1860s, on display at the Brooklyn Museum right now as part of their exhibit “The Rise of Sneaker Culture.”\n\nWhile track-and-field-type events have existed since ancient times (Ireland’s Tailteann Games date back to 1500 BCE [PDF]), running as a popular sport—with its own equipment—didn’t take off until much later. In the early 1800s, “pedestrianism,” or competitive walking, became popular among the leisure classes, followed by running. While the marathon is named after the 26.2 mile run Pheidippides took from Marathon to Athens in 490 BCE, it didn’t become a regular sporting event until the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.\n\nEarly running shoes looked a lot like typical men’s dress shoes, made of leather and with a small heel at the back. But they also featured spikes on the soles for grip, and an extra band of leather across the front of the shoe for support. Just take a moment to imagine the ensuing blisters.\n\n[h/t: Smithsonian]",

  "latent_10708": "HTTPS Made Easy: Setting up Caddy for PHP 7 on Debian Jessie\n\nCaddy is a modern open source HTTP/2 webserver written in Go. One of its most attractive features over other webservers (Apache, nginx, lighttpd, etc.) is that Caddy integrates with the free LetsEncrypt certificate authority to ensure all of your websites support HTTPS, out of the box.\n\n(Caveat: localhost and IP address virtual hosts are excluded from this automatic HTTPS, which also makes Caddy suitable for local development environments.)\n\nWhat follows is a step-by-step guide for getting the latest version of Caddy (0.8.3) set up on a freshly installed Debian Linux 8.5 (Jessie) server. Please note that this was written on July 17, 2016; if you are reading this in the distant future, some of the steps may be incorrect. (In all likelihood, it will become easier.)\n\nFirst Step: Hardening your Linux Kernel\n\nBefore you do anything else, make sure you're running the latest version of everything. This ensures you're not running vulnerable software.\n\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nNext, we generally recommend installing a Linux kernel with the grsecurity/PaX kernel patches. This adds a strong layer of exploit mitigation to the software running on your environment. This step is not required, but we highly recommend everyone use a hardened Linux kernel.\n\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-grsec-amd64\n\nRestart to boot into the new kernel, then proceed to install PHP 7.\n\nSetting up PHP 7 with the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM)\n\nDebian doesn't ship with PHP 7.0 by default. Fortunately, there's dotdeb for that. Verify then install their GPG public key, then add those entries as an apt source, like so:\n\necho \"deb http://packages.dotdeb.org jessie all\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotdeb.list echo \"deb-src http://packages.dotdeb.org jessie all\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotdeb.list wget https://www.dotdeb.org/dotdeb.gpg # SHA-384 is not vulnerable to length-extension attacks. However, this is a weak # verification that only stops transmission errors. # # You should verify the full fingerprint manually. echo \"ac6336bcd3883126c9976bd1e4aeff45be1a24e430be575c197954ce0b9288d0f4b35dfa675d72fb94bd35fd073aec27 dotdeb.gpg\" | sha384sum -c if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then sudo apt-key add dotdeb.gpg else echo \"Wrong public key\" exit 1 fi sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install php7.0-fpm\n\nThis is also a good point to install any PHP extensions (e.g. libsodium from PECL) that you may need.\n\nSetting up the Caddy web server\n\nThe best place to get Caddy is from the Caddy website, which allows you to customize which features you need. However, if you just need the core features accessible from wget , then the Github releases are your destination. (There is a freshly opened ticket to request Caddy releases be cryptographically signed. Once that's implemented, we will update this post with specific instructions.)\n\nAfter you download and extract the release, you'll need to delve into systemd configuration. This can get complicated quickly, and the instructions provided in the init/ directory target a newer version than Debian provides. Through trial and error, we managed to get the following instructions to work reliably:\n\nmkdir /tmp/caddy && cd /tmp/caddy wget https://github.com/mholt/caddy/releases/download/v0.8.3/caddy_linux_amd64.tar.gz # Extract: tar zxvf caddy_linux_amd64.tar.gz # Place the caddy binary in a standard location: sudo mv caddy_linux_amd64 /usr/bin/caddy # Remove newer systemd token (%I) from the caddy.service file and change the group # from 'http' to 'www-data': sed -e 's/%I//' init/linux-systemd/caddy\\@.service | \\ sed -e 's/=http/=www-data/' > \\ /lib/systemd/system/caddy.service # Make a global configuration directory: sudo mkdir /etc/caddy systemctl daemon-reload\n\nThe above commands set up the systemd service (in /lib/systemd/system/ ), create a directory /etc/caddy for placing your Caddyfile and any other configuration files, then reloads the systemd configuration.\n\nNext, you'll need to create a Caddyfile and store it at /etc/caddy/Caddyfile . Note that you can edit /lib/systemd/system/caddy.service if you want to change the location of the Caddyfile. An example Caddyfile follows:\n\nexample.com:80, example.com:443 { log /var/log/www_access.log fastcgi / /run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock php root /var/www/my_project/public rewrite { to {path} {path}/ /index.php?{query} } }\n\nOnce this is all done, enable then start the Caddy service and you're all set:\n\nsystemctl enable caddy.service systemctl start caddy.service\n\nNext Steps\n\nRead the documentation to learn how to better configure your website. If you're connecting to a domain name, it should automatically be served over HTTPS with a fresh LetsEncrypt certificate. It is for this reason that we highly recommend everyone use Caddy for web development in 2016 and beyond.",

If somebody in UKIP in the past did, well, so be it, but I think that people need to have a rounded education and sex education is part of that.\"\n\nThe questioner pointed out that the commitment to scrapping it was on the party's website, to which Mr Farage replied: \"I know there was a debate about sex education for four-year-olds, and whether that was appropriate but I don't think the age 11 was ever mentioned.\"\n\nUKIP's website states that its policy is to: \"Scrap sex and relationship education for children under the age of 11.\"\n\nMr Nuttall also told the party conference in Doncaster this autumn that \"UKIP is committed to the scrapping of sex and relationship education for children under the age of 11\".\n\nMr Farage later tweeted: \"Sorry, I missed the beginning of Mr Nuttall's conference speech. He did indeed lay out policy on sex education\" - with a link to the conference speech.\n\nConfusion\n\nIt comes after confusion, or disagreement, between Mr Farage and others in his party over various policies.\n\nMr Farage disowned an idea from the party's economy spokesman Patrick O'Flynn to impose a tax on high price items like shoes, which quickly became known as the \"handbag tax\".\n\nThe day before the Rochester and Strood by-election he was involved in a disagreement with his party's candidate - and now newest UKIP MP - Mark Reckless, who was criticised after implying that migrants might have to leave the country after a \"transitional period\" if the UK left the EU.\n\nMr Reckless suggested that they may have to apply for work permits and could face having to return to their home country.\n\nBut the party leader said no-one who came here legally before the UK left the union would face being forced to leave.\n\nMr Farage said Mr Reckless had been referring to the negotiations that would take place during a \"transitional period\" between a hypothetical vote to leave the EU and the actual moment of withdrawal.\n\nHe added: \"Anyone who has legally entered the country has a right to remain. We do not believe in retrospective legislation.\"",
  "latent_10821": "The public restrooms attached to a restaurant at Fault Line Park — closed for almost a year because the restaurant staff voiced safety concerns related to the area’s growing homeless population — will reopen to the public in the coming weeks, a city of San Diego spokeswoman said.\n\nJust two months after the East Village park opened in August 2015, Stella Public House employees said their concerns outweighed the benefits of having the restrooms open. They have remained locked despite a $1.6 million credit given to Pinnacle Bayside Development by the city to maintain the park and restrooms at Island Avenue and 14th Street.\n\nA day after inewsource’s recent story about the closed restrooms and park maintenance, signs were posted on streets surrounding the park about a property sweep and cleaning in the area. A row of homeless people, who residents said had been camped on sidewalks outside of the park since January, were also told to relocate.\n\nCity spokeswoman Katie Keach said the developer recently notified the city that the public will be able to use the restrooms, but will have to get a key in the restaurant.\n\nRELATED: Downtown Public Restrooms Remain Closed Despite Developer’s Promise To Maintain Them\n\nKeach said Pinnacle is responsible for maintenance of the park and restrooms, and for providing security in accordance with standards set forth in an agreement negotiated by Civic San Diego, a nonprofit that oversees redevelopment in parts of the city. Pinnacle also has constructed a high-rise apartment complex next to the park and restaurant.\n\n“Certain elements have proven to be more challenging than anticipated,” Keach said in an email. “The City has found that in certain areas, the Developer’s performance has not been to the required standards.”\n\nTim Graham, a spokesman for the Park and Recreation Department, said the city became aware of the breach in contract in December during a routine check of the park. He said that in July the city began monthly meetings with the developer to “work on the maintenance issues.”\n\ninewsource asked what other maintenance issues were discussed at the meetings, but got no response.\n\nIt is not clear whether the developer was providing adequate security, which many residents said was the biggest issue.\n\nIn response to an inewsource question about how the city will ensure equal access, Keach said Civic San Diego, the city and Pinnacle are still determining “the best action plan to have them open full time during park hours while remaining safe for all users.”\n\nTo view PDF documents, Download Acrobat Reader.",

  "latent_11215": "Philadelphia police say the alleged suspect responsible for the recent rash of armed robberies in Fairmount has been arrested.Ir started around 8:40 p.m. Friday when police say a man, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt with his face covered, grabbed a woman from behind as she exited her car at gunpoint.The suspect took the victims bag and other items and fled the scene, police say.Officers on patrol near 22nd and Brown noticed the suspect who matched the description of the robbery, and took him into custody.Police say the male is the prime suspect in four armed robberies dating back to October 15.The description in each armed robbery is the same and so is the way the assailant approaches his victims.The first robbery occurred around 8 p.m. Sunday in the 2200 block of Brown Street.Forty minutes later, police believe the same assailant struck again in the 2500 block of Poplar.Then Tuesday, just after midnight, a gunman mugged someone on the 800 block of N. 25th Street and struck again minutes later a few blocks away on N. 27th street.\"It's traumatic,\" said Merill Mason, who lives in the neighborhood. \"I keep looking to see if someone is hiding behind cars or coming up quickly behind me.\"Mason was attacked at 21st and Brown streets on March 14. News of these recent crimes is giving her flashbacks.\"He had come up behind me, cracked my head and dislocated my jaw,\" she said.Her assailant took off with her purse and was never caught.On Wednesday, while Frank Mannino and his daughter handed out flyers for their missing cat, they, like other neighbors, began to hear about the recent robberies on social media.\"I can deal with petty theft here and there, but armed robbery is not welcomed at all,\" said Mannino.Anyone with information regarding these incidents is asked to contact police.",
  "latent_11405": "When Twin Peaks stormed the airwaves 27 years ago, the creation of director David Lynch (hot off Blue Velvet, a cinematic masterpiece) and TV scribe Mark Frost (fresh from Hill Street Blues, a television classic) captivated audiences in novel ways that today are commonplace to the point of cliché. It was a high strange serialized drama and ironic soap opera, lacquered with prestige thanks to its cinematic panache and auteur branding. The storytelling roamed a spectrum of pitched, singular tones with striking emotional impact. One scene could move you to fanning and maybe some giggling with a hyper-sincere beat of sexy-sweet teen love, beautiful young faces shot in sensual close-ups. The next scene could scare the hell into you: A demonic serial killer enters as if out of the corner of the mind’s eye, sidling in slo-mo from the side of the frame, moving into the dead-center of the screen, huffing and puffing toward the camera, before finally crawling over a couch to get into your face. BOB is going get you, Maddie, BOB is going to get you…\n\nThere were also many deadpan jokes about donuts.\n\nOne mood ruled them all. Lynch’s favorite mood: mystery.\n\n“Twin Peaks is a mystery that holds other mysteries,” says the filmmaker with his trademark crypto-generic evasiveness when asked to describe the show for those who may know it. ABC marketed the living s—t out of the show’s inaugural, defining mystery, the brutal murder of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), a teenage beauty queen found dead, wrapped in plastic, and stuffed with a trove of dark secrets. Twin Peaks was so much more than a whondunit, but the network made the audience believe it was only about this bit of business. The tagline of the ad campaign that launched the show was “Who Killed Laura Palmer?” Lynch’s mesmerizing artistry captured our imagination for the question. We watched for the answer. We even tried to solve it. I certainly did. The son of a homicide detective, an avid consumer of mystery pop, I felt like Twin Peaks was made just for me. I treated the story like a crime scene. I actually took notes during the pilot. I held viewing parties after every episode and made my guests stay and parse the latest developments. By the middle of the sketchy second season, most of my friends had stopped coming over. Maybe I should have served snacks.\n\nI’d later learn I was far from alone. And so Twin Peaks taught us something else, a behavior that’s become a staple part of today’s TV watching experience: theorizing.\n\nTwin Peaks was a phenomenon of bygone TV era. There was no live tweeting, no Reddit, no post-mortems with producers breaking down episodes or discussing some “THAT” scene. What I would have given back for an immediate Q&A with Lynch to explain my #DancingGuyRedRoomDoppelgangerWTF? But there were online services back in 1990. And there were “bulletin boards” where the curious and perplexed gathered to debate and speculate.\n\nLynch can attest to this. He’ll also tell you he loved it.\n\n“One day I went into the studio where we were shooting and they showed me this stack of papers that was from the internet, this brand new kind of thing. There were no pictures, there was just typing,” he says. ”And the papers they showed me, it was just people talking about the show. People talking, thinking, sharing ideas, being like detectives, seeing what they make of certain things, trying to figure things out and to share ideas. It was a beautiful thing.”\n\nRELATED: Twins Peaks Stars on Why It Was a Cultural Phenomenon\n\nToday, cultural conversation about television is as voluminous and instantaneous as TV itself, if not more so. And all that typing takes many different forms: reviews, recaps, hot takes, close-reads, and miscellaneous geeking. We even have pictures! Viral videos, GIFs, flotsam and jetsam of appropriated images tagged with salty snark; I believe the kids call these “memes.” With podcasts, the TV talkback industrial complex has entered the talkie era. Coming soon to EW.com: James Hibberd’s Smell-o-Vision VR recaps of Game of Thrones. Can’t wait to get a deep whiff of The Hound!\n\nBut not all analysis is equal. And with all due respect to Mr. Lynch, there are some who think one of its most abundant expressions is no beautiful thing. As serialized sagas, mystery-driven dramas and surreal TV have exploded in recent years, the amount of theorizing – predicting developments, speculating solutions, interpreting dreaminess – has mushroomed, too. Last year was a banner year for theorizing, with shows like Mr. Robot and Westworld inspiring their viewers to obsessive forensic engagement. They also triggered a backlash, with critics like Matt Zoller Seitz and Willa Paskin voicing concern that producers who cater to the market for big twist TV risk doing at the expense of their artistry or the best possible articulation of their story.\n\nAs someone who writes traditional TV reviews and concocts recaps messy with predictions and conjectures, I’ve had a complicated and inconsistent response to complaints about theorizing. I believe another word for this is “hypocritical.” My attitudes tend to shift when I’m under the influence of some intoxicating mystery. When connections get made and an epiphany hits, no matter how lunatic, my aspiration to smart, respectable cogitation vaporizes into laughing gas. Doc Jensen emerges, more drunk nerd-clown than detective. I THINK WHITEROSE WAS HACKING INTO ALTERNATE REALITIES AT THE WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP POWER PLANT AND I MUST INFORM THE INTERNETS IMMEDIATELY.\n\nI don’t think there’s anything wrong or base about responding to mystery, ambiguity, and surrealism with questions, speculative answers, and “theorizing.” The exhortation to just absorb mystery, not solve it, is one of those arguments that makes a certain amount of sense until you think about it. How do I do that? Should I take that posture with any story? Are you actually encouraging me to be a couch potato? The argument that people should be passive consumers of storytelling designed to entertain by stimulating curiosity is a paradox I can’t quite reconcile. Playing detective with mystery fiction is part of the enjoyment of the genre. Just as romance fans ‘ship, mystery nerds theorize.\n\nStill, I should allow the critique of theorizing to sear me, a journalist, without defensiveness because it contains valid ideas that can only improve my work and fandom. (Yes, I consider fandom an improvable discipline.) Beyond diminishing the quality or quantity of more elevated critical discussion, theories have the potential to be spoilers if they happen to be correct. And theories that are wrong? They clutter the viewer’s mind with junk analysis and cloud their view of a show at the risk of diminishing their enthusiasm for it. If people read theories (and write them) to make sense of baffling or frustrating narratives, then bad wrong theories can confound people even more. I loved Lost to pieces, and I often broke it to pieces, with crushing overthink and reckless playfulness that got in the way of serving readers who wanted clarity, not entertaining crazy, especially in the final season.\n\nNow, the show that inspired in many a zeal for mystery and theorizing is back. Twin Peaks is returning on May 21 with an 18-episode series on Showtime, written by creators Mark Frost and David Lynch and directed entirely by Lynch. One major meta-storyline about this pop culture event that I’ll be tracking is how today’s TV watching culture, high and low, processes it. While Lynch and Frost refuse to say much about the show, they definitely seem interested in giving people something to talk about. Lynch won’t say if the new Twin Peaks will be like the old Twin Peaks, a “mystery that holds other mysteries.” (“It could be,” he says coyly.) But he does differentiate between two different kinds of shows: “Some shows, there’s not much room for the viewer to move within. It’s a surface thing. You watch it, bang, you’ve got it. Then there are other shows where there might be things to wonder about.”\n\nI asked Lynch if he has any concerns about fan theorizing – if he worries about theories that might misrepresent his work, if he worries bad theories might clutter minds and lead people astray. “This whole thing of leading people astray is interesting,” he says. “But I always say, we all see something different in a story, and I love that. If things like this happen with Twin Peaks, it’s a great thing.” He understands that not everyone enjoys the kind of mystery he makes, particularly films like Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, or Inland Empire, in which experiences are to be interpreted, where certainties are elusive. “Some people don’t like not knowing things. They like a concrete thing, something that is what it is,” he says. “Other people love room to dream. They don’t mind getting lost in a mystery. It makes them think and feel, and this is a beautiful thing.”\n\nWe at EW think talking, wondering, and theorizing about Twin Peaks is a beautiful thing, too. We intend to do a lot of it over the next several months, and hopefully do it well, beginning with our latest podcast launching today, A Twin Peaks Podcast: A Podcast About Twin Peaks. (Listen to the first episode, above). Over the next three weeks, Darren Franich and I will be looking back on and puzzling over the first two seasons of the show and the prequel film, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. Then, beginning May 22, we’ll be posting a podcast recap of each new episode of the revival. We don’t just want to vent and discuss our loopy ideas about the episode – we want to air and celebrate your inspired thinking as well. If you have theories, tweet us at @EWDocJensen and @DarrenFranich, or email us at twinpeaks@ew.com. We look forward to taking the journey with you. Let’s rock!",
  "latent_11603": "[Update]: There is also a HireDanMullen.com (hat tip to What a Maroon!), which looks like it is likely operated by the same person or group of persons running WeWantDan.com.\n\n[Original Story]: We knew this was coming; the only question was when it would finally come and from whom. After Mississippi State took down the #2 Auburn Tigers 38-23 at home on Saturday night, many of us began to wonder how long it would be before the bigger schools in need of a coaching refresh would come knocking at the door Coach Mullen.\n\nCouple MSU's recent rise with Florida's demise and you have your answer: This weekend.\n\nFlorida fans have officially started their campaign to hire Dan Mullen with the website WeWantDan.com. Mullen, as you may recall, was the Gator's offensive coordinator under former head coach Urban Meyer from 2005 through 2008. MSU hired him away in December of 2008 following the resignation of Sylvester Croom, and UF head coach Urban Meyer would step down two years later, leaving the door open for current head coach Will Muschamp to be hired.\n\nThings haven't gone great, to say the least, under Muschamp's direction, however, and Florida fans seem more than ready to move on and consider the Muschamp era a failure. While Muschamp is known a a strong defensive mind, his offensives have suffered in his four years in Gainesville, leaving the program far from the days of Tim Tebow and the high-flying offenses of Mullen and Urban Meyer's tenure.\n\nFrankly, this is more flattery than a serious concern at this point in the season. The Gators will definitely see the season through, and Mullen has far more important things on his mind than skipping town on a midnight train in October. As State fans, however, we should prepare ourselves to see more of this, because this is what comes with success. For now let's just sit back, relax, and enjoy the season we're having, and we can worry about Dan's being courted by larger programs a few months down the road.\n\nStill, we might want to go ahead and get those checks written, just to be prepared.",
  "latent_11702": "Take a trip to a New York ice-rink at the weekend and you're likely to see a middle-aged Japanese man jumping and spinning in perfect harmony with Newtonian physics. This is Michio Kaku's idea of relaxation; no relativity, little friction - just one man and the three laws of motion. He moves almost effortlessly, his blades carving perfect patterns in the ice; but then the three-dimensional world should present few problems to a man who is equally at home in 11.\n\nKaku is the Henry Semat professor of theoretical physics at the City University in New York, and the man who, in the late 1960s, co-founded the field theory of strings - the equation that united a complex series of equations which described the behaviour of sub-atomic particles into a coherent whole.\n\nMention string theory - the notion that an electron is not a dot, but a rubber band which, if vibrated enough times, can turn into every single sub-atomic particle in the universe - to most people and you get a glazed incomprehension: but to theoretical physicists it is just about the hottest topic around. \"It either explains everything, or it explains nothing,\" Kaku shrugs, though his expression tells you exactly which side of the fence he is on.\n\nOver in the US you can buy a T-shirt with Kaku's equation printed on the front, but it has taken a while for him to gain this recognition. Back in 1974, he was laughed off campus when it was discovered that strings could only vibrate coherently in 10-dimensional hyperspace, and Kaku groans as he remembers being taunted by the Nobel laureate Richard Feynman with \"How many dimensions are you living in today?\".\n\nKaku started work on another theory, only to realise he was looking at the same phenomenon at a higher vibration on the rubber band. And no one is laughing any more. For years, physicists and cosmologists have been searching for the grand theory that united quantum physics and gravity theory. Einstein spent the last 30 years of his life on just this problem, trying, in his words, \"to read the mind of God\".\n\n\"He got to the fourth dimension and dabbled with the fifth,\" says Kaku, \"but there wasn't yet the understanding of the nuclear force and quark model to allow him to progress. String theory is now the only real contender for the grand unified theory; everything else has fallen by the wayside. If Einstein had never lived, we would have been able to determine all his ideas from string theory.\"\n\nKaku slips into overdrive as he explains all the implications. \"String theory predicts the universe is like a soap bubble that is expanding and dying,\" he says. Billions of years from now stars will blink out; the night sky will be dark and the oceans will freeze over. But we may have an escape route. Our soap bubble co-exists with other soap bubbles; every time a black hole forms it may be creating a baby universe. The matter being sucked in may be blown out the other side, creating a white hole in a twin universe, which will expand very rapidly, like our own Big Bang.\n\n\"Perhaps, also, a Type III civilisation, which can harness the Planck energy, will open a hole in space and tunnel through a wormhole to a parallel, warmer universe. There is no other hope. Either leave the universe or die with it. If the wormhole is microscopic in size then we may send a nanobot that can reproduce itself indefinitely and create cloning factories to recreate the dead civilisation through it.\"\n\nThis sounds like something out of Star Trek, but Kaku is deadly serious as he goes on to talk up his latest variation of string theory - M (membrane) theory, which operates out of 11 dimensions - and to speculate on multi-worlds theory, a new version of quantum theory, which predicts there may be clones of ourselves with separate lives. \"It sounds crazy,\" he admits, \"but we can't apologise for it as it's a possibility.\" He notices my eyebrow rise. \"It's a theory that's being pushed strongly by physicists over here in Oxford,\" he adds, as if to show it's not just some nutty Stateside notion.\n\nKaku's voice washes easily over you. Each sentence makes sense. It's only when you get to the end of each paragraph that you realise you're hopelessly lost. But you don't really care, because it is never less than entertaining. And - academic credentials aside - this is Kaku's strong point. In the US, he's a regular contributor to the Wall Street Journal and has his own weekly radio show that explains the ins and outs of hyperspace and parallel universes.\n\nIt's a skill that was born out of necessity. \"I remember being at the final congressional hearing in 1994 to decide whether the US government would fund the building of an atom smasher outside Dallas that would be twice the size of that at Cern, Geneva,\" he says. \"A physicist was asked, 'Will we find God?'. The reply came back, 'We will find the Higgs Boson [sub-atomic particle].' That answer cost US physics the £12bn project.\n\n\"Thinking back, I would have said, 'This machine will take us as close as humanly possible to his or her greatest creation - genesis itself. It will give us a window on the instant of creation.' Before 1990, physicists only had to say 'Russia' to get their hands on cash, but since the end of the cold war, we have had to learn the language of the taxpayer.\"\n\nIt's a language that Kaku now speaks fluently, and the financial rewards have been forthcoming. Tempting as it is to caricature theoretical physicists as a bunch of geeks happy to operate in a mathematically pure vacuum, the reality is rather different. For the theoretical is rapidly becoming practical, as billions of dollars are now being spent to test the validity of string theory.\n\nWhen Cern opens for business in two years' time, Kaku expects physicists to find evidence of sparticles - higher vibrations of the superstring, echoes from the 11th dimension. But his biggest hopes are pinned on the Laser Inferometry Space Antenna (Lisa), which will be launched in 2011. \"Lisa is three satellites connected by laser beams which stretch 3m miles across space. This may pick up shock waves from the instant of creation, and maybe even pick up the umbilical cord of our universe.\"\n\nKaku's bet is that string theory will then be verified, but there's plenty happening here on earth to keep him occupied. Both string and M theory predict that gravity can seep across parallel universes - which means their existence can be proven by looking for deviations from Newton's inverse square law of gravity. One such experiment has already been conducted in Denver. \"The results came back negative,\" he smiles, \"but this just shows there are no parallel universes in Denver. Physicists in Atlanta are already planning to repeat the experiment at the atomic level.\"\n\nIt's hard to keep track of parallel universes, especially when Kaku keeps insisting they could be here, right now, in your living room and that there could be a universe in which Elvis Presley never died and in which Hitler was never born. But maybe Kaku's own life encourages him to believe in his own parallel world. For in most normal worlds, the first-born son of Japanese immigrants who were interned outside San Francisco during the second world war don't go on to refine and redefine Einsteinian physics.\n\nHis awakening came on hearing the news of Einstein's death when he was eight years old. \"I saw this picture of his unfinished work lying on his desk,\" he says, \"and it became like a real-life murder mystery that I wanted to solve.\" By the time he was 16, Kaku had bought 400lb of steel and 22 miles of copper wire and had built his very own atom smasher in the family garage. It was powerful enough to pull fillings out of teeth, but the only thing it smashed was the house. \"It broke every fuse and ruined every circuit breaker,\" he admits ruefully.\n\nBut it had the desired effect. Kaku came to the attention of the renowned US physicist Edward Teller, who took him under his wing and secured him a scholarship to Harvard. Even then there was a parallel twist. \"I discovered later that all Teller's scholarship students were earmarked for the Star Wars programme at Los Alamos,\" Kaku says. \"I was offered a chance to work there, but I've always thought science was about creation, not destruction. So I turned it down.\"\n\nKaku's legacy remains unclear. He could go down in history as a brilliant but misguided mathematician or he could be the first person to read the mind of God. But you sense that he isn't too bothered either way. \"String theory is the only game in town,\" he says, \"and you can't afford not to play it to the end.\" In any case, isn't there a parallel universe in which there's a Michio Kaku who reckons string theory is a load of nonsense?\n\n\"Quite possibly,\" he laughs, before teleporting himself out of the room.\n\nThe CV\n\nName: Michio Kaku\n\nAge: 57\n\nJob: Henry Semat professor in theoretical physics, City University of New York\n\nBefore that: visiting professor at Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton\n\nRadio: hosts Explorations, an hour-long programme in the US\n\nPublications: Nine books, including Parallel Worlds, Hyper space and Visions, and more than 70 articles\n\nLikes: figure skating\n\nDislikes: hiding in foxholes for the US army\n\nMarried: with two children",

  "latent_11754": "With all the people leaving the Mormon church over the past week, due to the Church’s bigoted stance toward gay couples and their children, Mark Naugle has been working like mad to make sure all those resignation letters are being processed correctly.\n\nHe’s an immigration attorney by trade, but he knows what it takes to leave the Church since his own family did it when he was a teenager. Several months ago, he posted on Reddit about how he could help people through the process for free. When the new policies were made public, there were more people than ever before looking for the exit sign, and he’s been helping as many of them as he can.\n\nThe obvious question is: Why would Mormons need a lawyer in order to tell the Church they want out?\n\nHe explained why to Michelle Woo at Upvoted:\n\nA lot of people don’t realize how difficult it is to leave. My grandmother who’s a Lutheran in Kansas says, “Well, if I don’t want to go to church anymore, I just stop going.” But it’s not that easy with the Mormon church. If you attempt to resign from the church on your own, you’re going to be contacted by your local bishop. He’s going to come over and start asking you questions to figure out what you’ve done wrong and why you don’t have a testimony anymore. He’s going to put you on a 60-day probation period. He’s going to call your family, the neighbors and everyone in the congregation so they can start helping you stay in the fold. It’s essentially a form of harassment. I don’t think they do it maliciously necessarily, but they feel that your eternal salvation is on the line. This process can take three to four months with a lot of pain and suffering. For most people, it’s not worth it to do it that way. [Under my representation,] people fill out the forms and send them back to me. I’ll print them, sign them and mail them to the church. When I receive confirmation that their name has been removed, I email them.

Let us instead focus on the age old question that the tweet stems from, ‘What is so special about Malala?’.\n\nPerhaps it isn’t common knowledge that Malala put her life on the line at the age of 11 to act as a correspondent to BBC Urdu so that the Taliban’s growing influence could be reported. Perhaps, she is is like ‘everyone else’ when she became the only person to take up the task amongst all the other schools girls who were scared for their lives.\n\nDespite this, there exist some rational arguments that can be made regarding the issue. The West’s admiration of Malala can very well be seen as hypocritical as it overlooks the plight of other innocent victims in drone strikes, for example, but to cast shame and abuse on a girl that remains an activist to this way and has earned her place the university on the same criterion as everyone else, is devoid of any knowledge of the work she has been able to accomplish with or without the West’s help.",

  "latent_12465": "Twenty years ago, futurist pundits talked breathlessly about the New Freelancer - master of his own destiny, nimble, entrepreneurial, the new warrior for the information age. The stolid, dull employees working for their daily wages were the peons of this age, safe and secure and unmotivated, their gray existence colorful only in comparison to government bureaucrats.\n\nTwenty years on, this vision has gone from wild prognostication to reality, and as is typical of reality, the picture of employment is considerably more nuanced that many of these early thinkers about jobs described. In some respects there are more opportunities, but these opportunities usually come at a higher skill cost (the amount of time and money necessary to gain proficiency in these skills). Meanwhile, unskilled and semi-skilled labor numbers are still anemic, eight years after the economic meltdown. This is, to me, an indication of a revolution in automation.\n\nI've come to believe that automation has multiple stages where it impacts employment.\n\nStage 0 Societies. Physical labor dominates, and any tools that exist have a low multiplier effect. For instance, the harnessed plow can turn a field perhaps three to four times as fast as a human digging and tilling directly. Let's say for convenience sake that the time involved for a single person to do something has a multiplier of 1x, If you take the base ten logarithm of human powered activity, it will be somewhere between 1x and 10x that base level, or between 0 and 1 logarithmically. Let's call this stage zero, predicated upon human or animal muscle power. .\n\nStage 1 Societies. The second stage of automation comes when technology reaches a point where it can be used to harness the power of natural energy sources - coal, river movements, oil, wood burning, and so on. With the exception of hydrodynamic systems (water wheels on rivers), most of the power in this case is steam power, heating up water to the point of producing steam, which then can be used to move turbines.\n\nStage 1 technology had comparatively little impact upon human labor replacement, but it went a long way towards replacing animal muscle. Steam ships and steam locomotives could move more mass, and so began to put drovers and carters out of business, as well as the human treadmills long used to employ the poor, long before they were used by the wealthy to keep weight off.\n\nWhat steam could do, however was to drive looms and lathes and drills. Since steam did still require people to shovel coal or other fuels to heat the boilers, it actually, at least for a while, increased the need for certain manual labor, but not so frequently as before. Stage 1 implied an efficiency of 10 to 100 times human labor.\n\nMid-to-late stage one systems will also develop printing, giving rise to the distribution of information beyond what can be hand-copied. Monks and clerics give way to printers and publishers.\n\nStage 2 Societies. One aspect of the stage 1 era was the fact that it made possible tools that were themselves useful for building tools. In the beginning of Stage 2 (100 to 1000 times human labor), technology began to improve significantly. You could create higher quality metals capable of withstanding more pressure, which in turn allowed you to create higher energy levels. At the start of stage 1, most tools are hand fabricated. By the time of stage 2, most tools are partially or wholly made using automation. At this point, you also see the direct consumption of hydrocarbons, usually to move pistons. Oil and gas begin to be used.\n\nThis is the point where technology's impact on labor begins to be felt. During stage 0, it may take a seamstress a week or more to create even simple clothes, and several weeks or even months to make complex ones, by the beginning of stage 2, it becomes possible to create a reasonably complex shirt within a few hours,, and to do so consistently. Indeed, consistency becomes the byword of the Stage 2 era. By establishing standards, you can apply automation to larger projects, and you can begin the process of distributing tasks. Most stage one tools are produced in the same shop as the things they are used on, but most stage two tools and intermediate products are likely shipped elsewhere for additional processing.\n\nSupply chains emerge, as does increasingly specialized labor. Animals all but disappear in cities, as transportation takes advantage of the burning of hydrocarbons. Most hanson drivers lose their jobs, but the era of the cabby arrives. Indeed, those who lose their jobs usually have multiple new niches to move into, and the mills and factories become greedy for new workers. The irony of the Luddites movement was that even as these general workers were protesting the rise of specialized machines that were making them obsolete, there would end up being so much new labor slots being created that eventually the Luddites couldn't find enough people to protest.\n\nInformation technologies in stage 2 societies begin to jump as it becomes possible to print books, newspapers and magazines in large numbers. More and more people are employed as writers, journalists, editors and publishers, professions which are only marginally feasible in a stage 1 society. Information technology at this time was centered on printing, but also saw the rise of photography and photo-lithography. Information spreads quickly, and again new jobs appear faster than old ones become obsolete.\n\nStage 3 Societies. Electricity becomes standardized. The problem with oil or gas as a fuel in Stage 2 societies is that the fuel to power these factories directly drives gears. This means that gearing becomes so absolutely critical in late stage 2 societies - anything beyond the longest belt is no longer directly powered. With the codification of the laws of electromagnetism it becomes possible to transmit power over wires, and to utilize electromagnetic waves to transmit signals. One person can now do from 1000 to 10,000 times as much as they could do in Stage 0 societies.\n\nTo put this into perspective, at the beginning of stage 0, it takes a glassblower roughly a day to create a bottle. By the beginning of stage 3, a bottler can produce upwards of 1000 bottles a day, and by the end of that period can produce 10,000. Most manufacturing companies now use machines to do a significant portion of the overall processing, though humans still are required for more complex actions. Mass production becomes the norm during this period.\n\nElectricity also has a profound impact upon communication. While reading is still commonplace, listening to radio or watching early television begins to replace this, and societies begin a process of standardization of ideas as well. It is now possible, if expensive, to communicate between New York and Los Angeles in real time, but dissemination still favors links between larger cities and only later towards smaller ones.\n\nPetroleum becomes the primary driver for transportation. even as labor participation in manufacturing growth begins to slow due to automated systems. You need more drivers, but fewer iron mongers, more engineers, but fewer builders. Stage 3 is the period of labor's height, but there are storm clouds brewing.\n\nStage 4 Societies. At stage 4 (one person can now do up to what 100,000 stage 0 people can do), the computer arrives. During WWII, while the iconic picture of women's emerging power in society is Rosie the Riveter, one of the most common occupations for women were as computers - women (and a few men) who either did sums manually or used gear driven calculators. Electrical computers had largely eliminated the position of the \"personal computer\" within fifteen years.\n\nManufacturing has become fully machine automated, but this is also the period in which robots - machines capable of limited decision making capability - also appear. Communication technologies advance rapidly, and it becomes logistically possible to move production facilities to areas of lowest cost (outsourcing). For wealthy countries with high wages and standards of living, this is a body blow. The biggest rise in jobs comes in the information sector (though it is small compared to the overall labor market) and in services that represent person to person interaction.Technology is evolving rapidly, and staying \"current\" becomes harder for even for intelligent people.\n\nEnergy constraints become a concern, because the overall cost of energy has been increasing with increased utilization and drawdown of energy reserves. The US in 1970 reached the stage where it was consuming more oil based energy than it was producing. By 2007, the world as a whole reached that point, and is currently in a plateau.\n\nMost of the jobs that were created in Stage 3 societies are now obsolete, and an increasing percentage of the population withdraws from the labor pool. towards the end of Stage 4, the pace of innovation in communication technologies, and the race to sustain or grow energy into Stage 5 heats up. After every recession, the number of new jobs is lower than it was before, and it takes longer and longer to reach full utilization.\n\nWe are about 85% of the way through Stage 4, which should phase into Stage 5 somewhere around 2035.\n\nStage 5 Societies. In a stage 5 society, one person has a reach of between 100,000 and one million stage 0 people. To put this in perspective, the global population will peak at between 9.5 and 11 billion people around 2050. To support this population will require (towards the end of this era), roughly 10,000 people. Ten thousand jobs, about the size of a small town.\n\nThis is the era of sapient computation. Computers and robots are capable of doing almost any human job, from digging a ditch to being president of the United States to solving complex mathematical theories. In this era, the number of \"jobs\" in the traditional sense will plummet, reaching a stable point only at the level where it is not cost effective to create a robot to accomplish a given task, which will almost certainly be designed and built by another robot powered by a wide array of local and networked computer nodes.\n\nTransportation will be handled by autonomous vehicles that can run 24/7. Agriculture will be handled by mechanical pickers that make employing illegal aliens prohibitively expensive, by mechanical harvesting engines and tractors. Manufacturing will have moved back onshore, because off-shoring no long makes sense economically (India and China, which both benefitted dramatically in the Stage 4 societies, are beginning to feel the pressures of this already). Retail will disappear into the clouds, delivery will be handled by drones - air, land and sea. Security, policing and the military are already moving in this direction, to the extent that by 2100, \"wars\" will be primarily specialized \"surgical\" strikes run primarily by businesses. Most non-live entertainment will be virtual, and in most cases will be fully configurable by the viewer.\n\nThat work is going away. Within the next century (and perhaps even half century), there will be no task that a human is capable of doing that a machine or AI won't be able to do better.\n\nThis is not to say that humans won't be doing at least some of these jobs, only that human beings have become essentially optional to the world of work.Service jobs will generally last the longest here, because there are high touch aspects to such jobs that people will be disinclined to abandon, but even there anything that is immediately out of the public eye will be automated.\n\nMost of the jobs that will exist at that point will be artisanal or anachronistic in nature. Creating paper newspapers out of purely non-electronic parts. Cooking \"authentic\" meals. Shoeing horses, which might actually make a comeback as a protest against automated vehicles. Recycling, refabricating, building for exploration of ideas, hosting a maker culture that bears more similarity to Steampunk Fantasy than corporate America ca. 1950. .Neal Stephenson explored this culture in his novel The Diamond Age, an underappreciated novel that sadly is looking even more prescient than Snow Crash was.\n\nThis will be a time of massive social upheaval. Our entire society is predicated upon the wage economy, which will become a curious relic within the lifetime of many alive today. The wage economy is in the process of collapsing even now (the growing income disparity is one fairly strong indication of this), and the investment economy will evaporate before that, as it requires the support of the wage economy to exist. What will replace that?\n\nStage 5 economies are not nationalistic, but rather are increasingly based upon economic circulation patterns. Political borders will become increasingly porous, not because of large scale political unions (such as the EU) but because the ability of governments to project force will diminish compared to those of the megacities. Vancouver, BC, Canada is far more like Seattle, Washington or Portland, Oregon than it is like Toronto, and Seattle has far more in common with San Francisco - political beliefs, economic trading partners, population distributions, technological levels, than either have with Washington DC, Dallas, Texas, or New York City.\n\nThe same thing is happening globally. As the trends from automation continue to change the balance of power, the Cascadian League will become stronger locally (as one example) than the United States will in terms of loyalty to it's citizens, and you'll see the emergence of these de facto states even if there is no formal map drawn that shows a border. In a few cases, these changes may happen cleanly, but it is far more likely that such power shifts will become battles between competing interest groups.\n\nStage 6 Societies. When automation moves beyond the 1,000,000 Stage 0 people equivalent, we get into a realm that is pure speculation. My suspicion is that (assuming energy requirements can continue to be met, which I don't think is necessarily a given) the distinction between human and machine will cease to exist. During Stage 5 societies, there will be an uneasy coexistence between purely natural biological human beings and the rise of enhanced humanity.\n\nOne aspect of this that's just in its infancy today is the rise of biological computing systems and interfaces. Silicon based electronics (or spintronics) is simply not a good medium for integration with organic systems. They produce a prodigious amount of heat, they require too heavily upon toxic metals, and they do not work the way that organic systems do. It is likely that in stage 5 societies that we'll create cybernetic humans (we're doing that to a certain extent even today), but that this will become a dead-end as better alternatives emerge.\n\nIn its place will emerge a general understanding of biocyber technologies that take advantage of the largely chemical nature of most biological systems. Bio-antennas embedded in (or grown into) bones or the skull, coupled with controlled bio-nanites that became a new cell-type, will likely end up becoming the typical conduit. Stem cells, the pre-potent cells that form into bones, skin, muscles and organ tissue, will become modifiable to create new organic entities. These will be enhanced human beings, capable of interacting wirelessly with cyber-organic robots and more traditional silicon based electronics, spintronics, optical, holographic and quantum computer systems.\n\nOn the flipside, these \"computers\" will also take on many of the characteristics of living beings - the ability to heal, to grow, to adapt and change forms in response to external threats or needs.\n\nAlready some of this is happening. Researchers recently were able to add two new stable (reproducable) \"letters\" into DNA, capable of expanding the types of proteins that can be created, in effect creating an entirely new phylum of life distinct from traditional DNA based systems. Sequencing costs have dropped from nearly $1 billion dollars and a decade the first full sequence in 1999 to $1000 and a few hours today. With sequencing comes a fuller understanding of the operating system of life.\n\nWith this, both the phenome (the shape of humans) and the genome (the reproducibility of that shape) becomes malleable, and the distinction between human and computer largely disappears, partially because people can shape themselves to suit their desires, partially because there's no longer any distinction between inside and outside. AIs can drive seemingly human bodies. Humans can mentally access the growing web, and can perform actions with a thought anywhere within this sphere.\n\nAt this point, the question of what jobs will do becomes largely moot. My guess is that as this stage fully takes hold you will see the emergence of a great diaspora as all aspects of being human become fully explored. Some will voluntarily remove themselves from the web, reverting back to an earlier stage deliberately (and not all will be human as we know them today). Some will discorporate entirely, existing purely in a virtual mode. Some will cycle through physical and virtual forms. Short of making things like Al Cubierre drives capable of FTL, this may in fact be the necessary precursor to interstellar space exploration.\n\nSummary\n\nThis breakdown looks at the idea that automation follows a logarithmic scale of growth, and that each stage tends to develop its own roles about the nature of business, employment and the shape of society. If the trends continue unabated, then the next stage will see the emergence of a very different society where \"real jobs\" becoming increasingly rare, but where, if society can balance out the benefits achieved by automation with the requirement to insure that basic needs are made, the vocations that people undertake can be done without fear of going hungry or becoming homeless.\n\nOne major caveat here - this is all predicated upon energy. So long as the energy exists to push societies towards the next stage growth will occur. However, we're in a very delicate state right now, one where if we fail to secure that energy future then the potential for systemic economic collapse becomes stronger. I'll be covering this in more detail in an upcoming post \"Collapse\".\n\nKurt Cagle is an author and blogger, founder of Semantical LLC, and a student of the future. .",
  "latent_12478": "A make-up artist dabs a bit of powder in his chubby face, then allows politician Frank Schäffler to fall into a deep leather sofa. In just a few moments, the evening talk show he is appearing on will be recorded. Snacks dry out on silver platters as other guests chatter excitedly, but Schäffler remains focused. He's come to say one sentence. His sentence.\n\nSo, Mr. Schäffler, the presenter soon asks, would it be best if Greece were to leave the euro-zone?\n\n\"If Greece were to do that itself, then I would recommend it,\" he says.\n\nThe sentence is a bit indirect, but its content is Schäffler's show-piece. Greece should return to the drachma, the member of parliament with Germany's pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) believes. It's a provocative message that hardly even a dozen German parliamentarians have allowed to cross their lips -- and one that is making the former insurance broker a potential serious risk for Chancellor Angela Merkel's government. Should the chancellor fail to achieve a majority in parliament for such a fundamental question as saving the euro, her center-right coalition government could collapse.\n\nWhile other politicians staunchly defend another Greek bailout worth billions, one can count on Schäffler taking the extreme opposite position. From inside the government camp, he encourages the Greeks to either sell their beloved islands, famous the world over as vacation destinations, to raise cash or to leave the monetary union. The vote in parliament that only just approved a negotiating mandate for a new bailout is still fresh, but the member of the FDP, Merkel's junior coalition partners, is already threatening the chancellor with another embarrassment.\n\nWhen the Bundestag votes on the next multibillion-euro tranche of loans for Greece and the future European Financial Stabilization Mechanism (EFSM) -- the 700 billion, permanent euro rescue fund, into which Germany will transfer actual cash for the first time instead of just guarantees -- Schäffler wants to vote against the measures and convince others to do the same.\n\nNo Forum Too Small\n\nTo spread his message, he traveled some four hours away from his electoral district in eastern Westphalia, in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, to appear on the talk show in Berlin in mid-June. Some 140,000 people watched his appearance, a market share of about a half-percent. Still, no forum is too small for his mission, Schäffler says.\n\nHe has neither charisma nor a good network. Schäffler is a politician with only one issue -- the euro. He gets his strength from the targeted breach of a taboo, doing something that the German political system isn't designed for. He's sticking to his opinion regardless of whether it runs counter to his party's euro-friendly tradition or trips up the coalition government he is part of. Meanwhile, the majority of Germans back his views. Up to 60 percent of the country's people reject plans for a second bailout for Greece, while a number of economists have been encouraging speedy debt restructuring.\n\n\"Mr. Schäffler, I'd like to thank you heartily for your straightforwardness,\" a member of the audience says in the windowless lecture hall at the University of Marburg at the end of June. He's been invited by the FDP student group, and around 180 people are present -- a success. Schäffler paints a picture of a currency in downfall. The governments break laws amongst themselves to provide aid for each other, while the central bank becomes a dumping ground for unprofitable securities, and politicians devalue the euro just like the medieval counterfeiters of gold and silver coins. Instead of posing a question, an audience member thanks Schäffler, while others rap their knuckles on the desks in approval. The meeting takes on a festive tone.\n\nSchäffler smiles sheepishly. His cheeks are red, and behind his thin wire-framed glasses his eyes dart back and forth. He is 42-years-old with slightly graying hair, but he looks like a student at his final high school exam.\n\nThe former back-bencher is still getting a feel for his new role as a resistance fighter. Initially he was driven by the worry that the billions in bailout payments would bury Germany's future. \"When 80 million people holding life insurance contracts are all afraid of inflation, it affects the substance of democracy,\" he says, having loosened up from all the attention. \"People tell me to found my own party,\" he says. \"I tell them that's a thousand times harder than changing the FDP from the inside out.\"\n\nGaining Support\n\nAs the bad news about the euro multiplies, Schäffler's position wins new supporters. When he voted against the first bailout package in parliament more than a year ago, he was the only member of the FDP to do so. Not long after, when the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) came up, he had two sympathizers in his party's parliamentary group. The motion with which he tried to unite the FDP in rage over the euro had 173 supporters at the party convention. \"With each rescue package two or three new dissenters emerge,\" he says.\n\nThe break away from the party line has also paid off for Schäffler personally -- it has become a career accelerator. At the last party conference he climbed the ranks to become part of the FDP's national executive committee. He was also voted district leader for the party by members in the Ostwestfalen-Lippe district.\n\nOn a Monday evening in June, Schäffler is a guest in Bern, Switzerland, where he is giving a talk on the euro. Speaking under the chandeliers and gilded ceiling of a five-star hotel, he quotes the Russian revolutionary Lenin: \"The surest way to destroy the capitalist system is to debauch its currency.\" Here Schäffler is hailed as a \"brave fighter,\" a rebel against the mainstream supporting the euro bailouts. His audience is full of parliamentarians, bankers and fans of the theories of Friedrich August von Hayek.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist wanted to do away with the money monopoly of the state. According to Hayek's idea, if companies and private people are allowed to introduce their own currencies, the best one will win out in the end. Schäffler is a fan of this concept, and it is the foundation of his euro criticism. The euro, he believes, would have not stand a chance against such a competition, because the common currency is bad money. \"The cheap money of the central banks creates a fake prosperity without a real basis,\" he says in Bern.\n\nRadical Demands\n\nIn the German parliament such theories only end in head-shaking, for example from fellow FDP member and freshly appointed deputy parliamentary group leader Volker Wissing. He belongs to a sober-minded species of financial policymakers, and there's not a single personal item in his office. He and Schäffler are about the same age, but they have little in common.\n\nIn fact, Wissing is his opponent in the FDP. Instead of making appearances on talk shows, he attempts to change the party's position through committees. Schäffler, by contrast, stepped down from his position as the leading FDP member on the German parliament's Finance Committee in protest over the first Greek bailout package.\n\nWhereas Wissing searches for practicable solutions, Schäffler suggests extreme measures without regard for the fact that politics are defined by negotiations and compromises. Schäffler demands a radical debt haircut, while Wissing considers how this suggestion would fail when faced by the resistance of the European Central Bank.\n\nSchäffler also wants to make payments to the planned ESM bailout subject to approval by the entire parliament. Wissing believes this time-consuming process is a fantasy in light of the speed with which financial markets operate. \"When it comes to saving the euro, throwing suggestions out there that haven't been thought through is grossly negligent,\" Wissing says.\n\nBut of Wissing, Schäffler says this: \"I couldn't do that -- defending the party line against my better judgement.\"\n\nWissing sometimes even gets phone calls from Chancellor Merkel, but Schäffler doesn't even get called by his own FDP party leader, Philipp Rösler.\n\nMerkel's Majority At Risk\n\nIt may not be wise, but Schäffler's rebellion is having an effect. Suddenly Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble are expressing support for debt rescheduling, however weak it may be. Schäffler takes credit for their about-face. \"A parliamentarian can only change the big picture by approaching it head-on,\" he says.\n\nMeanwhile, the anti-euro camp in parliament has formed a close fellowship, even holding their own meetings, including one last Tuesday. After a parliamentary group meeting a number of members of parliament from Merkel's Christian Democrats and the FDP held a meeting.

  "latent_12556": "(CNN) The author of President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban , which targeted people from six-majority Muslim countries, is the principal speechwriter for the President's speech on Islam in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.\n\nBoth are topics Miller has spoken out against throughout his career on Capitol Hill and in the White House.\n\nThe official said the speech has been put together through a collaborative process inside the White House, but that Miller was the primary author.\n\nThe speech, which will be given in front of about 50 Muslim leaders, could be a flashpoint in Trump's eight-day, five country trip . Trump has long derided Islam, proposed banning all Muslim immigration into the United States during the campaign and is expected to use the term \"radical Islamic terrorism\" throughout the speech in Saudi Arabia, the cradle of the 1.6 billion-member religion.\n\nHis travel ban, in the name of protecting the US against terrorism, also specifically targeted all Muslim-majority countries, a move that was derided by Muslims everywhere, including in the Middle East.\n\nThat ban was the work of Miller, a 31-year-old aide who, along with Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart CEO, has been a key voice in Trump's ear on immigration.\n\nMiller himself has a lengthy history with anti-Muslim rhetoric. During his time at Duke University, Miller wrote extensively for the school's newspaper, including one article in which he wrote : \"Islamic terrorists ... have declared a death sentence on every man, woman and child living in this country.\"\n\nMiller also worked as a college student for the Terrorism Awareness Project, an effort founded by the David Horowitz Freedom Center. The group is considered an anti-Muslim hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nPrior to working with Trump, Miller worked as a top aide and speechwriter to Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who is now Trump's attorney general. Sessions was outspoken on terrorism during Miller's time on his staff, mimicking Miller's views on the faith.\n\nTrump has called his first foreign trip \"crucial,\" despite the fact the trip couldn't come at a worst time for the President: His administration is currently consumed by the naming of a special counsel by the Justice Department to look into Russia's connections to the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nTrump said earlier this week that he will \"challenge\" Muslims in Saudi Arabia to \"fight hatred and extremism and embrace a better future of their faith.\"\n\n\"We have to stop radical Islamic terrorism,\" he added.\n\nH.R. McMaster, Trump's national security adviser, said Trump's speech will be \"inspiring but direct\" and urge the leaders to \"confront radical ideology.\"\n\n\"The President hopes for a peaceful vision of Islam to dominate across the world,\" McMaster said. \"The speech is intended to unite the broader Muslim world against common enemies of all civilization and to demonstrate America's commitment to our Muslim partners.\"\n\nCNN's Daniel Burke contributed to this report.",

  "latent_12912": "No doubt, Ukrainians have been surprised to discover that many American Leftist intellectuals tend to justify Russian aggression directed at Ukraine. Many side with Stephen Cohen, the leading Putin apologist in the USA, and most blame the United States. This is an issue that deserves an explanation.\n\nFor decades, many American intellectuals on the Left concentrated on criticizing the American foreign policy, which they’ve perceived (and often rightfully so) as needlessly interventionist. However, this mindset left them ill-prepared to judge the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Sympathetic to the critical voices from abroad, they internalized anti-American propaganda — particularly the belief that most political developments in the world are only effects of the application of America’s will.\n\nNo wonder that Noam Chomsky, in his latest book Who Rules the World?, leans on sources like Frontline Ukraine: Crisis in the Borderlands by Richard Sakwa, which he calls an “illuminating and judicious scholarly study of the region.” This is the book, may I remind you, where Mr. Sakwa states that “ultimately, the Ukraine crisis was about Russia’s refusal to submit itself to Atlanticist hegemony and global dominance.”\n\nMr. Chomsky also finds Russian concerns easily understandable, and includes in his book this quote by Joseph Mearsheimer, the father of offensive realism: “the taproot of the current crisis [over Ukraine] is NATO expansion and Washington’s commitment to move Ukraine out of Moscow’s orbit and integrate it into the West,” which Putin viewed as ‘a direct threat to Russia’s core interests.’” Never mind that the same Joseph Mearsheimer also wrote back in 1993: “A nuclear Ukraine makes sense for two reasons. First, it is imperative to maintain peace between Russia and Ukraine. That means ensuring that the Russians, who have a history of bad relations with Ukraine, do not move to reconquer it. Ukraine cannot defend itself against a nuclear-armed Russia with conventional weapons, and no Nuclear Deterrence state, including the United States, is going to extend to it a meaningful security guarantee. Ukrainian nuclear weapons are the only reliable deterrent to Russian aggression.” Perhaps, the idea of Russian aggression could still be entertained back in the 90’s, but not in 2016, right?\n\nJust like Mr. Chomsky, the American Leftist-at-large found it much harder to understand Ukrainian concerns, or grasp complexities of Ukrainian politics. It might as well have been Western Sahara. It’s all about America: projections of the American solipsist mind locked into internal debate over its identity and policies toward the major geopolitical forces like the EU, China, Russia, and the Islamic World. Tens of millions of puppets, remote-controlled from the State Department, must be populating vast areas in between, so why even try?\n\nThis bizarre worldview mirrors the opinions expressed by Russian conspiracy buffs & Putin’s propaganda in the most comic and unfortunate way. Distorted reflections of American power are absorbed and internalized to fortify the perceived might of American thought, will, and ego.\n\nNo large-scale upheavals anywhere in the world can happen without the hand of the U.S.A.\n\nThere is no place for any other hegemony in this echo chamber.\n\nIgor Satanovsky is a poet living in New York City.",
  "latent_13031": "In a freewheeling speech Thursday afternoon, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump stumbled into a riff about how great trains are. It’s sad, he said, that the American rail system is so dilapidated while China’s is now slicker than ever.\n\n“They have trains that go 300 miles per hour,” the populist billionaire exclaimed. “We have trains that go chug … chug … chug.”\n\nThe line got a laugh—it’s not often that one sees a presidential candidate imitate Thomas the Tank Engine—but it also underscored one of the most solid planks in the billionaire businessman’s rickety policy platform: to fund and rebuild U.S. infrastructure, including its crumbling railways.\n\nThe thing is, that’s usually a Democratic talking point.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nPresident Obama spent the better part of his second term pushing for a $478 billion infrastructure bill to fund roads, bridges, and rail lines. Before that, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, who at one point practically moonlighted as Amtrak’s spokesman, pushed a new U.S. Department of Transportation initiative awarding $8 billion to states to build new high-speed intercity rail.\n\n“[T]here’s no reason why Europe or China should have the fastest trains when we can build them right here in America,” Obama announced in a 2010 statement.\n\n“By investing in high speed rail, we’re doing so many good things for our country at the same time,” Biden added. We’re creating good construction and manufacturing jobs in the near-term; we’re spurring economic development in the future; we’re making our communities more livable—and we’re doing it all while decreasing America’s environmental impact and increasing America’s ability to compete in the world.”\n\nTrump’s language, six years later, is nearly identical.\n\n“Our airports, bridges, water tunnels, power grids, rail systems—our nation’s entire infrastructure is crumbling, and we aren’t doing anything about it,” he wrote in his 2015 book, Crippled America. He went on to promise that fixing it would spur economic growth.\n\n“These projects put people to work—not just the people doing the work but also the manufacturers, the suppliers, the designers, and, yes, even the lawyers. The Senate Budget Committee estimates that rebuilding America will create 13 million jobs,” he wrote. Which, incidentally, was Obama’s point in 2011, when Congressional Republicans blocked his $60 billion infrastructure jobs bill.\n\nRepublicans have generally fought efforts to increase federal spending on principle. That includes vast infrastructure projects, even popular ones. In the hours after the deadly Amtrak derailment in May 2015, for example, the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee voted to slash the rail budget by 20%.\n\nIn December, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate joined to pass a less sweeping $305 billion version of the infrastructure package. But both of Trump’s top rivals for the Republican nomination, Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, voted no on the bill.\n\nIn a nod to the fiscal conservative tradition of the Republican Party, Trump has admitted that rebuilding American infrastructure would cost taxpayer dollars. But then waved away the concern with Trumpian bravado.\n\n“On the federal level, this is going to be an expensive investment, no question about that. But in the long run it will more than pay for itself,” he said. “It will stimulate our economy while it is being built and make it a lot easier to do business when it’s done—and it can be done on time and under budget.”\n\nWrite to Haley Sweetland Edwards at haley.edwards@time.com.",
  "latent_13035": "Two weeks ago, Christian rock singer Trey Pearson came out as gay. His band, Everyday Sunday, had multiple albums and several #1 hits on the CCM single’s chart. Trey said he had tried for years to become straight, even marrying a woman and fathering two children, but nothing had changed. He wasn’t sexually attracted to his wife, was unable to meet her intimate needs, and felt burdened by having to pretend to be someone he clearly wasn’t. He and his wife had mutually agreed to separate, putting a plan in place for him to continue to be very involved in raising his children.\n\nWhat shocked me about this announcement was the response to it. A fairly well-known Christian radio show host spat on Twitter that Trey was ungodly, and so were all the other CCM artists who had come out as gay in recent years.\n\nUngodly?\n\nAll Trey had confessed to was same-sex attraction. Not an affair. Not abusive behavior. Not breaking one of the commandments. Just “I like men.” Yet that statement alone was enough to erase his godliness and call his salvation into question.\n\nThis is proof of the homophobia that exists in the Church. Mark Driscoll can confess (unrepentantly) to stealing, beating counselees upside the head and fleeing church discipline, and still get support for his new church plant. Tullian Tchividjian can confess to having an affair with a member of his congregation (which is clergy sex abuse) and still get hired on staff at another church a few months later. Doug Wilson can plagiarize books, threaten to humiliate rape victims, and publicly use filthy, sexualized slurs against women, and still get invited to speak at conferences and write articles for John Piper’s websites. I could go on with many other examples. (Though to be fair, the Christian radio show host mentioned above has criticized these things as well.)\n\nWhy do all of these men–men who have stolen, lied, slept around, and behaved in despicable ways–get a pass from the broader Christian community, while those who confess “I’m attracted to the same sex” do not? Why do Driscoll and Wilson get to keep preaching and selling books, but Trey can’t have his music played in church anymore?\n\nWhy is it that we applaud authenticity when pastors confess to neglecting their families, or disliking parishioners, or giving into bouts of explosive anger, but react with disgust and outrage when the same authenticity comes from someone who is attracted to the same sex?\n\nEven if everyone else were faultless, it would still be wrong. Being attracted to someone is not a sin.\n\nThe conservative church may not want to hear this, but there are gay people in your church. Right now. Today. There are gay people singing in your choirs, writing your worship music, and sitting next to you in Sunday School. There are gay people working at your favorite Christian charities. There are gay people on staff at CCM, CBN and TBN. There are gay people writing on popular Christian blogs. There are gay teens in your youth group. There are gay people on your elder board. There are gay students attending your seminaries. You may even have a gay pastor who stands up in front of you every Sunday and rails about the sin of homosexuality.\n\nThe gay people in your church may be married to an opposite-sex partner. They may have children. They may tithe and give other offerings. They may be serving in your weekly outreach programs. They may come to church in their Sunday best, not looking anything like the trendy clubgoers that you see frequenting your local gay bars on Saturday night.\n\nAnd the only reason you don’t know they are there is because they haven’t told you yet.\n\nAnd do you know why they are there? Because they love Jesus and want to serve him. They want to be disciples. They want to fellowship with other believers. The want to be part of a conservative faith community. They want to further the Kingdom of God. Some of these people, like you, believe that gay sex is wrong. Some of them are living as celibate singles or in heterosexual marriages, doing their best to live up to the commitment they have pledged to God and their spouse.\n\nBut that doesn’t make their feelings and attractions go away.\n\nNow imagine that these people, in many churches, get to hear on a regular basis that they are condemned. That they are such horrible sinners that God gave them over to this attraction so He could punish them. That they are dirty and represent everything that is wrong with our world. That they need to be told, over and over, to repent, even while they are walking in repentance. That they aren’t fit to be parents. That they are a danger to children. That they aren’t qualified to minister within the church, ever. That their songs of worship to God aren’t fit to be sung. That their sexual orientation, which they did not choose, should induce a gag reflex in straight Christians. That they aren’t right with God until God takes their attractions away. That they aren’t worthy of communion, which is simply a remembrance of the sacrifice Jesus made to forgive all sins.\n\nImagine what that must be like. To love Jesus with all of your heart and be so despised by his followers.\n\nTo see others offered grace and forgiveness for their struggles, but not you. To see others applauded for their openness and authenticity while you are shamed and shunned.\n\nThis is why we have to have a different conversation about gay people in the Church. Because even the ones who are there–who are doing their best to live faithfully to the scriptures as your church understands them–don’t feel welcome, loved, or safe in your community.\n\nThat’s a problem. It’s a problem when the Church offers to pray for gay victims of a mass shooting and the victims respond, “We don’t want your prayers, because we know what you say when you pray for us.” It’s a problem when a young gay person says, “I’m a Christian, but I haven’t attended church in over a year because I can’t find a church that will truly welcome me.” Is it any wonder that they would flock to bars and clubs instead, where there is a community that values them? The Church needs to be encouraging gay Christians in their faith, allowing them to be open and authentic–evaluating their walk with God, not solely by what feelings and attractions they have, but by the fruit of the Spirit in their lives.\n\nHint: Heterosexual orientation is not a fruit of the Spirit.\n\nWe already teach that salvation is through faith in Christ alone, that he alone is our righteousness–that while our sinful nature has been mortified through the Cross, we will never fully escape sin or temptation this side of our resurrection. We teach that humans are fundamentally broken in all areas, that grace is available to those who commit themselves to God, and that said grace allows us to live redeemed and justified in spite of whatever thorns in the flesh God allows us to keep.\n\nThe only change required is not showing partiality to whom this doctrine is applied.\n\nIf you think even feeling attracted to the same sex is sinful, then why do your potentially sinful feelings of anger and fear and frustration get to live under Christ’s blood, but your brother’s same-sex attraction does not?\n\nIf there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ, why do you still condemn the LGBT people who have accepted him as Lord and Savior? Why is it acceptable for Bill to struggle with alcoholism, or David to struggle with lust, but not acceptable for Todd to be attracted to men?\n\nThere are people in your community who are trying to enter the Kingdom of God. Gay people. And there are others in the Church who are blocking the door. Are you one of them? Because the problem with blocking the door is, you don’t get to enter, either (Matthew 23:13).\n\nI think it’s time we talked about it.",
  "latent_13079": "Share Labour needs to get real about the EU\n\nLabour needs to get real about the EU Labour is making no effort to remedy what many people thinks are deficiencies in our EU terms of membership\n\nLabour is making no effort to remedy what many people thinks are deficiencies in our EU terms of membership It is high time that Labour’s uncritical Europhiles realise that this is what is at stake\n\nIn 1975, when the last EU referendum was held, about 80% of Conservative voters were in favour of the UK staying in what was then the Common Market, while the Labour Party split roughly 50:50 for staying in and coming out. Now the situation is largely reversed. It is the Labour Party which is far more Europhile than the Conservatives, a factor clearly reflected in the attitude of all the current Labour leadership candidates. Jeremy Corbyn has wobbled towards a degree of Euroscepticism but all of them now advocate a “yes” vote in the forthcoming referendum, apparently irrespective of what comes out of the current round of negotiations. Does this make sense either for the Labour Party or the country – or even for those who passionately want us to stay in?\n\nClearly, which way the referendum goes is going to make a huge difference to our future, yet the Labour Party seems to have developed no policy stance on the forthcoming referendum other than to decide not to vote against it being held. The Party says it is in favour of a “reformed EU” but has put forward practically no suggestions about what needs to be changed. This is surely irrational as well as bad politics, not least because, if you scratch below the surface, there are plenty of changes which most left of centre people would like to see accomplished.\n\nWho among them is in favour of the huge net payment across the exchanges which has to be made by the UK to the EU every year – a total of £11.4bn in 2014 and set to rise substantially in future? Who really thinks it is a good idea to turn away Indian programmers and Chinese students from coming to the UK, but to let in 40,000 or more people a year from Rumania and Bulgaria to compete with the less advantaged of our indigenous labour force? How may Labour members are in favour of the Common Agricultural or the Common Fisheries Policies? How many are happy with the way he EU is run, especially the way the Greeks have been treated by the Germans? How many are satisfied that if we are the only major EU Member State outside the Single Currency that our interests are going to be fully protected? The fact is that there is a large left of centre agenda for change but the Labour Party is not putting it forward.\n\nThis can’t be doing the Party’s relationship with many of its lost voters any good, particularly those who decamped to UKIP. There is a large majority of the electorate which would like to stay in the EU on the back of major reforms but a much tighter outcome looms if there is little or no change. The unqualified enthusiasm for our EU membership exhibited by many Labour MPs and Party members is simply not reflected among most of the electorate. Nor are voters likely to be impressed by Labour making no effort to remedy what many people thinks are deficiencies in our EU terms of membership.\n\nPotential Labour supporters are likely to be even less happy about Labour’s current stance when they perceive that it weakens the government’s ability to get changes made, as surely will be the case. The more it appears to the powers that be in Brussels that the outcome of the referendum is going to be a “yes” vote irrespective of any concessions they make, the less likely it is that any of them will be inclined to go ahead with the difficult negotiations required to change the UK’s relationship with the other Member States. The more tempting, too, it will be for the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ask for the minimum that seems likely to be required to enable them to claim enough of a victory to persuade the UK electorate not to vote “no”. By not making any effort to stiffen and support where appropriate the government’s negotiating stance, Labour makes it more likely that we will be left substantially with the status quo.\n\nAnd this is where the major miscalculation may be being made by those who advocate staying in before they even know what the revised terms of membership might be. These are febrile times and there is a very real danger to those who want to keep the UK in the EU at any cost that renegotiation which turns out to be a sham could very easily generate an anti-Westminster, anti-authority backlash which will produce exactly the opposite from the result they want. Support for our EU membership is not that strong in the UK and it would not take that much to overturn the relatively small margin of support there is currently for our continuing membership.\n\nThis is why even those in the Labour Party most committed to the UK staying in the EU when the forthcoming referendum takes place need to realise that Labour badly needs a reform agenda. Of course, this will not be exactly the same as the one favoured by Conservatives. Much of Labour’s support for the EU derives from the Social Chapter and Labour is not going to support watering down employment protection and many of the social advances for which our EU membership has been largely responsible. But there is a lot of common ground where Labour could support the government’s stance.\n\nIf Labour largely advocates our continuing EU membership irrespective of any changes that might be made, with nothing reflecting the widely held concerns about some aspects of our relationship with other Member States, the result is more likely – not less likely – to be a “no” vote when the time comes. It is high time that Labour’s uncritical Europhiles realise that this is what is at stake.\n\nJohn Mills is a British businessman and the founder of JML.\n\nShare",

  "latent_13803": "Impact of Industrial Revolution on Architectural Design\n\nAdmin October 10, 2012 Blog\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, which happened in the latter half of the 18th century, brought about a number of changes in the architectural scenario all over the world.\n\nThe world turned greatly towards Greek and Roman forms of architectural design. It was considered fashionable, and rightly so, to borrow from various types of architectural designs. The Greek designs were what dominated the architectural designs that were taken up, right till the 19th century.\n\nBecause the Industrial Revolution also saw advancement in technology and manufacturing facilities, architecture became popular and it became easier to design the buildings. New architectural designs were incorporated with easeas one adapt one’s own designs on the architectural designs from over the world, giving an edge to almost all works produced after the Industrial Revolution. It was during the Industrial Revolution that the textile industry also boomed. Because of this development, architectural designs introduced fabrics like velvet and silk. This brought about the concept of interiors being incorporated into the architectural designs, making them interestingly different from all the designs known to exist before this era.\n\nMany who have studied architecture would probably agree that because these architectural designs were drawn by the same contributing factors, they seemed to lack imagination and style. However, not a person can deny that these architectural designs were practical, lasting, and only got better with other accompanying advancements.\n\nAdvancements in the Industrial Revolution also contributed greatly in the evolution of architectural design as we see them today. At the height of the Industrial Revolution, architecture celebrated both the ornamental and the unadorned and embraced mass production in an almost unbelievable display of goods and resources.\n\nThe heavy industry growth brought about a flood of new building materials such as cast iron, steel, and glass, with which architects, with the help of engineers devised structures of or sizes bigger than before, of forms better than before, and fit to perform functions which were not possible before.\n\nApart from architectural designs flourishing with respect to housing and commercial buildings, architecture also saw a boom with respect to other forms of infrastructure such as canals, tunnels, bridges and the likes.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution brought about a number of changes in the way architecture was perceived post 18th century. Architectural design took a huge turn and all for the better. Access to better resources, more material, better techniques; all were contributing factors to architecture becoming a full-blown and still flourishing industry today.\n\nContact us for a free quote for your architectural plan.",
  "latent_13826": "I know that the old ladies forever praying rosaries at the back of the Church don’t really live in the sacristy. I know that the women who eternally surround the Mary-statue didn’t come with a “Buy Our Statue, Get an Aging Filipino!” deal. I know that the “Church-lady” is a person like the rest of us, chock full of her own doubts and insecurities, and yet — the Church-lady is also a type, just like the ‘hero,’ ‘celebrity,’ or the ‘starving artist.’ I want to investigate the creature.\n\nThe best way to understand the Church-lady is through the joke that “she lives in the church.” You and I, we enter our houses of the holy in spurts, bursting open the doors in moments of crisis or lighting candles in weeks of enthusiasm. The Church-lady observes these interruptions from the back pew where, wrapping up her 900-day novena to St. Gertrude, she prays for our sorry souls.\n\nDon’t question her as she moves flowers or tidies hymnals, don’t ask her how, exactly, she has a key to the tabernacle, and for the sake of your eternal salvation, don’t think that she has a “job” at the church. She is no more “employed” by the priest than a daughter is employed in her house, no more a “volunteer” than a man is a volunteer in his own vegetable garden. She moves about the parish with the reverence, familiarity and crankiness of a homebody. The priest has no real say in the matter. Is it any wonder that the children imagine she pulls at a cross, opens a secret panel, and reveals her room? Or that the confessional serves as an elevator to her lair?\n\nIt’s a joke, but it’s a true joke: The Church-lady lives in the Church. But to “live in the Church” isn’t simply to spend a lot of time within its physical structure. There are janitors, youth ministers and even religious who, putting in equal hours, will never amount to the exemplary status of the Church-lady. To really live in a place to cease considering that place as a theoretical object detached from our experience, a “point on a map,” an “apartment,” “bungalow,” or some other repeatable structure. When we live in a place we saturate it with our experience, making it inseparable from the joys and sorrows of life, until we are unable to reduce the place back into “just a building” or “one house among many.” We make the house our home, wrapped up in and inseparable from our being.\n\nThe constant geographical presence of the Church-lady is a physical manifestation of a spiritual presence to the Divine, one that reeks of audacious familiarity, unrepentant companionship, and a confident being-with the Lord — a being-with that has ceased to consider His House as some extrinsic, conceptual place, and has begun to consider it as Home. The Church is inseparable from her being. She cannot reduce it back to a theoretical object, an institution she may or may not devote herself to, or a possible place in a world of possible places.\n\nThis becomes obvious when we consider how easily the “Christian of the world” is embarrassed by the Church-lady. A young man tells a Church-lady that he is an atheist. She responds, in all earnestness: “Talk to God about it.” Another says, with all the papal superiority of a Catholic Reporter reader, that the practice of praying to the Saints is a decadent, merit-based, medieval disruption of the early Church’s pure concept of Unity in Christ. She says: “Pray to St. Thomas, he’s the patron saint of skeptics.” Another tells her that he doubts the Real Presence. She responds: “He’s used to it.”\n\nThe Church-lady is impossibly bad at entertaining positions outside of the Church, even for the sake of argument. She argues from the Church. God is so far from being a “theory” or a “topic of debate” that he cannot be held in suspense or treated “as if” non-existent. Such a position might work for the concept “God,” a God extrinsic to my being, a God “out there” who I may affirm or deny — it doesn’t work for the God who lives with us, who speaks to us, who cares for us. It’s as if one were to say “I don’t believe in the existence of your husband.” The husband is so real, so suffered, so lived-with, that it would hardly occur to us to respond from this idea of his non-existence. We would hardly begin by arguing, “Well, if my husband didn’t exist, who’s gin am I buying?” We’d assert the obvious daily experience of his existence: “Of course he exists, go talk to the fool yourself!”\n\nThis is the critical method of the Church-lady, for whom Church is home and God is companion. She suffers the divine, lives with it, eats it, and, as a result, seems foolish in our secular age, for whom the divine is an option, but never a given — a possibility among other possibilities, never simply lived with beyond doubt.\n\nWe look for heroes of apophatic mysticism in the caves of ascetics. We should be looking to the ladies at the 3p.m. Divine Mercy Chaplet. The transcendence of our concepts of God does not result in a speechless encounter with the One, a stripping away of all our profane knowledge until we are left with an awe in the face of “that of whom nothing can be said.” Those are still concepts anyways — the concept of “that of which nothing can be said,” the concept of “the One.” No, we trade in our all-too-human ideas of God, not for an inhuman idea, but for a relationship with God. We know God as we know our friends: by transcending all that can be said about them and entering into a sphere in which we actively relate to them — loving them, speaking to them, consoling them.\n\nThe atheist gets told to “talk to God about his atheism” because the Church-lady is unwilling to take his stance and consider God as an object, a possible, and a theory available to affirmation and denial. She lives in and with the reality of God — and asserts it foolishly. She is “always at Church” and she refuses to leave — even for the sake of a suave apologetic. This is the price for really believing — it becomes harder to entertain the skeptical proposition in order to build a proof of the Creator, harder to intellectually suspend our certainty of God’s existence. As we ascend the divine ladder to Church-lady status, we become more likely to proclaim than argue, more likely to shout “He is risen” than consider the question of the Resurrection according to the discipline of the academic historians. We are in love, and it’s easier to doubt my own existence than that of the beloved, making it that much harder to argue from the blank space of modern secularism, in which God’s existence is hung perpetually in doubt.\n\nOf course, the Church needs to give reason for its hope, coherent testimony to the Sacred in a secular age — but a love of reasonable argument that leaves behind the validity and efficacy of the Church-lady is unreasonable. When God is suffered rather than merely believed in, we become foolish, but it’s holy tomfoolery, evangelically cunning beyond all attempts at cunning. The Church-lady proves God as a wife proves her husband, her status of being-with the divine giving testimony to the divine as a person to be lived with beyond every possible “god” we can prove. She makes no arguments, or she makes bad arguments — but only because she already is an argument. May she live forever.",

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nWASHINGTON - It's not a particularly strategic location, the United States and its allies never pledged to defend it, and few people outside the region had even heard of it before this month.\n\nBut the symbolism of US-led airstrikes failing to stop Islamic State militants from overrunning the Syrian city of Kobani could provide an early setback to US President Barack Obama's three-week old Syria air campaign - far beyond its battlefield importance.\n\nIf Islamic State seizes full control of the city - which US officials acknowledge is possible in coming days - it would be able to boast that it has withstood American air power. A US-led coalition has launched 50 strikes against militant positions around the city, most of those in the last four days.Islamic State also would be able to free up thousands of fighters to pursue territorial gains elsewhere in Syria and Iraq, analysts said.Inevitable questions would arise over Obama's pledge to keep US ground troops out of the fight and the strength of his international coalition. Turkey, whose border abuts Kobani, has declined to join military action against Islamic State.\"Judging the overall coalition from a single town in northern Syria ... is slightly unfair,\" said Shashank Joshi of London's Royal United Services Institute. \"But I think it will dent overall confidence in the coalition and it will concern many people as to whether the US can really stop this movement.\"A Kobani victory would also provide valuable propaganda for the Islamic State, which has proved adept at providing packaged video footage of its fighters in action, while the United States can only produce fuzzy pictures of air-launched bombs and missile blowing up often unidentifiable objects on the ground.Jeff White of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said Islamic State will \"claim it has been able to do this in the face of a US-led bombing campaign.\" The group's supporters \"will find that uplifting\" and its opponents depressing, White said.The city's fate also holds importance for Syria's Kurds, who have enjoyed a semi-independent region that includes Kobani after President Bashar Assad's grip on his country loosened.For Turkey, the loss of Kobani would appear to be a mixed blessing.Ankara opposes both Assad and Kurdish independence, and has done nothing to aid in Kobani's defense. But if the city falls, Islamic State will have stitched up a 250-kilometer (155-mile) stretch of territory along the Turkish border, according to some analyst estimates.Kobani has riveted international attention largely because of its proximity to Turkey - and television cameras there have captured the fighting just across the border.On Friday, Kurdish forces and Islamic State fighters were reported to be engaged in street battles within the city. A UN envoy said he feared a massacre of thousands of people if Islamic State was victorious.While Obama has said his aim is to degrade and ultimately defeat the Islamic State group, his first priority appears to be limiting its advance in Iraq. The air strikes in Syria are designed in part to deprive the group of safe haven there.US officials say putting so much emphasis on a single city misrepresents the US-led air campaign, which will take time. Much also depends on moderate Syrian rebels that Washington will train and equip, as well as US-backed Iraqi security forces.\"To hang Kobani around the military's neck represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the elements of the strategy we're pursuing and limits of military power in pursuing that strategy,\" said a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity.US officials, echoed by defense analysts, point out that Islamic State's siege of Kobani has forced the group to bring its military hardware out in the open, where warplanes have attacked it daily.\"They seem to really want Kobani and have their flags flying over it,\" a second US official said. \"They are paying a very heavy price.\"The US government says there will be no change in Obama's strategy - which rules out US troops in ground combat in both Iraq and Syria - if Kobani falls.But if it turns out that coalition air power alone was unable to help the Kurds hold Kobani, that \"might prompt a redefinition\" of Obama's \"no boots on the ground\" pledge, said retired veteran US diplomat James Dobbins.Dobbins, now at the Rand Corporation think tank, predicted the limits of air power around Kobani would accelerate a debate within the administration over deploying advisers and forward air controllers on the ground - but in Iraq, where they would partner with Iraqi security forces, rather than in Syria.White, of the Washington Institute, said Obama's lengthy timeline for battling Islamic State might also come into question.\"They're fighting the war on their terms,\" he said of Islamic State. \"Their timeline and our timeline don't coincide.\"\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_13969": "Release notes for the Genode OS Framework 12.11\n\nThe central theme of version 12.11 of the Genode OS Framework is self-hosting Genode on Genode. With self-hosting, we understand the execution of the entire Genode build system within the Genode environment. There are two motivations for pursing this line of work. First, it is a fundamental prerequisite for the Genode developers to move towards using Genode as a day-to-day OS. Of course, this prerequisite could be realized using one of the available virtualization solutions. For example, we could run L4Linux on top of Genode on the Fiasco.OC kernel and use the Genode build system from within an L4Linux instance. However, this defeats the primary incentive behind Genode to reduce system complexity. By having both Genode and L4Linux in the picture, we would indeed increase the overall complexity in configuring, maintaining, and using the system. Therefore, we would largely prefer to remove the complex Linux user land from the picture. The second motivation is to prove that the framework and underlying base platforms are suited and stable enough for real-world use. If the system is not able to handle a workload like the build system, there is little point in arguing about the added value of having a microkernel-based system over current commodity OSes such as GNU/Linux.\n\nWe are happy to have reached the state where we can execute the unmodified Genode build system directly on Genode running on a microkernel. As the build system is based on GNU utilities and the GNU compiler collection, significant effort went into the glue between those tools and the Genode API. Section Building Genode on Genode provides insights into the way we achieved the goal and the current state of affairs.\n\nAlong with the work on bringing the build system to Genode came numerous stability improvements and optimizations all over the place, reaching from the respective kernels, over the C runtime, the file-system implementations, memory allocators, up to the actual programs the tool chain is composed of. Speaking of the tool chain, the official Genode tool chain has been updated from GCC version 4.6.1 to version 4.7.2. Thereby, all 3rd-party code packages were subjected to testing and fixing activities.\n\nFor running the build system, the project currently focuses on NOVA and Fiasco.OC as base platforms. However, our custom kernel platform for the ARM architecture has also received significant improvements. With added support for Freescale i.MX and Texas Instruments OMAP4, this platform proved to be very well adaptable to new SoCs whereas new cache handling brings welcome performance improvements. Furthermore, we have added experimental support for ARM TrustZone technology, which principally enables the execution of Genode in the so-called secure world of TrustZone while executing Linux in the so-called normal world.\n\nAs we discovered the increasing interest in using Genode as a middleware solution on Linux, we largely revisited the support for this kernel platform and discovered amazing new ways to align the concept of Genode with the mechanisms provided by the Linux kernel. Section Linux provides a summary of the new approaches taken for supporting this platform.\n\nFunctionality-wise, the new version introduces support for audio drivers of the Open Sound System, a new OMAP4 GPIO driver, improvements of the graphical terminal, and the initial port of an SSH client.\n\nBuilding Genode on Genode\n\nOn the Genode developer's way towards using Genode as a day-to-day OS, the ability to execute the Genode build system within the Genode environment is a pivotal step - a step that is highly challenging because the build system is based on the tight interplay of many GNU programs. Among those programs are GNU make, coreutils, findutils, binutils, gcc, and bash. Even though there is a large track record of individual programs and libraries ported to the environment, those programs used to be self-sustaining applications that require only little interaction with other programs. In contrast, the build system relies on many utilities working together using mechanisms such as files, pipes, output redirection, and execve. The Genode base system does not come with any of those mechanisms let alone the subtle semantics of the POSIX interface as expected by those utilities. Being true to microkernel principles, Genode's API has a far lower abstraction level and is much more rigid in scope.\n\nTo fill the gap between the requirements of the build system and the bare Genode mechanisms, the Noux runtime environment was created. Noux is a Genode process that acts like a Unix kernel. When started, it creates a child process, which plays a similar role as the init process of Unix. This process communicates via RPC messages to Noux. Using those messages, the process can perform all the operations normally provided by a classical Unix kernel. When executed under Noux, a process can even invoke functionalities such as fork and execve, which would normally contradict with Genode's principles of resource management.\n\nOver the course of the past year, more and more programs have been ported to the Noux environment. Thereby, the semantics provided by Noux have been successively refined so that those program behave as expected. This was an iterative process. For example, at the beginning, Noux did not consider the differences between lstat and stat as they did not matter for the first batch of GNU programs ported to Noux. As soon as the programs got more sophisticated, such shortcuts had to be replaced by the correct semantics. The Genode build system is by far the most complex scenario exposed to Noux so far. It revealed many shortcomings by both functionality implemented in Noux or the C runtime as well as the underlying base platforms. So it proved to be a great testing ground for analysing and improving those platform details. Therefore, the secondary effects of self-hosting Genode on Genode in terms of stability turned out to be extremely valuable.\n\nThe release comes with two ready-to-use run scripts for building bootable system images that are able to execute the Genode tool chain, one for targeting NOVA and one for targeting Fiasco.OC. Those run scripts are located at ports/run/ and called noux_tool_chain_nova.run and noux_tool_chain_foc.run respectively. Each of those run scripts can be executed on either of those base platforms. For example, by executing noux_tool_chain_nova on Fiasco.OC, the image will run Genode on Fiasco.OC and the tool chain will build binaries for NOVA. When started, a build directory will be created at /home/build . The Genode source code is located at /genode . In the /bin directory, there are all the GNU programs needed to execute the tool chain. For taking a look into the source code, vim is available. To build core, change to the build directory /home/build and issue make core .\n\nOn Fiasco.OC, the complete Genode demo scenario can be compiled. On NOVA, the incomplete life-time management of kernel objects will still result in an out-of-memory error of the kernel. This kernel issue is currently being worked on. Executing the tool chain on either of those platforms is still relatively slow as extensive trace output is being generated and no actions have been taken to optimize the performance so far. There are many opportunities for such optimizations, which will be taken on as the next step.\n\nBase framework\n\nGenode's base framework has received new support for extending session interfaces and gained improvements with regard to interrupt handling on the x86 platform. At the API level, there are minor changes related to the CPU session and Range_allocator interfaces.\n\nSupport for specializing session interfaces\n\nWith increasingly sophisticated application scenarios comes the desire to extend Genode's existing session interface with new functionality. For example, the Terminal::Session interface covers plain read and write operations. It is implemented by services such as a graphical terminal, the telnet-like TCP terminal, or UART drivers. However, for the latter category, the breadth of the interface is severely limited as UART drivers tend to supplement the read / write interface with additional control functions, e.g., for setting the baud rate.\n\nOne way to go would be to extend the existing Terminal::Session interface with those control functions. However, these functions would be meaningless for most implementations. Some of those other implementations may even desire their own share of additions. In the longer term, this approach might successively broaden the interface and each implementation will cover a subset only.\n\nBecause Genode aspires to keep interfaces as low-complex as possible while, at the same time, it wants to accommodate the growing sophistication of usage scenarios, we need a solution that scales. The solution turns out to be strikingly simple. The RPC framework already supports the inheritance of RPC interfaces. So it is possible to model the problem such that a new Uart::Session interface derived from the existing Terminal::Session will be the host of UART-specific functionality. The only piece missing is the propagation of both Uart and Terminal through the parent interface while announcing the service. To spare the work of manually announcing the chain of inherited interfaces from the implementor, the Parent::announce() function has been enhanced to automatically announce all service types implemented by the announced interface. This way, a UART driver will always announce a \"Uart\" and a \"Terminal\" service.\n\nImproved interrupt handling\n\nTo accommodate modern x86 platforms, the session arguments of core's IRQ service have been supplemented with the IRQ mode. There are two degrees of freedom, namely the trigger (level / edge) and polarity (high / low). Thanks to this addition, device drivers have become able to supply their knowledge of devices to core.\n\nIn system scenarios with many peripherals, in particular when using the USB driver, IRQ lines are shared between devices. Until now, Genode supported shared interrupts for the OKL4 base platform only. To also cover the other x86 kernels, we have generalized the interrupt sharing code and enabled this feature on Fiasco.OC and NOVA.\n\nRevised CPU session interface\n\nWe revisited the CPU session interface, removed no-longer used functions and added support for assigning threads to CPUs.\n\nThe original CPU session interface contained functions for iterating through the threads of a session. This interface was originally motivated by an experimental statistical profiling tool that was developed at an early stage of Genode. In the meanwhile, we discovered that the virtualization of the CPU session interface is much more elegant to cover this use case than the thread-iterator interface. Because the iteration has no transactional semantics, it was unsafe to use it anyway.\n\nTo enable the use of multiple CPUs on multi-processor systems, the CPU session interface has been enhanced with two functions, namely affinity and num_cpus . The interface extension principally allows the assignment of individual threads to CPUs. It is currently implemented on Fiasco.OC only. On all other base platforms, num_cpus returns one CPU. Note that on the Linux platform, multiple CPUs will be used transparently.\n\nThe Cpu_session::state function has been split into two functions, one for retrieving information and one for propagating state information. The prior interface was less explicit about the semantics of the state function as it took a non-const pointer to a Thread_state object as argument.\n\nPlatform-tailored protection domains\n\nGenode tries to provide a uniform API across all the different base platforms. Yet, it also strives to make genuine platform features available to the users of the framework. Examples for such features are the virtualization support of the NOVA hypervisor or the special support for paravirtualizing Linux on Fiasco.OC. Another example is the security model as found on the Linux platform. Even though the security mechanisms of plain Linux are not as strong as Genode's capability concept on a conceptual level, we still want to leverage the available facilities such as user IDs and chroot as far as possible. Consequently, we need a way to assign platform-specific properties to PD sessions. With the new Native_pd_args type introduced into base/native_types.h , there is now a way to express those platform-specific concerns. This type is now used at all the places that deal with the creation of protection domains such as Process , Child , and the loader.\n\nRevised Range_allocator interface\n\nThe handling of allocation errors has been refined in order to distinguish different error conditions, in particular out-of-metadata and out-of-memory conditions. The user of the allocator might want to handle both cases differently. Hence we return an Alloc_return value as result. In prior versions, this type was just an enum value. With the new version, the type has been changed to a class. This makes the differentiation of error conditions at the caller side more robust because, in contrast to enum values, typed objects don't get implicitly converted to bool values.\n\nLow-level OS infrastructure\n\nNew UART session interface\n\nTo accommodate UART specific extensions of the Terminal::Session interface, in particular setting the baud rate, we introduced the new Uart::Session interface and changed the existing UART drivers to implement this interface instead of the Terminal::Session interface. Because Uart::Session inherits the Terminal::Session interface, Uart services announce both \"Uart\" and \"Terminal\" at their parent.\n\nNew GPIO session interface\n\nEmbedded SoCs such as OMAP4 provide many general-purpose I/O pins, which can be used for different purposes depending on the board where they are soldered on. For example, the Pandaboard uses such GPIO pins to detect the presence of a HDMI plug or control the power supply for the USB. If only one driver deals with GPIO pins, the GPIO programming can reside in the driver. However, if multiple drivers are used, the GPIO device resources cannot be handed out to more than one driver. This scenario calls for the creation of a GPIO driver as a separate component, which intermediates (and potentially multiplexes) the access to the physical GPIO pins. The new Gpio::Session interface allows one or multiple clients to configure I/O pins, request states, as well as to register for events happening on the pins.\n\nTerminal\n\nThe graphical terminal has been enhanced with support for different built-in font sizes and background-color handling.\n\nIn addition to those functional changes, the implementation has been decomposed into several parts that thereby became reusable. Those parts comprise the handling of key mappings, decoding the VT character stream, and the handling of the character array. These functionalities are now available at gems/include/terminal .\n\nLibraries and applications\n\nC runtime\n\nAllocator optimized for small-object allocations\n\nTo optimize the performance of workloads that depend on a large number of small dynamic memory allocations, in particular the lwIP TCP/IP stack, we replaced the memory allocator of the libc with a more sophisticated strategy. Until now, the libc used Genode::Heap as allocator. This implementation is an AVL-tree-based best-fit allocator that is optimized for low code complexity rather than performance for small allocations. The observation of the allocator usage pattern of lwIP prompted us to replace the original libc malloc/free with a version that uses slab allocators for small objects and relies on the Genode::Heap for large objects only.\n\nSymbolic links\n\nBecause part of our ongoing refinements of the Noux runtime is the provision of symbolic links, support for symbolic links was added in the libc, libc plugins, and file system servers.\n\nlwIP\n\nWe updated the light-weight IP stack to version STABLE-1.4.1. Additionally, the following optimizations were conducted to improve its performance and robustness.\n\nWe reduced the maximum segment lifetime from one minute to one second to avoid queuing up PCBs in TIME-WAIT state. This is the state, PCBs end up after closing a TCP connection socket at the server side. The number of PCBs in this state is apparently not limited by the value of MEMP_NUM_TCP_PCB . One allocation costs around 160 bytes. If clients connect to the server at a high rate, those allocations accumulate quickly and thereby may exhaust the memory of the server. By reducing the segment lifetime, PCBs in TIME-WAIT state are cleaned up from the tcp_tw_pcbs queue in a more timely fashion (by tcp_slowtmr() ).\n\nTo prevent the TCP/IP stack from artificially throttling TCP throughput, we adjusted lwIP's TCP_SND_BUF size.\n\nFrom our work on optimizing the NIC stub-code performance of L4Linux as described here, we learned that the use of a NIC-specific packet allocator for the packet-stream interface is beneficial. At the lwIP back end, we still relied on the original general-purpose allocator. Hence, we improved the lwIP back-end code by using the bitmap-based Nic::Packet_allocator allocator instead.\n\nStandard C++ library\n\nGenode used to rely on the standard C++ library that comes with the tool chain. However, this mechanism was prone to inconsistencies of the types defined in the header files used at compile time of the tool chain and the types provided by our libc. By building the C++ standard library as part of the Genode build process, such inconsistencies cannot happen anymore. The current version of the C++ standard library corresponds to GCC 4.7.2.\n\nNote that the patch changes the meaning of the stdcxx library for users that happened to rely on stdcxx for hybrid Linux/Genode applications. For such uses, the original mechanism is still available, in the renamed form of toolchain_stdcxx .\n\nDevice drivers\n\nOpen Sound System\n\nGenode tries to re-use existing device drivers as much as possible using an approach called device-driver environment (DDE). A DDE is a library that emulates the environment of the original driver by translating device accesses to the Genode API. There are many success stories of drivers successfully ported to the framework this way. For example, using DDE-Linux, we are able to use the Linux USB stack. Using DDE-ipxe, we are able to use iPXE networking drivers. With Genode 12.11 we extend our arsenal of DDEs with DDE-OSS, which is a device-driver environment for the audio drivers of the Open Sound System (OSS).\n\nWebsite of the Open Sound System http://http://www.4front-tech.com\n\nThe new dde_oss contains all the pieces needed to use Intel HDA, AC97, and ES1370 audio cards on Genode. On first use, the 3rd-party code can be downloaded by issuing make prepare from within the dde_oss source-code repository. Also, you need to make sure to add the dde_oss repository to your REPOSITORIES variable in etc/build.conf .\n\nAn OSS demo configuration can be found under run/oss.run and can be started via make run/oss from a Genode build directory. Be sure to adjust the filename tag of the audio0 program. The file has to reside under <build-dir>/bin/ . The file format is header-less two-channel float-32 at 44100 Hz. You may use the sox utility to create these audio files:\n\nsox -c 2 -r 44100 foo.mp3 foo.f32\n\nOMAP4 GPIO driver\n\nThe new OMAP4 GPIO driver is the first implementation of the just introduced Gpio::Session interface. The driver supports two ways of interacting with GPIO pins, by providing a static configuration, or by interacting with a session interface at runtime. An example for a static configuration looks as follows:\n\n<config> <gpio num=\"121\" mode=\"I\"/> <gpio num=\"7\" mode=\"O\" value=\"0\"/> <gpio num=\"8\" mode=\"O\" value=\"0\"/> </config>\n\nThe driver is located at os/src/drivers/gpio/omap4 . As reference for using the driver, please refer to the os/run/gpio_drv.run script.\n\nThanks to Ivan Loskutov of Ksys-Labs for contributing the session interface and the driver!\n\niPXE networking drivers\n\nWe updated our device-driver environment for iPXE networking drivers to a recent git revision and enabled support for the x86_64 architecture. Currently, the driver covers Intel gigabit ethernet (e1000, e1000e, igb), Intel eepro100, and Realtek 8139/8169.\n\nRuntime environments\n\nNoux\n\nThe Noux runtime environment has received plenty of love thanks to the aspiration to execute the Genode build system.\n\nTime\n\nThe build system uses GNU make, which depends on time stamps of files. We do not necessarily need a real clock. A monotonic increasing virtual time is enough. To provide such a virtual time, the libc was enhanced with basic support for functions like gettimeofday , clock_gettime , and utimes . As there is currently no interface to obtain the real-world time in Genode, Noux simulates a pseudo real-time clock using a jiffies-counting thread. This limited degree of support for time is apparently sufficient to trick tools like ping, find, and make into working as desired.\n\nImproved networking support\n\nThe Noux/net version of Noux extends the Noux runtime with the BSD-socket interface by using the lwIP stack. This version of Noux multiplexes the BSD-socket interface of lwIP to multiple Noux programs, each having a different socket-descriptor name space and the principal ability to use blocking calls such as select . The code for multiplexing the lwIP stack among multiple Noux processes has been improved to cover corner cases exposed by sophisticated network clients, i.e., openssh.\n\nDirectory cache for the TAR file system\n\nThe original version of the TAR file system required a search in all TAR records for each file lookup. This takes a long time when composing a large directory tree out of multiple TAR archives stacked together. This is the case for the Genode build-system scenario where we have all the files of the GNU tools as well as the Genode source tree. Searching through thousands of records for each call of stat quickly becomes a scalability issue. Therefore, we introduced a TAR indexing mechanism that scans each TAR file only once at the startup of Noux and generates a tree structure representing the directory layout. Looking up files using this index is quick.\n\nNew packages\n\nWith Genode-12.11, new 3rd-party packages have become available, namely OpenSSH, the which command, and all tool-chain components in their current version. OpenSSH is still at an experimental stage. The run script at ports/run/noux_net_openssh_interactive.run demonstrates how SSH can be used to login into a remote machine.\n\nNew pseudo file systems\n\nThe new stdio and random file systems are intended to represent the pseudo devices /dev/random and /dev/tty on Noux. Both are needed to run OpenSSH. Note that the Arc4random class, on which the random file system is based on, currently does not collect enough random bytes! It should not be used for security-critical applications.\n\nL4Linux\n\nThe paravirtualized L4Linux kernel for the Fiasco.OC platform was updated to SVN revision 25, which matches the Fiasco.OC SVN revision 40. We further improved the integration of L4Linux with Genode by optimizing the stub drivers for block devices and networking, and added principal support for running L4Linux on SMP platforms.\n\nPlatforms\n\nNOVA\n\nGenode follows the steady development of the NOVA microhypervisor very closely. The kernel used by the framework corresponds to the current state of the master branch of IntelLabs/NOVA.\n\nImprovements towards GDB support\n\nThe NOVA-specific implementation of the CPU session interface has been improved to accommodate the requirements posed by GDB. In particular, the pause , resume , state , and single_step functions have been implemented. Those functions can be used to manipulate the execution and register state of threads. Under the hood, NOVA's recall feature is used to implement these mechanisms. By issuing a recall for a given thread, the targeted thread is forced into an exception. In the exception, the current state of the thread can be obtained and its execution can be halted/paused.\n\nMaximizing contiguous virtual space\n\nTo enable the Vancouver virtual machine monitor to hand out large amounts of guest memory, we optimized core's virtual address space to retain large and naturally aligned contiguous memory regions. For non-core processes, the thread-context area that contains the stacks of Genode threads has been moved to the end of the available virtual address space.\n\nLife-time management of kernel resources\n\nWe improved the life-time management of kernel resources, in particular capabilities, within Genode. Still the management of such kernel resources is not on par with the Fiasco.OC version, partially because of missing kernel functionality. This is an ongoing topic that is being worked on.\n\nUsing the BIOS data area (BDA) to get serial I/O ports on x86\n\nIf the I/O ports for the comport are non default (default is 0x3f8 ), we had to specify manually the correct I/O ports in the source code. To avoid the need for source-code modifications when changing test machines, we changed the core console to read the BDA and use the first serial interface that is available. If no serial interface is available, no device configuration will be undertaken. The BDA can be populated via a multi-boot chain loader. Bender is such a chain loader that can detect serial ports accessible via PCI and writes the I/O ports to the Bios Data area (BDA). These values get then picked up by core.\n\nThe Fiasco.OC kernel has been updated to the SVN revision 40. The update improves SMP support and comes with various bug fixes. There is no noteworthy change with regard to the kernel interface. We extended the number of supported Fiasco.OC-based platforms for Genode by including the Freescale i.MX53.\n\nTo enable the use of multiple CPUs by Genode processes, the CPU session interface has been enhanced to support configuring the affinity of threads with CPUs. We changed the default kernel configuration for x86 and ARM to enable SMP support and adapted L4Linux to use the new interface.\n\nExecution on bare hardware (base-hw)\n\nThe development of our custom platform for executing Genode directly on bare hardware with no kernel underneath went full steam ahead during the release cycle.\n\nPandaboard\n\nThe in-kernel drivers needed to accommodate the Pandaboard, more specifically the timer and interrupt controller, are now supported. So the Pandaboard can be used with both base-hw and base-foc . Also, the higher-level platform drivers for USB, HDMI, and SD-card that were introduced with the previous release, are equally functional on both platforms.\n\nFreescale i.MX31\n\nWe added principal support for the Freescale i.MX line of SoCs taking the ARMv6-based i.MX31 as starting point. As of now, the degree of support is limited to the devices needed by the kernel to operate. Pure software-based scenarios are able to work, i.e., the nested init run script executes successfully.\n\nTrustZone support\n\nThe new VM session interface of core provides a way to execute software in the normal world of a TrustZone system whereas Genode runs in the secure world. From Genode's point of view, the normal world looks like a virtual machine. Each time, the normal world produces a fault or issues a secure monitor call, control gets transferred to the virtual machine monitor, which is a normal user-level Genode process. The base-hw kernel has been enhanced to perform world switches between the secure and normal world and with the ability to handle fast interrupts (FIQs) in addition to normal interrupts. The latter extension is needed to assign a subset of devices to either of both worlds.\n\nCurrently, the only TrustZone capable platform is the ARM CoreTile Express CA9x4 for the Versatile Express board. For a virtual machine working properly on top, some platform resources must be reserved. Therefore, there exist two flavours of this platform now, one with the trustzone spec-variable enabled and one without. If trustzone is specified, most platform resources (DDR-RAM, and most IRQs) are reserved for the normal world and not available to the secure Genode world.\n\nMemory attributes and caching\n\nWe successively activated various levels of caching and improved the handling of caching attributes propagated into the page tables. These changes resulted in a significant boost in performance on non-emulated platforms.\n\nLinux\n\nThe Linux version of Genode was originally meant as a vehicle for rapid development. It allows the framework components including core to be executed as plain Linux processes. But in contrast to normal Linux programs, which use the glibc, Genode's components interact with the kernel directly without any C runtime other than what comes with Genode. We use the Linux version on a regular basis to implement platform-agnostic functionality and protocols. Most of Genode's code (except for device drivers) falls in this category. Because the Linux version was meant as a mere tool, however, we haven't put much thought into the principle way to implementing Genode's security concept on this platform. Threads used to communicate over globally accessible Unix-domain sockets and memory objects were represented as globally accessible files within /tmp .\n\nThat said, even though Linux was not meant as a primary platform for Genode in the first place, Genode can bring additional value to Linux. When considering the implementation of a component-based system on Linux, there are several possible approaches to take. For example, components may use DBus to communicate, or components could pick from the manifold Unix mechanisms such as named pipes, files, sysv-shared memory, signals, and others. Unfortunately those mechanisms are not orthogonal and most of them live in the global name space of the virtual file system. Whereas those mechanisms are principally able to let processes communicate, questions about how processes get to know each other, access-control policy, synchronization of the startup of processes are left to the developer.\n\nGenode, on the other hand, does provide an API for letting components communicate but also answers those tricky questions concerning the composition of components. This makes Genode an interesting option to build component based applications, even on Linux. However, when used in such a context, the limitations of the original Linux support need resolutions. Therefore, the current release comes with a largely revised platform support for the Linux base platform.\n\nThe changes can be summarized as follows:\n\nUsing file descriptors as communication addresses\n\nGenode's synchronous RPC framework was using Unix domain sockets. Each RPC entrypoint was represented by a pair of named files, one for sending and one for receiving messages. In the new version, inter-process communication is performed via file descriptors only.\n\nTransfer of communication rights via RPC only\n\nCapabilities used to be represented as a pair of the destination thread ID and a global object ID. The thread ID has been replaced by a file descriptor that points to the corresponding RPC entrypoint. When capabilities are transferred as RPC arguments, those file descriptors are transferred via SCM rights messages. This is in line with Genode's way of capability-based delegation of access rights.\n\nCore-only creation of communication channels\n\nCommunication channels used to be created locally by each process. The naming of those channels was a mere convention. In contrast, now, communication channels are created by core only and do not reside on the Linux virtual file system. When creating an RPC entrypoint, core creates a socket pair and hands out both ends to the creator of the entrypoint.\n\nRestricted access to memory objects\n\nAccess to dataspace content was performed by mmap'ing a file. For a given dataspace, the file name could be requested at core via a Linux-specific RPC call. Now, core holds the file descriptors of all dataspaces, which are actually unlinked files. A process that is in possession of a dataspace capability can request the file descriptor for the content from core and mmap the file locally. This way, access to memory objects is subjected to the delegation of dataspace capabilities.\n\nCore-local process creation\n\nGenode used to create new processes by directly forking from the respective Genode parent using the process library. The forking process created a PD session at core merely for propagating the PID of the new process into core (for later destruction). This traditional mechanism has the following disadvantages:\n\nFirst, the PID reported by the creating process to core cannot easily be validated by core. Therefore core has to trust the PD client to not specify a PID of an existing process, which would happen to be killed once the PD session gets destructed. Second, there is no way for a Genode process to detect the failure of any of its grandchildren. The immediate parent of a faulting process could use the SIGCHLD-and-waitpid mechanism to observe its children but this mechanism does not work transitively.\n\nBy performing the process creation exclusively within core, all Genode processes become immediate child processes of core. Hence, core can respond to failures of any of those processes and reflect such conditions via core's session interfaces. Furthermore, the PID associated to a PD session is locally known within core and cannot be forged anymore. In fact, there is actually no need at all to make processes aware of any PIDs of other processes.\n\nHandling of chroot, user IDs, and group IDs\n\nWith the move of the process creation into core, the original chroot trampoline mechanism implemented in os/src/app/chroot does not work anymore. A process could simply escape the chroot environment by spawning a new process via core's PD service. Therefore, chroot support has been integrated into core and the chroot policy becomes a mandatory part of the process creation. For each process created by core, core checks for a root argument of the PD session. If a path is present, core takes the precautions needed to execute the new process in the specified chroot environment.\n\nThis conceptual change implies minor changes with respect to the Genode API and the configuration of the init process. The API changes are the enhancement of the Genode::Child and Genode::Process constructors to take the root path as argument. Init supports the specification of a chroot per process by specifying the new root attribute to the <start> node of the process. In line with these changes, the Loader::Session::start function has been enhanced with the additional (optional) PD argument.\n\nIn line with how the chroot path can be propagated into core, core has become able to assign customized UIDs and GIDs to individual Genode processes or whole Genode subsystems. The new base-linux/run/lx_uid.run script contains an example of how to use the feature.\n\nBuild system and tools\n\nThe current release comes with a new tool chain based on GCC 4.7.2 and binutils 2.22. The tool-chain upgrade involved adapting the Genode code base and fixing various issues in 3rd-party software. To obtain the new tool chain, please refer to the tool-chain website:",
  "latent_14008": "Perry signs pledge backing gay marriage ban\n\nGov. Rick Perry on Friday became the latest Republican presidential candidate to sign a pledge to support an amendment to the Constitution that would outlaw gay marriage. His pledge came a month after he voiced support for the right of states to decide for themselves about gay marriage and other social issues.\n\nThe National Organization for Marriage pledge states that, if elected, Perry will send to the states for ratification a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. He also pledged to appoint U.S. Supreme Court judges and federal judges who will \"reject the idea our Founding Fathers inserted a right to gay marriage into the Constitution.\"\n\n\"The purpose of NOM's Marriage Pledge is to move from vague values statements to concrete actions to protect marriage. Gov. Perry joins Michele Bachmann, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum as a signer of NOM Marriage Pledge,\" said Brian Brown, president of the organization, in a statement. \"By doing so, Perry makes crystal clear that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, gay marriage is going to be a bigger issue in 2012 than it was in 2008, because the difference between the GOP nominee and President Obama is going to be large and clear.\"\n\nPerry also signed a pledge this week offered by an anti-abortion group called the Susan B. Anthony List that commits him to selecting only \"strict constructionist\" judges and anti-abortion appointees to Cabinet and executive branch positions. By signing the pledge he also commits to an effort to de-fund Planned Parenthood and to sign a Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\n\nPerry's signature on the anti-abortion pledge is consistent with positions he has taken throughout his career, but he has had to scramble since becoming a presidential candidate to clarify his position on gay marriage.\n\nSpeaking to a Republican Governors Association forum in Colorado last month, a few days before he declared his candidacy, he said that his strong support of state's rights meant that he could accept New York's approval of gay marriage, even though he still considered himself an \"unapologetic social conservative.\"\n\n\"Our friends in New York six weeks ago passed a statute that said marriage can be between two people of the same sex,\" he told the Colorado gathering. \"And you know what? That's New York, and that's their business, and that's fine with me. That is their call. If you believe in the 10th Amendment, stay out of their business.\"\n\nAdding a few words\n\nSocial conservatives immediately took issue with Perry's position.\n\n\"So, Gov. Perry, if a state wanted to allow polygamy, or if they chose to deny heterosexuals the right to marry, would that be OK, too?\" former Sen. Rick Santorum tweeted. Santorum also is seeking the GOP nomination for president.\n\nA week later, Perry told Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, \"I probably needed to add a few words after that 'it's fine with me,' and that it's fine with me that a state is using their sovereign rights to decide an issue. Obviously, gay marriage is not fine with me. My stance hasn't changed. I believe marriage is a union between one man and one woman.\"\n\nHe told Perkins he had worked to pass a defense of marriage act in Texas and had signed a bill in 2003 specifying that Texas does not recognize same-sex marriage or same-sex civil union.\n\nHe also told Perkins he was in favor of a federal marriage amendment as a way to thwart \"activist\" judges.\n\nHis book Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, would seem to tolerate differences among the states: \"If you don't support the death penalty and citizens packing a pistol, don't come to Texas. If you don't like medical marijuana and gay marriage, don't move to California. ... I would no more consider living in Massachusetts than I suspect a great number of folks from Massachusetts wold like to live in Texas. We just don't agree on a number of things. They passed state-run health care, they have sanctioned gay marriage.\"\n\nThe pledge factor\n\nMore interest groups this campaign season are insisting that candidates sign pledges to gain endorsements and donations. Although Democrats occasionally are asked to sign pledges, it primarily is a Republican phenomenon.\n\nGOP candidate Jon Huntsman, a former Utah governor, has pledged not to pledge.\n\n\"I don't sign pledges - other than the Pledge of Allegiance and a pledge to my wife,\" he said while campaigning in Idaho recently.\n\njoe.holley@chron.com",
  "latent_14040": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe number of people unemployed in the eurozone dipped slightly in May, but not by enough to dent the unemployment rate.\n\nSome 18.5 million people were out of work in May, 28,000 fewer than in April, but the jobless rate remained at 11.6%, the Eurostat agency said.\n\nApril's figure had initially been reported at 11.7%, but was revised down to 11.6%.\n\nSeparately, a survey showed eurozone manufacturing growth eased in June.\n\n'Too weak'\n\nThe unemployment report highlighted again the divergence between northern and southern Europe.

  "latent_14267": "On a morgue slab in Shejaiya in the Gaza Strip a few days ago lay two anonymous children, a boy and a girl. Their bodies could not be identified because their parents, according to Sharif Abdel Kouddous, a journalist for the Nation magazine, were already dead. Israel’s continuing assault on Gaza has claimed hundreds of Palestinian lives and has created 81,000 refugees. I should support it, according to many Zionist opinionators, because I am half Jewish. They tell me that those children had to die so that my future children can be safe. In the end, they say, it’s about blood.\n\nDoes it matter what Jews, and people from Jewish backgrounds, say about Gaza? It does when children are being murdered in our names, and in the names of family members for whom we have recently said Kaddish. Jews are better placed than anyone else to articulate a powerful call for ceasefire that does not fall back on the sort of lazy anti-Semitism that seems to the Israeli military to prove its point.\n\nPeople of Jewish descent have every reason to be hyper-vigilant about anti-Semitic language and it is stupid to pretend that there’s none of it in the global movement for Palestinian freedom. It’s stupid to pretend that nobody ever conflates Jews with Zionists, or labels the Jewish people bloodthirsty and barbarous. And it hurts like hell to hear hoary old words of hate trickling through a movement that is about justice, about freedom, about protecting some of the world’s most persecuted people. It hurts just as much, however, to hear right-wing Israelis tell Jews around the world that the violence is for us, for our ancestors, for our children.\n\nIt is not anti-Semitic to suggest that Israel doesn’t get a free pass to kill whoever it likes in order to feel “safe”. It is not anti-Semitic to point out that if what Israel needs to feel “safe” is to pen the Palestinian people in an open prison under military occupation, the state’s definition of safety might warrant some unpacking. And it is not anti-Semitic to say that this so-called war is one in which only one side actually has an army.\n\nIt is not hate speech to reiterate the wild disparity in casualties. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed this past week, most of them civilians. Fewer than 30 Israelis have died, and most of them were soldiers. To speak of proportionality is not to call, as at least one silverback columnist has claimed, for “more dead Jews”.\n\nOne can mourn loss of life on both sides without condoning further bloodshed. The families of the young Israeli soldiers killed on the front lines of a conflict they didn’t create are grieving, too. That doesn’t change the fact that the casualties are disproportionate. This is a conflict in which no one wants to edge towards saying the word “genocide”, because in this context that is a term so loaded that what’s left of reasoned debate staggers and falls to its knees.\n\nComparisons to the Holocaust are crass – except when it is Israeli politicians who make them, as the economy minister Naftali Bennett did on CNN, accusing Hamas of “conducting mass self-genocide”. Then the comparisons become obscene. Binyamin Netanyahu’s ministers tell the world that families in Gaza that remain in their homes have nobody but themselves to blame when they are massacred. Ayelet Shaked, of the far-right Jewish Home Party, went further, posting on her Facebook page that the mothers of Palestinian men should “follow their sons [to hell] . . . Nothing would be more just. They should go, as should the physical homes in which they raised the snakes. Otherwise, more little snakes will be raised there.”\n\nThis sort of hate speech is not just disturbing – it is disturbed. We must have a compassionate reading of Jewish and Israeli history to understand where that disturbance comes from. Over 20 centuries of faith and survival, the Jewish people have been persecuted, forced into exile, tortured, traumatised, ridiculed, harassed and finally murdered in their millions, and that matters – it still matters, to the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those who survived, including me.\n\nBut the abused sometimes go on to abuse others. Countries formed in response to genocide expand their borders with murderous intolerance. People whose communities are bombed and bulldozed fire rockets back. Cycles of violence are comprehensible. That doesn’t mean they are acceptable. That doesn’t mean they can never stop.\n\nLast weekend, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children around the world marched to express their disgust at Israel’s air and ground assault on the Gaza Strip, and among them were swathes of Jews and Israelis. This is one of the few situations in which it makes a difference to stand up and say: not in our name. Not now, not ever again. Being Jewish, or having Jewish roots, doesn’t make you responsible for what is happening in Gaza, but it does mean that your dissent carries that much more weight. Not more weight than the grieving relatives of the families butchered in Shejaiya, but the kind of weight that hangs heavy on the heart, and that comes with the small but palpable risk of upsetting your family.\n\nSo here it is. I think my ancestors who were persecuted, tormented and exiled down the centuries for being Jews would be horrified to see what is being done in their name today. Maybe it’s crass to put words in the mouths of your dead relatives, but right-wing hawks have been putting their opinions in the mouths of my dead relatives for weeks, so I think I’m entitled to a say, too.\n\nBecause in the end, it is about blood. Not blood as metonym or metaphor, but the actual stuff, wet on the faces of screaming children in Gaza. It’s about blood, and how much more of it will have to be shed before Israel finally feels “safe”, and how long the international community will stand by. The moral basis for Israel’s persecution of the Palestinian people is eroding fast. It is not anti-Semitic to say “not in my name”.\n\nLaurie Penny’s “Unspeakable Things: Sex, Lies and Revolution” is newly published by Bloomsbury (£12.99)",

  "latent_14432": "Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms\n\nElizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926)[a] is Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms.[b]\n\nElizabeth was born in London as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and she was educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne on the abdication of his brother King Edward VIII in 1936, from which time she was the heir presumptive. She began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.\n\nWhen her father died in February 1952, she became head of the Commonwealth and queen regnant of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon. She has reigned as a constitutional monarch through major political changes, such as devolution in the United Kingdom, Canadian patriation, and the decolonisation of Africa. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories gained independence and realms, including South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (renamed Sri Lanka), became republics. Her many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland and visits to or from five popes. Significant events have included her coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, Golden, and Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012 respectively. In 2017, she became the first British monarch to reach a Sapphire Jubilee. She is the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch as well as the world's longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state, the oldest and longest-reigning current monarch and the longest-serving current head of state.\n\nElizabeth has occasionally faced republican sentiments and press criticism of the royal family, in particular after the breakdown of her children's marriages, her annus horribilis in 1992 and the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana, Princess of Wales. However, support for the monarchy has consistently been and remains high, as does her personal popularity.\n\nEarly life\n\nElizabeth was born at 02:40 (GMT) on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. Her father, the Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son of the King. Her mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth), was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. She was delivered by Caesarean section at her maternal grandfather's London house: 17 Bruton Street, Mayfair.[3] She was baptised by the Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May,[4][c] and named Elizabeth after her mother, Alexandra after George V's mother, who had died six months earlier, and Mary after her paternal grandmother.[6] Called \"Lilibet\" by her close family,[7] based on what she called herself at first,[8] she was cherished by her grandfather George V, and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.[9]\n\nElizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their governess, Marion Crawford.[10] Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature and music.[11] Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled The Little Princesses in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family.[12] The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility.[13] Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was two as \"a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant.\"[14] Her cousin Margaret Rhodes described her as \"a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved\".[15]\n\nHeir presumptive\n\nDuring her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the throne, behind her uncle Edward and her father. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as Edward was still young. Many people believed he would marry and have children of his own.[16] When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis.[17] Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became heir presumptive. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession.[18]\n\nElizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from Henry Marten, Vice-Provost of Eton College,[19] and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses.[20] A Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace Company, was formed specifically so she could socialise with girls her own age.[21] Later, she was enrolled as a Sea Ranger.[20]\n\nIn 1939, Elizabeth's parents toured Canada and the United States. As in 1927, when her parents had toured Australia and New Zealand, Elizabeth remained in Britain, since her father thought her too young to undertake public tours.[22] Elizabeth \"looked tearful\" as her parents departed.[23] They corresponded regularly,[23] and she and her parents made the first royal transatlantic telephone call on 18 May.[22]\n\nSecond World War\n\nIn September 1939, Britain entered the Second World War. Lord Hailsham[24] suggested that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada to avoid the frequent aerial bombing. This was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, \"The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave.\"[25] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk.[26] From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived for most of the next five years.[27] At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments.[28] In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities.[29] She stated: \"We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.\"[29]\n\nIn 1943, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the Grenadier Guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year.[30] As she approached her 18th birthday, parliament changed the law so she could act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.[31] In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number of 230873.[32] She trained as a driver and mechanic and was given the rank of honorary junior commander five months later.[33][34][35]\n\nAt the end of the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled anonymously with the celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, \"We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised ... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.\"[36]\n\nDuring the war, plans were drawn up to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for several reasons, including fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd at a time when Britain was at war.[37] Welsh politicians suggested she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.[38] In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.[39]\n\nPrincess Elizabeth went in 1947 on her first overseas tour, accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the British Commonwealth on her 21st birthday, she made the following pledge: \"I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.\"[40]\n\nMarriage\n\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, in 1934 and 1937.[41] They are second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third cousins through Queen Victoria. After another meeting at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in July 1939, Elizabeth—though only 13 years old—said she fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters.[42] She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.[43]\n\nThe engagement was not without controversy; Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links.[44] Marion Crawford wrote, \"Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin.\"[45] Later biographies reported Elizabeth's mother initially opposed the union, dubbing Philip \"The Hun\".[46] In later life, however, the Queen Mother told biographer Tim Heald that Philip was \"an English gentleman\".[47]\n\nBefore the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, officially converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Anglicanism, and adopted the style Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, taking the surname of his mother's British family.[48] Just before the wedding, he was created Duke of Edinburgh and granted the style His Royal Highness.[49]\n\nElizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. They received 2,500 wedding gifts from around the world.[50] Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war, Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown, which was designed by Norman Hartnell.[51] In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding.[52] The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.[53]\n\nElizabeth gave birth to her first child, Prince Charles, on 14 November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued letters patent allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince.[54] A second child, Princess Anne, was born in 1950.[55]\n\nFollowing their wedding, the couple leased Windlesham Moor, near Windsor Castle, until July 1949,[50] when they took up residence at Clarence House in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British Crown Colony of Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardamanġa, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten. The children remained in Britain.[56]\n\nReign\n\nAccession and coronation\n\n2 June 1953 Coronation of Elizabeth II,\n\nDuring 1951, George VI's health declined, and Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she toured Canada and visited President Harry S. Truman in Washington, D.C., in October 1951, her private secretary, Martin Charteris, carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour.[57] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of Kenya. On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of the King and consequently Elizabeth's immediate accession to the throne. Philip broke the news to the new queen.[58] Martin Charteris asked her to choose a regnal name; she chose to remain Elizabeth, \"of course\".[59] She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.[60] She and the Duke of Edinburgh moved into Buckingham Palace.[61]\n\nWith Elizabeth's accession, it seemed probable the royal house would bear her husband's name, becoming the House of Mountbatten, in line with the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth's grandmother, Queen Mary, favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, \"I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\"[62] In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname Mountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.[63]\n\nAmid preparations for the coronation, Princess Margaret told her sister she wished to marry Peter Townsend, a divorcé‚ 16 years Margaret's senior, with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of Martin Charteris, \"the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought—she hoped—given time, the affair would peter out.\"[64] Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage, she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession.[65] Eventually, she decided to abandon her plans with Townsend.[66] In 1960, she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; she did not remarry.[67]\n\nDespite the death of Queen Mary on 24 March, the coronation on 2 June 1953 went ahead as planned, as Mary had asked before she died.[68] The ceremony in Westminster Abbey, with the exception of the anointing and communion, was televised for the first time.[69][d] Elizabeth's coronation gown was embroidered on her instructions with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries:[73] English Tudor rose; Scots thistle; Welsh leek; Irish shamrock; Australian wattle; Canadian maple leaf; New Zealand silver fern; South African protea; lotus flowers for India and Ceylon; and Pakistan's wheat, cotton, and jute.[74]\n\nContinuing evolution of the Commonwealth\n\nElizabeth's realms (pink) and their territories and protectorates (dark red) at the beginning of her reign\n\nFrom Elizabeth's birth onwards, the British Empire continued its transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations.[75] By the time of her accession in 1952, her role as head of multiple independent states was already established.[76] In 1953, the Queen and her husband embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour, visiting 13 countries and covering more than 40,000 miles by land, sea and air.[77] She became the first reigning monarch of Australia and New Zealand to visit those nations.[78] During the tour, crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen her.[79] Throughout her reign, the Queen has made hundreds of state visits to other countries and tours of the Commonwealth; she is the most widely travelled head of state.[80]\n\nIn 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union.[81] In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.[82]\n\nElizabeth II and Commonwealth leaders at the 1960 Commonwealth Conference\n\nThe absence of a formal mechanism within the Conservative Party for choosing a leader meant that, following Eden's resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to commission to form a government. Eden recommended she consult Lord Salisbury, the Lord President of the Council. Lord Salisbury and Lord Kilmuir, the Lord Chancellor, consulted the British Cabinet, Winston Churchill, and the Chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, resulting in the Queen appointing their recommended candidate: Harold Macmillan.[83]\n\nThe Suez crisis and the choice of Eden's successor led in 1957 to the first major personal criticism of the Queen. In a magazine, which he owned and edited,[84] Lord Altrincham accused her of being \"out of touch\".[85] Altrincham was denounced by public figures and slapped by a member of the public appalled by his comments.[86] Six years later, in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised the Queen to appoint the Earl of Home as prime minister, advice she followed.[87] The Queen again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister.[87] In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader, thus relieving her of involvement.[88]\n\nIn 1957, she made a state visit to the United States, where she addressed the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of the Commonwealth. On the same tour, she opened the 23rd Canadian Parliament, becoming the first monarch of Canada to open a parliamentary session.[89] Two years later, solely in her capacity as Queen of Canada, she revisited the United States and toured Canada.[89][90] In 1961, she toured Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran.[91] On a visit to Ghana the same year, she dismissed fears for her safety, even though her host, President Kwame Nkrumah, who had replaced her as head of state, was a target for assassins.[92] Harold Macmillan wrote, \"The Queen has been absolutely determined all through ... She is impatient of the attitude towards her to treat her as ... a film star ... She has indeed 'the heart and stomach of a man' ... She loves her duty and means to be a Queen.\"[92] Before her tour through parts of Quebec in 1964, the press reported extremists within the Quebec separatist movement were plotting Elizabeth's assassination.[93][94] No attempt was made, but a riot did break out while she was in Montreal; the Queen's \"calmness and courage in the face of the violence\" was noted.[95]\n\nElizabeth's pregnancies with Princes Andrew and Edward, in 1959 and 1963, mark the only times she has not performed the State Opening of the British parliament during her reign.[96] In addition to performing traditional ceremonies, she also instituted new practices. Her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970.[97]\n\nAcceleration of decolonisation\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the decolonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. Over 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965, however, the Rhodesian Prime Minister, Ian Smith, in opposition to moves towards majority rule, unilaterally declared independence while expressing \"loyalty and devotion\" to Elizabeth. Although the Queen formally dismissed him, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade.[98] As Britain's ties to its former empire weakened, the British government sought entry to the European Community, a goal it achieved in 1973.[99]\n\nIn February 1974, the British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, advised the Queen to call a general election in the middle of her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to Britain.[100] The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.[101]\n\nA year later, at the height of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals.[102] As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, saying she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general.[103] The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.[102]\n\nSilver Jubilee\n\nIn 1977, Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth, many coinciding with her associated national and Commonwealth tours. The celebrations re-affirmed the Queen's popularity, despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret's separation from her husband.[104] In 1978, the Queen endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania's communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, and his wife, Elena,[105] though privately she thought they had \"blood on their hands\".[106] The following year brought two blows: one was the unmasking of Anthony Blunt, former Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, as a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law Lord Mountbatten by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.[107]\n\nAccording to Paul Martin, Sr., by the end of the 1970s the Queen was worried the Crown \"had little meaning for\" Pierre Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister.[108] Tony Benn said the Queen found Trudeau \"rather disappointing\".[108] Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics, such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind the Queen's back in 1977, and the removal of various Canadian royal symbols during his term of office.[108] In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the patriation of the Canadian constitution found the Queen \"better informed ... than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats\".[108] She was particularly interested after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as head of state.[108] Patriation removed the role of the British parliament from the Canadian constitution, but the monarchy was retained. Trudeau said in his memoirs that the Queen favoured his attempt to reform the constitution and that he was impressed by \"the grace she displayed in public\" and \"the wisdom she showed in private\".[109]\n\n1980s\n\nDuring the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, six weeks before the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse, Burmese. Police later discovered the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three.[110] The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.[111]\n\nMonths later, in October, the Queen was the subject of another attack while on a visit to Dunedin, New Zealand. New Zealand Security Intelligence Service documents declassified in 2018 revealed that 17-year-old Christopher John Lewis fired a shot with a .22 rifle from the fifth floor of a building overlooking the parade, but missed.[112] Lewis was arrested, but never charged with attempted murder or treason, and sentenced to three years in jail for unlawful possession and discharge of a firearm. Two years into his sentence, he attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital in order to assassinate Prince Charles, who was visiting the country with Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prince William.[113]\n\nFrom April to September 1982, the Queen was anxious but proud of her son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War.[114] On 9 July, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, Michael Fagan, in the room with her. In a serious lapse of security, assistance only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard.[115] After hosting US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, the Queen was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.[116]\n\nIntense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true.[117] As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\"[118] Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.[119] Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party—Thatcher's political opponents.[120] Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\".[121] Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen,[122] and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift—membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter—to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major.[123] Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \"behind the scenes force\" in ending apartheid.[124][125]\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, the Queen had become the target of satire.[126] The involvement of younger members of the royal family in the charity game show It's a Royal Knockout in 1987 was ridiculed.[127] In Canada, Elizabeth publicly supported politically divisive constitutional amendments, prompting criticism from opponents of the proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau.[124] The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup. As monarch of Fiji, Elizabeth supported the attempts of the Governor-General, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic.[128]\n\n1990s\n\nIn 1991, in the wake of coalition victory in the Gulf War, the Queen became the first British monarch to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress.[129]\n\nOctober 1992 Philip and Elizabeth,\n\nIn a speech on 24 November 1992, to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession, Elizabeth called 1992 her annus horribilis, meaning horrible year.[130] Republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth—which were contradicted by the Palace—and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.[131] In March, her second son, Prince Andrew, and his wife, Sarah, separated; in April, her daughter, Princess Anne, divorced Captain Mark Phillips;[132] during a state visit to Germany in October, angry demonstrators in Dresden threw eggs at her;[133] and, in November, a large fire broke out at Windsor Castle, one of her official residences. The monarchy came under increased criticism and public scrutiny.[134] In an unusually personal speech, the Queen said that any institution must expect criticism, but suggested it be done with \"a touch of humour, gentleness and understanding\".[135] Two days later, the Prime Minister, John Major, announced reforms to the royal finances planned since the previous year, including the Queen paying income tax from 1993 onwards, and a reduction in the civil list.[136] In December, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, formally separated.[137] The year ended with a lawsuit as the Queen sued The Sun newspaper for breach of copyright when it published the text of her annual Christmas message two days before it was broadcast. The newspaper was forced to pay her legal fees and donated £200,000 to charity.[138]\n\nIn the years to follow, public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana's marriage continued.[139] Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings.[140] Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions.[141] In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying a divorce was desirable.[142]\n\nIn August 1997, a year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. The Queen was on holiday with her extended family at Balmoral. Diana's two sons by Charles—Princes William and Harry—wanted to attend church and so the Queen and Prince Philip took them that morning.[143] After that single public appearance, for five days the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private,[144] but the royal family's seclusion and the failure to fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace caused public dismay.[125][145] Pressured by the hostile reaction, the Queen agreed to return to London and do a live television broadcast on 5 September, the day before Diana's funeral.[146] In the broadcast, she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings \"as a grandmother\" for the two princes.[147] As a result, much of the public hostility evaporated.[147]\n\nIn November 1997, the Queen and her husband held a reception at Banqueting House to mark their golden wedding anniversary.[148] She made a speech and praised Philip for his role as a consort, referring to him as \"my strength and stay\".[148]\n\nGolden Jubilee\n\nIn 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee. Her sister and mother died in February and March respectively, and the media speculated whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure.[149] She again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, which began in Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet \"memorable\" after a power cut plunged the King's House, the official residence of the governor-general, into darkness.[150] As in 1977, there were street parties and commemorative events, and monuments were named to honour the occasion. A million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London,[151] and the enthusiasm shown by the public for the Queen was greater than many journalists had expected.[152]\n\nThough generally healthy throughout her life, in 2003 she had keyhole surgery on both knees. In October 2006, she missed the opening of the new Emirates Stadium because of a strained back muscle that had been troubling her since the summer.[153]\n\nIn May 2007, The Daily Telegraph, citing unnamed sources, reported the Queen was \"exasperated and frustrated\" by the policies of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, that she was concerned the British Armed Forces were overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair.[154] She was, however, said to admire Blair's efforts to achieve peace in Northern Ireland.[155] She became the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary in November 2007.[156] On 20 March 2008, at the Church of Ireland St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh, the Queen attended the first Maundy service held outside England and Wales.[157]\n\nDiamond Jubilee and longest-reigning British monarch\n\nThe Queen addressed the United Nations for a second time in 2010, again in her capacity as Queen of all Commonwealth realms and Head of the Commonwealth.[158] The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, introduced her as \"an anchor for our age\".[159] During her visit to New York, which followed a tour of Canada, she officially opened a memorial garden for British victims of the September 11 attacks.[159] The Queen's visit to Australia in October 2011—her 16th visit since 1954—was called her \"farewell tour\" in the press because of her age.[160] By invitation of the Irish President, Mary McAleese, the Queen made the first state visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch in May 2011.[161]\n\nJuly 2012 as part of her Diamond Jubilee tour Visiting Birmingham inas part of her Diamond Jubilee tour\n\nElizabeth's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 marked 60 years on the throne, and celebrations were held throughout her realms, the wider Commonwealth, and beyond. In a message released on Accession Day, Elizabeth wrote:\n\nIn this special year, as I dedicate myself anew to your service, I hope we will all be reminded of the power of togetherness and the convening strength of family, friendship and good neighbourliness ... I hope also that this Jubilee year will be a time to give thanks for the great advances that have been made since 1952 and to look forward to the future with clear head and warm heart.[162]\n\nShe and her husband undertook an extensive tour of the United Kingdom, while her children and grandchildren embarked on royal tours of other Commonwealth states on her behalf.[163][164] On 4 June, Jubilee beacons were lit around the world.[165] In November, the Queen and her husband celebrated their sapphire wedding anniversary.[166] On 18 December, she became the first British sovereign to attend a peacetime Cabinet meeting since George III in 1781.[167]\n\nThe Queen, who opened the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, also opened the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London, making her the first head of state to open two Olympic Games in two countries.[168] For the London Olympics, she played herself in a short film as part of the opening ceremony, alongside Daniel Craig as James Bond.[169] On 4 April 2013, she received an honorary BAFTA for her patronage of the film industry and was called \"the most memorable Bond girl yet\" at the award ceremony.[170]\n\nOn 3 March 2013, Elizabeth was admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital as a precaution after developing symptoms of gastroenteritis. She returned to Buckingham Palace the following day.[171] A week later, she signed the new Commonwealth charter.[172] Because of her age and the need for her to limit travelling, in 2013 she chose not to attend the biennial meeting of Commonwealth heads of government for the first time in 40 years. She was represented at the summit in Sri Lanka by her son, Prince Charles.[173] She had cataract surgery in May 2018.[174]\n\nThe Queen surpassed her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-lived British monarch on 21 December 2007, and the longest-reigning British monarch and longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in the world on 9 September 2015.[175][176][177] She is also the \"longest-reigning sovereign in Canada's modern era\".[178] (King Louis XIV of France reigned over Canada (New France) for longer than Elizabeth.[179]) She became the oldest current monarch after King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia died on 23 January 2015.[180][181] She later became the longest-reigning current monarch and the longest-serving current head of state following the death of King Bhumibol of Thailand on 13 October 2016,[182][183] and the oldest current head of state on the resignation of Robert Mugabe on 21 November 2017.[184][185] On 6 February 2017, she became the first British monarch to commemorate a Sapphire Jubilee,[186] and on 20 November, she was the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary.[187] Prince Philip had retired from his official duties as the Queen's consort in August.[188]\n\nThe Queen does not intend to abdicate,[189] though Prince Charles is expected to take on more of her duties as Elizabeth, who celebrated her 92nd birthday in 2018, carries out fewer public engagements.[190] On 20 April 2018, the government leaders of the Commonwealth of Nations announced that she will be succeeded by Prince Charles as head of the Commonwealth. The Queen stated it was her \"sincere wish\" that the Prince of Wales would follow her in the role.[191] Plans for her death and funeral have been extensively prepared by most British government and media organisations for decades.[192]\n\nPublic perception and character\n\nSince Elizabeth rarely gives interviews, little is known of her personal feelings. As a constitutional monarch, she has not expressed her own political opinions in a public forum.[193] She does have a deep sense of religious and civic duty, and takes her coronation oath seriously.[194] Aside from her official religious role as Supreme Governor of the established Church of England, she is a member of that church and also of the national Church of Scotland.[195] She has demonstrated support for inter-faith relations and has met with leaders of other churches and religions, including five popes: Pius XII, John XXIII, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis.[196] A personal note about her faith often features in her annual Christmas message broadcast to the Commonwealth. In 2000, she said:\n\nTo many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life. I, like so many of you, have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words and example.[197]\n\nShe is patron of over 600 organisations and charities.[198] Her main leisure interests include equestrianism and dogs, especially her Pembroke Welsh Corgis.[199] Her lifelong love of corgis began in 1933 with Dookie, the first corgi owned by her family.[200][201] Scenes of a relaxed, informal home life have occasionally been witnessed; she and her family, from time to time, prepare a meal together and do the washing up afterwards.[202]\n\nIn the 1950s, as a young woman at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous \"fairytale Queen\".[203] After the trauma of the Second World War, it was a time of hope, a period of progress and achievement heralding a \"new Elizabethan age\".[204] Lord Altrincham's accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a \"priggish schoolgirl\" was an extremely rare criticism.[205] In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary Royal Family and by televising Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales.[206] In public, she took to wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats, which allow her to be seen easily in a crowd.[207]\n\nAt her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic,[208] but in the 1980s, public criticism of the royal family increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny.[209] Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public.[210] Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.[211]\n\nIn November 1999, a referendum in Australia on the future of the Australian monarchy favoured its retention in preference to an indirectly elected head of state.[212] Polls in Britain in 2006 and 2007 revealed strong support for Elizabeth,[213] and in 2012, her Diamond Jubilee year, approval ratings hit 90 percent.[214] Referendums in Tuvalu in 2008 and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2009 both rejected proposals to become republics.[215]\n\nElizabeth has been portrayed in a variety of media by many notable artists, including painters Pietro Annigoni, Peter Blake, Chinwe Chukwuogo-Roy, Terence Cuneo, Lucian Freud, Rolf Harris, Damien Hirst, Juliet Pannett, and Tai-Shan Schierenberg.[216][217] Notable photographers of Elizabeth have included Cecil Beaton, Yousuf Karsh, Annie Leibovitz, Lord Lichfield, Terry O'Neill, John Swannell, and Dorothy Wilding. The first official portrait of Elizabeth was taken by Marcus Adams in 1926.[218]\n\nFinances\n\nElizabeth's personal fortune has been the subject of speculation for many years. In 1971 Jock Colville, her former private secretary and a director of her bank, Coutts, estimated her wealth at £2 million (equivalent to about £28 million in 2018[219]).[220][221] In 1993, Buckingham Palace called estimates of £100 million \"grossly overstated\".[222] In 2002, she inherited an estate worth an estimated £70 million from her mother.[223] The Sunday Times Rich List 2017 estimated her personal wealth at £360 million, making her the 329th richest person in the UK.[224]\n\nThe Royal Collection, which includes thousands of historic works of art and the Crown Jewels, is not owned by the Queen personally but is held in trust,[225] as are her official residences, such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,[226] and the Duchy of Lancaster, a property portfolio valued at £472 million in 2015.[227] Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle are personally owned by the Queen.[226] The British Crown Estate—with holdings of £12 billion in 2016[224]—is held in trust and cannot be sold or owned by Elizabeth in a personal capacity.[228]\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\n\nTitles and styles\n\n21 April 1926 – 11 December 1936: Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth of York\n\n11 December 1936 – 20 November 1947: Her Royal Highness The Princess Elizabeth\n\n20 November 1947 – 6 February 1952: Her Royal Highness The Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh\n\nSince 6 February 1952: Her Majesty The Queen\n\nElizabeth has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders in her own countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms she has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Jamaica and her other realms and territories in Jamaica, Queen of Australia and her other realms and territories in Australia, etc. In the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies rather than separate realms, she is known as Duke of Normandy and Lord of Mann, respectively. Additional styles include Defender of the Faith and Duke of Lancaster. When in conversation with the Queen, the practice is to initially address her as Your Majesty and thereafter as Ma'am.[229]\n\nArms\n\nFrom 21 April 1944 until her accession, Elizabeth's arms consisted of a lozenge bearing the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose and the first and third a cross of St George.[230] Upon her accession, she inherited the various arms her father held as sovereign. The Queen also possesses royal standards and personal flags for use in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Barbados, and elsewhere.[231]\n\nIssue\n\nAncestry\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography",
  "latent_14446": "What lies behind the rise in people using food banks in Britain? Campaigners, food bank providers and researchers have claimed that changes to welfare benefits are the main reason people turn to food banks – claims that the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) strongly deny. So how strong is the evidence linking benefit changes to food bank use?\n\nThe latest study looking at this question was based on a survey carried out by the Child Poverty Action Group, Church of England, Oxfam GB and The Trussell Trust – research that the DWP dismissed because it “can’t prove anything.” The study’s main finding was that “for between half and two-thirds of the people included in this research, the immediate income crisis was linked to the operation of the benefits system.” I asked Jonathan Portes, Director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Reseach, and Ben Baumberg, Senior Lecturer in Sociology and Social Policy, University of Kent, how robust and systematic this study was.\n\nBeing largely qualitative research from a small sample, the study doesn’t give us an in-depth idea about food bank use in the country as a whole. Still, Portes said, “I can't see anything to suggest this isn't at least as good quality as the many qualitative research reports DWP commission and publish.”\n\nBaumberg looked into the strengths and weaknesses of the research in detail, focussing on the quantitative elements. He noted that the study’s authors are transparent in setting out the limitations of their work, which is really welcome. “The three food banks involved are not statistically representative of food banks in Britain, but they make a reasonable claim to be typical of Trussell Trust food banks across the country. This is all transparently admitted by [the authors]. On p19, they have a very clear box setting out the ‘advantages and limitations of the research design.” We also know little about people at these food banks who didn’t respond to the survey. Despite these limitations, Baumberg judges that “overall, it seems that this was a well-conducted study on a very tight budget (perhaps unsurprisingly, given the cost of high-quality data collection with food bank clients).”\n\nBaumberg also put this new study into context by referring to other available evidence on the use of food banks. It’s clear that there’s no official, systematic data collected on the number of people visiting food banks across the UK, or the reasons they need to use them. In the absence of reliable quantitative data, qualitative research can add some insights into the use of food banks – and when several independent reports suggest that benefit changes are the main cause of people being referred to food banks, it becomes hard for the government to carry on dismissing each study as not proving anything.\n\nThe government has previously delayed publication of a separate report into food banks, and is now dismissing good-quality, if limited, research. If the Department of Work and Pensions doesn’t think well-conducted qualitative research, from authors who don’t over-claim about their findings, is good enough, why don’t they commission some systematic, quantitative research into the numbers of people requiring food banks and the reasons for needing them? That way we can judge whether the government is right to reject a link between benefit changes and food poverty.\n\nBen Baumberg has blogged in more detail about the connection between benefit changes and food bank use here.\n\nImage from Wikimedia",

  "latent_14628": "Hannibal’s Bryan Fuller seems to be settling comfortably into his new life, transitioning seamlessly from showrunner of a critically beloved cult show into hint-dropping tormentor of that canceled program’s rabid fans. He’s already made some noise about a possible resurrection of Hannibal on one of the big streaming services, as well as his willingness to continue the story as a movie if the stars were to properly align. Now, he’s also started to drop hints about what could have been, had the metaphorical teacup reformed and the show been allowed to continue.\n\nSpecifically, Fuller told Vulture that he’d been thinking of ways to introduce elements from Thomas Harris’ breakout novel The Silence Of The Lambs—the book that introduced FBI trainee Clarice Starling to the world and served as the basis for Jonathan Demme’s Oscar-winning film—into the show. “I want Buffalo Bill. I want to tell the Buffalo Bill story in a way that hasn’t been told before,” Fuller said, alluding to the skin-stealing serial killer played by Ted Levine in the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut adaptation of Lambs has always been hindered by copyright issues, as MGM still holds the film rights to all the characters that originated in the book, including Starling and unlikely survivor Barney the orderly (played by Frankie Faison across all three of Anthony Hopkins’ Lecter films.) Fuller joked about including a character named “Schmarice Schmarling” in the show as a workaround—ignoring the fact that that’s pretty much exactly what he already did when he created Anna Chlumsky’s character, ambitious FBI trainee Miriam Lass—before alluding to an interesting behind-the-scenes possibility: “I’ve asked Schmodie Schmoster if she wanted to direct an episode, because she’s a brilliant director,” Fuller said, using his powers as a criminal mastermind to cunningly refer to original Starling actress Jodie Foster via code.“But that’s the only conversation I’ve had with Schmodie Schmoster.”\n\nSo, there you go, Hannibal fans: Not only is your favorite show at-least-temporarily dead, but you also missed the chance to see Jodie Foster direct an arc starring one of her most famous characters in the hypothetical fourth season. Somewhere, Bryan Fuller feels your pain, and, like a distant God, is amused.",
  "latent_14725": "LawNewz.com has learned that First Lady Melania Trump has agreed to settle her defamation lawsuit filed against a Maryland blogger who published an article accusing her of being a high-end escort. The blogger has agreed to pay Trump a “substantial sum,” according to a statement from Melania’s attorney, Charles Harder. The blogger, Webster Tarpley, also agreed to issue an additional apology for the posts.\n\nLast year, on Tarpley’s website, Tarpley.net, he blogged about how there were reports that Melania suffered from a “breakdown” after accusations she plagiarized portions of her speech at the GOP Convention, according to court documents. He also blogged about “rumors” from other sources that Melania once worked as a high-end escort. Tarpley issued a retraction and apologized shortly after publishing the story, but Trump sued anyway. The Daily Mail published a similar story, which has since been retracted, but Melania sued them as well.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tarpley issued this statement:\n\n“I posted an article on August 2, 2016 about Melania Trump that was replete with false and defamatory statements about her. I had no legitimate factual basis to make these false statements and I fully retract them. I acknowledge that these false statements were very harmful and hurtful to Mrs. Trump and her family, and therefore I sincerely apologize to Mrs. Trump, her son, her husband and her parents for making these false statements.”\n\nIn a court filing to get the case dismissed, Tarpley accused Trump of acting in bad faith by filing the lawsuit, because she filed it after Tarpley “immediately” complied with Trump’s attorneys request to retract the article and apologize.\n\nWhile the case against Tarpley has been settled, Melania has refiled a defamation lawsuit against The Daily Mail in a New York court after it was kicked out of a Maryland venue for jurisdictional reasons.",
  "latent_14915": "Michel Krol and Andrzej Sokołowski have made the first ascent of the north face of Pik Vernyi (c5,250m), close to Kyzyl Asker in Kyrgyzstan's Western Kokshaal-too.\n\nCztery Pory Roku, which translates as Four Seasons, follows steep ice runnels and mixed ground on this relatively narrow 700m granite face, with difficulties rated at M8- (one rest point), WI5 and UIAA IV+.\n\nIn 2009, and using a different start, the accomplished Polish pair climbed almost to the end of the main difficulties before Krol was struck resoundingly on the shoulder by a large lump of falling ice.\n\nIt damaged ligaments and with the pain severe, the two bailed.\n\nOn their recent ascent, completed in two days of fine crisp weather, the two were able to follow a more direct start, and use bolt belays they had established two years previously.\n\nTwo long pitches of WI4+ led to a easier-angled but calve-burning ice field of WI3 and 3+, towards the top of which they rejoined their original line coming in from the left.\n\nThe next two pitches were taxing; WI5 M7 and M6. Four long pitches of WI4 and 5 took them to a second icefield where they bivouacked.\n\nNext day they reached their 2009 high point, where Sokołowski began grappling with the crux pitch - a troublesome icy off-width. He was unable to climb it without taking a rest on a Camalot 6 and had no time to lower and try again free.\n\nEasier ground (M4 and UIAA IV+) took them up left to the crest of the north ridge, which they followed without difficulty to the north summit (5,150-5,200m).\n\nThe main top looked to be half an hour of easy snow plodding/scrambling distant, but thunder was already in the air, and worried about the possibility of a lightning strike, they opted to give it a miss.\n\nThe two then made a committing blind descent down the east face, abseiling three, consecutive, 100m-high couloirs to reach a steep and complex glacier. Starting their descent of the glacier at 11:00pm, they reached advanced base during the night.\n\nIn recent years Russian teams reconnoitering this mountain's steep granite walls have dubbed Vernyi the Petit Dru of the Tien Shan.\n\nVernyi was first climbed by a four-man Soviet team in 1988 via a route up the north-west face and south ridge (Russian 5A). But this has only come to light recently, and was certainly unknown to Neil Crampton and Blair Fyffe, who in 2002 reached the summit by the north ridge (TD+: Scottish 6), naming it Pik Sabor. French repeated their line one year later.\n\nIn 2009 a Belorussian-Russian team added a big wall route to the main north-west face, leading to the principle summit, while in 2010 a four-person Swiss group climbed No Shaslik, a 700m line to the left up the north-west face at 6c, A3 and M6, directly to the north summit. Other aspects of this impressive granite tower have still to be ascended.\n\n« Back",

  "latent_15003": "If you’re reading this, there’s a chance that you have a Thrasher shirt and/or a pair of Vans Old Skools and are hoping to get put onto the next “hot, underground brand” to rep that your homies have yet to get their hands on. And that’s fine. We are all well aware of fashion’s ongoing obsession with skateboarding (which has been going on for longer than anyone had anticipated), and there’s no use in anyone fighting it anymore. Alexander Wang has included a “skate shoe” in a recent collection, Dior Homme has turned a runway into a “skate park”, and Gucci forever tainted a song that was used in one of the best skate parts of all time.\n\nThat being said, there is a lot more to know about some of these independent skateboard brands beyond the fact that Travis Scott or Frank Ocean has worn a piece of their clothing in an Instagram photo or in a music video. Treat this list as a little crash course in some of the skate brands that are offering something new and fresh in today’s heavily saturated market.\n\nAlltimers\n\nAlltimers\n\nThe first time I came across an Alltimers board, I was stunned and came to a standstill. As I walked into Supreme New York, I locked eyes with a board shaped like a cutout of Rihanna, which was hanging right next to another board shaped like a cutout of a yellow Lamborghini. Combined, these were the dumbest, yet most genius skateboard products I had seen in a long time. It was only a few months later that I saw their Marissa Tomei-shaped board featured on Conan O’Brien, which fully convinced me that Alltimers had found its lane in the industry.\n\nSince gaining a cult following after releasing a variety of other odd-shaped boards, Alltimers has slowly become more than just a brand pressing silly decks and has grown into a legitimate skateboard brand that’s home to the likes of OG East Coast skater Zered Basset and a slew of up and coming rippers from Canada. Alltimers has a unique presence in skateboarding that constantly changes up with each new edit and product release, and has yet to be easily pinned down.\n\nPlaying off a party boy image, a lot of Alltimers T-shirt graphics and videos manage to tap into the all-too familiar feeling of going out skating with your friends and then getting really, really hammered afterwards. Admittedly, the image could come across as really corny if it wasn’t such an accurate representation of a fraction of modern skate culture.\n\nCall Me 917\n\nCall Me 917\n\nAlex Olson’s first brand—Bianca Chandon—has occupied uncharted territory since its founding, toeing the line between a high-end fashion brand and a traditional skateboard company. It was always clear his business model would be unlike other skate brands that had come before it, but now Olson has taken a step back from trying to run Bianca as a skate brand at all; Bianca Chandon’s last offering featured Olson’s first foray into cut and sew, marketed as a unisex line of minimalist staple pieces, and there hasn’t really been any sort of “traditional” output as far as skate videos or hard goods go since.\n\nCall Me 917 was introduced to complement Bianca Chandon, aiming to create the direct tie to skateboarding that many people—including Olson himself—felt was absent from Bianca Chandon. 917 brings the same minimal, vintage ’80s and ’90s-inspired flavor of its sister company, but focuses primarily on supporting a full team of skaters and supplying a steady stream of both hard and soft goods to skate shops. And much like the skaters on the team, the brand’s gear has a classic, stylish, no frills feel to it that’s easy to throw on for daily wear.\n\nCanal New York\n\nprovtokyo.blogspot.de\n\nBy running with a spoof of the classic Chanel logo, Canal has managed to become one of the most easily-recognizable skate brands out there, just based on their logo alone. What started off as a fledgling wheel company has slowly turned into a full-blown clothing brand, offering everything from cozy fleece quarter-zips to convenient shoulder packs, all tied together under a sharp and minimal aesthetic.\n\nAs more and more independent skate brands enter the market seemingly every day, Canal has really managed to stand out amongst the crowd via its social media presence. Much like Dime, the brand’s Instagram stories usually show off the crew’s weekly missions throughout New York City, featuring silly antics with lurkers and security guards, as well as actually filming some serious skating. For a crew of younger kids making their first venture into skateboarding on their own, these guys are doing pretty well for themselves thus far.\n\nClubgear\n\nwww.humidityskateshop.net\n\nClubgear’s designs are generally meant to be attention grabbing; Reflective 3M is a staple for the brand, often thrown onto sleeve prints, hat straps, and just about anywhere else it can go. And in an era where logos are making a retreat and downsizing, Clubgear has recently opted for full sized chest prints on safety orange tees.\n\nAside from the functional clothing offerings (3M and safety orange are pretty clutch during night skate sessions), the brand’s biggest contribution to date has been changing the soundscape of skateboarding. Antosh Cimoszko’s Clubgear edits have used a number of spacey, moody tracks (often by local Canadian musicians/producers who are friends of the brand), and although people may contest the claim, I feel these edits are responsible for the recent surge in the use of electronic/house music in everything from random YouTube homie edits to big budget full-lengths from established companies.\n\nClubgear also release a “Mixxxtapes” series on their site, introducing skaters to the less-familiar musical worlds of Industrial and Acid House. Despite being a newer brand, it’s safe to say they have done a good amount to shift the culture’s sensibilities thus far.\n\nDoomsayers\n\nDoomsayers\n\nOmar Salazar has been releasing Doomsayers gear for almost half a decade now, but after suffering a severe injury in 2015 and seeing his board sponsor Alien Workshop exit the scene due to financial troubles, he has refocused on developing Doomsayers’ presence in skating with a clear anti-corporate message.\n\nDoomsayers graphics reflect that anti-corporate and anti-authority mentality, continually playing off snake and businessman imagery, and bringing a workwear feel to their drops, including their collaboration with Hong Kong brand Know1edge. As an added plus to the cool and unique feel of the brand, the items come in a simple color palette consisting of mostly black, browns, greys, and white, making the gear easy to incorporate into everyday wear.\n\nHockey\n\nHockey\n\nMuch like Call Me 917 to Bianca Chandon, Hockey is the sister company and complement to Jason Dill’s brainchild, Fucking Awesome. Current Fucking Awesome pro and 2015’s Thrasher Skater of The Year Anthony Van Engelen founded the brand a few years back, and it has quickly become recognizable due to its imagery highlighting motifs of destruction and chaos. The brand’s identity is truly an accurate representation of the styles of the skateboarders behind the brand, which is often a difficult task to achieve, making Hockey one of the strongest independent skateboard brands today.\n\nAVE himself is known for his aggressive style on the board, often going into full-on attack mode at spots; Similarly, John Fitzgerald, Donovon Piscopo and Ben Kadow are all known for their full speed lines featuring the perfect mix of finesse and power. Throw some rare Black Metal and horror movie soundtracks into that mix and you have a recipe for a killer team video. If you haven’t seen it, throw on “Hockey II” and see for yourself.\n\nPARADIS3\n\nCivilist\n\nOne of the younger kids of the Supreme and Fucking Awesome bunch, Sean Pablo, has picked up a lot from his mentors Jason Dill and AVE, but has also shown his own ability to create a cohesive brand with his new project PARADIS3. Pulling from a wide variety of influences, whether it’s through music references—the webstore currently has a live version of “She’s Lost Control” by Joy Division on loop—or flipping iconic ’90s logos you may have seen as bumper stickers growing up, PARADIS3 is a difficult brand to pin down or duplicate.\n\nWhile PARADIS3 seems less like a traditional “skate brand” and more like a pet project for Sean Pablo, it will be interesting to see where he takes it in the future. He’s already had Kim Kardashian cozying up in his hoodies, so we’re curious to see what the next big leap for his brand could be.\n\nQuasi\n\nQuasi\n\nBorn from the ashes of Alien Workshop—before it was recently reincarnated—Quasi has quickly become a favorite for many skaters across the world. It’s surprising to see how many skaters swear by their boards and the level of brand loyalty they have built up after just a few short years in business.\n\nFounder Chad Bowers managed to bring along a few riders from his old Alien Workshop team and has shaped the brand around an aesthetic that I (jokingly) refer to as “post-Tumblr”. Vaporwave-esque, bright neon graphics are their standard, which is a departure from a lot of what you see in the market today, where giant brand logos plastered across the whole deck are the norm. There’s a real art focus surrounding the brand, also making it appealing to a number of people outside of skateboarding.\n\nAnd when you do see Quasi goods on the racks in shops, the attention to detail really helps their products stand out, whether it’s the brand’s use of puff prints on graphic tees or their peculiar, minimal logo placements on their accessories.\n\nQuartersnacks\n\nQuartersnacks\n\nQuartersnacks serves double duty as New York skaters’ unofficial online skate bible and a clothing line that’s now stocked across the globe in skate shops as well as elite retailers like Dover Street Market. Offering a unique and honest voice within skateboarding media today, it’s no surprise Quartersnacks has built and maintained the following that it has across the world. That influence has reached a new high point with the introduction of regular clothing capsules.\n\nThe publication’s deep connection to the city shines through in all of the product releases, with their tees, fleeces, and accessories always managing to appeal to the needs and sensibilities of skaters in NYC. Who ever knew they wanted a “Leave-A-Penny, Take-A-Penny” tray to hold all the random shit on their dresser, or a Goldman Sachs logo ripoff hat, until Quartersnacks made those a reality?\n\nDime\n\nDime\n\nAt times, Dime feels like an inside joke that you’re not in on, but is somehow still funny whenever it’s mentioned. The marketing surrounding the skate brand’s first Vans collaboration, featuring some weird banana stomping went way over my head, but of course people rushed to get a pair anyway. There are also constant references to L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology, both of which are weird in their own way and have nothing to do with skateboarding directly, but somehow still manage to work within the scope and framework of Dime.\n\nThe fact that I sometimes don’t get it, yet still find Dime’s products cool, is a testament to the company’s strong suits. Co-founder Phil Lavoie has previously expressed the he feels surprised and stoked that he somehow turned skating with his friends and making gear they like into a full-time job, and it definitely comes across that way. Dime is a fun brand that doesn’t take itself too seriously, and still manages to come out with items and videos that hit the mark every time, leaving everyone eager for more.\n\nTheories of Atlantis\n\nTheories of Atlantis\n\nTheories of Atlantis founder Josh Stewart is truly an underground skateboarding legend. As a revered filmer, he’s put together the Static series and contributed to numerous other classic skateboarding videos, and he is in part responsible for the dissemination of the “small board brand” ethos that’s so popular today by supporting a slew of them since the beginning.\n\nTheories is possibly best known as the American distributor for a number of small skate brands, like Polar, Hopps and Magenta, but as of late is venturing into making its own clothing as well. As the name suggests, Stewart’s designs play heavily off of conspiracy theories and the occult, which makes for unique graphics featured on cool everyday pieces like printed socks and coach’s jackets.\n\nOne major plus that Stewart’s brand has going for it is that you won’t break the bank when shopping for Theories goods. As of right now, the most expensive item on the Theories site is currently a windbreaker coming in at $60, whereas some other skateboard brands will price a similar item at almost double that price. You gotta appreciate that Stewart is conscious enough to not price out his most loyal customers.\n\nSkateboard Café\n\nSkateboard Cafe\n\nAs a UK-based brand, Skateboard Cafe have done a good job building a cult following locally, and are well on their way to putting together a brand offering something different than their other English counterparts. As their name suggests, Skateboard Café has a tendency to lean towards food-related imagery and graphics, but does so in a way that is still sharp and clean.\n\nWhereas companies like Palace Skateboards and Thames have quickly locked down both a mainstream and core skateboarding following, Skateboard Café doesn’t seem to be looking to make the jump towards ubiquity. Instead, by supporting hometown heroes like Korahn Gayle and Mike Arnold who hail from outside the highly concentrated and visible London scene, they’re looking to show that the UK can be home for brands that cater to skaters who care less about penny loafers and printed joggers and more about impressive and inventive skating.\n\nYardsale\n\nYardsale\n\nSo much about Yardsale screams ’80s Miami, whether it’s their use of hits of pink and teal, the palm tree motifs, or grainy film footage giving all their videos a retro look. Their board graphics are reminiscent of sunny days at the country club or sitting back on the beach with a cold cocktail, but despite all that, you’d probably be surprised to hear the brand actually comes out of the (usually) grey and cloudy city of London.\n\nYardsale is one of the more fashion-conscious skateboard brands on this list, releasing gear that shows a unique sense of design that goes beyond screen printing logos on blank tees and hoodies. Not very many skateboard brands (if any) are out there making French terry track tops or taking inspiration from Yves Saint Laurent. And of course, there’s a lot to be said about their riders’ level of skating. It’s still surprising to see Julian Kimura’s ability to casually throw down full speed lines on cobblestone London streets.\n\nPizza Skateboards\n\nPizza Skateboards\n\nThe first time I came across Pizza, I saw a kid pushing through SoMA skate park in San Francisco wearing a crewneck with a Palace Skateboards Tri-Ferg logo flip that read “Pizza” instead. Unsure of whether the kid knowingly bought a bootleg, or this was some brand I hadn’t heard of, I sat down and Googled what Pizza Skateboards was. On their web shop, I saw a variety of other logo parodies that had that good spirited, funny attitude of something reminiscent of ’90s-era World Industries, and a time when skateboarding wasn’t so focused on portraying an image of cool.\n\nPolo Sport, NASCAR, and Chuck E. Cheeze’s logos have all gone through the spin cycle for Pizza, and the brand has gotten so good at these parodies that I’m sure some have gone over my head. I’d honestly love to find out how many cease-and-desist letters Pizza has received since it started up.\n\nAlso, as an added bonus, all you Kanye West Stans out there will be hyped as soon as you start up their “Southwest Side Story” edit.\n\nThames London\n\nThames London\n\nBlondey McCoy has taken much of what he’s learned from Lev Tanju and the Palace Skateboards team and veered off on his own to start Thames, drawing the name from the river running through the city he calls home. Much like the case of Sean Pablo and his company PARADIS3, Thames seems like a side project for Blondey to explore ideas and play around with imagery and styles not typically seen in Palace releases.\n\nTo date, the brand’s offerings have been limited and have generally only been available via the official web store or at the Palace brick-and-mortar location in London. Given that Blondey is an official team rider for Palace Skateboards, it seems like there is no plan for him to build it up as an official board company and spread distribution widely to other skate shops and retailers. For now, we’ll have to keep our eyes peeled and see where he takes the brand, as it is still in its infancy.\n\nLewis Cruise\n\nLewis Cruise\n\nIn a time when most trends have come full circle, it’s unclear which ones are back for real, and which are back for a touch of irony. Lewis Cruise has added to the confusion, bringing back the peak of swagless, bummy skater style with a Shorty’s rip off beanie cap in dirt brown. Couple that with a Craigslist logo flip and a number of other playful graphics, and we have another example of a brand in it for the fun and not the hype. Gotta respect the brand’s approach in a time where mainstream appeal is the only thing keeping certain skateboard brands alive today.\n\nPolar Skate Co.\n\nPolar is another heavyweight, hailing from Malmö, Sweden and captained by Pontus Alv, founder, art director, illustrator, filmmaker, editor, skater and DIY innovator. The guy is a creative force unlike any other in the contemporary skate scene. And with the help of co-founder and artist Stefan Narancic, the brand has quickly become known for their always impressive graphics – each deck could very well be a wall hanger. Alv’s modernist illustrations almost seem sculpturally inspired, while Narancic’s surreal, disjointed and occasionally haunting illustrations are original and intriguing in their own way. It’s more fine art than skateboard graphic. Though that may be the point – who’s to say there’s a difference? Now add in the crude, cartoonish graphics by Jacob Ovgren and you have opposing styles that somehow feel cohesive.\n\nAcross the board, Polar produces far and away the most exciting, interesting graphics currently on shop walls. And when paired with a stacked team of international rippers, the small company holds a large presence in returning skateboarding to its arts-driven, DIY roots. The more no complies, wallrides and shuvits the better, we say.\n\nBianca Chandôn\n\nAs the son of a skateboarder, Alex Olson has rebellion in his blood. And Bianca Chandôn is hell bent on doing things differently. Products are done in short runs and made available only through an exclusive, small number of stockists. There’s no team, or any immediate plans to have one. It’s just Olson and fellow creative Steven Kay steering the ship, which is currently floating in rather uncharted territory, drawing inspiration from Studio 54 era disco and drag culture, and ’80s and ’90s fashion.\n\nThough some are quick to question Olson’s interests in the LGBTQ community, many more, ourselves included, back his efforts in bringing attention to a subject conventionally considered taboo in skateboarding. Whether or not they continue down this path though, we’ll have to wait and seen. Either way, the socially conscious agenda and simple, fun art direction is refreshing to say the least.\n\nEvisen Skateboards\n\nFounded in 2011 by Japanese skater Katsumi Minami, Evisen Skateboards hopes to put some shine on Japanese cities beyond Tokyo with thriving skate scenes, like Sendai and Osaka. Mixing modern graphics with ancient Japanese motifs, there’s also a cheeky appeal added through icons like an embroidered sushi roll with chopsticks. Beyond the expected hoodies, tees, and caps, Evisen also makes pieces like all-over print camp shirts and lightweight military jackets.\n\nThe Evisen team includes Akira Imamura, MARU, Shinpei Ueno, and Minami himself, and their boards are made in the USA. Recently, Evisen made its stateside debut, by way of North American distributor PERMANENT.\n\nFucking Awesome\n\nIn some shape or another, Jason Dill’s Fucking Awesome has been around for 13 years now. Though it wasn’t until Dill and Anthony Van Engelen left a floundering Alien Workshop that FA saw its full potential come to fruition. There isn’t much driving FA, aside from a total disregard for anyone’s feelings or opinions. It’s exactly what one would expect from such an enigmatic character as Jason Dill. And that’s exactly what makes it so great.\n\nIsle Skateboards\n\nFurther proving California is no longer the absolute center of skateboarding, Nick Jensen and Paul Shier’s UK-based Isle Skateboards was born when the two bailed on the once-legendary but now-busted Blueprint program. Isle feels very contemporary, with photo heavy, design-y graphics that could easily find their way onto your favorite aesthete’s Tumblr.\n\nThe art direction extends beyond graphics to the brand’s overall identity, keeping Isle very much in line with current trends in blending subject-heavy photography and sculpture, reminiscent of the studio work of Stephanie Gonot and Charlie White’s “Self Portriat” series. But as a brand cannot survive on visuals alone, Isle’s team is growing stronger as well. As a relatively young brand, like many of the others on this list, we’re curious to see how Jensen and Shier continue to evolve with Isle.\n\nWelcome\n\nFor lack of a better word, Welcome is weird, in the best of ways. At it’s heart, Welcome is about having fun, and not taking oneself too seriously. In direct opposition to the norm, they offer 22 different board shapes with fantastical graphics on both top and bottom plies (encouraging grip tape art). The unique shapes encourage a more creative way of skating, as each trick feels different on a wide, blunt-nosed board versus a traditional popsicle shape, for example.\n\nThe overall brand aesthetic seems to fall somewhere between the brain child of Timothy Leery and Doctor Moreau, with an illuminati-esque logo and graphics featuring wicked sorcerers and bizarre animal creations in wild neon colorways. Every thing about the brand is different, as their about page states, “others take themselves seriously and not their products, we take our products seriously and not ourselves.” Skateboarding needs Welcome.\n\nBronze 56k\n\nA video franchise, a hardware brand, apparel and deck maker – whatever the hell Bronze 56k wants to be, we’re okay with it. The overall brand concept draws heavy inspiration from (err, rips off) a myriad of ’90s lo-fi and low-brow iconography, from the perfectly pixelated Windows ’95 logo and PBS silhouette to Pissin’ Calvin and the No Fear muscle guy. The appropriation of dated corporate logos corny computer graphics for use by a comically small, Internet-driven brand is too on point.\n\nIn an era of mega HD videos and arena run contests, Bronze’s late 2013 video release “Solo Jazz” and more recent “Enron” come ready with a disclaimer: “for maximum viewing pleasure switch quality to 240p.” Both deliver pure raw NYC skating mixed with amazing video overlays and interludes. Even if the lo-fi shtick is harsh on the eyes, we back the brand’s effort to keep skateboarding in the streets where it belongs. Either way, how can you not love a brand that makes a “404 Error” board graphic?\n\nMagenta\n\nBorn in Paris in 2010, Magenta is in essence a little bit of everything already mentioned. It’s completely independent, skater-owned and operated with all branding and graphics done in house by founder Soy Panday. Though the identity is entirely its own. Magenta’s team boasts individuals from the U.S., Europe and even Japan, with each bringing their own unique flavor of skating to the table through spot selection and truly creative trick combinations – check any clip of quick feet king Kolchiro Uehara skating his hometown of Osaka and you’ll know exactly what we mean.\n\nMood\n\nBy way of Brooklyn, Mood exists to take the best parts of the art and design worlds and connect it to those in skateboarding. By working with established and emerging artists and designers from around the globe, founders Grandison Tabor (formerly of Rhode Island’s Fountain of Youth skateshop) and Calvin Waterman have successfully introduced a handful of genuinely interesting artist collaborations in the two years since Mood’s founding.\n\nEach collection uses specially commissioned work as apparel and deck graphics – the most recent collection delivers ’90s streetwear-inspired apparel and graphics adapted from photo-realistic paintings. While the concept may sound stuffy, the two graphic designer’s are far from pretentious. Smart brand videos, “short stack” Instagram edits and playful product shots keep their project light without losing sight of the artistic end goal. To the adult design nerd that never stopped skating, Mood is just what you’re after.\n\nSubscribe\n\nLead image: Alex Pires\n\nWriter: Alexis Castro\n\nAlexis Castro Writer: Graham Hiemstra\n\nWords by Alexis Castro Freelancer",

Last night, Steve Yegge, a Google engineer, accidentally posted a rant about Google to his public Google+ profile. It's revealing and absolutely rips Google+. It's also true.\n\nYegge covers a bunch of topics, mostly focusing on how Google just simply doesn't understand platforms. He praises Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and even Facebook for \"getting it\" when it comes to platforms, how long term growth in a product requires that product to be a platform for others to develop more products on. But he thinks Google just doesn't understand how to do that. Yegge wrote:\n\nGoogle+ is a prime example of our complete failure to understand platforms from the very highest levels of executive leadership (hi Larry, Sergey, Eric, Vic, howdy howdy) down to the very lowest leaf workers (hey yo). We all don't get it. The Golden Rule of platforms is that you Eat Your Own Dogfood. The Google+ platform is a pathetic afterthought. We had no API at all at launch, and last I checked, we had one measly API call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe goes on about how Facebook murders Google+ as a platform:\n\nGoogle+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product. But that's not why they are successful. Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work. So Facebook is different for everyone. Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars. Some spend all their time on Farmville. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of different high-quality time sinks available, so there's something there for everyone. Our Google+ team took a look at the aftermarket and said: \"Gosh, it looks like we need some games. Let's go contract someone to, um, write some games for us.\" Do you begin to see how incredibly wrong that thinking is now?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he's totally right. We don't think Google+ will ever beat Facebook. Never, ever, ever. But Google needs to take this advice and learn from it. Learn from mistakes like Google TV. Learn from success like Android. Learn from weirdness like Wave. Learn it all! And then maybe they can compete (or do something else). We love Google and it's obvious Yegge does too, he just wants them to get better.

  "latent_15247": "Clint Eastwood's new film \"American Sniper\" has become the latest battleground in the culture wars. Washington Post columnist Alyssa Rosenberg explains why its politics matter. (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)\n\nEveryone involved with this week’s most popular movie claims it has nothing to do with politics. Really, star actor Bradley Cooper stressed over and again in interviews, it doesn’t. Director Clint Eastwood’s “American Sniper” simply explains the “plight” of the soldier, he told the Daily Beast, providing a “character study.”\n\nBut this was no ordinary soldier. This was the late Chris Kyle, the much-mythologized “deadliest sniper” in American history. And regardless of what Cooper wants, his movie has become political.\n\nBefore he was shot to death at a Texas gun range, Kyle, who claimed he killed at least 150 people while working as a sniper in Iraq, oozed conviction and charisma. He wore big boots. He spoke with a languid Texas drawl. He wrote a best-selling memoir. He made millions. And he stirred controversy just about everywhere he went.\n\n[How Bradley Cooper trained for the role of Chris Kyle in ‘American Sniper]\n\nThe conversation that now shadows the release of “American Sniper,” which collected a record $105 million over the holiday weekend, has been no different. After days of nationwide screenings, which the Associated Press called an “unprecedented success,” the film was subject to widespread praise among conservatives for depicting an American soldier at his best and condemnation among some liberals who question the admitted pleasure Kyle took in killing and dehumanizing Iraqis.\n\nAnd then there were the tales Kyle told about himself, which came under increasing suspicion after numerous journalists tried — and failed — to corroborate them. Among them: Kyle once said he shot dead two armed Texas thugs who wanted to steal his truck. He said he traveled down to New Orleans and killed 30 bad guys in the chaos following Hurricane Katrina. And he also falsely claimed he punched out former Minnesota governor Jesse “the Body” Ventura after Ventura, a former member of a U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team, disparaged the Navy SEALs.\n\n“There were a lot of things he told people that are really unverifiable,” journalist Michael J. Mooney, who wrote a book on Kyle, told The Washington Post in July.\n\nIn the latest trailer for \"American Sniper,\" directed by Clint Eastwood and based on the autobiography of the name, Bradley Cooper plays U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, who is said to have had the most confirmed kills in U.S. military history. Kyle struggled with PTSD and was killed at a gun range by a fellow veteran in February 2013. The film opens Dec. 25. (Warner Bros. UK)\n\nBut anyone who mentions such holes in the Chris Kyle narrative or critiques the ethos under which he operated does so at his or her own peril. It’s a lesson that journalist Rania Khalek, who calls objectivity “bulls—” on her Twitter profile, learned days ago when she let loose a series of tweets that took aim at Kyle. She highlighted several passages in Kyle’s book, also titled “American Sniper.”\n\n“Savage, despicable evil,” Kyle wrote. “That’s what we were fighting in Iraq. That’s why a lot of people, myself included, called the enemy ‘savages.’ There really was no other way to describe what we encountered there.” He later added: “There’s another question people ask a lot: ‘Did it bother you killing so many people in Iraq?’ I tell them, ‘No.’ … I loved what I did. … I’m not lying or exaggerating to say it was fun.”\n\nTo Khalek, any movie that lionizes Kyle represents “dangerous propaganda that sanitizes a mass killer and rewrites the Iraq War.” She said Kyle was consumed by “unrepentant bloodlust” fueled by “hatred, bigotry and enthusiasm for killing Iraqi ‘savages.'” Khalek got death threats almost immediately for her comments.\n\nOne man, who has since had his Twitter account deactivated, told her she “NEED[ED] TO BE SHOT DEAD. DO ALL A FAVOR..GO KILL YOURSELF.” Or, as the left-wing Web site Alternet commented after posting an article critical of Kyle: “This kicked off an endless flood in our Twitter mentions of outraged right-wing military worshipers who’ve whipped themselves into a hateful frenzy out of blind obedience to a mass killer.”\n\n[RELATED: Trial of Eddie Routh, killer of Chris Kyle, will be darkest chapter of ‘American Sniper’]\n\nEven those who were less incendiary were met with online venom. On Saturday, “The Interview” actor Seth Rogen, who himself just emerged from a political storm, observed that “‘American Sniper’ kind of reminds me of the movie that’s showing in the third act of ‘Inglourious Basterds,'” referencing a Nazi propaganda film, inside Quentin Tarantino’s film, that glorifies a German sniper. Rogen quickly backed off the remark, adding that he “actually liked” the movie. But that wasn’t before he got walloped: “Amazing considering guys like Kyle are the reason you’re not sitting in a NKorean prison right now,” one person told him.\n\nOn Jan. 18, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted: “My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren’t heroes. And invaders r worse.” He too doubled back, saying he thought Cooper’s performance was great. But, he added, “most of us were taught the story of Jesse James and that the scoundrel wasn’t James (who was a criminal who killed people) but rather the sniper who shot him in the back. I think most Americans don’t think snipers are heroes. Hopefully not on this weekend when we remember that man in Memphis, Tennessee, who was killed by a sniper’s bullet.”\n\nEven Sarah Palin entered the fray, excoriating “Hollywood leftists” for “spitting on the graves of freedom fighters who allow you to do what you do, just realize the rest of American knows you’re not fit to shine Chris Kyle’s combat boots.”\n\nThe exchanges are just the latest eruption in a long culture war, analysts said, with lines clearly demarcated. “As screenings have sold out, conservative media has manned barricades against liberals who have attacked the movie or the idea of lionizing Kyle,” conservative David Weigel wrote for Bloomberg. He noted that much of the controversy involves the extended battle over guns — and gun control — and pits pro-Iraq war conservatives against anti-war liberals.\n\nBut it also hints at another gulf in American politics: the plummeting number of Americans who serve in the armed services, which has given rise to what experts call a widening cultural divide between civilians and combat veterans. During World War II, more than 12 percent of Americans served in the military. Today fewer than .5 percent do, and many belong to a demographic that military analyst Thomas Ricks called “socially isolated, politically conservative.” That growing chasm has resulted in a modern America in which few grant much thought to soldiers except for ritualized reverence.\n\nIf there’s any cultural force that exacerbates misunderstandings, it’s movies like “American Sniper,” according to Karl Eikenberry and David Kennedy in the New York Times. To many conservatives and members of the armed services, Chris Kyle was a man beyond reproach, and to criticize him disrespects both the military and those who choose to serve.\n\n“The greatest challenge to our military is not from a foreign enemy — it’s from the widening gap between the American people and their armed forces,” the authors wrote in 2013. “… The media offer us images of drone pilots, thousands of miles from the fray, coolly and safely dispatching enemies in their electronic cross hairs. Hollywood depicts superhuman teams of Special Operations forces snuffing out their adversaries with clinical precision.”",
  "latent_15256": "Joachim Gauck, 72, already came close to becoming Germany's president once before. Back then, in the early summer of 2010, a veritable Gauck hysteria broke out in the country after the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Green Party presented him as their candidate for the country's highest office.\n\nSome even called him a German Obama. The more desperately Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats and her coalition partner, the business-friendly Free Democratic Party, clung to their candidate Christian Wulff, the greater the sympathy grew among the public for Gauck, a Protestant pastor from the eastern German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.\n\nIn the end, it took a full three rounds of voting in the Federal Assembly before Wulff was elected as president.\n\nBetween votes two and three, Gauck started to think for the first time that he might actually succeed in becoming president. When he ultimately lost, the pain was apparently far greater than he was ready to admit.\n\nBut Gauck lived in East Germany for long enough to know how to look at things in perspective. The pastor has long been separated from his wife, with whom he has four children. He and his partner, journalist Daniela Schadt, attended the 2010 presidential summer party to wish Christian Wulff and his wife Bettina all the best. Then he went on travelling across Germany, telling people about his struggle for freedom. He reminded them they also needed to do their part for the country -- that they needed to take responsibility.\n\nGauck himself had to wait almost 50 years to taste democracy. When he finally did, the theologian from the northern port city of Rostock soon became the head of the German authority that manages the files of the former East German secret police, the much-feared Stasi.\n\nGauck believes that democracy is a gift to humanity. It's a recognition that he attributes to his past living under a dictatorship. It's a secular message that the pastor has been repeating for years as a sort of traveling preacher of democratic values.\n\nGood Ties with Merkel\n\nIt already seemed strange to Gauck back in the summer of 2010 that Merkel didn't want him to become president. After all, the two had so much in common. The chancellor was the daughter of a pastor, she knows Gauck and the two hold each other in high regard. But Merkel's rejection of Gauck was easily explained: The decision was pure party politics. But that's not Joachim Gauck's world.\n\nOf course, Gauck is no stranger to party politics. He got a crash course in that world while working as the first federal commissioner for the Stasi Archives after German reunification. The task of investigating Stasi crimes was a personal one for Gauck, whose own father was arrested by the East German secret police when he was a child. The post, which he held for ten years, earned him the nickname \"Stasi Hunter\" and sealed his reputation as a tireless pro-democracy advocate.\n\nGauck's aloofness from politics is one of the biggest reasons why he is so popular in Germany. When Gauck talks about democracy, he sounds almost noble, exuding none of the political pragmatism of leaders like Merkel of the conservative Christian Democrats, Sigmar Gabriel of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) or other party bosses.\n\nThe chancellor knows this. His stature and storied past are part of the reason why she resisted the idea of Gauck as the next German president for years. It was a mistake on a par with her decision to ditch nuclear power after Fukushima. But Merkel knows that Gauck could become a thorn in her side.\n\nGauck Likely to Annoy Politicians\n\nFrom Gauck's new perch at Bellevue Palace, the president's office, he is likely to take the entire political class to task: The CDU, when they ignore citizens in their implemetation of policies. The FDP, when they put market interests before people yet again. The SPD, when they exaggerate their bank bashing. The Greens, when they get a little too self-righteous.\n\nExpect Joachim Gauck to hold his own against them all. He's been through so many storms that he won't cave in as easily as ex-President Horst Köhler. And he won't be running after the jet set as Christian Wulff did.\n\nGauck will hold a mirror to the political parties and the people. Don't be surprised when he misses the mark occasionally. He's already asking people to cut him a bit of slack. At a news conference on Sunday evening, he already asked to be forgiven for making mistakes when he's finding his feet as president. After all, he said, he couldn't be expected to be \"a Superman or a flawless person.\"",
  "latent_15414": "In 1903, Apostle Reed Smoot was elected by the Utah legislature to the U.S. senate. Because of the United States’ strained relationship with Mormonism, a series of congressional hearings were conducted to determine whether the senate should seat Elder Smoot.\n\nOne of the witnesses summoned to testify was President Joseph F. Smith. After beginning the examination by covering the dozens of companies ran by Smith, he was asked many insightful questions:\n\nTayler: What official position do you now hold in the church?\n\nSmith: I am now the president of the church.\n\nTayler: Is there any other description of your title than mere president?\n\nSmith: No, sir; not that I know of.\n\nTayler: Are you prophet, seer, and revelator?\n\nSmith: I am so sustained and upheld by my people.\n\nTayler: Do you get that title by reason of being president or by reason of having been an apostle?\n\nSmith: By reason of being president.\n\nTayler: Are not all of the apostles also prophets, seers, and revelators?\n\nSmith: They are sustained as such at our conferences.\n\nNotice how President Smith refuses to answer the question directly. Rather than affirming that he and the other brethren were prophets, he uses a more lawyerly answer: “I am so sustained.” While this may be a point for President Smith’s honesty, it doesn’t look well for the church which claims to be led by a legitimate prophet.\n\nThe problem becomes more apparent as Senators McComas and Hoar begin questioning him:\n\nMcComas: I should like to ask one question. You say that the councilors are appointed by the president of the church. How are the apostles selected?\n\nSmith: In the first place they were chosen by revelation. The council of the apostles have had a voice ever since in the selection of their successors.\n\n…\n\nMcComas: When vacancies occurred thereafter, by what body were the vacancies in the twelve apostles filled?\n\nSmith: Perhaps I may say in this way: Chosen by the body, the twelve themselves, by and with the consent and approval of the first presidency.\n\nHoar: Was there a revelation in regard to each of them?\n\nSmith: No, sir; not in regard to each of them. Do you mean in the beginning?\n\nHoar: I understand you to say that the original twelve apostles were selected by revelation?\n\nSmith: Yes, sir.\n\nHoar: Through Joseph Smith?\n\nSmith: Yes, sir; that is right.\n\nHoar: Is there any revelation in regard to the subsequent ones?\n\nSmith: No, sir; it has been the choice of the body.\n\nMcComas: Then the apostles are perpetuated in succession by their own act and the approval of the first presidency?\n\nSmith: That is right.\n\nWhat? None of the apostles after Joseph Smith were chosen by revelation? Not according to President Smith. This leads to a discussion about revelation.\n\nSmith: I will say this, Mr. Chairman, that no revelation given through the head of the church ever becomes binding and authoritative upon the members of the church until it has been presented to the church and accepted by them.\n\nWorthington: What do you mean by being presented to the church?\n\nSmith: Presented in conference.\n\nTayler: Do you mean by that that the church in conference may say to you, Joseph F. Smith, the first president of the church, “We deny that God has told you to tell us this?”\n\nSmith: They can say that if they choose.\n\nTayler: They can say it?\n\nSmith: Yes, sir; they can. And it is not binding upon them as members of the church until they accept it.\n\nTayler: Until they accept it?\n\nSmith: Yes, sir.\n\nI think this part of the conversation has direct relevance to what has happened with the church’s policy on LGBT families. Elder Russell M. Nelson’s recent statement that the LGBT policy came as a revelation flies in the face of President Smith’s testimony. If there was indeed a revelation from God labeling same-sex couples apostate and barring their children from full participation in church, then it must be presented before the church in conference for a sustaining vote. Otherwise, members are in no way obligated to accept it. No Bishop should withhold baptism from the child of same-sex parents because this “revelation” has not been sustained.\n\nThe topic of revelation continues:\n\nChairman: You have revelations, have you not?\n\nSmith: I have never pretended to nor do I profess to have received revelations. I never said I had a revelation except so far as God has shown me that so-called Mormonism is God’s divine truth; that is all.\n\nChairman: You say that was shown to you by God?\n\nSmith: By inspiration.\n\nChairman: How by inspiration; does it come in the shape of a vision?\n\nSmith: “The things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God;” and I cannot tell you any more than that I received that knowledge and that testimony by the spirit of God.\n\nTayler: You do not mean that you reached it by any process of reasoning or by any other method by which you reach other conclusions in your mind, do you?\n\nSmith: Well, I have reached principles; that is, I have been confirmed in my acceptance and knowledge of principles that have been revealed to me, shown to me, on which I was ignorant before, by reason and fact.\n\nHere Joseph F. Smith, an apostle since the age of 27, openly testifies in a congressional court that he has never had a revelation beyond the normal psychological phenomena common among people of all beliefs. Two days later, he again affirms that the Brethren do not have any revelatory gift beyond that of any other member of the church.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute. Every time an apostle speaks anywhere, members of the church go full-on fan girl, tripping over themselves to hear from a “mouthpiece of the Lord.” What they fail to realize is that an apostle isn’t half a furlong better at receiving “revelation” than the lowest member of the church. They don’t have extra insight. They don’t have exclusive access to hot tips from God. They are literally just guessing and going by their feelings like every other member of the church.\n\nNow here’s the kicker:\n\nWorthington: What was the last revelation that came to the church from the one authorized to give it as the law of the church?\n\nSmith: Well, according to my best recollection, it must have been about 1882. The purport of the revelation was calling to the apostolate or apostleship two men, who are named in the revelation.\n\nWorthington: Who was the president through whom that revelation came?\n\nSmith: President John Taylor.\n\nWorthington: You say that was the last one?\n\nSmith: I do not now recall any since then except the manifesto.\n\nWorthington: Except the manifesto?\n\nSmith: Yes, except the manifesto.\n\nWorthington: Then do I understand you to say the only revelation that has come to the church in the last twenty years is the one that says polygamy shall stop?\n\nSmith: Since 1882?\n\nWorthington: Yes, since 1882 – twenty-one years.\n\nSmith: Yes, sir; I think it is\n\nNever mind that this contradicts his earlier testimony, here he states that in the 21 years prior, not a single revelation had been given to the head of the Church. That time span includes the entire presidencies of Wilford Woodruff and Lorenzo Snow. Can you imagine if Thomas S. Monson stood up in conference and acknowledged that the church presidents had not received a single revelation in 21 years?\n\nIsn’t continuing revelation the church’s pet doctrine? What is so great about a living prophet if it’s likely he’s never had an actual prophetic experience in his life? Members of the church love to speak in hushed tones about the supposed spiritual manifestations to which the brethren are privy. Well, over 100 years ago, Joseph F. Smith burst that bubble.\n\nEven more recently, Elder Dallin H. Oaks told the youth that he has never had an experience like Alma the Younger (you know, having a vision, seeing angels, or seeing Christ), and that he didn’t know a single one of the 15 brethren who had either.\n\nAdd that to a list of so-called prophets, seers, and revelators who have likewise confessed to never having had such an experience. The list includes at least Brigham Young, Heber J. Grant (who admitted to actually fearing such experiences), David O. McKay, and Joseph Fielding Smith. That’s just the list of those who admitted to never having a prophetic experience.\n\n(Now, Joseph F. Smith did acknowledge the Manifesto. This is interesting because the Manifesto was not actually a revelation; it was a smokescreen. After the Manifesto, the church continued secretly practicing polygamy until the Reed Smoot hearings forced Joseph F. Smith to publish a second Manifesto in 1904. During the Smoot hearings, Elder B. H. Roberts was asked if he believed the first Manifesto was a revelation. He answered honestly that he did not believe it to be a revelation.)\n\nAs a member of the church, I frequently wondered why we weren’t receiving new scripture. The answer was usually, “It’s because we don’t value the old scripture enough.” Turns out the true answer is that the brethren simply aren’t receiving revelations. And that’s just straight from the tapir’s mouth. As Joseph F. Smith himself used to say, “Put that in your pipe and smoke it!” (Improvement Era, 10:548)",

And with each swipe, she, like others before her, demonstrated the potential perils that await politicians in the subway.\n\nThere are other routines of New York life that have the ability to similarly trip up politicians. Indeed, two of the remaining three Republican presidential candidates — John Kasich and Donald J. Trump — have been seen eating pizza with a knife and fork.

  "latent_15597": "Pop quiz time. What do X Men: The Last Stand, Spiderman 3, and Watchmen have in common? They all have the same or better aggregate critic scores on Rotten Tomatoes when compared to Man of Steel. For those of you who have seen the film, ask yourselves if that is truly a fair judgement because after seeing it yesterday, I 100% disagree. In fact, as far as origin, story, and content, Zack Snyder provided me with the most interesting storyline in Superman since he died. Fanboys and film critics will rip their hair out when I say this, but this film is the perfect embodiment for Superman in the 21st century.\n\nTo The Critics:\n\nLet's start with the simple problems most critics had with the film; pacing and story development. If you're searching for someone who doesn't know the origin of Superman, you're going to be searching a while. The film saved us the time of going through the nuances of Clark's life that we've read, seen, and recanted a thousand times over and showed us new scenarios and the people affected by them. I met the fathers of Clark/Kal-El, and while I didn't spend too much time with them, learned which parts influenced him and the decisions he makes.\n\nSpeaking of character development, how about this being the first film in which Superman openly admits his Christianity? Opinions aside on that, that scene showed more of Midwest Kansas than the entire city of Smallville could provide, and it was true to the origin.\n\nProbably the most frustrating and ignorant criticism I've heard is \"action for no reason\"...seriously? The world is at stake. It's going to be destroyed, and it all happened within a few hours. As much as I would love to see Superman go incognito as Clark for 30 minutes, I don't really think he has time for that.\n\nTo The Fanboys (Spoilers):\n\nLet's transition to the fanboys and fangirls who are still spewing their rage over the concerned half that cares (themselves and us other geeks) and address perhaps their biggest issues. From smallest to large let's start with Lois. Who cares if she knows his secret identity! Ask yourself this. What respect can you possibly have for a woman who is an award winning journalist and still can't figure out the identity of a man who has saved her several hundred times? Of course she's going to figure it out. It's time to stop pretending glasses make that much of an impact on the face.\n\nAlright that was just a warm up, and in all honesty the majority of you who found a problem with that was small at best. The real issue was Zod, and 100% why you are reading this to either throw your hands up in agreement or flame the hell out of my email address (MickJoest@Geektyrant.Com). Superman killed Zod. Who Cares?\n\nFirst off, let's remember that Superman has killed before, Doomsday of course being the most common example. Although its canon has been disputed, (because in comics it's seemingly impossible to keep a storyline consistent) Superman also killed 3 rogue Kryptonians that had eradicated that universe's human race in Superman: Executioner.\n\nHe wasn't happy about this, and nor was he with Zod in the film. What did you expect? He was going to trick them into removing their own powers after an epic foresight on the actions of Lex Luthor? Perhaps he was to peel a magic logo off his chest and incarcerate him with it? Please, let's keep this based in reality. Superman did what Superman would really do in a tough situation, protect the human race. That's his end game, every time. It was kill, or be killed, and he was left with no other choice.\n\nSeriously there was no other choice. Having just discovered certain powers, he couldn't go to the Fortress of Solitude, he couldn't wipe Zod of his powers, and he most certainly couldn't get Zod to kneel. This is a key element I think most fans are blinded by.\n\nLet's not forget that this was, in fact, an origin story. He took on Zod...in his origin story. It doesn't get much tougher than that. This is his Batman: Year One scenario, and it was a hell of a task to take on having just learned how to fly.\n\nSuperman. That's What They're Calling Him.\n\nUltimately, who is Superman? A man of two worlds. This film was the perfect origin as it showed his clear decision on which world he wished to be a part of. Of course, you knew which side he was going to choose but it showed you why it happened and all the reasons why he shouldn't. For this reason, I list this at the top of my favorite Superman films.\n\nI look at the comics. I look at the cartoons. I look to the old films. When I look at Man of Steel, I see the Superman for the 21st century, a current and accurate representation of truth, justice and the American way. His transgressions are what keep him human, and his sacrifice shows his true love for humanity. In terms of heroes, I would expect nothing less.",

  "latent_15692": "Christian Pakistani Girl Killed After Rejecting Sexual Advances by Muslim Men\n\nEmail Print Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin\n\nPersecution watchdog groups are raising awareness for a Christian Pakistani girl who was killed earlier this month after she and her friends rejected the sexual advances of drunken Muslim men in Lahore, Defence Colony.\n\nThe British Pakistani Christian Association reported last week that the incident occurred on Jan. 13, when three young Christian girls, Kiran (17 years), Shamroza (18 years) and Sumble (20 years), were approached on the streets at night by four allegedly drunk Muslim men in a car. The girls rejected the lewd advances of the men, which caused them to turn violent.\n\n\"How dare you run away from us, Christian girls are only meant for one thing, the pleasure of Muslim men,\" one of the men reportedly said.\n\nThe men then crashed their car right into the girls, causing Shamroza to break several ribs and Sumble to brake her hip. Kiran, however, was lifted up from the ground on the hood of the car, and driven until the car suddenly stopped, throwing her rapidly to the ground, where she cracked open her head and suffered internal bleeding, leading to her death.\n\n\"All three families are really shook-up, Shamroza and Sumble are grateful to God for saving them but have been inconsolable at the loss of a close friend. Other girls in the local area are now too scared to travel at night and are being accompanied by the men in their families. The community wants justice for poor Kiran and seeks an end to the targeting of young Christian girls,\" said Naveed Aziz of the BPCA.\n\nThe families of the Christian girls even had to pay a bribe to police in order to have a First Incident Report registered, given how unwilling police in Pakistan are to help Christian victims of violence.\n\n\"The family are calling for a murder enquiry but because of the wealthy status of the young men, little hope exists that justice will prevail. Police are said to be doing little to apprehend the young men and are allegedly delaying the investigative process. Often in such cases evidence goes missing and witnesses are either threatened or bought out by the families of wealthy criminals in a country where corruption is rife and lauded,\" the organization said.\n\nInternational Christian Concern also reported on the crime, noting that Christians are \"considered second class citizens\" by the Muslim majority in the country.\n\nChristian girls and women are often the subject of such violence, and there were numerous internationally reported cases from last year.\n\nLate in November, American Center for Law and Justice affiliated group Organization for Legal Aid in Pakistan, prepared charges in the case of an 8-year-old Christian girl who was beaten and left naked on the streets by a Muslim family that wanted to punish her uncle for an interreligious relationship.\n\nBPCA has meanwhile started a petition for victims like Kiran, and has also set up a donations fund where people can financially contribute to the work that goes into helping Christian families.\n\n\"This act of violence should be met with the strong arm of the law. In any other nation the perpetrators would be arrested, convicted for murder and sentenced for a long term. In Pakistan, however, the poor go to prison and the wealthy commit whatever crime they wish with impunity. Violence against Christians is rarely investigated and highly unlikely to be met with justice,\" said Wilson Chowdhry, chairman of the BPCA.",

  "latent_15925": "A garda who made complaints of malpractice says he has been subject to intimidation and harassment, including having a minor incident between him and his wife referred to Tusla, writes Michael Clifford.\n\nJohn is a Garda whistleblower whose identity is not being made known here because of the involvement of his children in the following narrative.\n\nThe details of his case have been known to Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald for the last six months and the Garda Commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan for at least a year.\n\nHe says he has been subject to different forms of intimidation and harassment since he made complaints of malpractice. His partner is referred to here as Jane. They have young children.\n\nOn October 5, 2013, Jane was invited to attend her local Garda station. There had been an incident between her and John some weeks previously. There was no physical violence involved in the incident. A garda had been called to the scene, but the call was not made by either John or Jane.\n\nAt the station, she was interviewed for eight hours. Jane says she was put under pressure to sign a statement. She claims there was a threat that if she didn’t there may be repercussions for her and her children.\n\nFive days later, a senior officer completed a Notification of Suspected Child Abuse in relation to the couple’s children to be dispatched to Tusla. The suspected abuse was of an emotional nature, allegedly perpetrated on one of the children through being “present during argument between mother and partner”, according to the notification.\n\nOn October 16, a letter from Tusla stated that the notification was received. “However as there is no evidence of abuse detailed no further action will be taken from this service until we receive more information.”\n\nNo further information was received to the best of John and Jane’s knowledge. Some time after that, Jane contacted the gardaí and withdrew the statement she had made.\n\nJane claims that when she retracted the statement, she was told by a garda she should think hard about doing so as another couple in a similar situation where a statement had been made and withdrawn subsequently had the social services “knocking on their door”.\n\nREAD MORE: Michael Clifford: Cock-up or conspiracy, it’s time to come clean about Maurice McCabe claims\n\nOn February 2, 2014, the couple received another letter from Tusla, inviting them to a meeting on the basis of the information that had been received the previous October.\n\nThe couple attended the meeting with two Tusla employees where it was agreed that the argument that the couple had had was the type not unfamiliar to couples in general. There, the couple thought, the matter rested.\n\nLater that evening, Jane says she received a phone call from one of the Tusla employees who the couple had met. This woman stated she had been informed by her superior that a home call would now be required.\n\nAccording to Jane, the Tusla employee stated that this new instruction came about after a garda had rang her superior. This was a different outcome from that agreed earlier at the meeting.\n\nThe Tusla employee attended the house the next day and interviewed the children. The meeting was cordial and without rancour. The Tusla employee then compiled a report on the whole case, the final paragraph of which read: “It is important to note that given the nature of the referral…[the agency] made a decision that it was not in the children’s best interests to bring up the issue in the family home which led to the referral.\n\n\"This is based on the fact that the incident occurred in September 2013 and on [John] and [Jane’s] explanation on what happened in the context of the incident. It is likely [child’s name] may not remember the incident and even if she did the revisiting of a one off incident would not be beneficial to her and places unnecessary emphasis on what occurred.”\n\nThe couple had been put through four months of stress and worry over what both regarded as a minor incident. The extent to which Tusla investigated the original referral appears to lack any proportionality to the incident.\n\nJohn and Jane are both of the belief that the whole affair is linked to the complaints of malpractice he has made.\n\nNeither Tusla nor the gardaí will comment on individual cases for reasons of confidentiality.\n\nREAD MORE: Criminal investigation into whistleblower smear campaign a possibility\n\nMeanwhile, the Garda commissioner has been aware of this case and the allegations borne by John and Jane for at least a year.\n\nThe Minister for Justice has been aware of these details since last October. The garda or his representative have sent at least 13 letters to the minister outlining what John says he has been subjected to. Last week, a solicitor acting for the couple wrote to the Minister for Children with the details.\n\n“The manner of the intervention of Tusla in our client’s family life is a cause of concern and is by any measure an inexcusable abuse of their position. Their intervention caused our client untold stress, distress and anguish.”\n\nThe couple is seeking to have a number of questions answered:\n\nWho directed that Tusla be contacted querying the safety of the couple’s children, which subsequently warranted an investigation?\n\nWho directed the Tusla employee to meet with the couple over four months after the matter appeared closed on the basis that there was no evidence?\n\nWhat new evidence prompted this meeting, in February 2014, to be requested?\n\nWhat prompted Tusla to carry out a home visit and interview the children following the couple’s interview with Tusla?\n\nLabour party TD Alan Kelly, who has been made aware of this case in recent days, told the Irish Examiner he finds it incredible that Ms Fitzgerald didn’t join up the dots after she was contacted by Minisiter Katherine Zappone about the McCabe case, which also involved Tusla.\n\n“Minister Fitzgerald had in her possession letters from a second whistleblower from October last year which outlined similar cause for concern about how Tusla had treated him.

  "latent_16009": "This post is by Dennis Coyne\n\nThe eventual peak and decline of light tight oil (LTO) output in the Bakken/ Three Forks play of North Dakota and Montana and the Eagle Ford play of Texas are topics of much conversation at the Peak Oil Barrel and elsewhere.\n\nThe decline rates of individual wells are very steep, especially early in the life of the well (as much as 75% in the first year for the average Eagle Ford well), though the decline rates become lower over time and eventually stabilize at around 6 to 7% per year in the Bakken.\n\nWhat is not obvious is that for the entire field (or play), the decline rates are not as steep as the decline rate for individual wells. I will present a couple of simple model to illustrate this concept.\n\nMuch of the presentation is a review of ideas that I have learned from Rune Likvern and Paul Pukite (aka Webhubbletelescope), though any errors in the analysis are mine.\n\nA key idea underlying the analysis is that of convolution. I will attempt an explanation of the concept which many people find difficult.\n\nAt Wikipedia there is a fairly mathematical presentation of the concepts which often confuses people. There are a couple of nice visuals to convey the concept as well see this page.\n\nIn the visual below a function f (in blue) is convolved with a function g (in red) to produce a third function (in black) which we could call h where h=f*g and the asterisk represents convolution, just as a + symbol is used to represent addition.\n\n“Convolution of box signal with itself2” by Convolution_of_box_signal_with_itself.gif: Brian Amberg\n\nderivative work: Tinos (talk) – Convolution_of_box_signal_with_itself.gif. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nI think the best way to present convolution is with pictures. Chart A below shows a relationship between oil output (in barrels per month) and months from the first oil output for the average well in an unspecified LTO play.\n\nThis relationship is a simple hyperbola of the form q=a/(1+kt), where a and k are constants of 13,000 and 0.25 respectively, t is time in months, and q is oil output.\n\nChart A is often referred to as a well profile. The values for the constants were chosen to make the well profile fairly similar to an Eagle Ford average well profile. EUR30 is the estimated ultimate recovery from this average well over a 30 year well life.\n\nChart B shows the relationship between the number of new wells that begin producing each month and the months from the start of production for the entire field.\n\nThe convolution of the relationship shown in chart A and the relationship shown in chart B results in a third relationship shown in Chart C below, oil output vs. months from start of field output. Output has been converted to kb/d from barrels per month.\n\nIt is indeed strange that two very different shapes (a hyperbola and a trapezoid) would combine to form the shape shown in chart C. A spreadsheet can be downloaded here, with the scenario above laid out.\n\nWhat was surprising to me when I first tried this analysis was that a combination of the average well profile with the number of wells added each month reproduced the oil output data fairly closely.\n\nTo clarify this further, I have created a simple model. As before, we have a hyperbolic well profile in chart 1 (slightly different than chart A above) and the number of new wells added each month in chart 2, but in chart 2 this is over a short 6 month period. After that time no more new wells are added.\n\nIn the chart below I show the output for each group of wells that begins production in successive months. The output from all wells starting production in month 1 are labelled “month 1 wells”, there are 6 of these groups up to “month 6 wells”. The number of wells added each month is shown as a dashed line read off the right axis. Remember that 30 wells are added each month from month 1 to month 6 so output for “month x wells” will be 30 times month 1 of the well profile in month x and 30 times month 2 of the well profile in month x+1, etc.\n\nThe convolution of Chart 1 and Chart 2 results in Simple oil model 1 shown below.\n\nThis model is very simple in order to present how the principle works in a clear manner. When the annual decline rate for the “field” is compared to the average well’s annual decline rate, they are very similar for this simple 6 month model. More realistic models are presented later for comparison.\n\nNote that month zero in the chart below is the month of maximum annual decline rate, for the average well the maximum annual decline rate happens in month 13 and for the field it occurs in month 18, the curves have been shifted to the left by 13 and 18 months so that the maximum decline rates match up at month zero for easy comparison.\n\nThe spreadsheet for simple model 1 can be downloaded here.\n\nA second simple model with the number of wells added each month rising from 5 new wells per month to 30 new wells per month over 6 months and then falling back to no wells added by month 12 is shown below.\n\nNote that the “month 7 wells” output curve is the same as the “month 5 wells“ output curve, but shifted 2 months to the right. Likewise month 8 is month 4 shifted 4 months to the right and this same symmetry is true for months 9 and 3(6 month shift right), months 10 and 2, and months 11 and 1 where the shift right in the curve is equal to the difference in the month when the well started production (8 months and 10 months for the last two cases respectively).\n\nWhen all of these 11 curves are added up for each month (the convolution of the “well output of the average new well” chart and the “number of new wells added per month” chart) we get the Simple Oil Model 2 chart below.\n\nSimple model 2 can be downloaded here.\n\nI now present a different model with a higher EUR well profile (than in chart A) and a lower rate of addition of new wells (than in chart B). This model’s well profile is similar to the average North Dakota Bakken well profile.\n\nThe convolution of the two charts above results in the field output shown below.\n\nHow does the annual field decline rate compare to the average new well annual decline rate in this case? In the chart below we see that a slower decrease in the rate that new wells are added causes the annual field decline rate to be only 22% at most, about 3 times lower than the maximum annual well decline rate.\n\nThe spreadsheet for the model above can be downloaded here.\n\nAs this result is rather counterintuitive, I will try another modification to the model. The well profile remains unchanged, but there is a steeper reduction in the rate that new wells are added to field production.\n\nSuch a scenario could occur if there was a steep drop in oil prices as in the early 1980s. It will also occur if there is a decrease in new well productivity which will reduce profits and the incentive to add more wells.\n\nThe well profile chart is unchanged, the other two charts are as follows:\n\nEven in this case the maximum annual field decline rates are less than half the maximum well decline rate. This is because we have almost 15,000 wells added over an 11 year period and their decline behavior in the aggregate is much different than that of an individual well. See chart below.\n\nNote that the field decline rate is very high, close to a 30% maximum rate in this scenario. If the rate that new wells are added drops to zero over a 1 to 2 year period and no further wells are added, we would expect the field decline to behave like the gray curve in the chart above. Spreadsheet for the 5.6 Gb scenario can be downloaded here.\n\nEarlier I mentioned that when I first tried this method I was surprised that such a simple model could accurately match output from the Bakken or Eagle Ford fields.\n\nUsing data from the North Dakota Industrial Commission(NDIC) on oil output, the number of new wells added per month, and individual well data(from Rune Likvern initially and lately from Enno Peters) I attempted to match scenarios initially presented by Rune Likvern at the Oil Drum.\n\nBelow I present the well profile and number of new wells added each month.\n\nWhen the two charts above are combined (convolved) we get the output curve below.\n\nNote that the sharp drop off in the number of producing wells added each month is not very realistic and is an artifact of the way I set up these simple models for illustration (they end at 130 months so the number of producing wells had to be ramped down very quickly).\n\nSuch a scenario would be more likely if there was a sharp rise in well costs, or a sharp drop in oil prices or new well productivity (EUR). The field decline rate is somewhat similar to the previous scenario, rising quickly to a 28% annual decline rate which falls to 10% after 5 years and to 7% in 8 years.\n\nThis simple Bakken model can be downloaded here.\n\nA fairly realistic scenario for the North Dakota Bakken (it is a little on the low end of likely scenarios) is presented now for comparison to the model above. This scenario has an ERR (economically recoverable resource) of 5.3 Gb where the more likely range is 7 to 9 Gb, based on USGS estimates. The average well profile and number of new wells added each month are below.\n\nWhen we convolve the two charts above the following model output results. The match to the data is surprisingly good.\n\nThe annual field decline rate and well decline rate are shown below. In this case the maximum annual field decline is about 16% in 2021 and falls to 8% by 2026 and to 5% in 2031, the maximum annual well decline rate is 61%, the well decline rate is shown for a well starting production in Dec 2013.\n\nThe spreadsheet with this more realistic model is quite large (18 MB) so those with limited bandwidth may want to skip it. The realistic Bakken model can be downloaded here.\n\nFor the Eagle Ford play I was able to collect data on single well leases from the Railroad Commission of Texas, data on the number of producing wells in the play and output data. I developed an average well profile (shown below) and combined it with the number of new wells added each month to produce an output chart.\n\nNote that the output chart is for crude only and does not include condensate.\n\nThe two charts above are combined (or convolved) to give the output chart below.\n\nNote that there is about 20% of Eagle Ford output that is condensate, when this condensate is added to the URR above for crude only we get a URR of 5.1 Gb of C+C.\n\nAs in the case of the North Dakota Bakken/Three Forks the match between the model and data is surprisingly good considering the simplicity of the model and the complexity of the real world.\n\nSummary\n\nOil field output can be simulated with the convolution of the average well profile of newly added wells and the number of new wells added each month. I presented several simple models to demonstrate this concept. An obvious weakness for any attempt at forecasting is that the future average well profile may change over time and the number of new wells added in any future month is unknown.\n\nThe decline rate of a field of wells will tend to be considerably lower than the decline rate of the individual well. The field decline rate depends on several factors: the decline rate of individual wells, the total number of wells in the field, the period of time over which these older wells were added (whether the period was long or short), and finally the rate at which the number of new wells added decreases as the field begins to decline.\n\nSeveral models were presented showing how the field decline rate might vary under differing circumstances.\n\nThe concepts presented were applied to scenarios which simulated both the North Dakota Bakken and Eagle Ford shale plays with fairly good precision.\n\nIn a future post I plan to show how the convolution of two mathematical functions is used to develop the Oil Shock Model.",
  "latent_16043": "The Obama administration deported a record 438,421 unauthorized immigrants in fiscal year 2013, continuing a streak of stepped up enforcement that has resulted in more than 2 million deportations since Obama took office, newly released Department of Homeland Security data show.\n\nPresident Obama today is scheduled to address members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, a group that has recently criticized the president on immigration. Last month, the caucus urged the president to take executive action on immigration by extending deportation relief to certain groups of unauthorized immigrants, such as parents of U.S.-born children. Some immigrant advocates have dubbed Obama the “deporter in chief” over the fact that his administration has deported about as many immigrants in five years as the George W. Bush administration deported in eight years.\n\nDuring his speech, Obama is expected to reiterate his pledge to make changes to immigration policy on his own, something he said he will do after the November midterm elections.\n\nThe record number of deportations comes even as 580,946 young unauthorized immigrants have received relief from deportation and work permits since 2012 under a policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\n\nIn Pew Research Center surveys, Hispanics have expressed disapproval of the growing number of deportations during the Obama administration. Six-in-ten Hispanic adults in February said the increased number of deportations of unauthorized immigrants is a “bad thing,” while the U.S. general public was divided on the issue. And while 89% of Hispanics in 2013 said they support a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants who meet certain requirements, a majority (55%) said deportation relief is more important than a pathway to citizenship for this population.\n\nMost of the growth in the number of deported immigrants has come from those deported for reasons other than a criminal conviction. In 2013, 240,000 deported immigrants did not have a previous criminal conviction, up from 218,000 in 2012. Meanwhile, the number of deportations of those with a criminal conviction has stalled at around 200,000 for the past two fiscal years.\n\nOne distinct feature of the record number of deportations is the increasing share of deportations by U.S. Customs and Border Protection after border apprehension. In 2013, 25% of all deportations were carried out by the agency, up from 17% in 2012. Meanwhile, the number of deportations carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which deports people caught both at the border and the interior of the country, fell in 2013 compared with 2012.\n\nAnother change is that in 2013, a record 363,000 (83%) of deportations were carried out without appearing before a judge – either through an order issued by an enforcement agent (called expedited removal) or by using a previous order of deportation (called reinstatement of final orders). This is due to a 2005 shift in policy that has increased the likelihood of being deported after apprehension.\n\nThis rise in the number of deportations also coincides with stalled growth of the U.S. unauthorized immigrant population since 2009, and a more recent rise in the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2013, there were 414,000 apprehensions at the southwest border, a rise of 27% over 2011 (the most recent low in apprehensions).\n\nAlso, a new shift in migration patterns emerged over the last two years: more Central American immigrants and unaccompanied children crossing the border. These trends have led to an increase in apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. On the other hand, the number of Mexican immigrants apprehended at the border and the interior has continued to decline from a high of 1.1 million in 2005 to 425,000 in 2013.\n\nTopics: Unauthorized Immigration, Hispanic/Latino Demographics, Immigration",

What else has the elder Cruz lied about?\n\nSomeone should print this original pamphlet in color and hand it to Rafael Cruz, Sr. and ask him if he handed them out in New Orleans on August 16, 1963.\n\nOswald was arrested along with three Cubans on August 9, 1963, not necessarily the same Cubans he was later photographed with at the trade mart, after he got into what is considered to have been a \"staged\" fight with anti-Castro Cuban activist and lawyer Carlos Bringuier. Before Oswald's very public fight with Bringuier and Oswald's subsequent arrest, the ex-Marine Oswald was arrested along with three Cubans on August 9, 1963, not necessarily the same Cubans he was later photographed with at the trade mart, after he got into what is considered to have been a \"staged\" fight with anti-Castro Cuban activist and lawyer Carlos Bringuier. Before Oswald's very public fight with Bringuier and Oswald's subsequent arrest, the ex-Marine\n\noffered to help the DRE train its commandos to fight against the Castro government in Cuba.\n\nG. Robert Blakey, the\n\nSpecial Attorney at the Department of Justice in the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section from 1960 to 1964 and the chief counsel of the House Special Committee on Assassinations, affirmed that the men seen with Oswald passing out pamphlets at the trade mart on August 9 were never identified. In fact, Blakey told PBS's Frontline in 1993, \"\n\nwhen he [Oswald] distributed the literature, one of the two people was hired. The other person we've never been able to identify.\"\n\nOn August 9, 1963, Oswald was found guilty of disturbing the peace and he was fined 10 dollars. It is known that Oswald worked with Bringuier and Clay Shaw in anti-Castro activities linked to the CIA. Bringuier's Student Revolutionary Directorate (DRE), an anti-Castro organization, used the same 544 Camp Street address as Oswald's Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Moreover, Bringuier had in his possession Oswald's personal copy of the book, Guidebook for Marines.\n\nOn February 11, 2016, WMR provided a history of Cruz's ties to New Orleans during the time of the CIA's and organized crime's plot to kill Kennedy:\n\nIn 1957, Rafael Cruz, the son of an employee of the U.S. intelligence-linked RCA Corporation, left Cuba for the United States. Cruz claims he fought with Castro against the fascist government of Fulgencio Batista but soured on the revolution. However, Cruz left Cuba two years before the Castro revolution.\n\nCruz arrived in Austin where he enrolled in the University of Texas. This is a strange story since he claimed he left Cuba with only $100, which he said was sewn into his underwear. Cruz eventually gained U.S. permanent residency and a degree in mathematics from the University of Texas. In 1959, Cruz married Julia Ann Garza and, after Cruz graduated from the University of Texas in 1961, the couple moved to New Orleans from Dallas after the birth of their second daughter on November 18, 1962.\n\nCruz was in New Orleans during 1963, the year that New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison claimed his city was the focal point for the plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. The plot involved a number of Cuban exiles. Accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald claimed, as part of his \"fake defector\" persona developed by the Central Intelligence Agency, to be a member of the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee. The committee just happened to share an office address with Guy Banister's private investigation agency.\n\nGuy Banister Associates was located on the ground floor of the Newman Building at 5312 Lafayette Street while Oswald's \"pro-Castro\" Fair Play for Cuba Committee was located around the corner but on the ground floor of the same building but with an address of 544 Camp Street. Banister was a retired FBI agent who continued to carry out tasks for the bureau and the CIA. The Newman Building housed a number of anti-Castro groups, including the Cuban Revolutionary Council, Crusade to Free Cuba Committee, the Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front, Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean, and Friends of Democratic Cuba. While living in New Orleans, Cruz was also active with anti-Castro movements and the chances that he did not cross paths with Banister and the other anti-Castro activists, including CIA agent Sergio Arcacha Smith, are highly unlikely for such a close-knit community at the time.\n\nWhile living in New Orleans with his wife and two young daughters, Cruz claimed residency at two addresses, one a low-rent apartment building off of Jackson Avenue. Cruz worked for an oil company in New Orleans. He has been less than forthcoming about the details of his time in New Orleans and the time line that included his move from Dallas.\n\nCruz and his wife Julia divorced in New Orleans or Dallas, allegedly in 1962 or 1963, but this detail is also clouded in mystery. Cruz apparently registered for the draft in 1967 claiming the New Orleans' Jackson Street address. Draft registration was a requirement for resident aliens like Cruz. Cruz apparently waited until the age of 28 to register for the draft, which, because he waited so long, was a criminal offense at the time. While liable for the draft and possible service in Vietnam, a country where fellow Cuban immigrant Otto Macias gladly volunteered to serve, Cruz took off for Calgary, Canada with his second wife, Eleanor Darragh. Darragh, a native of Delaware who graduated from Rice University in Houston, worked for the same oil company in New Orleans that employed Cruz. Their son, Rafael \"Ted\" Cruz, Jr., now a candidate for president of the United States, claims that his mother and father worked for the same company in New Orleans but there is actually no record of an Eleanor Darragh Wilson Cruz living in New Orleans at the time.\n\nEleanor Wilson, married to Fort Worth, Texas native Alan Wilson, lived in London from 1960 to 1966. In 1965, their infant son Michael died from crib death. Alan Wilson, who still lives in London, told McClatchy News Service that Michael was not his son. In his autobiography, Senator Ted Cruz not only claims Michael was the son of his mother and Alan but also claims the baby died in 1965. In fact, Michael, according to London vital statistics records, died in 1966 and well after the Wilsons were divorced. Eleanor Cruz, who lives in Houston, has been mum on her marriage to Wilson and her marriage to Cruz, which lasted from 1969 to 1997. Ted Cruz was born in Calgary in 1970 and there is a major question about his eligibility to serve as president since Cruz maintained Canadian citizenship until 2013.\n\n------------------\n\nTo WMR Readers:\n\nWhat follows is a response by WMR’s editor to a blog post April 14 on the website JFKFacts.org, whose publisher/editor is Jefferson Morley, a journalist and author who formerly reported for the Washington Post. We put this here because Morley’s illustrates the mentality of an information gatekeeper and tool of the establishment who poses as an open-minded researcher.\n\nMorley’s blog post entitled, “Debunking the JFK conspiracy theory involving Rafael Cruz, father of Ted,” constituted an unwarranted attack on WMR. The Morley post can be found here: http://jfkfacts.org/assassination/debunking-jfk-conspiracy-theory-involving-rafael-cruz-father-ted/\n\nMorley’s site invites reader comments to what is claimed to be a site about “JFK Facts.” (and email: [email protected]) But the following rebuttal has not been published as a reader comment, either in whole or in part. www.jfkfacts.org\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nYour column makes grave factual and research procedural errors that unfairly smear me and undermine this blog’s title “JFKFacts.” Instead, your opinion stems from name-calling and anonymous sources. You claim a source stating that the mystery man was not Rafael Cruz. Who is your source? Who is the mystery man? Did you have this info before you defamed me?\n\nI am a journalist, national security expert, author of 14 books, and former government investigator who has broken many scoops later vindicated. Based on training in 14 years as a Naval Intelligence officer, for example, my reporting includes a three-part series on the Wayne Madsen Report in 2006 exposing House Speaker Dennis Hastert as a gay pedophile subject to blackmail.\n\nAs errors:\n\nFirst, you falsely claimed with no attribution that I described myself as a “conspiracy theorist.” Please cite your source. As we know from declassified 1960s CIA memos, authorities devised that smear for its media assets to use to discredit JFK assassination researchers. I scorn such a label, for the same reasons as Bill Simpich here (http://jfkfacts.org/memories/want-to-be-marginalized-talk-about-your-conspiracy-theory/).\n\nSecond, your slurs come from anonymous and CIA-tainted sources. Instead, why not contact me for comment and fact-checking? I’m not hiding, unlike those cowards. I write a daily column, and have appeared as a national security expert on eight of the top nine TV and cable U.S. news networks. My opeds have appeared hundreds of times in mainstream U.S. newspapers just in the past four years. Previously, I worked a year as an NSA analyst and for two major defense contractors, RCA and Computer Sciences Corp., achieving the VP-equivalent rank at the latter of Chief Privacy Officer. Which of your sources have that kind of experience? Some of their mischief apparently stems from the hit-job bio that anonymous editors at Wikipedia concocted about me and have refused to change. The CIA helped fund Wikipedia via its venture capital arm In-Q-Tel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel), as former deputy director Michael Morell confirmed last year at the National Press Club. Although most of Wikipedia’s entries are straightforward, its controllers undertake hit jobs on sensitive topics, as I described in a 2014 profile of Wikipedia’s founder “The Outlaw, Jimmy Wales.”\n\nThird, your blog mocks my use of anonymous sources. You suggest that you know I am wrong because of an anonymous source, which you do not name! Who is that source?\n\nFourth, the editor falsely suggested April 14 that my reporting was complete even though my probe was ongoing, as I reiterated April 13 to WGSO-AM’s New Orleans audience when I invited their help to identify Oswald’s companion. Even FBI and HSCA investigators (including former HSCA counsel Robert Blakey) have not named him publicly.\n\nOn April 15, I submitted a longer version of this reply. By now, I can report progress. Stay tuned.\n\nWayne Madsen\n\nEditor, The Wayne Madsen Report",
  "latent_16162": "ETFs are designed to track the changes in the price of benchmark natural gas futures contract in percentage terms not in dollar terms meaning if the spot price rises 5% you expect the ETF to rise 5% as well. However, by investing in month to month futures contracts, these ETFs suffer from the inherent risk of Contango which have been prevalent in natural gas futures market. The following hypothetical example explains the contango situation:\n\nLet’s assume the spot price for natural gas (immediate delivery) is $1.00 for 2,000 mmBtu and the value of a position in the near month futures contract (the contract with the closest settlement date where you take delivery) is also $1.00 for 2,000 mmBtu. If you are an investor holding a near month contract in order to track the spot prices of natural gas and you wish to avoid taking delivery of the commodity, you need to sell your current near month contract before it reaches settlement date (expires) and invest in the next month contract.\n\nContango is when you buy the next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract. In our scenario, the price for buying the next month contract is higher at $1.02 for 2,000 mmBtu or 2% more expensive than the current front month contract. The value of the next month contract you bought falls as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $1.00. You just lost 2% + commission costs to roll your position from one month to another. This is exactly what happens when future natural gas prices are higher than spot prices.\n\nUNG, the most popular natural gas ETF, has been suffering from a persistent level of contango due to falling natural gas prices. Holding a long position in UNG burned many long term investors as the fund lost more than 95% of its value since inception and has been forced to undergo several reverse splits. The good news is there are 2 ways to profit from a contango market:\n\nFirst, since UNG is very liquid, you can short the ETF as shares are easy to borrow from this large fund. However, shorting UNG exposes you to the extreme volatility of natural gas prices due to the fund holding front months futures contracts.\n\nThe second and better way is through an innovative long-short strategy designed to capitalize on a potential contango market environment minus the volatility of natural gas prices. This is where GASZ ETN comes in.\n\nUBS E-TRACS Natural Gas Futures Contango ETN (NYSE: GASZ)\n\nError opening: http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=GASZ&f=sl1c1j1ya2\n\nMER: 0.85%\n\nGASZ allows you to bet on a persistent contango environment in the natural gas futures market. The ETN is linked to the performance of the ISE Natural Gas Futures Spread™ Index (GYY) which shorts the near month natural gas futures contracts and goes long the midterm Henry Hub natural gas futures contracts.\n\nFor as long as contango exists, GASZ will be able to profit from its short positions in near term contracts. The biggest risk is for NG prices to fall in backwardation (opposite of contango). But from looking towards 2020, GASZ seems to be the perfect vehicle to hold as NG is virtually stuck in contango.\n\nLive ONE YEAR Chart of the The Natural Gas Futures Contango ETN– Symbol GASZ\n\nGASZ should be viewed as a new tool investors can use solo or in conjunction with other funds in their investment/trading strategy. But keep in mind that this fund is in no way designed for a buy and hold move and may not be suitable to express a long term bullish view on spot prices. If spot prices rally on the back of speculative price action, GASZ will take a hit as contango in the futures curve eases. The fund’s liquidity is light so monitor your positions carefully and keep stop losses at hand as a temporary backwarded market is always a possibility. If you have a bullish take on natural gas prices for the long run, a natural gas stocks etf might be a better option to consider.\n\nDisclaimer: the information presented above is only for informative purposes.

  "latent_16246": "I sat at my desk and stared at the screen.\n\nThe Chinese characters seemed to taunt me as I wrote their literal meaning in English to grasp why one character went after the verb here and after the subject in so many other cases.\n\nAfter five minutes, I sighed, rolled my eyes at the Mandarin language, and moved on.\n\nFour months prior I would’ve let frustration take over.\n\nIn fact, when I was learning Italian, frustration was the reason why I stopped lessons, and if it weren’t for my commitment to The Iceberg Project, I would not have reached the level where I’m at now.\n\nWith Mandarin I find myself running into the same frustration, but instead of wanting to quit, I feel more at ease and motivated to tackle the language again.\n\nWhat inspired that difference?\n\nWhat did I learn in six months that changed my view of frustration?\n\nWhen I’m not learning Mandarin or writing for the Italian site, I’m usually reading an academic paper (or watching Doctor Who) – most notably from the Modern Language Journal. On one of my most recent linguistic explorations, I stumbled across a linguist named Stephen Krashen from the University of Southern California.\n\nHe talks about the Comprehension Hypothesis, which suggests “we acquire language and develop literacy when we understand what we hear and what we read” (Krashen, 2014).\n\nThis means that what comes in – books, audio, and lessons – are more important than what goes out – speaking and writing.\n\nThere is more to this theory, so if you’re interested, read this interview from Language Mastery.\n\n3 Ways to Reduce Frustration\n\nAccording to Krashen, other polyglots and my experience, there a few key ways to reduce frustration.\n\n1) Understand that you don’t learn grammar concepts, phrases, or vocabulary until you’re ready to learn them.\n\nThis point comes from Krashen, and it’s interesting to note how representative this point is of life.\n\nHow many times have you gone through difficult situations and only learned the lesson after the third time?\n\nThe lesson was there and had been waiting for you all along. You only needed to develop to a certain level to absorb it.\n\nSo when it comes to grammar, know that you won’t learn certain concepts until you’re ready.\n\nYou can try hard to memorize usages and nitpicky rules, but studies suggest you need to be at a certain level first.\n\nLike the famous polyglot, Kató Lomb, paraphrased from the original German:\n\nOne learns grammar from language, not language from grammar.\n\n(Original German: “Man lernt Grammatik aus der Sprache, nicht Sprache aus der Grammatik.” – Toussaint and Langenscheidt)\n\nWhile this might sound depressing (because you can’t game the system and memorize everything), it’s actually liberating.\n\nWhat this means for you: When you encounter a difficult concept or don’t understand something, seek an answer. If it’s still not connecting, LET IT GO.\n\nYou might not understand it today, but I guarantee that as you continue learning, it and one hundred other invisible things, will become visible. It will be frustrating, but you’ll be more at ease when you let yourself off the hook after honouring that this is how our minds work.\n\n2) Drop boring textbooks, and pick up content that interests you.\n\nSome might argue with me, but I think you can use interesting, relevant content in your target language no matter what level you’re at.\n\nFor example, Lomb, the polyglot mentioned earlier, used a Russian novel to learn Russian. She never went to a class and learned rules. She used what she had – a compelling novel – and worked through it.\n\nWhat this means for you: Find a book, a television show, a magazine, or even memes online that you’re interested in to integrate into your learning schedule.\n\nDon’t have a schedule or know what to do each day? Read this: Four Easy Techniques for Using Foreign Language Every Day\n\nYou can also learn techniques for how to read books here : How to Read in a Foreign Language\n\nFor tips on how to watch movies and shows effectively, go here : Are You Wasting Your Time Watching Foreign Language Movies?\n\nMy final point is that the more background knowledge you have on a topic, the easier the content will be to acquire, so use content you’re familiar with AND enjoy.\n\n3) Stop EVERYTHING, and be honest with what is and what is not working.\n\nHumans are creatures of habit – both good and bad.\n\nOut of routine, we use a technique to learn and keep doing it even though we recognize we’re not learning from it anymore.\n\nThen we get confused because we know we’re supposed to be learning everyday, but we’re not sure what we should be doing that actually works.\n\nAt this point, many of us fall off the wagon…but that doesn’t have to be you.\n\nWhat this means for you: Look candidly at the techniques you’re using.\n\nQuestions to ask are:\n\nAm I using a material that I hate or find boring?\n\nAm I studying at a time when I’m unfocused or tired?\n\nAm I still using a technique from when I was a beginner that is no longer serving me as an intermediate learner?\n\nThen, take out a sheet of paper and make three columns.",
  "latent_16263": "Popeye the Sailor is a cartoon fictional character created by Elzie Crisler Segar.[3][4][5] The character first appeared in the daily King Features comic strip Thimble Theatre on January 17, 1929, and Popeye became the strip's title in later years. Popeye has also appeared in theatrical and television animated cartoons.[4]\n\nSegar's Thimble Theatre strip was in its 10th year when Popeye made his debut, but the one-eyed (left) sailor quickly became the main focus of the strip, and Thimble Theatre became one of King Features' most popular properties during the 1930s. After Segar's death in 1938, Thimble Theatre was continued by several writers and artists, most notably Segar's assistant Bud Sagendorf. The strip continues to appear in first-run installments in its Sunday edition, written and drawn by Hy Eisman. The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories.[4]\n\nIn 1933, Max Fleischer adapted the Thimble Theatre characters into a series of Popeye the Sailor theatrical cartoon shorts for Paramount Pictures. These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s, and Fleischer — and later Paramount's own Famous Studios — continued production through 1957. These cartoon shorts are now owned by Turner Entertainment and distributed by its sister company Warner Bros.[6]\n\nOver the years, Popeye has also appeared in comic books, television cartoons, arcade and video games, hundreds of advertisements,[4] peripheral products ranging from spinach to candy cigarettes, and the 1980 live-action film directed by Robert Altman and starring Robin Williams as Popeye.\n\nCharles M. Schulz said, \"I think Popeye was a perfect comic strip, consistent in drawing and humor\".[7] In 2002, TV Guide ranked Popeye number 20 on its \"50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\" list.[8]\n\nFictional character and story [ edit ]\n\nPopeye's story and characterization vary depending on the medium. Originally, Popeye got \"luck\" from rubbing the head of the Whiffle Hen; by 1932, he was instead getting \"strength\" from eating spinach.[9] Swee'Pea is Popeye's ward in the comic strips, but he is often depicted as belonging to Olive Oyl in cartoons.\n\nThere is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, although certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye's capabilities. Popeye seems bereft of manners and uneducated, yet he often comes up with solutions to problems that seem insurmountable to the police or the scientific community. He has displayed Sherlock Holmes-like investigative prowess, scientific ingenuity, and successful diplomatic arguments. His pipe also proves to be highly versatile. Among other things, it has served as a cutting torch, jet engine, propeller, periscope, musical instrument, and a whistle with which he produces his trademark toot. He also eats spinach through his pipe, sometimes sucking in the can along with the contents. Since the 1970s, Popeye is seldom depicted using his pipe to smoke tobacco.[4]\n\nPopeye's exploits are also enhanced by a few recurring plot elements. One is the love triangle among Popeye, Olive, and Bluto, and Bluto's endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye's expense. Another is his near-saintly perseverance in overcoming any obstacle to please Olive, who often renounces Popeye for Bluto.\n\nThimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips [ edit ]\n\nThimble Theatre was cartoonist E. C. Segar's third published strip when it first appeared in the New York Journal on December 19, 1919. The paper's owner William Randolph Hearst also owned King Features Syndicate, which syndicated the strip. Thimble Theatre was intended as a replacement for Midget Movies by Ed Wheelan (Wheelan having recently resigned from King Features).[10] It did not attract a large audience at first, and at the end of its first decade appeared in only half a dozen newspapers.\n\nIn its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in theatrical style (hence the strip's name). It could be classified as a gag-a-day comic in those days.[10]\n\nThimble Theatre's first main characters were the thin Olive Oyl and her boyfriend Harold Hamgravy. After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-adventure style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive's enterprising brother Castor Oyl. Olive's parents Cole and Nana Oyl also made frequent appearances.\n\nPopeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a ship for a voyage to Dice Island, the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen. Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell's, but survived by rubbing Bernice's head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip but, due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.[4][10]\n\nThe Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was taken up by many more newspapers as a result. Initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, but she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye's girlfriend and Ham Gravy left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually, he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.\n\nIn 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named \"Swee'Pea.\" Other regular characters in the strip were J. Wellington Wimpy, a hamburger-loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; Vickers Wellington bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character); George W. Geezil, a local cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and Eugene the Jeep, a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with magical powers. In addition, the strip featured the Sea Hag, a terrible pirate, as well as the last witch on Earth — her even more terrible sister excepted; Alice the Goon, a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag's henchwoman and continued as Swee'Pea's babysitter; and Toar, a caveman.[5]\n\nSegar's strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (King Blozo, for example). Spinach usage was rare and Bluto made only one appearance. Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a cigar, due to his last name being a homophone of \"cigar\" (pronounced SEE-gar). Comics historian Brian Walker stated: \"Segar offered up a masterful blend of comedy, fantasy, satire and suspense in Thimble Theater Starring Popeye.[5]\n\nThimble Theatre became one of King Features' most popular strips during the 1930s. A poll of adult comic strip readers in the April 1937 issue of Fortune magazine voted Popeye their second-favorite comic strip (after Little Orphan Annie).[5] By 1938, Thimble Theatre was running in 500 newspapers, and over 600 licensed \"Popeye\" products were on sale.[5] The success of the strip meant Segar was earning $100,000 a year at the time of his death.[5] Following an eventual name change to Popeye in the 1970s, the comic remains one of the longest running strips in syndication today. After Mussolini came to power in Italy, he banned all American comic strips, but Popeye was so popular the Italians made him bring it back.[citation needed]. The strip carried on after Segar's death in 1938, at which point he was replaced by a series of artists. In the 1950s, a spinoff strip was established, called Popeye the Sailorman.\n\nArtists after Segar [ edit ]\n\nThimble Theatre (December 2, 1951) Tom Sims and Bill Zaboly's(December 2, 1951)\n\nAfter Segar's death in 1938, many different artists were hired to draw the strip. Tom Sims, the son of a Coosa River channel-boat captain, continued writing Thimble Theatre strips and established the Popeye the Sailorman spin-off. Doc Winner and Bela Zaboly,[11] successively, handled the artwork during Sims's run. Eventually, Ralph Stein stepped in to write the strip until the series was taken over by Bud Sagendorf in 1959.\n\nSagendorf wrote and drew the daily strip until 1986, and continued to write and draw the Sunday strip until his death in 1994. Sagendorf, who had been Segar's assistant, made a definite effort to retain much of Segar's classic style, although his art is instantly discernible. Sagendorf continued to use many obscure characters from the Segar years, especially O.G. Wotasnozzle and King Blozo. Sagendorf's new characters, such as the Thung, also had a very Segar-like quality. What set Sagendorf apart from Segar more than anything else was his sense of pacing. Where plotlines moved very quickly with Segar, it would sometimes take an entire week of Sagendorf's daily strips for the plot to be advanced even a small amount.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1992, the daily strip was written and drawn by Bobby London, who, after some controversy, was fired from the strip for a story that could be taken to satirize abortion.[12] London's strips put Popeye and his friends in updated situations, but kept the spirit of Segar's original. One classic storyline, titled \"The Return of Bluto\", showed the sailor battling every version of the bearded bully from the comic strip, comic books, and animated films. The Sunday edition of the comic strip is currently drawn by Hy Eisman, who took over in 1994. The daily strip began featuring reruns of Sagendorf's strips after London was fired and continues to do so today.\n\nOn January 1, 2009, 70 years since the death of his creator, Segar's character of Popeye (though not the various films, TV shows, theme music and other media based on him) became public domain[13] in most countries, but remains under copyright in the United States. Because Segar was an employee of King Features Syndicate when he created the Popeye character for the company's Thimble Theatre strip, Popeye is treated as a work for hire under U.S. copyright law. Works for hire are protected for 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. Since Popeye made his first appearance in January 1929, and all U.S. copyrights expire on December 31 of the year that the term ends, Popeye will enter the public domain in the U.S. on January 1, 2025, assuming no amendments to U.S. copyright law before that date.[14]\n\nReprints [ edit ]\n\nComic books [ edit ]\n\nThere have been a number of Popeye comic books, from Dell, King Comics, Gold Key Comics, Charlton Comics and others, originally written and illustrated by Bud Sagendorf. In the Dell comics, Popeye became something of a crimefighter, thwarting evil organizations and Bluto's criminal activities. The new villains included the numerous Misermite dwarfs, who were all identical.\n\nPopeye appeared in the British \"TV Comic\" series, a News of the World publication, becoming the cover story in 1960 with stories written and drawn by \"Chick\" Henderson. Bluto was referred to as Brutus and was Popeye's only nemesis throughout the entire run.\n\nA variety of artists have created Popeye comic book stories since then; for example, George Wildman drew Popeye stories for Charlton Comics from 1969 until the late 1970s. The Gold Key series was illustrated by Wildman and scripted by Bill Pearson, with some issues written by Nick Cuti.\n\nIn 1988, Ocean Comics released the Popeye Special written by Ron Fortier with art by Ben Dunn. The story presented Popeye's origin story, including his given name of \"Ugly Kidd\"[15] and attempted to tell more of a lighthearted adventure story as opposed to using typical comic strip style humor. The story also featured a more realistic art style and was edited by Bill Pearson, who also lettered and inked the story as well as the front cover.[16] A second issue, by the same creative team, followed in 1988. The second issue introduced the idea that Bluto and Brutus were actually twin brothers and not the same person,[17] an idea also used in the comic strip on December 28, 2008 and April 5, 2009.[18][19] In 1999, to celebrate Popeye's 70th anniversary, Ocean Comics revisited the franchise with a one-shot comic book, titled The Wedding of Popeye and Olive Oyl, written by Peter David. The comic book brought together a large portion of the casts of both the comic strip and the animated shorts, and Popeye and Olive Oyl were finally wed after decades of courtship. However, this marriage has not been reflected in all media since the comic was published.\n\nIn 1989, a special series of short Popeye comic books were included in specially marked boxes of Instant Quaker Oatmeal, and Popeye also appeared in three TV commercials for Quaker Oatmeal,[20] which featured a parrot delivering the tag line \"Popeye wants a Quaker!\" The plots were similar to those of the films: Popeye loses either Olive Oyl or Swee'Pea to a muscle-bound antagonist, eats something invigorating, and proceeds to save the day. In this case, however, the invigorating elixir was not his usual spinach, but rather one of four flavors of Quaker Oatmeal.[20] (A different flavor was showcased with each mini-comic.) The comics ended with the sailor saying, \"I'm Popeye the Quaker Man!\", which offended members of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers.[21] Members of this religious group (which has no connection to the cereal company) are pacifists and do not believe in using violence to resolve conflicts. For Popeye to call himself a \"Quaker man\" after beating up someone was offensive to the Quakers and considered a misrepresentation of their faith and religious beliefs.[21] In addition, the submissiveness of Olive Oyl went against the Quakers' emphasis on women's rights. The Quaker Oatmeal company apologized and removed the \"Popeye the Quaker man\" reference from commercials and future comic book printings.[21]\n\nIn 2012, writer Roger Langridge teamed with cartoonists Bruce Ozella, Ken Wheaton, and Tom Neely (among others) to revive the spirit of Segar in IDW's 12-issue comic book miniseries, Popeye, Critic PS Hayes reviewed:\n\nLangridge writes a story with a lot of dialogue (compared to your average comic book) and it's all necessary, funny, and entertaining. Bruce Ozella draws the perfect Popeye. Not only Popeye, but Popeye's whole world. Everything looks like it should, cartoony and goofy. Plus, he brings an unusual amount of detail to something that doesn't really need it. You'll swear that you're looking at an old Whitman Comics issue of Popeye, only it's better. Ozella is a great storyteller and even though the issue is jam packed with dialog, the panels never look cramped at all.[22]\n\nIn late 2012, IDW began reprinting the original 1940s–1950s Sagendorf Popeye comic books under the title of Classic Popeye.\n\nWebcomics [ edit ]\n\nIn january 2019, in celebration of its 90 years of character, King Feature Syndicate launched the webcomic Popeye's Cartoon Club produced by Alex Hallatt, Erica Henderson, Tom Neely, Roger Langridge, Larry deSouza, Jeffrey Brown, Jim Engel, Liniers, Jay Fosgitt and Carol Lay.[23]\n\nTheatrical animated cartoons [ edit ]\n\nIn November 1932, King Features signed an agreement with Fleischer Studios to have Popeye and the other Thimble Theatre characters begin appearing in a series of animated cartoons. The first cartoon in the series was released in 1933, and Popeye cartoons, released by Paramount Pictures, would remain a staple of Paramount's release schedule for nearly 25 years. William Costello was the original voice of Popeye, a voice that would be replicated by later performers, such as Jack Mercer and even Mae Questel. Many of the Thimble Theatre characters, including Wimpy, Poopdeck Pappy, and Eugene the Jeep, eventually made appearances in the Paramount cartoons, though appearances by Olive Oyl's extended family and Ham Gravy were notably absent. Thanks to the animated-short series, Popeye became even more of a sensation than he had been in comic strips, and by 1938, polls showed that the sailor was Hollywood's most popular cartoon character.[24][25]\n\nIn every Popeye cartoon, the sailor is invariably put into what seems like a hopeless situation, upon which (usually after a beating), a can of spinach becomes available, and Popeye quickly opens the can and consumes its contents. Upon swallowing the spinach, Popeye's physical strength immediately becomes superhuman, and he is easily able to save the day, and very often rescue Olive Oyl from a dire situation. It did not stop there, as spinach could also give Popeye the skills and powers he needed, as in The Man on the Flying Trapeze, where it gave him acrobatic skills.\n\nIn May 1942, Paramount Pictures assumed ownership of Fleischer Studios, fired the Fleischers and began reorganizing the studio, which they renamed Famous Studios. The early Famous-era shorts were often World War II-themed, featuring Popeye fighting Nazis and Japanese soldiers, most notably the 1942 short You're a Sap, Mr. Jap. In late 1943, the Popeye series was moved to Technicolor production, beginning with Her Honor the Mare. Famous/Paramount continued producing the Popeye series until 1957, with Spooky Swabs being the last of the 125 Famous shorts in the series. Paramount then sold the Popeye film catalog to Associated Artists Productions, which was bought out by United Artists in 1958. Through various mergers, the rights are currently controlled by WarnerMedia's Turner Entertainment.\n\nIn 2001, Cartoon Network, under the supervision of animation historian Jerry Beck, created a new incarnation of The Popeye Show. The show aired the Fleischer and Famous Studios Popeye shorts in versions approximating their original theatrical releases by editing copies of the original opening and closing credits (taken or recreated from various sources) onto the beginnings and ends of each cartoon, or in some cases, in their complete, uncut original theatrical versions direct from such prints that originally contained the front-and-end Paramount credits. The series aired 135 Popeye shorts over forty-five episodes, until March 2004. The Popeye Show continued to air on Cartoon Network's spin-off network Boomerang.\n\nWhile many of the Paramount Popeye cartoons remained unavailable on video, a handful of those cartoons had fallen into public domain and were found on numerous low budget VHS tapes and later DVDs. When Turner Entertainment acquired the cartoons in 1986, a long and laborious legal struggle with King Features kept the majority of the original Popeye shorts from official video releases for more than 20 years. King Features instead opted to release a DVD boxed set of the 1960s made-for-television Popeye the Sailor cartoons, to which it retained the rights, in 2004. In the meantime, home video rights to the Associated Artists Productions library were transferred from CBS/Fox Video to MGM/UA Home Video in 1986, and eventually to Warner Home Video in 1999. In 2006, Warner Home Video announced it would release all of the Popeye cartoons produced for theatrical release between 1933 and 1957 on DVD, restored and uncut. Three volumes were released between 2007 and 2008, covering all of the black-and-white cartoons produced from 1933 to 1943. In December 2018, a volume featuring the first 14 color shorts from 1943 to 1945 was released on DVD and Blu-ray from Warner Home Video through the Warner Archive Collection.\n\nOriginal television cartoons [ edit ]\n\nIn 1960, King Features Syndicate commissioned a new series of cartoons titled Popeye the Sailor, but this time for television syndication. Al Brodax served as executive producer of the cartoons for King Features. Jack Mercer, Mae Questel, and Jackson Beck returned for this series, which was produced by a number of companies, including Jack Kinney Productions, Rembrandt Films (William L. Snyder and Gene Deitch), Larry Harmon Productions, Halas and Batchelor, Paramount Cartoon Studios (formerly Famous Studios), and Southern Star Entertainment (formerly Southern Star Productions). The artwork was streamlined and simplified for the television budgets, and 220 cartoons were produced in only two years, with the first set of them premiering in the autumn of 1960, and the last of them debuting during the 1961–1962 television season. Since King Features had exclusive rights to these Popeye cartoons, 85 of them were released on DVD as a 75th anniversary Popeye boxed set in 2004.\n\nFor these cartoons, Bluto's name was changed to \"Brutus\", as King Features believed at the time that Paramount owned the rights to the name \"Bluto\". Many of the cartoons made by Paramount used plots and storylines taken directly from the comic strip sequences – as well as characters like King Blozo and the Sea Hag.[26] The 1960s cartoons have been issued on both VHS and DVD.\n\nOn September 9, 1978, The All New Popeye Hour debuted on the CBS Saturday morning lineup. It was an hour-long animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, which tried its best to retain the style of the original comic strip (Popeye returned to his original costume and Brutus to his original name of Bluto), while complying with the prevailing content restrictions on violence. In addition to providing many of the cartoon scripts, Mercer continued to voice Popeye, while Marilyn Schreffler and Allan Melvin became the new voices of Olive Oyl and Bluto, respectively. (Mae Questel actually auditioned for Hanna-Barbera to recreate Olive Oyl, but was rejected in favor of Schreffler.) The All New Popeye Hour ran on CBS until September 1981, when it was cut to a half-hour and retitled The Popeye and Olive Show. It was removed from the CBS lineup in September 1983, the year before Jack Mercer's death. These cartoons have also been released on VHS and DVD. During the time these cartoons were in production, CBS aired The Popeye Valentine's Day Special – Sweethearts at Sea on February 14, 1979. In the UK, the BBC aired a half-hour version of The All New Popeye Show, from the early-1980s to 2004.\n\nPopeye briefly returned to CBS in 1987 for Popeye and Son, another Hanna-Barbera series, which featured Popeye and Olive as a married couple with a son named Popeye Jr., who hates the taste of spinach, but eats it to boost his strength. Maurice LaMarche performed Popeye's voice; Mercer had died in 1984. The show lasted for one season.\n\nDrawn Together Popeye as he appeared in\n\nIn 2004, Lions Gate Entertainment produced a computer-animated television special, Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy, which was made to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Popeye. Billy West performed the voice of Popeye, describing the production as \"the hardest job I ever did, ever\" and the voice of Popeye as \"like a buzzsaw on your throat\".[27] The uncut version was released on DVD on November 9, 2004; and was aired in a re-edited version on Fox on December 17, 2004 and again on December 30, 2005. Its style was influenced by the 1930s Fleischer cartoons, and featured Swee'Pea, Wimpy, Bluto (who is Popeye's friend in this version), Olive Oyl, Poopdeck Pappy and the Sea Hag as its characters. On November 6, 2007, Lions Gate Entertainment re-released Popeye's Voyage on DVD with redesigned cover art.\n\nPopeye has made brief parody appearances in modern animated productions, including:\n\nWeb series [ edit ]\n\nOn December 2, 2018, a Popeye web series named Popeye's Island Adventures produced by the WildBrain studio was premiered on its official YouTube channel.[28][29]\n\nTheme song [ edit ]\n\nPopeye's theme song, titled \"I'm Popeye The Sailor Man\", composed by Sammy Lerner in 1933 for Fleischer's first Popeye the Sailor cartoon,[30] has become forever associated with the sailor. \"The Sailor's Hornpipe\" has often been used as an introduction to Popeye's theme song.\n\nA cover of the theme song, performed by Face to Face, is included on the 1995 tribute album Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records. A jazz version, performed by Ted Kooshian's Standard Orbit Quartet, appears on their 2009 Summit Records release Underdog and Other Stories.\n\nPlayground song parodies of the theme have become part of children's street culture around the world,[31][32] usually interpolating \"frying pan\" or \"garbage can\" into the lyrics as Popeye's dwelling place[33][34] and ascribing to the character various unsavory actions or habits[35][36][37][38] that transform the character into an \"Anti-Popeye\", and changing his exemplary spinach-based diet into an inedible morass of worms, onions, flies, tortillas and snot.[39]\n\nOther media [ edit ]\n\nThe success of Popeye as a comic-strip and animated character has led to appearances in many other forms. For more than 20 years, Stephen DeStefano has been the artist drawing Popeye for King Features licensing.[40]\n\nRadio [ edit ]\n\nPopeye was adapted to radio in several series broadcast over three different networks by two sponsors from 1935 to 1938. Popeye and most of the major supporting characters were first featured in a thrice-weekly 15-minute radio program, Popeye the Sailor, which starred Detmar Poppen as Popeye, along with most of the major supporting characters — Olive Oyl (Olive Lamoy), Wimpy (Charles Lawrence), Bluto (Jackson Beck) and Swee'Pea (Mae Questel). In the first episode, Popeye adopted Sonny (Jimmy Donnelly), a character later known as Matey the Newsboy. This program was broadcast Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday nights at 7:15pm. September 10, 1935 through March 28, 1936 on the NBC Red Network (87 episodes), initially sponsored by Wheatena, a whole-wheat breakfast cereal, which would routinely replace the spinach references. Music was provided by Victor Irwin's Cartoonland Band. Announcer Kelvin Keech sang (to composer Lerner's \"Popeye\" theme) \"Wheatena is his diet / He asks you to try it / With Popeye the sailor man.\" Wheatena paid King Features Syndicate $1,200 per week.\n\nThe show was next broadcast Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 7:15 to 7:30pm on WABC and ran from August 31, 1936 to February 26, 1937 (78 episodes). Floyd Buckley played Popeye, and Miriam Wolfe portrayed both Olive Oyl and the Sea Hag. Once again, reference to spinach was conspicuously absent. Instead, Popeye sang, \"Wheatena's me diet / I ax ya to try it / I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\".[41]\n\nThe third series was sponsored by the maker of Popsicles three nights a week for 15 minutes at 6:15 pm on CBS from May 2, 1938 through July 29, 1938.\n\nOf the three series, only 20 of the 204 episodes are known to be preserved.\n\nPopeye was recently featured on the Brad and John: Mornings on KISM \"When Animals Attack\" segment.\n\nFilms [ edit ]\n\nPopeye (1980) [ edit ]\n\nDirector Robert Altman used the character in Popeye, a 1980 live-action musical feature film, starring Robin Williams as Popeye (his first starring movie role), Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, and Paul L. Smith as Bluto, with songs by Harry Nilsson and Van Dyke Parks. The script was by Jules Feiffer, who adapted the 1971 Nostalgia Press book of 1936 strips for his screenplay, thus retaining many of the characters created by Segar. A co-production of Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Productions, the movie was filmed almost entirely on Malta, in the village of Mellieħa on the northwest coast of the island. The set is now a tourist attraction called Popeye Village. The US box office earnings were double the film's budget, making it a success.\n\nUpcoming animated film [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2010, it was reported that Sony Pictures Animation is developing a 3D computer-animated Popeye film, with Avi Arad producing it.[42] In November 2011, Sony Pictures Animation announced that Jay Scherick and David Ronn, the writers of The Smurfs, are writing the screenplay for the film.[43] In June 2012, it was reported that Genndy Tartakovsky had been set to direct the feature,[44] which he planned to make \"as artful and unrealistic as possible.\"[45] In November 2012, Sony Pictures Animation set the release date for September 26, 2014,[46] which was, in May 2013, pushed back to 2015.[47] In March 2014, Sony Pictures Animation updated its slate, scheduling the film for 2016, and announcing Tartakovsky as the director of Hotel Transylvania 2, which he was directing concurrently with Popeye.[48] On September 18, 2014, Tartakovsky revealed an \"animation test\" footage, about which he said, \"It's just something that kind of represents what we want to do. I couldn't be more excited by how it turned out.\"[49] In March 2015, Tartakovsky announced that despite the well-received test footage, he was no longer working on the project, and would instead direct Can You Imagine?, which is based on his own original idea.[50] Nevertheless, Sony Pictures Animation stated the project still remains in active development.[51] In January 2016, it was announced that T.J. Fixman would write the film.[52]\n\nVideo and pinball games [ edit ]\n\nMarketing, tie-ins, and endorsements [ edit ]\n\nFrom early on, Popeye was heavily merchandised. Everything from soap to razor blades to spinach was available with Popeye's likeness on it. Most of these items are rare and sought-after by collectors, but some merchandise is still being produced.\n\nGames and toys\n\nMezco Toyz makes classic-style Popeye figures in two sizes.\n\nKellyToys produces plush stuffed Popeye characters.\n\nRestaurants\n\nPopeyes Louisiana Kitchen (a.k.a. Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits), a fast food restaurant chain, is not named after Popeye the Sailor, but after the character \"Popeye\" Doyle from the film The French Connection (1971), who was in turn named after real police detective Eddie Egan, who was called \"Pop Eye\" because of his keen observational skills. The restaurant chain would later obtain a license for use of the cartoon character and advertise the name as Popeye's after Popeye the Sailor, causing some confusion as to the source of the name. Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen locations in Puerto Rico make extensive use of Popeye the Sailor and associated characters.

Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen locations in Puerto Rico make extensive use of Popeye the Sailor and associated characters. Wimpy's name was borrowed for the Wimpy restaurant chain, one of the first international fast food restaurants featuring hamburgers, which they call \"Wimpy Burgers\".[57]\n\nRetail foods and beverages\n\nSports\n\nStarting in 1940, Popeye became the mascot of Flamengo (Rio de Janeiro – Brazil), the most popular soccer team with almost 50 million fans around the world. The mascot of the soccer club is currently a cartoon vulture.[61]\n\nOther\n\nCultural origins and impact [ edit ]\n\nFrank \"Rocky\" Fiegel (January 27, 1868 – March 24, 1947) was said to be the real life inspiration for E. C. Segar's character \"Popeye\" The Sailor.\n\nLocal folklore in Chester, Illinois, Segar's hometown, claims that Frank \"Rocky\" Fiegel (b. in Poland, January 27, 1868) was the real-life inspiration for the character Popeye. He had a prominent chin, sinewy physique, characteristic pipe, and a propensity and agile skill for fist-fighting.[63][64][65] Fiegel died on March 24, 1947 never having married. His gravestone has the image of Popeye engraved on it.[66] The town of Chester erected a statue of Popeye in Fiegel's honor, which still stands today.[67] According to Popeye historian Michael Brooks, Segar regularly sent money to Fiegel.[68][69]\n\nSeparate hometown residents of Chester also are claimed to have served as inspiration for two other Segar characters including Dora Pascal, an uncommonly tall, angular lady who ran a general store in town. She even donned a hair bun close to her neckline. William \"Windy Bill\" Schuchert, a rather rotund man who owned the local opera house, was the seed for the character J. Wellington Wimpy. He would even send out his employees to purchase hamburgers for him between performances at a local tavern named Wiebusch's, the same tavern that Fiegal would frequent and engage in fistfights.[64][70]\n\nIn 2015, businessman Greg Morena refuted the claim that Popeye originated in Chester, Illinois. Instead, he stated that Santa Monica, California was the birthplace of the character and that a Norwegian sailor by the name of Olaf \"cap\" Olsen served as the impetus for the character.[71] Research presented in Jim Harris' 2009 \"Santa Monica Pier: A Century of the Last Great Pleasure Pier\" raised the idea that while living in Santa Monica, Segar based the physical attributes on Olsen; even though Harris never made a definitive claim.[72]\n\nCultural influences [ edit ]\n\nCulturally,[73] many consider Popeye a precursor to the superheroes who would eventually come to dominate US comic books.[74]\n\nSuch has been Popeye's cultural impact that the medical profession sometimes refers to the biceps bulge symptomatic of a tendon rupture as the \"Popeye muscle.\"[75][76] Note, however, that under normal (uninfluenced by spinach) conditions, Popeye has pronounced muscles of the forearm, not of the biceps.\n\nIn 1973, Cary Bates created Captain Strong, a takeoff of Popeye, for DC Comics,[77] as a way of having two cultural icons – Superman and (a proxy of) Popeye – meet.[78]\n\nThe 1981 Nintendo videogame Donkey Kong, which introduced its eponymous character and Nintendo's unofficial company mascot Mario to the world, was originally planned to be a Popeye game. Mario (then known as Jumpman) was originally supposed to be Popeye, Donkey Kong was originally Bluto, and the character Pauline was originally Olive Oyl, but when Nintendo was unable to acquire the rights to use the actual franchise characters, it decided to create original characters instead.[79]\n\nThe 1988 Walt Disney/Touchstone Pictures film Who Framed Roger Rabbit featured many classic cartoon characters, and the absence of Popeye was noted by some critics. Popeye (along with Bluto and Olive Oyl) actually had a cameo role planned for the film. However, since the Popeye cartoons were based on a comic strip, Disney found they had to pay licensing fees to both King Features Syndicate and MGM/UA. MGM/UA's pre-May 1986 library (which included Popeye) was being purchased by Turner Entertainment at the time, which created legal complications; thus, the rights could not be obtained and Popeye's cameo was dropped from the film.[80]\n\nThe Popeye Dance [ edit ]\n\nThe Popeye was a popular dance in the dance craze era of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Originating in New Orleans around 1962, the Popeye was performed by shuffling and moving one's arms, placing one arm behind and one arm in front and alternating them, going through the motion of raising a pipe up to the mouth, and alternate sliding or pushing one foot back in the manner of ice skating, similar to motions exhibited by the cartoon character. According to music historian Robert Pruter, the Popeye was even more popular than The Twist in New Orleans.[81] The dance was associated with and/or referenced to in several songs, including Eddie Bo's \"Check Mr. Popeye,\" Chris Kenner's \"Something You Got\" and \"Land of a Thousand Dances,\" Frankie Ford's \"You Talk Too Much,\" Ernie K-Doe's \"Popeye Joe,\" Huey \"Piano\" Smith's \"Popeye,\" and Harvey Fuqua's \"Any Way You Wanta.\" A compilation of 23 Popeye dance songs was released in 1996 under the title \"New Orleans Popeye Party.\"[82]\n\nSpinach [ edit ]\n\nInitially Popeye's chief superhuman characteristic was his indestructibility, rather than super strength, which was attributed to his having rubbed the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen numerous times after being shot. Popeye later attributed his strength to spinach.[83][84] The popularity of Popeye helped boost spinach sales. Using Popeye as a role model for healthier eating may work; a 2010 study revealed that children increased their vegetable consumption after watching Popeye cartoons.[85] The spinach-growing community of Crystal City, Texas, erected a statue of the character in recognition of Popeye's positive effects on the spinach industry. There is another Popeye statue in Segar's hometown, Chester, Illinois, and statues in Springdale and Alma, Arkansas (which claims to be \"The Spinach Capital of the World\"), at canning plants of Allen Canning, which markets Popeye-branded canned spinach. In addition to Allen Canning's Popeye spinach, Popeye Fresh Foods markets bagged, fresh spinach with Popeye characters on the package. In 2006, when spinach contaminated with E. coli was accidentally sold to the public, many editorial cartoonists lampooned the affair by featuring Popeye in their cartoons.[86]\n\nA frequently circulated story claims that Fleischer's choice of spinach to give Popeye strength was based on faulty calculations of its iron content. In the story, a scientist misplaced a decimal point in an 1870 measurement of spinach's iron content, leading to an iron value ten times higher than it should have been. This faulty measurement was not noticed until the 1930s.[87][88][89] While this story has gone through longstanding circulation, recent study has shown that this is a myth,[90][91] and it was chosen for its vitamin A content alone;[92] see Spinach: Popeye and iron.\n\nWord coinages [ edit ]\n\nThe strip is also responsible for popularizing, although not inventing, the word \"goon\" (meaning a thug or lackey); goons in Popeye's world were large humanoids with indistinctly drawn faces that were particularly known for being used as muscle and slave labor by Popeye's nemesis, the Sea Hag. One particular goon, the aforementioned female named Alice, was an occasional recurring character in the animated shorts, but she was usually a fairly nice character.\n\nEugene the Jeep was introduced in the comic strip on March 13, 1936.

  "latent_16295": "A few years ago, I read an article about the unfathomable lack of sleep that is structured into the curriculum of military schools; we’re talking 5-6 hours a night for young adults who still requires between 8.4-10 hrs a night. In this month’s journal SLEEP Swedish researchers have observed thatchronic sleep deprivation in military personnel affects moral judgments, in addition to what we already know: decreased reaction time, poor procedural decision making, increased risk taking, increased reliance on hypnotics (alcohol and sleep meds) and psychostimulants (cocaine, amphetamines). Even more shockingly, this chronic sleep deprivation most affected individuals who typically made sound moral decisions. As expected, chronic sleep deprivation had little affect on those individuals who were already lacking in moral fiber. The quality of one’s moral fiber was based from decision-based questionnaires in response to a presented scenario that modeled Kohlberg’s stages of moral development.\n\nNo, they weren’t trivial moral decisions like this.\n\nBut rather in response to the following scenario:\n\nA woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to produce. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman’s husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $ 1,000, which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said, “No, I discovered the drug and I’m going to make money from it.” So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man’s store to steal the drug for his wife. Should Heinz have broken into the laboratory to steal the drug for his wife? Why or why not?\n\nOne typically argues the ethos of this situation by using one of these stages….\n\nStage one (obedience): Heinz should not steal the medicine because he would consequently be put in prison, which would mean he is a bad person. Or: Heinz should steal the medicine because it is only worth $200, not how much the druggist wanted for it. Heinz had even offered to pay for it and was not stealing anything else.\n\nStage two (self-interest): Heinz should steal the medicine because he will be much happier if he saves his wife, even if he will have to serve a prison sentence. Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine because prison is an awful place, and he would probably languish over a jail cell more than his wife’s death.\n\nStage three (conformity): Heinz should steal the medicine because his wife expects it; he wants to be a good husband. Or: Heinz should not steal the drug because stealing is bad and he is not a criminal; he tried to do everything he could without breaking the law, you cannot blame him.\n\nStage four (law-and-order): Heinz should not steal the medicine because the law prohibits stealing, making it illegal. Or: Heinz should steal the drug for his wife but also take the prescribed punishment for the crime as well as paying the druggist what he is owed. Criminals cannot just run around without regard for the law; actions have consequences.\n\nStage five (human rights): Heinz should steal the medicine because everyone has a right to choose life, regardless of the law. Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine because the scientist has a right to fair compensation. Even if his wife is sick, it does not make his actions right.\n\nStage six (universal human ethics): Heinz should steal the medicine, because saving a human life is a more fundamental value than the property rights of another person. Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine, because others may need the medicine just as badly, and their lives are equally significant.\n\nPersonally, my decision would rely on universal human ethics. In relation to the research, what is most terrifying is the profound change in moral character in lieu of chronic sleep deprivation. If we remember our sophomore year history, the US has engaged in several immoral military acts in the past, such as the institution of American concentration camps, killing raids in Vietnam, and let’s not forget the numerous cases of sexual abuse and rape of women that occurs at these same military schools were chronic sleep restriction is expected. How responsible chronic sleep deprivation is for influencing these poor choices is unknown, but if each country’s military is chronically sleep deprived and making poor choices of moral fiber……..then if this study is universally true, then we have ourselves a global Armageddon.\n\nOlav Kjellevold Olsen; Ståle Pallesen; Jarle Eid (2010).

Dyson Heydon is a man of honour,\" Mr Abbott said.\n\nMr Burnside said he believed Justice Heydon was an honourable man but that the Government had quoted him out of context.\n\n\"They will grasp at any straws they can,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think they would see me as a natural source of support, but the fact is I do have a high regard for Dyson Heydon.\n\n\"In fact, as I've said, I think he is an honourable person and I think in the circumstances an honourable person would step aside.\"\n\nOn Monday Justice Heydon, a former High Court judge, produced emails showing that he was originally told about the Liberal Party connection with the Sir Garfield Barwick address when invited last year.\n\nBut he said he overlooked it when he later confirmed that he would give this year's annual speech. He has pulled out of the address.\n\nIt has also been revealed that Justice Heydon was on the selection committee that awarded the Prime Minister a Rhodes Scholarship in the 1980s.\n\n\"The more his connections with the Liberal Party become apparent, the more difficult it is to give him the benefit of the doubt,\" Mr Burnside said.\n\n\"But I still think that he's an honourable person.\"\n\nPossible to continue with a new commissioner: Burnside\n\nThe peak union group, the ACTU, is now considering an application for Justice Heydon's disqualification as royal commissioner.\n\nACTU spokesman Dave Oliver said unions believed Justice Heydon was biased, but they had not settled on their next step.\n\n\"We need to talk to many of our affiliates to get further legal advice, many of our affiliates have been involved in this royal commission and there's many teams of lawyers and we'll be sitting down over the short term to consider what all our options are,\" he said.\n\nMr Burnside said he believed it could be possible to continue with a new commissioner whose terms of reference could take into account the evidence already given.\n\nHe was counsel assisting the Australian Broadcasting Authority inquiry into the cash-for-comment scandal in 1999.\n\n\"The person chairing the inquiry, David Flint, was careless enough to go on air with John Laws just after the cross-examination of John Laws was not completed and he eventually saw the difficulty and stepped aside,\" Mr Burnside said.\n\n\"Within half an hour the commission had been reconstituted and it continued without a break using the evidence that had already been received.\n\n\"Now that's not the same as a royal commission, but it's an indication of what can be done.\"\n\nThe ACTU has until Thursday to make an application for his disqualification, with a hearing on Friday.\n\nTopics: federal-government, government-and-politics, unions, law-crime-and-justice, royal-commissions, australia\n\nFirst posted",

(WTVR) -- Police sources said an SUV belonging to former Detroit Piston and Virginia Union basketball star Ben Wallace crashed into a fence outside a home in Henrico County early Saturday morning.\n\nSilverio Acosta said he dialed 911 after he heard a loud boom around 2 a.m. at his home off Gaskins Rd. near Peppertree Dr.\n\nWhen Acosta went outside to see what happened, he found pieces of his fence, which butts up to Gaskins Rd., scattered throughout his yard.\n\n“It was dark, but it's clear from here I saw one person trying to fight to get out of the car,” Acosta said.\n\nThat’s when Acosta said he saw a man pick up and smash pieces of wood against the fence “because he was angry.”\n\nPolice said the SUV, which was left at the accident scene, took out a 20-foot section of the fence.\n\nMultiple police sources told CBS 6 News that the vehicle belongs to former NBA All-Star Ben Wallace.\n\nAdditionally, Acosta said that police found an expired insurance card inside the vehicle and that they gave him a piece of paper listing Ben and Chanda Wallace as the policyholders.\n\nCBS 6 went to the gated Goochland neighborhood listed as an address for Wallace's wife to try to ask the former basketball star about the wrecked SUV. But the number listed for Wallace on the call box would not dial through.\n\nWallace pleaded guilty to drunken driving and weapon possession charges stemming from an incident just outside of Detroit in 2011.\n\nHenrico police, who are investigating the wreck as a felony hit-and-run, would not confirm on the record that the vehicle belongs to Wallace.\n\nAcosta said he would not have recognized Wallace since he is not a basketball fan. He said the man was very tall, but admitted that he could not see the fleeing driver’s face.\n\nAcosta is not upset about the fence, but said he is angry because whoever was driving the SUV ran away.\n\n\"If he would have killed somebody right there; he would have walked away, and he doesn't care,” Acosta said.\n\nCBS 6 also called and left messages with lawyers who represented Wallace in the past.\n\nCraig Cooley said that he once represented Wallace for a traffic violation, but has no information about this incident.\n\nPolice said that this is an ongoing investigation and that no has been charged at this point.",
  "latent_16476": "The craft beer boom is spreading to the shores of Lake Minnetonka.\n\nThe Excelsior Brewing Co., the first Lake Minnetonka brewery and the only one allowed in the small town, is more than tripling in size less than two years after opening thanks to the high demand. The $1.4 million expansion is set to open next month, with a celebration this Saturday of the demolition.\n\n“We basically reached our capacity nine months into operation,” spokesman Ben Flattum said. “We didn’t know what we were getting into … and it’s been crazy.”\n\nThe expansion of the brewery, which opened in summer 2012 in an old 1920 Ford dealership industrial building, will increase beer production by 600 percent and add a bottling line to sell cases to Twin Cities stores for the first time.\n\nIt’s part of the growing brewery and taproom trend across the west metro area. And Excelsior could soon have company on Lake Minnetonka.\n\nAcross the lake from Excelsior, Wayzata City Manager Heidi Nelson said they’ve received some inquiries about opening a brewery in the city, though no formal proposals have been submitted yet; the city is also discussing changing its ordinance to allow taprooms.\n\nIn Excelsior, the brewery is just three blocks from the lake, near the town’s main street, at 421 3rd St. But opening a new business in a small town hasn’t come without challenges.\n\nLast fall, some nearby residents and businesses complained to the city about noise issues increasing with the brewery’s expansion. And since then, the City Council has debated how or whether to limit the brewery’s hours and outdoor seating.\n\n“It’s been a very contentious issue,” City Manager Kristi Luger said. “We have a split council; it’s a 3-2 vote. And that’s not typical here.”\n\nShe said the debate comes down to balancing residents’ quality of life with the realities of being a popular tourist town. While she said police haven’t received any formal complaints about the brewery, the city has received calls about drunkenness and noise.\n\nExcelsior changed its ordinance in 2011 to allow breweries, but restricted it to only one. Now, when it comes to limiting hours and seating, Luger said there are few small cities that Excelsior can model their ordinance after because the brewery business is so new since the 2011 so-called “Surly bill” allowed them.\n\n“It’s a very polarizing issue right now … it’s such a new industry,” she said, adding about breweries’ taprooms, which don’t serve food like restaurants: “It was supposed to be a tasting place … but it’s kind of become like a bar. And our council members are very uncomfortable with it.”\n\nBut Flattum said it’s a vocal few; most residents and businesses, he said, have been supportive of the brewery and have contributed to its success.\n\n“We don’t sell a cheeseburger and that makes us the enemy?” he said about the city’s bars that sell hard liquor. “I’d say on Lake Minnetonka, we are the least rowdy.”\n\nThe final agreement is expected to be voted on by the City Council on April 21.\n\nMore beer all around\n\nIn the meantime, a year and a half after the three local residents opened the brewery, they’re back in construction mode.\n\nThe expansion includes relocating and remodeling their taproom in the former auto shop space and boosting the square footage from 2,700 to 8,500 square feet. Taking up the entire building will increase their brewing capacity by 600 percent, Flattum said, adding seven 40-barrel fermenters, two conditioning tanks and a bottling line to begin selling six-packs of beer to metro stores in late May.\n\nThe brewery is hosting a “wall party” Saturday to celebrate the demolition of a wall separating the current space from the expanded area and then a grand opening of the new space May 24 with an outdoor beer garden and live music all day.\n\nIf they someday outgrow that space, Flattum said they have ambitions to move their production off-site to another west metro city, but keep the taproom in Excelsior.\n\nLuger said that’s a good thing for the town, despite the few concerns.\n\n“The brewery has been great,” she said about it boosting tourism to Excelsior and responding to any complaints. “They’re well established. And they’re successful.”",
  "latent_16693": "Following the incident of rape in Delhi, which left a 23-year-old physiotherapy student dead, the struggle for women's rights and safety has gathered momentum in the country. While one would like to think that women across the country echo the same feelings and are probably equally restless about the patriarchal structure around which they have to arrange their lives, the RSS women's wing seems to be a study in contradictions.\n\nOne one hand they encourage women to come out of their homes to join a political organisation and organise camps to encourage sports on the other hand they keep reiterating that a woman's primary duty is towards her family and its well-being.\n\nAn Outlook article by Neha Dixit, explores the amusing mechanisms within the women's section of the party, called the Rashtra Sevika Samiti.\n\nThe article traces how the pracharikas or the workers of the group take pride in the fact that they are not backing or demanding women's rights. Rather, they seem to be content with the fact that they are working towards the creation of a 'Hindu' nation. The women's wing, which has close to 55,000 branches across the country also seem skeptical of the feminist movements working their way against patriarchal domination in the country.\n\nIn a particularly interesting section, the reporter talks to a young woman about the dynamics of the man-woman relationship, to which the said RSS workers reveals shockingly misogynistic ideas. What is even more strange is probably that, in the mammoth women's organisation she works in and for, such ideas are endorsed as perfectly credible.\n\nThe reporter quotes twenty-something Sharda from Jabalpur:\n\nI turn to Sharda from Jabalpur. In her late twenties, Sharda has been a whole timer for five years. She tells me that apart from the shakhas, the Samiti also counsels women in their respective areas. There is a manual that is followed. When I ask her, “What advice would you give to a victim of wife beating?” she answers, “Don't parents admonish their children for misbehaviour? Just as a child must adjust to his/her parents, so must a wife act keeping in mind her husband's moods and must avoid irritating him. Only this can keep the family together.” Similarly, divorce is also a non option for women. She says, “Our task is to keep the family together, not break it. We tell the women to adjust. Sometimes, we try counsel the husband too.”\n\nWhile women of the country might be busy taking potshots at men and the likes of Mohan Bhagwat, perhaps it's time to take a deeper, critical look at their own kinds.\n\nRead the full Outlook article here.\n\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

  "latent_17089": "Ahead of the radically-new turbo V6 era, the Australian veteran called time on his F1 career and switched to the increasingly popular FIA WEC and Le Mans with Porsche.\n\nSo as the first season without Webber since 2001 comes to a close this weekend, the popular 38-year-old was asked by Austria's Salzburger Nachrichten to contemplate the highly-anticipated title showdown between Mercedes' two drivers.\n\nIt's not the Formula One we were all used to. Mark Webber\n\nWebber duly gave his answer, but completed his comments with: \"I have to say, there are more important things in Formula One at the moment.\n\n\"I'm talking about the state ... the prosperity of the entire sport.\"\n\nA tumultuous time for F1\n\nIndeed, it is a tumultuous time for F1, with backmarkers going out of business and the next-smallest teams fighting viciously over income and power.\n\nWebber thinks the sport also took a sharp turn with its new regulations this year.\n\n\"Look at Kimi (Raikkonen),\" he said. \"This is not racing. If you could drive the cars hard at the limit, he would be there. One fastest lap after the next.\n\n\"He's completely frustrated,\" said Webber, referring to the Finn who has struggled notably alongside Ferrari teammate Fernando Alonso in 2014.\n\n\"I also found Bernie Ecclestone saying he doesn't need a young audience in Formula One very, very interesting,\" he added.\n\nNot impressed\n\nF1 will, however, have a 17-year-old on the grid next year.

The probability of failure was much greater.\n\n\"Now it's almost embarrassing when an F1 car comes out of the pits. It's like a slightly stronger GP2; it's not the Formula One we were all used to,\" said Webber.\n\nNot missing F1\n\nHe said he does not particularly miss the highest category of open-wheeler racing.\n\n\"It's been a few months since I watched an entire race on TV,\" Webber admitted.\n\n\"After Brazil I was in a car listening to the radio, and 85 per cent of what they were talking about was the tyres. It's frustrating not only for the drivers but for the fans.\n\n\"DRS is embarrassing,\" he added. \"It's so different to the mid-2000s. I think the development of the last three or four years did the fans no favours.\n\n\"Four pitstops, what's that about?

  "latent_17118": "After more than 20 years and nearly 500 episodes, the Simpsons have seen and done just about anything you can think of ( much to the chagrin of the 'South Park' kids).\n\nIn fact, in their ongoing quest to make fun of anything and everything, our favorite Springfield residents have occasionally managed to predict the future . Here are just a few surprising examples.\n\n'The Three Musketeers 3D'\n\nBefore director Paul W.S. Anderson decided to film the adventures of Alexandre Dumas' famous heroes in 3D, 'The Simpsons' imagined ' The Poke of Zorro ,' in which the musketeers end up on the wrong end of the masked bandit's trusty blade.\n\nFarmville\n\nParents, do you struggle to get your kids to mow the lawn, only to watch in exasperation as they devote countless hours to virtual manual labor in online simulator games? Marge Simpson felt your pain in the 1998 episode 'Bart Carny,' when the carnival comes to Springfield -- complete with the very popular Yard Work Simulator attraction.\n\nIt all seemed pretty ridiculous in the '90s, even during the Tamagotchi era, but if there's one thing the last decade has taught us, it's that there's no task too menial for people to enjoy ... as long as they get to sit in front of a screen while they're doing it.\n\nThe 9/11 attacks\n\nBelieve it or not, there really are people who think the Illuminati are sending messages to America through 'The Simpsons.' The most infamous example is this clip from the 'To Surveil with Love' episode, in which a large number nine is shown next to the outlines of the twin towers. Sinister prediction, or simple coincidence? You decide.\n\nOctomom\n\nTen years before Nadya Suleman made headlines for giving birth to a full set of octuplets -- and publicly dealing with all the headaches that eight babies bring -- 'The Simpsons' imagined a similar situation for Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon, the wife of kindly convenience store owner Apu.\n\nIn the episode 'Eight Misbehavin',' Apu and Manjula use fertility drugs to add the pitter-patter of little feet to their home, only to end up with a whole lot more than they bargained for. Adding insult to injury, a couple in nearby Shelbyville soon gives birth to nine babies, bringing an end to the shower of gifts that the Nahasapeemapetilons had been counting on to help pay for their brood.\n\nOf course, the real-life Octomom never agreed to sell her kids to an unscrupulous zoo owner, but the rest of the episode does contain some eerily prescient gags -- and, as a bonus, it ends with Homer being attacked by snakes.\n\nThe Nintendo Wii, Microsoft Kinect and Sony PlayStation Move\n\nWay back in 1995, 'The Simpsons' time-traveled 15 years into the future for 'Lisa's Wedding,' an episode that imagined what life might look like for the grown-up Simpsons kids as Lisa prepares to walk down the aisle. (Who could have guessed that everyone in the family would be exactly the same age in 2010? Ah, the irony.)\n\nThe episode included a long list of predictions , but one of the most interesting was glimpsed in a throwaway bit about Bart playing video games with a friend. Envisioned as a sort of hybrid between current motion-controlled games and '90s \"virtual\" systems like the Nintendo Virtual Boy , the gaming technology dreamed up by 'The Simpsons' writers looked pretty fantastical in the mid '90s. Today, of course, we can hack our Kinects to do things no sci-fi writer would have dared dream -- but this is still pretty impressive.\n\nIt looked like we might lose 'The Simpsons' a few weeks ago , but now that they're sticking around for at least two more years, we should be able to get at least a couple more future predictions out of them. What will they think of next?",
  "latent_17167": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced a new policy to pare back congressional leaders’ ability to delay removals of illegal aliens, according to a letter obtained Monday by Breitbart News.\n\nStays of removal are frequently issued to aliens otherwise slated for deportation when members of Congress introduce “private bills” to individually grant those aliens permanent legal status. While these bills rarely come to a vote and are even more rarely passed, ICE previously granted aliens stays of removal as a matter of course, while the bills are formally under consideration — a policy that can allow otherwise removable persons to remain in the United States for months if not years.\n\nLiberal members of Congress like Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO), Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA), and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) have resorted to introducing these private bills to prevent deportations when the regular administrative process is exhausted.\n\nIn light of President Donald Trump’s executive order to place new emphasis on the deportation of aliens convicted of crimes, ICE has reevaluated this policy, according to the letter sent to congressional leaders Friday.\n\nFrom now on, stays of removal will only be issued when specially requested by the chairs the House and Senate Judiciary Committees or the relevant subcommittees. In the current Congress, all these posts are held by Republicans.\n\nEven when specifically requested, stays will now be granted only once for no more than six months with the potential for 90-day extensions at the discretion of the Director of ICE, currently Acting Director Thomas Homan. Stays will also be eligible for revocation if ICE discovers damning information about aliens slated for removal after a stay is issued.\n\nThis new ICE policy may remove one the most potent weapons used by opponents of the Trump administration’s new direction on immigration enforcement. A Capitol Hill source who was apprised of the policy change also expressed hope that, by decreasing the possibility of congressional interference, it would help ensure the efficient functioning of lawful immigration adjudication.\n\nOver 950,000 aliens have pending removal orders against them as of last May, according to now-Acting ICE Director Homan’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Only about 300 federal immigration judges, who are part of the Department of Justice, are working through this backlog, although the Trump administration has pledged to rapidly expand this number. Fewer stays second guessing these judges’ orders, which are enforced by ICE, part of the Department of Homeland Security, may help to overcome this still-expanding logjam in the country’s immigration dockets.",

Other board members are the defense minister, deputy chief of the military general staff, undersecretary to the defense minister and SSM’s undersecretary.\n\nSome of the Turkish companies controlled by TSKGV are military electronics specialist Aselsan, Turkey’s largest defense company; Turkish Aerospace Industries; Tusas Engine Industries; missile-maker Roketsan; and military software specialist Havelsan. All of these companies are considered top defense companies in Turkey.\n\nA senior government official from Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party said the decree reflects the president’s notorious interest in the defense industry and indigenous programs.\n\n“It is not a secret that our president views many of our indigenous programs as his pet projects,” he said. “It is not surprising that he has officially taken charge of these programs, as the April referendum gave him the authority to act as an executive president.”\n\nSome industry sources think the new decree will not change much in the way Turkish programs are run.\n\n“The decree only formalizes a de facto situation in which Erdogan was the procurement boss,” a Western company’s Turkey executive said. “From our point of view, there will not be much change.”\n\nOther industry sources expect the decree to boost Erdogan’s involvement in procurement and programs.\n\n“It is true that there was a de facto situation before the decree. But that was an anomaly, legally speaking. Now that that situation is de jure, I think the president will feel more liberty to personally administer critical decisions, especially in milestone programs,” an Ankara-based industry official said.\n\n“This will further centralize decision-making in the Turkish system,” according to a London-based Turkey specialist. “With the procurement and military bureaucracy weakened, the president will run a one-man show.”\n\nHowever, the government official disagreed. “The president’s decisions on major programs, local or international, will be based on skilfully crafted input and deliberations coming from the procurement and military bureaucracies, sometimes even from the Foreign [Affairs] Ministry,” he said.\n\nErdogan’s interest in defense procurement and indigenous programs is not new. In 2014, a draft bill empowered then-Prime Minister Erdogan to extend the terms of top brass. The bill meant that the annual reshuffle in top brass underscored a visible shift in power from the generals to civilians in controlling defense procurement.\n\nIn the 1990s, Turkish generals had the upper hand in procurement decisions. Since Erdogan rose to power in 2002, the military’s role in politics and procurement has significantly diminished.",

  "latent_17300": "Two summers ago I bled out on a bare mattress in a foreclosed home in Miami. I’d been sick. I’d seen a doctor but, as an American without health insurance, I’d been able to afford only the diagnosis—not the solution. I went back to work.\n\nEvery week I stuck my tips in a jar. I took a lot of Advil. I went through the phone book and called doctors. Visited strip malls. I wondered if anyone would maybe put me on a payment plan; they wouldn’t. I wondered if maybe I could get a credit card; I couldn’t. I kept taking Advil. I kept visiting strip malls.\n\nI found a doctor who would work on me. His clinic was the size of a Chinese take-out and nestled between a massage parlor and a bail bonds. I paid him straight cash. I recognized the situation as less than ideal, but the pain had made me desperate. So we rented a space. He gashed me good. I woke up in bandages and hopped in my car. He hadn’t told me not to drive.\n\nWhen I got home the wound tore open, tore near the vein, I guess, and that was that. I lay on my bed for a while, stunned like those stupid deer. Frozen like every non-hero in every movie. The bandages slicked off like debris in a flood, and I pawed ineffectually at the dangling bundle, convinced everything would be safe again if only it would come back. I started shaking.\n\nI took steps toward the bathroom. There was wetness down my legs, big red footprints on the tile. I saw the wound in the mirror, the black-almost-purple mat of my hair, the three of me staring back. Spinning. I dry heaved into the toilet; I didn’t want to make a mess. My fingers slipped into the bowl at some point and I thought, gross.\n\nI think I\n\nI don’t know\n\nThere’s so much blood; they’ll say that at the hospital later. I’ll think that nurses shouldn’t say that. But right now, there’s so much blood. The floors. It drips from the mattress through the futon. Totally saturated. There’re fat streaks where I crawled. Handprints on the walls. I think, this is like that scene from Dexter, and I get upset with myself for thinking about a popcorn cop drama – that my last thoughts might be of a popcorn cop drama.\n\nI’ve always had a thing with last words. When I was younger my father fell five stories on a job site, right down an open sewer valve, right on his head into four feet of shit. The fall didn’t kill him, just knocked him out and fucked him up, left him unconscious and drowning in a tube full of shit. You know what he said on his way down?\n\n“Shit!”\n\nI always told myself I’d do better. The blood matted my eyelashes. Burned. Blurred everything. I felt around for my phone: one of the old flip ones, fat like a football—pre-RAZR. I squint out a slow 9-1-1. I know I’ll be recorded and I’m very conscious of making a good impression.\n\nEspecially if…\n\nI imagine people at home watching the local news. I wonder if maybe I’ll be on the local news. The tapes. My picture. The blue background and the scrolling text.\n\n“There’s a good amount of bleeding coming from a pretty large gash here.” They ask for my address. I tell them. I try to put bass in my voice. “I normally wouldn’t call, you know, and distract from people with real emergencies, but, I just think this is a lot of blood and, also, I think I might go unconscious. Soon. I’m alone.”\n\nI’m alone.\n\nI’m alone.\n\nOh, no.\n\nI’m alone.\n\nI think of old men in recliners shaking their heads. Saying, poor boy.\n\nI really am. I’m going to cry. I’m not going to cry. I can’t cry; I’m awful. This is my fault. Everything is my fault. I was terrible. I was a bad guy. Now I’m paying for it. Bad guy’s supposed to pay for it. Maybe Karma is real. Maybe this is okay. Maybe I’m supposed to die. My head hurts. I can’t stop shaking. I’m cold. There’s static in my veins, out my veins, in pools on the floor. I’m dizzy. I try to sit up but my gut rocks me prone; I see black. I clutch the wound, the gauze, my head, my eyes, rub the gore from my eyes.\n\nI’m alone.\n\nI always told myself I’d do better.\n\nI open the phone and dial Someone from memory. I vomit—nothing dry this time—and the convulsions wrap my periphery in bright, shining stars. I hang up. I try again. Voicemail. I see blurs. I put the phone to my face. I try to breathe big. It hurts. It’s hard. I need air. I want air. I squint at the tiny monochrome screen, want to smudge it clear but I’m finger-painting red. It’s impossible. It’s frustrating. I shout and it hurts, it hurts so badly.\n\nI think I press 96827324368463594663737766184265968.\n\nI think that spells you are a genuinely good person. thank you.\n\nBut maybe it doesn’t. I feel suddenly weightless. Flying. I wonder if this is the whole heaven thing. I very seriously and very intensely hope this is the whole heaven thing. I want to see a white light but it’s all yellow and red blotches, the taste of tin and salt. My head floats off my body. The world is swirls. My phone is swirls. Far, far in the distance, I hear sirens. I know they are for me. I think of the people driving; they are for me, too. The world fades in and out. I rub my face. I’m sleepy. My phone doesn’t ring. Maybe I didn’t send the text. Maybe it was full of typos. How embarrassing that my last words could be full of typos. I wish I had autocorrect. I wish I had an iPhone.\n\nI wish my phone would ring.\n\nI promise I’ll do better.\n\nAnd there’s a knock, but I’m gone.",
  "latent_17332": "1. Roberto Matta\n\nRoberto Matta is a twentieth century surrealist and abstract expressionist. His work seems to contain recognizable forms such as fireworks and onion heads, and possibly even staircases and architectural forms. At closer examination, the viewer realizes his work is composed of unrecognizable features such as lines, complimentary colors, a trail of mossy greens, and the occasional inclusion of yellow.\n\n2. Robert Venosa\n\nRobert Venosa is an artist that I was first introduced to by seeing a Facebook post of Alex Grey, mentioning his death in 2011. His work caught my eye with its liquidity, and vibrant blues. It’s almost as if he is channeling extraterrestrial beings that contain benevolence, housed in a shiny membrane with light piercing through its translucence. Venosa’s work gives a new aesthetic to angels, and his work encourages viewers to be transported to another world.\n\n3. Max Ernst\n\nMax Ernst is a surrealist artist that made friends with major players in the art world such as Peggy Guggenheim and Andre Breton in the early twentieth century. Ernst has the ability to create magnificent landscapes that remind us of something from dreams, but not quite nightmares. He conveys organic matter covering seemingly vast surfaces. Ernst uses vibrant colors such as algae green, and a sandy yellow, creating the illusion of real vegetation on some alternate alien planet. There’s visibility of bodies and shadows of anatomical sculptural protrusions in his cavernous painted structures. He influenced the surrealist movement greatly, and made an appearance in the Museum of Modern Art in 1936.\n\n4. Aurel Schmidt\n\nAurel Schmidt is a Brooklyn based artist that I discovered at the Museum of Modern Art a few years ago. Her work consists of extremely detailed conglomerations of cigarette butts, mice, snakes, and other things one could find in the streets and apartments of the city life. Her work is the kind that you can look at, and keep on finding new things. Included in this blog is an especially successful piece, in which tiny, creepy, crawling, insects, maggots, rodents, and birds- all of which which eats away at our deceased body, ironically compose a human form that stands tall and alive.\n\n5. H.R. Giger\n\nH. R. Giger can be recognized from his set design work of the movie Alien and the Matrix, with his signature “bio-mechanical” style. To any aspiring surrealist, Giger will point you in the direction that helps you bridge the organic with the artificial. He merges the machine with the human anatomy, combining imagery of needles, ridges, chains, phalluses, and flesh to create something visceral and complex. His work feels cold and post-apocolyptic, bringing us into a world that we are both afraid of and intrigued by.\n\n6. Dorthea Tanning\n\nDorothea Tanning was 101 when she died in 2012, leaving a life and legacy of surrealism behind her. This painting is from the 1960s, and it is that decade, and the late 1950s that her work had an especially ambiguous, ambient, and yet anatomical aesthetic to it. She made extraordinary friends in her lifetime including Robert Motherwell, husband Max Ernst, and Man Ray. Her work is whimsical, and this painting is reminiscent of cumulonimbus clouds one would stare up at during a Summer day dreaming of figures lost in our memory.\n\n7. Andre Breton\n\nAndre Breton is known as the founder of surrealism because he wrote the surrealism manifesto in 1924. This painting describes the revolution of the mind, as one climbs into their unconscious, there is so much wonder and complexity he or she can discover.\n\n8. Isaac Abrams\n\nIsaac Abrams founded the first psychedelic art gallery in the world in NYC in the 1960s. I spoke to Isaac on the phone not too long ago, and he told me “God helps those who help themselves. He has shown in the Tate museum twice, and the Whitney Museum twice as well. His work involves intricacies of vibrant patterns, and he has a keen ability to push and pull colors using oil color paint. He is not limited to only paint, as he draws frequently. He is extremely prolific, and he has a major amount of paintings in his studio in upstate NY. He is alive, and still working very hard; if you are interested in one of his painting, you should contact him through his website.\n\n9. Zdzislaw Beksinski\n\nZdzislaw Beksinski painted haunting oil color paintings that he surprisingly found quite humorous. He was a European painter, and his oeuvre is filled with nightmarish scenes of figures without faces, dream-like landscapes, and creatures from the depths of his mind. Unfortunately, at the end of his life, he was stabbed to death, which marked a series of tragic events towards his final years. Beksinski had the ability to pull us into a surreal plane of existence without never having been academically trained.\n\n10. James Roper\n\nJames Roper is an artist that works mostly with acrylic on canvas, although he can work in multiple mediums, including sculpture. His work is explosive, and works brilliantly with tone, as he has gray palettes colliding next vibrant primary colors. His work seems to be the result of Greek Gods throwing thunderbolts at one another in a hurricane of action and propulsion. He has mastered creating folds in fabric by using a limited color palette, not too hasty on gradations. His work employs compositions with centrifugal force.\n\nWritten by Andrew Kaminski",
  "latent_17335": "11 Pages Posted: 3 Apr 2011\n\nDate Written: December 1, 2010\n\nAbstract\n\nFree Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) is characterised by a specific programming and development paradigm. The availability and freedom of use of source code are at the core of this paradigm, and are the prerequisites for FLOSS features. Unfortunately, the fundamental role of code is often ignored among those who decide the software purchases for Canadian public agencies. Source code availability and the connected freedoms are often seen as unrelated and accidental aspects, and the only real advantage acknowledged, which is the absence of royalty fees, becomes paramount. In this paper we discuss some relevant legal issues and explain why public administrations should choose FLOSS for their technological infrastructure. We also present the results of a survey regarding the penetration and awareness of FLOSS usage into the Government of Canada. The data demonstrates that the Government of Canada shows no enforced policy regarding the implementation of a specific technological framework (which has legal, economic, business, and ethical repercussions) in their departments and agencies.",
  "latent_17359": "The Red Sox have had a difficult time finding something to do with Allen Craig. Well, besides sticking him in Triple-A and trying to forget about him until he gets a spring training invite, anyway. They just don't have the room on the big-league roster for Craig, no matter what he hits in spring training, and keeping him off the 40-man roster has allowed them to avoid having his contract count against the luxury tax.\n\nAn opportunity to move Craig -- and at least part of his salary -- might have opened up on Tuesday, however. White Sox first baseman Adam LaRoche announced that he would \"step away\" from baseball, presumably setting him up for retirement. LaRoche, who has been in the league for 12 years, struggled in 2015 after signing a two-year deal with Chicago, and he's had a rough spring in limited duty this year. Like Ryan Dempster with the Red Sox a couple years back, LaRoche might have just decided it's time regardless of the money left on his contract.\n\nSo, the White Sox are suddenly in need of a first baseman. They can shift Jose Abreu there, which would mean they are only in need of a DH -- that would open them up to additional options, including an in-house one in Avisail Garcia. Garcia -- whom the White Sox acquired in the three-way deal that brought Boston Jake Peavy back in 2013 -- has struggled in the majors but has performed well this spring. The latter likely means little, though, he was a prospect of some regard not that long ago, so it's entirely possible that Chicago is still searching for alternatives, or, at least, a backup plan.\n\nA look at the remaining free agents at first base is a disheartening one. Jeff Baker is a utility player who can't hit. Corey Hart was last productive in 2012, and now he's 34 and coming off of years of injury issues. Justin Morneau has the highest ceiling, but he also has a history of concussions and their lingering effects that have brought the career of the former MVP to a halt. Morneau played in just 49 games last summer, and even though there is a serious lack of first baseman out there, he's still a free agent just weeks from Opening Day.\n\nThe list of players who could pop in at designated hitter, keeping Abreu at first, aren't much better. Delmon Young once again looks like an off-the-field issue waiting to happen, and as for on-the-field, he's the short side of a platoon, anyway. Marlon Byrd is clearly on the downswing at 38. Alex Rios, David DeJesus, Grady Sizemore? Yeah, just give Garcia a shot instead.\n\nThat's where the Red Sox can come in, though. Craig is owed $9 million in 2016 and $11 million in 2017, plus a $1 million buyout on his $13 million 2018 option. LaRoche was set to make $13 million in 2016 before becoming a free agent, so there is room for Craig in the White Sox budget already -- if Boston packaged Craig along with some cash, the price would be even more palatable for Chicago.\n\nWe can't just ignore that Craig was a mess in the majors in 2015, but he also played just 36 games while accruing 88 plate appearances. Life as a pinch-hitter or late-game replacement is tough, especially for a player trying to get things going again. Craig is unlikely to be the player he was with the Cardinals ever again -- he'll be 31 and his last productive season came in 2013 before his foot injury -- but he's still potentially worth a look by a White Sox team who, again, is considering Avisail Garcia as their starting DH, the same Garcia that fans could not wait to see replaced by a free agent just a few weeks ago.\n\nCraig still seems to be able to make contact and get on base -- at least, against minor-league opponents -- but the power just hasn't been there. Maybe he just needs a change of scenery, or a fresh set of coach's eyes, or the opportunity to stick somewhere besides a team that rides around on a bus during road trips. If Boston were to front enough of Craig's money -- say, half of Craig's 2017 salary along with the cost of the 2018 buyout, for a total of $6.5 million or so -- the White Sox might be interested in taking a chance on him. After all, Craig costs less than LaRoche for 2016, and in 2017, they'd only be on the hook for $5.5 million regardless of what Craig is for them, or if he's even still on the roster.\n\nWhat would Boston get back? Honestly, you can't expect much of anything -- this would mostly be to clear a roster space at Triple-A Pawtucket so that players who need the time -- like Sam Travis, Bryce Brentz, and so on -- get it. It would save them some cash, too, which isn't nothing: sure, Craig doesn't count against the luxury tax, but the $21 million remaining to him is still real money, and its presence might keep Red Sox ownership from feeling like they can push over the tax threshold to certain degrees.\n\nTrading Craig would cut into Boston's depth at first base, but not really. Travis Shaw already passed him on the depth chart, and will likely win a job on the bench this year, one that seems him play often to spell Hanley Ramire and Pablo Sandoval, one that will give him a shot to start at first base in 2017 if he continues to hit. After Shaw is Sam Travis, who is not major-league ready, but could be by 2017, which would mean just one more obstacle for Craig to clear.\n\nBoston has no real need for Craig, who at this point is just taking up a spot on Pawtucket's roster but getting paid more than the rest of his teammates combined to do so. The White Sox are in a position to take a chance on a Craig rebound, with the hope that a more stable role, a return to the majors, and a change of scenery could bring back at least some of the old slugger. It's not a deal that needs to happen now -- Avisail Garcia should get a chance to become the player it was expected he'd be -- but it's something to keep in mind as 2016 rolls on.",

  "latent_17380": "Is the 'Bombardier for Western, Siemens for Central' decision unfair on the 40-odd lakh people who use CR's suburban line everyday? Opinion on this is divided, but a large number of railway officials believe the vast expanse of CR's suburban network requires the best of technology and, everytime a new train is introduced, CR should be a recipient. dna takes a look at what all makes up the debate.\n\nThe height of the problemAs highlighted by dna earlier, the height of the Bombardier rake is more than the other makes. This meant that there would have been a problem running them at places on CR's mainline network where the bridges have not been raised even after the conversion of CR's electricals from 1,500-volt Direct Current to 25,000-volt Alternating Current. However, with the Integral Coach Factory, which builds these rakes, having reduced the height of Bombardier ones, the rakes at a height of 4,257 millimetres are actually lower than the Siemens ones at 4,276mm.\n\n\"It is perfectly safe to run Bombardier on CR and, in fact, in places where there are height restrictions due to lower overhead wires or low bridges, the Bombardier might be a better option,\" said a top-ranking ICF official.\n\nWhy CR isn't getting the Bombardier rakeAccording to sources, the decision to keep Bombardier rakes away from CR's suburban network was taken by a team led by current general manager SK Sood in order to avoid duplication of inventory and spares, and, in the process, save the railways money. It also puts less pressure on motormen to learn two types of controls. However, the move has its detractors. \"CR suburban is among the biggest in the world and can manage to have different kinds of rakes in its fleet. It just robs CR and, in turn, the commuters of having trains of different technologies. Why should CR always get hand-me-downs from Western Railway?\" asked a senior CR official.\n\nThe original Railway Board decision taken in 2010 was that of the 72 Bombardier rakes that would be made for Mumbai, 38.5 (38 rakes and 6 coaches) would be given to CR, and the rest to WR.\n\nIsolation might not be a good ideaThe officials opposed to this 'no Bombardier for CR' diktat point out that isolation of this kind — Siemens for CR and Bombardier for WR — might not be a good idea. During the Diva agitation of January 2, when protesters extensively damaged 10 Siemens rakes, CR had to send an SOS to WR for spares. dna had front-paged the issue in its January 3 edition.\n\n\"This SOS saved CR as the damaged rakes could be put back into service within a few hours. Imagine if there was complete isolation. CR would have had to approach the ICF in Chennai and the whole process would have taken a few days, a luxury we do not have on Mumbai suburban,\" said the official.\n\nThe old trains begin to hurtWhile CR's fleet of 58 Siemens rakes are managing to run at an average speed of 97kmph on some stretches on the fast line between Kurla and Thane and over 100kmph beyond Kalyan, its fleet of 32 older trains are running at a maximum speed of 80kmph. Of these 32 rakes, 10 are BHEL makes, nine are retrofitted trains than can run on both DC and AC, and 13 are retrofitted AC rakes. \"These older rakes are just not being able to match the speed requirements of the suburban system and that is affecting the entire schedule. People are suffering,\" said an official.",
  "latent_17397": "No new nuclear or coal plants may ever be needed in the United States, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said today.\n\n\"We may not need any, ever,\" Jon Wellinghoff told reporters at a U.S. Energy Association forum.\n\nThe FERC chairman's comments go beyond those of other Obama administration officials, who have strongly endorsed greater efficiency and renewables deployment but also say nuclear and fossil energies will continue playing a major role.\n\nWellinghoff's view also goes beyond the consensus outlook in the electric power industry about future sources of electricity. The industry has assumed that more baseload generation would provide part of an increasing demand for power, along with a rapid deployment of renewable generation, smart grid technologies and demand reduction strategies.\n\nJay Apt, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Electricity Industry Center, expressed skepticism about the feasibility of relying so heavily on renewable energy. \"I don't think we're where Chairman Wellinghoff would like us to be,\" Apt said. \"You need firm power to fill in when the wind doesn't blow. There is just no getting around that.\"\n\nSome combination of more gas- or coal-fired generation, or nuclear power, will be needed, he said. \"Demand response can provide a significant buffering of the power fluctuations coming from wind. Interacting widely scattered wind farms cannot provide smooth power.\"\n\nWellinghoff said renewables like wind, solar and biomass will provide enough energy to meet baseload capacity and future energy demands. Nuclear and coal plants are too expensive, he added.\n\n\"I think baseload capacity is going to become an anachronism,\" he said. \"Baseload capacity really used to only mean in an economic dispatch, which you dispatch first, what would be the cheapest thing to do. Well, ultimately wind's going to be the cheapest thing to do, so you'll dispatch that first.\"\n\nHe added, \"People talk about, 'Oh, we need baseload.' It's like people saying we need more computing power, we need mainframes. We don't need mainframes, we have distributed computing.\"\n\nThe technology for renewable energies has come far enough to allow his vision to move forward, he said. For instance, there are systems now available for concentrated solar plants that can provide 15 hours of storage.\n\n\"What you have to do, is you have to be able to shape it,\" he added. \"And if you can shape wind and you can effectively get capacity available for you for all your loads.\n\n\"So if you can shape your renewables, you don't need fossil fuel or nuclear plants to run all the time. And, in fact, most plants running all the time in your system are an impediment because they're very inflexible. You can't ramp up and ramp down a nuclear plant. And if you have instead the ability to ramp up and ramp down loads in ways that can shape the entire system, then the old concept of baseload becomes an anachronism.\"\n\n'A lot that is still not understood'\n\nAsked whether his ideas need detailed studies, given the complexity of the grid, Wellinghoff said the technology is already moving that way.\n\n\"I think it's being settled by the digital grid moving forward,\" he said. \"We are going to have to go to a smart grid to get to this point I'm talking about. But if we don't go to that digital grid, we're not going to be able to move these renewables, anyway. So it's all going to be an integral part of operating that grid efficiently.\"\n\nIn response to Wellinghoff's comments, James Owens, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, an association of shareholder-owned utilities, issued this statement: “While our industry is making very major strides in expanding energy efficiency and the use of renewables, we’ll still have to add new baseload generation capacity to help meet the growth in demand for electricity. As we intensify the transition to a low-carbon future, we will need to have all generation options on the table, including advanced new nuclear, advanced clean coal with carbon capture and storage, as well as natural gas.”\n\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corp. reported last week on challenges in integrating a twentyfold expansion of renewable power into the nation's electricity networks but did not specifically address whether additional baseload generation would be needed. A spokesperson for NERC did not have an immediate response to Wellinghoff's comments.\n\nRevis James, who directs energy technology assessment for the Electric Power Research Institute, said recently that it is not clear how fast renewable energy can be added without creating reliability issues. \"No one knows what the magic number is,\" he said. \"Are we moving too fast? On the policymakers' side, there's a lot that is not still understood about the implications of a large share of renewables.\"\n\nImpact on nuclear power\n\nWellinghoff's statement – if it reflects Obama administration policy – would be a huge blow to the U.S. nuclear power industry, which has been hoping for a nuclear \"renaissance\" based on the capacity of nuclear reactors to generate power without greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nCongress created significant financial incentives to encourage the construction of perhaps a half-dozen nuclear plants with innovative designs, and Energy Secretary Steven Chu has promised Congress to accelerate awards of federal loan guarantees for some of these proposals.\n\nBut a major expansion in U.S. nuclear energy would require a high effective tax on carbon emissions from coal plants, or an extended loan guarantee and tax incentive policy, according to the Congressional Research Service and outside consultants. The leading energy bills before Congress do not provide more loan guarantees.\n\n\"If expansion of nuclear plants is the nation's policy, then Congress has to recognize that the U.S. energy companies cannot afford to do this alone,\" said Paul Genoa, policy director for the Nuclear Energy Institute, in a recent interview.\n\n\"The president needs to show his cards on nuclear energy,\" said energy consultant Joseph Stanislaw, a Duke University professor. \"He cannot keep this industry, which must make investments with a 50-year or longer horizon, in limbo for much longer.\"\n\n\"I think [new nuclear expansion] is kind of a theoretical question, because I don't see anybody building these things, I don't see anybody having one under construction,\" Wellington said.\n\nBuilding nuclear plants is cost-prohibitive, he said, adding that the last price he saw was more than $7,000 a kilowatt – more expensive than solar energy. \"Until costs get to some reasonable cost, I don't think anybody's going to [talk] that seriously,\" he said. \"Coal plants are sort of in the same boat, they're not quite as expensive.\"\n\nCan renewables meet demand?\n\nThere's enough renewable energy to meet energy demand, Wellinghoff said. \"There's 500 to 700 gigawatts of developable wind throughout the Midwest, all the way to Texas. There's probably another 200 to 300 gigawatts in Montana and Wyoming that can go West.\"\n\nHe also cited tremendous solar power in the Southwest and hydrokinetic and biomass energy, and said the United States can reduce energy usage by 50 percent. \"You combine all those things together ... I think we have great resources in this country, and we just need to start using them,\" he said.\n\nProblems with unsteady power generation from wind will be overcome, he said.\n\n\"That's exactly what all the load response will do, the load response will provide that leveling ability, number one,\" he said. \"Number two, if you have wide interconnections across the entire interconnect, you're going to have a lot of diversity with that wind. Not all the wind is going to stop at once. You'll have some of it stop, some of it start, and all of that diversity is going to help you, as well.\"\n\nPush for grid modifications\n\nBut planning for modifying the grid to integrate renewables must take place in the next three to five years, he said.\n\n\"If we don't do that, then we miss the boat, \"Wellinghoff said. \"That planning has to take place so you don't strand a lot of assets, a lot of supply assets.\"\n\nUnlike coal and nuclear, natural gas will continue to play a role in generating electricity, he said.\n\n\"Natural gas is going to be there for a while, because it's going to be there to get us through this transition that's going to take 30 or more years.\"\n\nChu reiterated before the House Energy and Commerce Committee today that he supports loan guarantees for new nuclear power plants and is working with the White House on the issue.\n\n\"I believe nuclear power has to be part of the energy mix in this century,\" Chu said.\n\nChu also noted today that nuclear technology, along with renewables, is an area where the United States has lost its lead. \"We are trying to start the American nuclear industry again,\" he said.\n\nCoal currently provides half of U.S. power, while nuclear energy accounts for about 20 percent.\n\nSenior reporter Ben Geman contributed.\n\nReprinted from Greenwire with permission from Environment & Energy Publishing, LLC. www.eenews.net, 202-628-6500",

And yet our ideas of this place and time are also caught in a bit of fantastic nostalgia. In memory it becomes an erotic theme park, a quaint corner of New York City history. Sometimes its stark everyday reality is forgotten.\n\nIn this show we focus on a couple of Times Square’s most notorious streets from the period — 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue — and provide historical context for the seediness they were known for in this era.\n\nThose glowing marquees disguise a theatrical history that dates from the beginning of Times Square, once hosting productions by the likes of Florenz Ziegfeld and Oscar Hammerstein.

  "latent_17485": "Allison Jones, The Canadian Press\n\nTORONTO -- Ontario is envisioning a future in which millions of electric vehicles are on the roads, but analysts predict consumer uptake will remain far off the government target for 2020, despite tens of millions of dollars in subsidies.\n\nThe Liberal government has been encouraging electric vehicle sales by doling out $75 million in rebates to vehicle owners, offering various other incentives and programs, installing a network of charging stations and spending $1 million to open an electric vehicle education centre.\n\nBut that so far hasn't translated into vast numbers of vehicles. The official data for 2017 isn't yet available, but at the end of last year, electric vehicles represented less than one per cent of all passenger vehicle sales in Ontario.\n\nIn just two years, by 2020, the government hopes to see that number increase to five per cent.\n\nIt can't be done, analysts say.\n\n\"The chances of meeting it aren't low, they're zero,\" said auto industry analyst Dennis DesRosiers. \"In the auto sector all roads lead to electric, it just happens to be that the road to serious acceptance of them is probably at least 2030 and more likely 2040, 2050.\"\n\nTony Faria, an auto industry analyst at the University of Windsor, agrees that Ontario won't meet its goal by 2020.\n\n\"We will almost assuredly get to five per cent electric vehicles purchased or on the road at some point in time, it's just not going to be in the next couple of years,\" he said. \"We're really wedded to our gasoline-driven vehicles because of the flexibility they give us distance wise, amazing availability of where you can fill up and so on.\"\n\nRange anxiety -- a fear that an electric vehicle would run out of charge somewhere far from a charging station -- is cited by analysts, the industry and government as one of the main reasons more people haven't yet switched to electric vehicles.\n\nThe government announced in July 2016 that it would spend $20 million to build a network of 500 public charging stations along highways and at public places across the province by March 31, 2017.\n\nBut now, more than eight months after that self-imposed deadline, just two-thirds of the stations are in use.\n\nTransportation Minister Steven Del Duca said that timeline was \"ambitious\" and there have been challenges around the locations of some of the chargers, permits and construction delays, but he still believes the target can be met.\n\n\"We see what the numbers are currently, but again when you look at not only the demand we've seen over the last few months, but the forecasted demand for the next three or four years we do see and certainly do predict fairly sharp increases in people's appetite for (electric) vehicles,\" he said.\n\nIt takes time to get people to change their behaviours, Del Duca said.\n\n\"People get very comfortable in their patterns, both as commuters and when they're making their product selections when they're looking at cars,\" he said. \"I think there was always going to be the need for some time for a cultural shift.\"\n\nFleetCarma, a company that promotes electric vehicles, reports on quarterly sales numbers and found that in Ontario those numbers are up 96 per cent year-over-year for the first nine months of 2017.\n\nIn the second quarter, they reported electric vehicle sales represented about 0.7 per cent of the market.\n\n\"While these numbers may seem small compared to the total number of auto sales the thing to take note of here is the trajectory of the numbers,\" they wrote.\n\nThe president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association said those numbers bode well and he believes there is a good chance of hitting the five per cent target in 2020. The industry itself is doing a lot to encourage sales, but for now the market demand is still very small and manufacturers are losing money on their production, said Mark Nantais.\n\n\"There's a good deal of literature out there by independent parties to suggest that at this point in time vehicle manufacturers are losing anywhere from $10,000 to $14,000 per vehicle,\" he said.\n\nThat will change over time as demand increases, he said.\n\n\"Sometimes we proceed with costly technologies that -- while we might be losing money on them -- we ultimately think that the market will improve, that the number of vehicles will increase, that the cost of the technology will come down,\" Nantais said.\n\nTo increase sales, the government offers rebates of up to $14,000 for electric vehicles that cost up to $150,000.\n\nIn order to encourage customers to choose electric vehicles, auto dealers will often give buyers the rebate out of their own funds, but that has left some out hundreds of thousands of dollars, they say.\n\nFrank Notte, with the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association, said many dealers are waiting up to five or six months for the government to reimburse them. One dealer is owed more than $400,000, he said, and GM dealers in the Greater Toronto Area alone are owed about $2.3 million.\n\nThe Ministry of Transportation wouldn't confirm those numbers, but said it is working to streamline the process so dealers can get reimbursed more quickly.\n\nThe province has also put $1 million toward the Plug'n Drive Electric Vehicle Discovery Centre in northern Toronto, where people can learn about and test drive electric vehicles. The centre said it has seen 1,600 test drives with more than 4,000 visitors since it opened this spring.",
  "latent_17486": "Islam law prohibits Muslims from taking interest-bearing loans, which gives them limited options for moving funds. However, bitcoin could be a form of micro-financing that is approved or “halal” in Islam since the cryptocurrency doesn’t incur interest.\n\nMatthew Joseph Martin, a 30-year-old developer who has previously worked with finance technology start-ups Boku and Xoom, came up with a bitcoin-based service for the Muslim market by providing micro-financing in Indonesia.\n\nLoans Based on Bitcoin\n\n“I was running a small business on the side and I had a cash flow issue. Some of my non-Muslim advisors suggested to just get a loan, but I knew interest-based loans are not allowed in Islam. So I started researching Sharia finance,” Martin shared. “After understanding what Islam advocates as a mode of financing, I started researching what exists in the market today.”\n\nHe found that there are over 220 million Muslims in Indonesia, mostly without any access to any kind of micro-financing that is approved under Islam. He noted that only 8% of financial products in Indonesia are compliant with the religion’s laws and that a micro-lending service based on bitcoin and profit-sharing could be a workaround.\n\n“I realized this unserved need is a huge problem that needs to be solved. My background is in financial technology doing payments and remittance, so my experience building similar products was really an asset to help solve the problem,” Martin said.\n\nHis service called Blossom was launched in late 2014 and it works by collecting money from several individual investors then investing it in a profit-sharing model. Investors make money by collecting a share of the profit from the businesses that their investment helped to create and grow. The cryptocurrency bitcoin is used by Blossom to move money electronically, allowing for fast, verified, and safe money transfer. Since its launch, Blossom has been able to provide micro-financing to around 200 businesses.",

She was born in 2012 after a brief relationship and is his only child, despite \"silly online rumours\" to the contrary.\n\nIf you search his name on the internet, one of the first suggestions is 'Raheem Sterling four kids'. This, he says, is the public's biggest misconception of him.\n\nHe quips that he actually \"has eight\", but then adds: \"It made people think badly of me, that I'm not really grounded, that I'm out and about doing loads of madness.\"\n\nIt's not the only thing contributing to a bad boy reputation. In May 2013, he had a common assault charge against him dropped after a witness failed to turn up to court.\n\nAnd in September last year, he was found not guilty of assault against a former girlfriend. He knows he's \"made mistakes\" in the past but says he's young and is using those experiences to help him grow up and move on.\n\nBack to those tattoos. On the inside of his biceps are the words 'Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me, through all the pain and suffering'.\n\nIt's clear his mother, Nadine - who he jokes \"thinks she's Jose Mourinho\" - is a constant presence and strength in his life.\n\nSterling says: \"She's a big part of my life - she tries to have too much of a say sometimes! I try to listen to her, because most of what she says is right.\n\n\"My mum thinks she knows her football. She'll certainly tell me when I'm not doing something right.

With several big teams interested in him, he chose Liverpool when he was 15.\n\nCurrent England boss Roy Hodgson gave Sterling his first game in a Liverpool shirt as a 15-year-old in a friendly against Borussia Monchengladbach in 2010, before Kenny Dalglish handed him his senior debut against Wigan in March 2012, aged 17.\n\nThe slight, diminutive boy who was repeatedly knocked off the ball by older players is still the same height - just 5ft 7in - but has \"bulked up a bit\" and Hodgson has made it clear that Sterling is in his World Cup thoughts.\n\n\"He has seen me play and I think he likes the way I play. I'm grateful he's the manager of England,\" Sterling says.\n\n\"He gives me good motivation to do well. He puts his arm around me and gives me little things I can do better at.\"\n\nRaheem Sterling says Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has helped him \"massively\" on and off the pitch\n\nSterling's form for Liverpool since Christmas has been electrifying. He has scored seven goals this season and set up many more. He cites Brendan Rodgers as a huge influence.\n\n\"He's helped me massively,\" Sterling explains. \"Not only with my footballing game but if I need someone to talk to off the field he's there for me. I've got to really give credit to him and thank him a lot.\"\n\nBut while Liverpool's resurgence is a source of pride and excitement in the red half of the city, the players have clearly been briefed not to get carried away.

We all know what the dream is at the end of it.\"\n\nAnd the other dream lies in Brazil. He has Wembley tube station and the stadium tattooed on his crowded arm. They are a reminder of his past and what he describes now as \"the dream that's becoming a reality\", following a man-of-the-match display in the friendly win over Denmark on 5 March.\n\nPassing his old haunts on the team coach to that game, he says had to pinch himself: \"I was looking at the sights thinking: 'I used to play there a couple of years back and now I'm on the coach with the England team.'\"\n\nNicknamed 'Heemio' by his mates for his Brazilian-style flicks and tricks, going to Rio would mean everything.\n\n\"Growing up you watch players like Ronaldinho playing in World Cups, doing the business and you idolise these people,\" he says.\n\n\"To then get called up by England for a World Cup? I don't think there'd be a greater feeling, knowing you could help make the nation proud.\"\n\nWith a future this bright, it's handy he has room on his other arm for all the tattoos that will surely follow.\n\nThe full interview with Raheem Sterling appeared on BBC One's Football Focus on Saturday, 29 March, at 12:00 GMT.",

And they responded with a ton of answers.\n\nTwo names, though, kept coming up, over and over: Texas Tech quarterback signee Jett Duffey and Baylor wide receiver signee Devin Duvernay.\n\nDuffey, a three-star recruit who racked up countless honors as the top player in the Dallas-Fort Worth area this season, was praised for his mobility and his arm, and repeatedly was called a “winner” by the recruiters we polled.\n\n\"I think he fits what Kliff [Kingsbury] and them do on offense perfectly,” one Big 12 coach said. “He's kind of a mini-Patrick Mahomes. A little bit more speed, maybe. He's got instincts and he knows how to move the pieces around on offense. He's a baller.\"\n\nDuvernay is no underdog -– he’s the No. 3 receiver recruit in the country –- but rival coaches still admire that he’s a burner and a perfect fit for the Bears’ offense.\n\n“He can flat fly.

He goes zero to 60 in a heartbeat.”\n\nMany more players earned love from the coaches and staffers we surveyed. Get to know these names:\n\nBaylor CB Parrish Cobb: “We said from the get-go he was a corner who could start as a freshman. I believe it. He’s a boundary corner. Never says a word. Total team guy.”\n\nIowa State TE Dylan Soehner: “A legitimate 6-foot-7, 277 pounds and athletic enough to remain at tight end. I cannot believe Arkansas didn’t recruit him.”\n\nKansas CB Kyle Mayberry: \"He's going to be a really good player. I think he could've flipped somewhere else. He's got the speed you need and the ability to lock people down, which is so important in the Big 12.\"\n\nKansas State QB Skylar Thompson: “I loved him and many others on our staff did, too. He will be a good one.”\n\nOklahoma LB Kapri Doucet: “We thought we’d get him. He’s a good player. Instant impact. He’s the real deal.”\n\nOklahoma State LB Calvin Bundage: “Bundage is really intriguing. He’s long and aggressive. He’s physical, he looks like a Velociraptor and he will strike you.\"\n\nTCU RB Darius Anderson: “Really liked him a ton. He was so explosive in his senior year, and what he did in the state playoffs, they really rode him. Fun to watch.”\n\nTCU WR Isaiah Graham: “He’s going to be special. He has good speed and length.”\n\nTCU RB Sewo Olonilua: “He’s a freaky dude. Can play linebacker, running back ... where are they going to play him?\"\n\nTexas QB Shane Buechele: “Has all the qualities to be a great quarterback, both on and off the field.”\n\nTexas DT Chris Daniels: “Daniels will be a good player.

  "latent_17848": "The first day of VMWorld 2017 was kicked-off with a keynote presentation by Pat Gelsinger, VMware’s CEO, who emphasized that the future is now. “Science fiction is now becoming a fact,” he said, providing examples from quantum entanglement, through zika-resistant mosquitos, to self-driving cars. However, while whole industries have made the obvious tech transitions by employing intelligent tools, Pat mentioned digital advertising as an example, other industries are only 10% of the way there. Many industries still face the inevitable change and there’s still much work to be done when it comes to digital transformation, and huge opportunities at the enterprise level.\n\nVMware’s vision can easily be portrayed as essentially digital transformation for “any cloud, any application, any device,” with endless application capacity or exploding IoT data. VMware’s motto, “Consumer-Simple, Enterprise-Secure” remains focused on end-user experience and IT security. The spirit of the motto set the tone for the entire day, which continued with many exciting announcements from the company, from ‘Workspace One’ upgrades to AWS partnerships to OpenStack updates. Here’s our take on the most exciting announcements:\n\nVMware Cloud on AWS\n\nVMware’s AWS announcement follows massive interest in deploying MVware Cloud on AWS ever since the initial plan was announced last October. Today, at VMWorld 2017, VMware Cloud on AWS was officially made available. Amongst the key strengths, VMware took pride in the fact that AWS setup would take just a couple of hours and requires a very elastic deployment. Possible use cases included data center extension and consolidation, disaster recovery, hybrid applications, and control of intellectual property. The team at VMware emphasized that this was just the beginning, and the VMware Cloud-AWS partnership would continue to enhance its services in response to the needs of customers and partners.\n\nExpanded Cloud Services\n\nVMware announced expanded cloud services meant to simplify and resolve cloud management and security challenges. Due to the growing complexity of IT infrastructures, enterprises are now required to contend with each provider’s different network and security settings, policies, APIs and schemas. VMware’s NSX Cloud is purposed to simplify operations across public cloud environments by centralizing network and security settings. Putting their motto “consumer simple, enterprise secure,” into action, other cloud service announcements encompassed reducing costs, workload provisioning, traffic visibility and flow, and performance analytics.\n\nAppDefense and The New Security Paradigms\n\nThe name of the game at VMWorld 2017 is “predictive, not reactive,” and VMWare’s new security tool, AppDefense, was announced to assist IT teams identify the faultsby baselining the norms, very much similar to the way Loom Systems operates for overall monitoring. AppDefense is activated by predefined triggering actions any time there’s a change to baseline thresholds. In addition to an alert, automated actions could include changing firewall rules, capturing network traffic, or even quarantining the app. VMWare continues to make security a key component of its offerings.\n\nVMware-integrated OpenStack version 4.0\n\nVMware announced a new VIO (VMware-integrated OpenStack) version with more support for containerized applications, integration with vRealize automation, multi vCenter support, and other capabilities designed to improve performance and scale. For any entity that works with a public cloud- Vmware’s support to OpenStack is huge news. No matter how complex OpenStack gets, multiple services exist to make the OpenStack world more accessible to enterprise IT Operations.\n\nAnd some more announcements:\n\nVMWare also announced upgrades to Workspace ONE, the VMware Cloud Foundation, and their software-defined data center (SDDC). A few presenters hinted also about a few exciting announcements about VMware and containers, so stay tuned for tomorrow’s recap.\n\nDon’t miss our booth #700J for a short demo, our daily ‘Cozmo’ raffle and some AI for IT talk. See you there!\n\nLoom is excited to be a finalist of Best of VMworld 2017! Learn how Loom leverages AI to simplify VMware monitoring.",
  "latent_18024": "(Photo by Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nTamesha Means was 18 weeks pregnant when her water broke. Means, then 27 and the mother of two, knew something was wrong. So she called a friend to take her to the one hospital within a half-hour's drive, Mercy Health Partners.\n\nDuring that trip to the hospital--and two return trips, one later that night and then again the next morning--Means says she was discharged with medication and instructions to wait for her pain to subside. According to her account, she was not offered the option to induce labor or terminate the pregnancy, options that could have ended her pain, nor was she told that the fetus was unlikely to survive.\n\n“The pain was unbearable,” Means said in an interview from her home in Muskegon, Mich. “I told them, ‘I need you guys to help me.’ They told me there was nothing they could do.”\n\nThree years later, Means’s treatment at Mercy, part of a Catholic health system, has become the centerpiece of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit against the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nThe suit, filed in late November, argues that the Catholic Bishops' religious directives for hospitals--which generally bar discussion or performance of abortions--result in negligent care for patients such as Means.\n\nWithout being offered \"the medically appropriate treatment option of terminating her pregnancy,\" the case argues, Means \"suffered severe, unnecessary, and foreseeable physical and emotional pain.\"\n\nThe lawsuit comes in the midst of a wave of high-profile mergers between Catholic hospitals and secular systems. The partnerships have raised questions about how care will be delivered at institutions guided by religious directives, particularly in rural areas like Muskegon where patients have little choice of where to be seen.\n\n“As the number of Catholic hospitals increases, we’re highlighting the way they can constrain care,” Louise Melling, ACLU deputy legal director, said. “The suit is significant in that it's calling attention to what is happening at these hospitals. In some instances, the directives are governing care rather than medical guidelines.”\n\nMercy Health Partners declined to comment on the case through a spokeswoman, as did the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nMuch of the tension tends to center on reproductive health; 52 percent of obstetricians who work in Catholic hospitals say they have experienced a conflict over religious-based policies, according to a 2012 article in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\nOne obstetrician, according to a recent report published this summer in the American Journal of Bioethics Primary Research, faced off with his Catholic hospital's ethics committee when he wanted to terminate the pregnancy of a women newly-diagnosed with cancer, who needed to undergo chemotherapy.\n\nAnother doctor reported a conflict at her hospital that had been sold to a Catholic hospital chain three years prior. The ethics committee ruled that a doctor could not terminate a \"molar pregnancy,\" where the embryo begins to develop but, due to a tumor, will not survive.\n\n“Some of the doctors have read them all and practice exactly according to the directives,” study author Lori Freedman, a medical sociologist at the University of California - San Francisco, said. “Some don’t quite remember what they signed on for, but they learn from colleagues what you need to get approval for. I do hear about at least some level of awareness.”\n\nThere are 630 Catholic hospitals in the United States, according to the American Hospital Association, accounting for 15 percent of all hospital beds in the country. One-third of Catholic hospitals are in rural areas and, according to the Catholic Hospital Association, one in six American patients are treated in a Catholic facility.\n\nThe United States Conference of Catholic Bishops publishes ethical and religious directives for Catholic health care providers, meant to “to provide authoritative guidance on certain moral issues that face Catholic health care today.”\n\nThe directives guide the way that physicians practice, especially in situations involving sterilizations and obstetric complications, according to UCSF's Freedman.\n\n\"The most concerning conflicts I've heard about tend to revolve around restrictions on sterilization and obstetric complications,\" Freedman said. \"They frequently bring up this exact scenario, where a woman is suffering pre-mature rupture of membranes in the second trimester. In a non-Catholic hospital you would talk about various options, if you want to miscarry naturally, induce labor or do you want us to do a surgical removal.\"\n\nSome hospitals have changed their practices when they merge with Catholic institutions. In one of the more high profile cases, Swedish Health System, a secular hospital chain in Seattle, stopped offering elective abortions when it partnered with Providence Health, one of the larger Catholic hospital systems in the country.\n\nThe ACLU lawsuit, filed on Means' behalf, centers on Mercy Health in Muskegon, Mich., a city with 38,000 residents on the edge of Lake Michigan. The hospital became part of the nation’s second-largest Catholic health care system in May 2013 when its parent company, Trinity Health, merged with Catholic Health East, a hospital chain headquartered in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn both the lawsuit and a phone interview, Means said she made three trips to the hospital of the course of two days.\n\nMeans said she did not ask about the option of terminating her pregnancy and doctors did not offer that as a possible medical treatment. After her second discharge from the hospital, Means returned to the hospital again that evening. She said she gave birth while waiting for her third discharge from the hospital in two days.\n\nHer child was pronounced dead two-and-a-half hours after delivery.\n\n“I was in terrible pain,” Means said. “I was tired. I was frustrated. I still had no answers as to why they did nothing to help me, why they didn’t go ahead and induce my labor when they knew my baby wasn’t going to make it. They left me in pain for those days.”\n\nThe case is meant to push back against the Catholic health directives, ACLU’s Melling said. “It certainly alleges that the imposition of the directives in their current fashion violats the duty of care to patients,” she said.\n\n“We are committed to defending Americans’ right to practice religion,” Melling continued. “We have a long history of doing that. But this isn’t about religious freedom. It’s about medical care.”\n\nRelated:\n\nShopping for Obamacare? Tell us about it!",
  "latent_18132": "FROZEN FROGS\n\nPBS Airdate: April 1, 2005\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: Well, as we all know, it is finally springtime. So before we go, I wanted to celebrate the season. And I can think of no better way than to introduce you to a creature who is, again, very, very small, and lives down here somewhere, close to the ground, doing things that I think you will find very surprising.\n\nHere's the thing about North American wood frogs. They're small...\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: So it might be difficult to spot a frog.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: ...very small. But they're everywhere, just out of view, hiding on the forest floor.\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: He's camouflaged. His coloration is the same as the soil around him. You see him here? He's cold.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: You can find them here in southern Ohio, all the way up to the Arctic Circle. But, wherever they are, once it gets cold, with the first sprinkle of ice, this frog does something I didn't know was possible. As soon as the frog touches, just touches, an ice crystal...\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: This animal is going to freeze.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: Freeze, freeze?\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: Freeze solid, freeze.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: That touch of ice immediately sets off signals inside the frog, says Professor John Costanza, that pull water away from the center of its body. So the frog's internal organs are now wrapped in a puddle of water that then turns to solid ice.\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: I still can't get over it. It's really an amazing, amazing thing.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: There is no breathing, no kidney function, the heart stops.\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: And there will be no heartbeat for a long period of time.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: You mean as in no heartbeat? Nothing?\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: Right. Flat line.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: Flatline. For an hour or two?\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: It could be for days, perhaps even weeks.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: Really? Sounds like it's virtually dead, no?\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: We know that the frog isn't dead, but he's probably about as close as you can get.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: To being dead?\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: Yes.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: So, from the outside, this little frog feels like a rock except that as it froze, the frog flooded itself with a kind of sugar.\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: The frog's blood sugar is distributed through the circulatory system and works like an antifreeze.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: It's harder for water to freeze, so cells stay just damp enough for the animal to hold itself together, until the springtime, when the days grow a little longer and the ground gets a little warmer and then, well, a kind of miracle happens.\n\nAfter weeks or months of no heartbeat, none, suddenly there's a pulse. And that first heartbeat leads to another and then another and then, within a day, and—in the case of this little frog, it took about 10 hours—the animal literally comes back to life.\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: Spontaneous resumption of function.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: Why?\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: We don't know. We don't know what triggers that event.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: And think how elegant a business this is, because although the sun is warming up the outside of this little guy, somehow his insides, his heart, his brain, they thaw first. His insides warm up before his outsides. But somehow, it all happens in perfect synchrony every spring.\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: Yes, and it's going to undertake a very energetic activity. It's mating time.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: Oh, you mean hours after it thaws it's going to do it with a lady?\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: It's going to perform.\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: Uh-huh. What an animal!\n\nJOHN COSTANZO: Can we say that on TV?\n\nROBERT KRULWICH: I don't know if we can or not.\n\nWell, we just did.",

No one willingly gives up being an actor, he says. “It’s too fun. They feed you. You get to pretend all day. But I had to figure it out.”\n\nHelping him figure it all out was legendary film director Richard Donner, who directed Cohen in The Goonies. Donner introduced Cohen to the business side of Hollywood, and Cohen parlayed that introduction into summer jobs at movie studios during college.\n\n“I grew up loving the Three Stooges and the Marx Brothers, but suddenly I had a new crop of heroes,” like David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg. Cohen discovered that many of the most respected agents, studio executives, producers and managers had law degrees, and he followed suit.\n\nAfter graduating from UCLA’s law school in 2000, Cohen worked at an entertainment law firm before starting his own firm in Beverly Hills. Cohen Gardner, his six-lawyer office, represents actors, media companies, directors, writers, producers and production companies. “My concerns about my clients are not merely academic,” he explains. “I’ve been in front of the camera. I know how hard everyone works. I treat them carefully, with respect.”\n\nBeing an entertainment attorney is ideal because “I get to go to the parties but I don’t have to audition,” jokes Cohen, who also writes about business, legal and political matters for the Huffington Post and CNBC, a side gig that he calls “my creative outlet post-acting days.”\n\nBecause he works in show business, Cohen says he’s never the most famous person in the room. Still, people get a kick out of his child stardom. “Having Chunk as your attorney? That’s pretty cool.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in the February 2014 issue of the ABA Journal with this headline: “Chunk, Esq.: Child actor parlays his connections into the law business.”",

  "latent_18231": "Abstract Objectives Caffeine is consumed by more than 85% of adults and little is known about its role on erectile dysfunction (ED) in population-based studies. We investigated the association of caffeine intake and caffeinated beverages with ED, and whether these associations vary among comorbidities for ED. Material and Method Data were analyzed for 3724 men (≥20 years old) who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). ED was assessed by a single question during a self-paced, computer-assisted self-interview. We analyzed 24-h dietary recall data to estimate caffeine intake (mg/day). Multivariable logistic regression analyses using appropriate sampling weights were conducted. Results We found that men in the 3rd (85-170 mg/day) and 4th (171-303 mg/day) quintiles of caffeine intake were less likely to report ED compared to men in the lowest 1st quintile (0-7 mg/day) [OR: 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37–0.89; and OR: 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38–0.97, respectively], but no evidence for a trend. Similarly, among overweight/obese and hypertensive men, there was an inverse association between higher quintiles of caffeine intake and ED compared to men in the lowest 1st quintile, P≤0.05 for each quintile. However, only among men without diabetes we found a similar inverse association (P trend = 0.01). Conclusion Caffeine intake reduced the odds of prevalent ED, especially an intake equivalent to approximately 2-3 daily cups of coffee (170-375 mg/day). This reduction was also observed among overweight/obese and hypertensive, but not among diabetic men. Yet, these associations are warranted to be investigated in prospective studies.\n\nCitation: Lopez DS, Wang R, Tsilidis KK, Zhu H, Daniel CR, Sinha A, et al.

Among older men, these numbers significantly increase affecting their overall quality of life [3]: at age 40, approximately 44% are affected and this number increases nearly to 70% by age of 70 [2, 4]. The economic burden of ED is unclear, yet studies have shown that the cost of treatment could reach $15 billion if all men seek treatment [5, 6]. Cardiovascular risk factors like physical inactivity, alcohol consumption and smoking have been suggested to increase the risk of ED [7, 8]. Yet, little is known about other factors that could have a potential benefit on ED such as caffeine intake [9–12]. It was previously hypothesized that coffee and/or caffeine initiates a series of pharmacological effects that lead to the relaxation of the cavernous smooth muscle and that subsequently could improve ED [13]. Caffeine was recently reported to be consumed by more than 85% of US adults, and it is obtained mainly from dietary fluid sources, such as coffee, tea, soda, and energy/sport drinks. About two thirds of American adults drink coffee on a daily basis, 52% of the US male population drinks at least one glass of soda per day, while over 50% drinks tea on any given day, and 17% consumes energy and sport drinks more than three times per week [14]. Coffee, and its most studied component, caffeine, have been implicated in potential health benefits due to the rich sources of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds contained in this beverage [14, 15]. The prevalence of overweight/obesity, hypertension and diabetes is increasing dramatically among US men, and previous studies have linked them with ED [16–20]. Yet, there is a paucity of research on the interplay between these comorbidities, caffeine intake and ED. Therefore, the aims of this study are to investigate the association of caffeine intake and caffeinated beverages with ED, and to compare whether these associations vary among overweight/obese, hypertensive and diabetic men in a nationally representative sample of the US adult population.\n\nMethods Study Population The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies undertaken by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the US. Continuous NHANES used a multistage, stratified and clustered probability sampling in which Mexican-Americans, non-Hispanic blacks, and the elderly were oversampled to ensure adequate samples sizes and to represent the total US civilian, non-institutionalized population [21]. For the purpose of this study, we combined data from continuous NHANES waves 2001–2002 and 2003–2004 because information on ED was reported only on those years. Assessment of Erectile Dysfunction NHANES participants were in a private room using self-paced audio computer-assisted self-interview system that enabled them to both hear questions through earphones and read questions on the computer related to ED. To assess erectile dysfunction, men (≥20 years) were asked the following question that has been previously validated and suggested to be added in large ongoing national epidemiologic surveys to provide needed information related to the prevalence of ED [22], “Many men experience problems with sexual intercourse. How would you describe your ability to get and keep an erection adequate for satisfactory intercourse? The following answers were provided, “would you say that you are… always or almost always able, usually able, sometimes able, or never able? For the purpose of this study, we defined and dichotomized positive ED from the answers “sometime able” or “never able” to keep an erection, and subsequently negative ED was derived from the answers “almost always able” or “usually able” to maintain an erection [2]. In this study we excluded men with the following conditions as they could influence the condition of ED: men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer (n = 94), or underwent surgery/radiation treatment (n = 85) for the same disease. We also excluded men with implausible daily calorie intakes (below 800 kcal or above 5,000 kcal) (n = 285) leaving a total sample size of 3,724 men with valid data on ED. Assessment of caffeine and dietary data The U.S. Department of Agriculture developed and validated a multiple-pass dietary recall method for NHANES to collect dietary data [23]. Participants reported all food and beverages consumed in two, 24-h dietary recall periods (midnight to midnight). The first one was conducted by dietary research interviewers face-to-face, and the second one was done 3 to 10 days later by telephone. Because NHANES 2001–2002 only included one recall, our analysis was limited to the first-day dietary recall for both NHANES waves 2001–2002 and 2003–2004, which is considered a population-based estimate of daily caffeine intake. After the dietary interviews, USDA’s Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 5.0 (2012) was used to code dietary intake data and calculate nutrient intakes [23]. Based on the quantity of food and beverages reported and the corresponding nutrient contents by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the caloric content and other nutrients derived from each consumed food and beverage item were calculated [23, 24]. Data on caffeine intake (mg/day), plain and tap water (gm), and alcohol (gm) was obtained from the Total Nutrient File, which contains summed nutrients for an individual from all food and beverages provided on the dietary recall [25]. Information on specific caffeinated beverages was obtained from the Individual Foods files [23]. We identified four beverages, coffee, total soda (regular and low-calorie), tea and energy and sport drinks, which were dichotomized (“Yes” / “No”) for their intake on any given day. We examined caffeine intake in quintiles (mg/day), lowest quintile (0–7), 2nd quintile (8–84), 3rd quintile (85–170), 4th quintile (171–303), and highest quintile (304–700). Total water intake categorized and defined by combining plain and tap water and it was included in multivariable models, while alcohol consumption was kept continuous. Assessment of covariates Age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, education and physical activity during the past 30 days (moderate and vigorous) were self-reported during the NHANES interview. NHANES categorizes race/ethnicity as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, and other (other Hispanics and all others). Participants were classified as never, former and current smokers from self-reported information; participants were asked if they had smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and if they were current smokers; serum cotinine was measured using high performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric-pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry [26]. Current smokers consisted of those who self-reported smoking habits, smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, and cotinine was ≥ 10 ng/mL (actively exposed). Vigorous physical activity was obtained from the questions on whether participants did any activity that caused heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate (e.g., swimming, aerobics, or fast cycling), while moderate physical activity was determined from the questions on whether they did any activities that caused light sweating or a moderate increase in the heart rate, such as playing golf, dancing, bicycling for pleasure, or walking. Three readings of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were obtained from participants who attended the mobile examination center. We used the average of those three measurements (≥140/90 mmHg). We also considered the current use of antihypertensive medication treatment or being “told by a doctor you have hypertension” as an indication of high blood pressure (hypertension). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from measured weight and height (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Type 2 diabetes status was defined from ≥126 mg/dl of fasting plasma glucose, medication treatment or being “told by a doctor you have diabetes or sugar diabetes.” Fasting plasma glucose concentration was measured in the morning session after an overnight fast of at least 8 h [27], details related to the laboratory procedures of that is found elsewhere [21]. Statistical analysis Sampling weights were applied to take into account selection probabilities, over-sampling, non-response, and differences between the sample and the total US population. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ED using weighted logistic regression models were estimated in relation to quintiles of caffeine intake, binary variables of caffeinated beverages and its combinations. We did not attempt to classify “coffee plus tea” (or any of the beverage combinations) intake according to caffeine intake (mg/day) content due to missing information about specific beverage consumption, missing information on caffeine (mg/day), or discrepancy between caffeine (mg/day) values and reporting of specific beverage consumption. In “Model 1,” we only adjusted for age, while in “Model 2” we included the variables vigorous and moderate physical activity, age (continuous), smoking status, education, race/ethnicity, obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), total water intake (plain and tap; continuous), total energy (continuous) and alcohol (continuous). Stratified analyses were conducted by binary overweight/obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m2), type 2 diabetes and hypertension because these variables are known to modify ED. Multivariable models included the variables vigorous and moderate physical activity, age, smoking status, education, race/ethnicity, intake of total water, total energy, alcohol and obesity (removed when stratified by overweight/obesity). Statistical interaction tests were carried out by using the ordinal variables for caffeine intake, binary variables for caffeinated beverages, binary variables for the potentially modifying factors and their product terms. The statistical significance of the interaction terms was evaluated by the Wald test. All p-values were two-sided; alpha = 0.05 was considered the cut-off for statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 12.0 (College Station, TX).\n\nDiscussion In the present study, our nationally representative sample of men showed that total caffeine intake was associated with a reduced likelihood to report ED in multivariable analyses. This reduced prevalence of ED was mainly observed when the amount of caffeine intake was between 170 and 375 mg/day, which is approximately equivalent to 2–3 cups of coffee per day. In addition, total caffeine intake seemed to reduce the odds of ED among men who were overweight/obese, hypertensive and non-diabetic. A few caffeinated beverages were inversely associated with ED, yet they were not consistent when stratified by comorbidities for ED. Our results are consistent with two population-based studies that showed an inverse association between caffeine intake and ED [9, 10]. The suggested biological mechanism [20] is that caffeine triggers a series of pharmacological effects that lead to the relaxation of the penile helicine arteries, and the cavernous smooth muscle that lines cavernosal spaces, thus increasing penile blood flow [13]. However, our findings differ from two previous studies that showed no association between caffeinated drinks (cross-sectional), coffee consumption (prospective) and ED [11, 12]. Compared to these null studies, our study had a larger sample size for the endpoint of interest. In addition, our exposures (total caffeine intake and caffeinated beverages) were derived from a 24-hour dietary recall period, which method has been developed and validated by the US Department of Agriculture to report population-based estimates of daily caffeine intake. Plus, our multiple linear regression models included more confounders, total water intake and total energy, that could possibly mask an association between caffeine intake and ED. We did not find a significant inverse association between caffeine intake and ED among diabetic men. In an animal study, we previously showed that caffeine consumption improved the erectile function of diabetic rats by up-regulating cavernous cGMP [20]. Diabetes is one of the strongest risk factors for ED and it remains one of the most difficult medical conditions to treat [28]. Thus, it is possible this is one of the reasons we couldn’t find lower prevalence of ED among men with higher intake of caffeine. Interestingly, our findings showed a lower prevalence of ED among men with caffeine intake, especially when this is equivalent to 2–3 daily cups of coffee (170–375 mg/day). Previously, a similar caffeine intake amount was associated with beneficial effects on cardiometabolic factors and cardiovascular health [14]. In addition, a recent study reported that American men age 35 to 54 years had a caffeine intake of 336 mg per day, which is close to the amount of caffeine we found having a significantly inverse association with ED [29]. Our findings with caffeinated beverages, or its combination, did not follow a consistent pattern as we observed with total caffeine intake (mg/day). Yet, it is possible that due to its collection (consumption on any given day) and dichotomization (“Yes” / “No”) contributed to the inconsistent results we found. Strengths of this study is the large sample size with a representative sample of the US men population, and the validated dietary recall methodology from NHANES that allows for measurement of caffeine intake from drinks [23, 24] and report population-based estimates of daily caffeine intake. Yet, our study also has limitations; ED is a multifactorial disease and some of its risk factors were not addressed in this study such as cardiovascular diseases; NHANES is a cross-sectional study, therefore, the association we found between caffeine intake and ED impede us to infer causality or much less suggest any clinical practice change. Plus, there is an inherent bias in the use of surveys for data collection. Thus, these findings should be confirmed in prospective studies.\n\nConclusion In general we found a reduced likelihood to report ED among men with caffeine intake, especially with 2–3 daily cups of coffee, which is approximately 170–375 mg/day. Interestingly, we found differences in the inverse associations of caffeine intake and caffeinated beverages among overweight/obese, non-diabetic and hypertensive men.\n\nSupporting Information S1 Table.

  "latent_18250": "As more and more organizations are becoming data-driven, everything around big data – including programmatic, consumer insights and machine learning – have become buzzwords in marketing and advertising.\n\nWhile almost every industry conference addresses the importance of big data, high-profile executives from Bain & Company, General Mills, Tinder and more gave this subject some fresh thinking today at The Economist’s Marketing Unbound conference Thursday.\n\nBelow are three things that we learned.\n\nMarketing should center around the consumer, not data\n\nMarketing needs to adapt, said Laura Beaudin, partner of Bain & Company. Decisions need to be made collaboratively across different departments within an organization. “We’ve seen big changes in the idea of smashing silos between functions in order to make sure that merchandising is in line with marketing and sales,” said Beaudin.\n\nPreviously, the marketing team didn’t need to work closely with the research team, for example, and a brand marketer might be required to set the budget 18 months prior to a campaign. But now, marketing needs to collaborate with IT, analytics and data. Most importantly, marketing should put the consumer at the center of every single decision.\n\n“We see lots of companies start organizing no longer around products or channels but around the customer,” said Beaudin. “This is disruptive but beneficial at the same time because it requires companies to be more nimble.”\n\nCompanies that are leading marketing tend to make decisions two times faster and use data three times more often, according to Beaudin.\n\nBig data can inform ideas but it cannot create ideas\n\nWhile big data can help companies make marketing decisions faster, it cannot replace consumer experience. “Big data is tactical and it offers consumers guidance,” said Joseph Coughlin, director of MIT AgeLab. “But big data doesn’t create a vision that gets the consumer excited and say ‘this brand offers a lifestyle that I want’.”\n\nWhile big data can absolutely drive marketing decisions, he said, it’s more important for a brand to come up with a great idea that delights its consumers. Then the company can use data to decide if its hypothesis actually works.\n\nMichael Fanuele, chief creative officer for General Mills, agreed that no matter how marketing is changing – be it data-driven or not – fundamentally, it’s about creating something that consumers desire.\n\n“As valuable as programmatic and analytics can be, sometimes I think it blurs the reality that at the end of the day, we need ideas – either for building the product or for building the consumer relationship – that are irresistible,” said Fanuele. “How much precision is too much precision when you precisely target people with crap?”\n\nDigital market research cannot replace traditional market research methods\n\nIn terms of market research, organizations today can collect data from mobile, search and social media to study consumer behavior. While digital media generates faster results, traditional market research methods like telephone surveys, in-person interviews and qualitative focus groups are still necessary, according to Phil Schwarz, chief marketing officer for Tinder.\n\nDespite being a purely digital company, Tinder still conducts online and street surveys, asking people dating culture or product-specific questions. It also runs focus groups and A/B testing on different various.\n\n“We can quickly see what’s working and what’s not working from our product data. But none of them can be a substitute for classic methods,” said Schwarz.",
  "latent_18254": "The WikiLeaks website has been under a major DDoS attack over the last few days and a group calling itself AntiLeaks has claimed responsibility.\n\n\"We are young adults, citizens of the United States of America and are deeply concerned about the recent developments with Julian Assange and his attempt at asylum in Ecuador,\" said the group's self-proclaimed leader, who calls himself Diet Pepsi.\n\n\"Assange is the head of a new breed of terrorist. We are doing this as a protest against his attempt to escape justice into Ecuador. This would be a catalyst for many more like him to rise up in his place. We will not stop and they will not stop us.\"\n\nAccording to the WikiLeaks Twitter feed, the website, and those of its associates and mirrors, have been hit by a massive DDoS attack reaching 10Gbits/s and using a more complex system than a standard bulk UDP or ICMP packet flooding. The range of IP addresses is huge, indicating either thousands of machines taking part or some really good simulation.\n\nThe AntiLeaks group hasn't been heard of before and its Twitter feed only started this month. While it's possible they are simply claiming the attacks rather than carrying them out, it's clear the attacks are being taken by WikiLeaks as an attempt to shut down information.\n\nAttacks on # WikiLeaks are not only intended to prevent secrets from being revealed, but also to maintain an monopoly on influence. — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) August 10, 2012\n\nThe attack comes as WikiLeaks is trying to distribute more emails from the hacking of private security group Stratfor Global Intelligence. This latest batch, released in the last few days, concern the existence of a US-based monitoring system called Trapwire.\n\nTrapwire was set up by the Abraxis Corporation, a private security operation fun by former intelligence officers and headed by ex-CIA man Richard Helms. The Abraxis CEO said in an interview seven years ago that the system was designed to share threat information and establish patterns of data that could be used to predict attacks.\n\n\"It can collect information about people and vehicles that is more accurate than facial recognition, draw patterns, and do threat assessments of areas that may be under observation from terrorists,\" he said. \"The application can do things like 'type' individuals so if people say 'medium build,' you know exactly what that means from that observer.\"\n\nHelms claimed then that it was the largest source of threat data outside the US government, and the leaked emails show its scope has widened further. According to one from Fred Burton, Stratfor's vice president for intelligence, the Trapwire network is now covering most North American and British high-value targets (HVT.)\n\n\"I knew these hacks when they were GS-12's at the CIA. God Bless America. Now they have EVERY major HVT in CONUS, the UK, Canada, Vegas, Los Angeles, NYC as clients,\" he wrote.\n\nAn annual Trapwire license will set the user back $150,000 he said, with a quarter-million dollar signup fee on top.\n\nMeanwhile, the attacks on Wikileaks go on and the organization is appealing for more funds to get extra bandwidth. AntiLeaks might have a few more problems on their hands, however, if Anonymous is to be believed. ®",
  "latent_18258": "Here’s roaring good news: In a move several years in the making, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service today finally announced that the African lion (Panthera leo) would formally be protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.\n\nSpecifically, the nearly extinct lions of western and central Africa—a subspecies now called P. l. leo—will be listed as endangered. Only about 1,400 of these lions remain scattered across more than a dozen countries, including the critically endangered Asiatic lions of India (the cats on the two continents were not previously considered the same subspecies). Another lion subspecies—P. p. melanochaita of east and southern Africa—will be listed as threatened. There are about 17,000 to 19,000 lions left in this subspecies, most of which live in protected but restricted habitats.\n\nIn a press conference, FWS director Dan Ashe called lions “iconic,” “a part of our culture,” and one of the most beloved wildlife species on the planet.\n\nAshe called the ESA listing an important step to setting a new course for African lions, which are projected to lose another 50 percent of their populations over the next 20 years. The total lion population was estimated about half a million at the begining of the Twentieth Century.\n\nLions in Africa face many threats, including habitat loss, prey depletion and retaliatory killings for livestock depletions. The endangered species listing will help to tackle another threat, the so-called “sports” hunting of lions like we saw with the famous case of Cecil earlier this year. Ashe said the listing will not bar the import of trophies from these hunts into the U.S., but it will “raise the bar significantly” and require permits that prove any hunts were conducted in a sustainable manner. Countries which allow hunting will need to prove to FWS that their programs actually enhance and protect wild populations—for example, by funding local communities and ensuring that lions do not pose a perceived threat to livestock—before any trophies from those hunts could be imported into the U.S.\n\nAshe also used the authority of his office to order that anyone who has previously violated wildlife laws in the U.S. or abroad be barred from receiving all future import permits for any wildlife species. This would include people like the dentist who shot Cecil the lion.\n\nAlthough the majority of Ashe’s discussion focused on hunting, the ESA listing also frees up resources to help address other threats to lions, including poaching and illegal trafficking or lion parts. A proposed increased fee for trophy imports will help to improve enforcement actions across the board. The ESA listing would also limit and require permits for the currently unrestricted interstate trade in captive African lions within the U.S. and place new restrictions on the commerce of lion bones and other derivative products, according to FWS spokesperson Vanessa Kauffman.\n\nConservation groups praised the ESA listing, while also pointing out that a lot of additional work is needed to save wild lions. “Trophy hunting is only one small factor contributing to the lion’s current status,” said Luke Hunter, president and chief conservation officer of Panthera, an organization devoted to protecting the world’s big cat species. “While today’s bold actions are welcome, they will not stem the rapid decline of the species brought on by far more pressing and pervasive threats, especially the illegal bushmeat industry that empties African savannahs of wildlife, and the widespread killing of lions by people in defense of their livestock. Lions have already disappeared from 22 countries in Africa. Reversing this tragic pattern will require the many local, national and international stakeholders in the lion’s future to commit to its protection on a grand scale.”\n\nThe new rules go into effect on Jan. 22, 2016.\n\nPreviously in Extinction Countdown:\n\nAlso by John R.

  "latent_18292": "By Lindsey Collen\n\nJuly 20, 2012 -- Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal -- Victories, even partial, are rare in these times. The revolutionary socialist party LALIT (\"Lalit\" means \"struggle\" in Kreol) would like to share with you an important development in the class struggle and struggle for women’s emancipation in Mauritius. LALIT is the only political party in Mauritius that has, over the decades, campaigned for abortion decriminalisation, and finally last month parliament passed a new abortion law to replace the 1838 total ban on any abortion. Everyone in the country knows that this is a LALIT struggle, as our stand on abortion decriminalisation had often been used “against” us. So, it is like getting accumulated “support”.\n\nThis victory comes less than a year after another victory accredited to LALIT: the introduction into schools of the mother tongues, Kreol and Bhojpuri, for the very first time in 2012.\n\nThe new abortion law passed last month decriminalises abortion in the circumstances of serious ill health of the woman or malformation of the foetus, rape, incest or statutory rape. But, it means that all women can now speak openly about abortion and can, when ill after a complication resulting from a future illegal abortion, go to the hospitals for treatment with more freedom. And the struggle continues.\n\nThe law came into the National Assembly only two months after the women’s organisation, the Muvman Liberasyon Fam (MLF, Women's Liberation Movement), had held ceremonies in two cemeteries with the families of women who had died as a direct result of abortion still being illegal. The MLF had over the past three years accentuated its campaign for abortion decriminalisation, and putting into question the very wording of the archaic law, which referred to the woman being “quick with child”.\n\nA woman had been charged in 2009 with illegal abortion, and the director of public prosecutions had finally, after women’s mobilisation against the law as “not clear”, dropped charges. In 2011 he admitted in public that the wording was not clear enough for him to arrest and charge women under, once the confusing expression “quick with child” was exposed to scrutiny. Jurisprudence showed that it usually meant around the 20th week of pregnancy, but the DPP’s office had always for 174 years assumed it meant simply “pregnant”, because the French version used the word enceinte.\n\nMLF called a Common Front on Abortion which became very strong. The death of a woman photo journalist following an illegal abortion changed the balance of forces enormously, as all the reporters and other employees of the Press groups could no longer toe the line of the main companies that run the Press, which are historically close to the Catholic Church.\n\nDuring the mobilisation of women behind the proposed bill, even if only for partial legalisation -- mobilisation organised mainly by LALIT women who are in the leadership of the Muvman Liberasyon Fam (MLF) -- the law was finally passed with only 20% of MPs voting against. This massive support in parliament was despite a campaign that would make you think “everyone” is against, or if not, then too weak to stand up to the religious lobbies opposing abortion.\n\nEvery time parliament met, there were dozens of women in the galleries, holding press conferences before or after, and even staying until after midnight. There was a candelight ceremony in memory of women who had died from illegal abortions.\n\nThe mobilisation was given strong, vocal support by the Nursing Association, the biggest union in the health sector. The leadership, including Ashok Callooa and Ram Nawzadick, and the women’s wing representatives, all spoke out in favour of the law, and attended mobilising events. The union called for complete decriminalisation, and for women to feel free to come to hospital.\n\n“We are here to look after the sick, not to judge you”, Ashok Callooa announced. He also said that nurses are the ones who see the suffering that results from back-street abortions, and he, like almost everyone else in the debate, put emphasis on the class issue. Poor women suffer disproportionately from the repressive law.\n\nOther unions also came in in strong support, including the Government Teachers’ Union and the Federation of Para-Statal Bodies, as well as the big Confederation of Private Sector Workers (CTSP). This added to the growing support from human rights groups, and the family planning organisation to the mobilised women’s movement.\n\nA surprisingly large number of MPs spoke in favour of well-nigh total de-criminalisation, showing their reliance on the argumentation developed over decades of struggle, especially by LALIT and the MLF. Another surprise was the strong pro-secular approach amongst MPs of almost all parties. They put emphasis on the health issues, human rights issues and need for a secular state.\n\nThe only parties against were three parties that have only one MP in parliament, the Mauritian Solidarity Front (FSM, a fundamentalist party), the MMSD (a party run by a maverick capitalist) and the OPR (run by a former Catholic priest). Two parties were 100% in favour, despite giving a “free vote”. They were the biggest party, Labour, and the bigger of the two Rodrigues parties, the Mouvement Rodrigues, whose two MPs spoke eloquently from the point of view of working-class women in the republic as a whole. The Labour Party’s coalition partner, the Mauritian Social Democratic Party was three out of four in favour, while the opposition Militant Socialist Movement was 3/4 in favour.\n\nThe opposition Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) was split down the middle, and thus came out worst, with its anti-abortion MPs making fools of themselves in speeches so outrageous that the Press denounced them unanimously. This once-long-ago left-wing party is now a bastion of the reaction.\n\nOne of the MMM’s MPs, Jean-Claude Barbier, in an all-time first-ever, actually told parliament that god had personally spoken to him about what to say in “the august Assembly”.\n\nWhile some MPs spoke of “murderers”, one MMM deputy, Lysie Ribot, said that women who had abortions, were also more likely to have road accidents and get cancer of the cervix. She said, in a grotesque statement, that women who were raped were unlikely to fall pregnant because their ovulation got “blocked”.\n\nAdil Meea, another MMM MP, said religion was one of the last ramparts against degeneracy and depravity. Soon, he said we will hear talk of same-sex marriages.\n\nBut, these were marginalised completely in the generally massive support for the law, not only in parliament, but also outside. A survey of women’s opinions in the country carried out by a big commercial opinion poll company found that over 66% of women are in favour, and only 20% against, thus reflecting neatly the vote in parliament.",

  "latent_18965": "At White House, Trump Campaigns While Merkel Champions Western Order\n\nOn Friday, President Donald Trump opted to reopen a painful rift in U.S.-German relations, part of his continued claim to have been wiretapped by his predecessor, just a day after the White House drove another close ally, Britain, ballistic by implying its intelligence service was somehow involved.\n\nTrump’s claims have been thoroughly debunked by President Barack Obama, the intelligence community, and top lawmakers, but nevertheless, he persisted. Asked by a German reporter at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about the discredited claims Obama had eavesdropped on him, Trump gestured to Merkel and said, “At least we have something in common.”\n\nThat was a reference to the 2013 revelations that the United States spied on her mobile phone, the beginning of a diplomatic row between two longstanding allies that culminated in the expulsion of a CIA agent from Germany and led to hard feelings for years. It was an odd path to take in Trump’s first face-to-face meeting with Europe’s most influential politician, who now bears the additional burden of defending the liberal international order Washington built and once buttressed.\n\nBut Trump’s off the cuff comment, which gobsmacked the chancellor\n\n\"As far as wiretapping by, i guess, this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps\" pic.twitter.com/dv9MJwJ0d2 — Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) March 17, 2017\n\nwas in tune with the rest of Trump’s press conference. After meeting with Merkel in the Oval Office for a photo opportunity — and pointedly ignoring her request for a handshake — and hosting a roundtable with U.S. and German business leaders, the president slipped back into his familiar campaign mode. (The economic roundtable focused on Germany’s use of apprentices for vocational training. “That’s a word I like,” the former reality TV host said.)\n\nIn between remarks about his crowd size at a recent rally in Tennessee, boasts about the supposed unity of the Republican Party, jibes at “fake news,” and attacks on Obama’s healthcare plan, Trump returned to familiar themes. He reiterated his belief that “bad” trade deals had somehow hollowed out U.S. manufacturing (U.S. manufacturing output is at an all-time high) and warned of the dangers of terrorism.\n\n“Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question,” he said, defending his administration’s recent effort to ban travel for people from six Muslim countries. (Federal courts have frozen that order, too.)\n\nThe irony is that Merkel, unlike Trump, actually faces a general election this year, but she did not campaign. Rather, after explicitly noting that she is in the United States to defend the interests of all Germans, she subtly repudiated many of the factually incorrect claims the president made, all while defending free trade, the trans-Atlantic alliance, European integration, and the importance of immigration — in other words, much of what, until recently, it it was customary for the leader of the free world to defend.\n\nShe thanked U.S. support — especially the Marshall plan — for helping Germany recover economically after the war, even as Trump’s budget, proposed Thursday, would gut foreign aid.\n\nMerkel noted that Germany’s success is inseparable from European integration and security; Trump has openly praised Brexit and is reportedly considering appointing Ted Malloch, who likens the EU to the Soviet Union, to be U.S. ambassador to the EU. After Trump spoke of advantages afforded German trade negotiators, Merkel reminded him that EU member states cede trade talks to Brussels. She also noted that free trade pacts increased employment, despite some initial fears at home.\n\nMerkel said she was personally gratified to hear Trump is committed to NATO; this, after Trump said, “Many nations owe vast sums of money. It is very unfair to the United States. These nations must pay what they owe.”\n\nWhen it comes to refugees, Merkel stressed the reasons they can’t go home, such as civil war, to quietly refute Trump’s opening remarks on the supposed dangers of immigration.\n\nThe chilly oval office meeting and the awkward press conference with one of America’s closest allies will do little to reassure those in Washington and Europe who worry about the Trump administration’s commitment to Europe, NATO, and the international order. With questions still swirling about Trump’s ties to and intentions toward Russia, that’s probably not what Merkel — or most of Europe — wanted to hear.\n\nPhoto credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",

Die Handgeräte zum Aufpumpen der Autoreifen seien oft demoliert oder gestohlen worden, sagte eine Esso-Sprecherin der \" Augsburger Allgemeinen\". \"Wir mussten jährlich zweistellige Millionenbeträge aufwenden, um geklaute Geräte zu ersetzen.\" Die Geräte seien auch nicht sehr komfortabel gewesen – der Schlauch habe oft auf dem Boden gelegen und sei dreckig geworden.

  "latent_19376": "In March, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Kent Conrad (D-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Tom Coburn (R-OK) formed a group to tackle long-term budget reform; they referred to themselves the “Gang of Six.” The six were motivated by the belief that to create a bipartisan deal, everything had to be on the table. Chambliss, for instance, said, “For a Republican to put revenues on the table is significant. For a Democrat to put entitlements on the table is significant. The only way we’re going to solve this problem is to have a dialogue about all these issues, because there is no silver bullet.”\n\nWhile the “Gang of Six” earned supportive statements from their colleagues and other observers, they accomplished little for some time. Furthermore, the six senators remained very tight-lipped on any details regarding their proposal, leaving the public and many in Washington curious as to whether an actual solution along their lines was possible. Others began trying their own efforts, such as Vice President Biden’s working group on the debt ceiling.\n\nIn May, when Senator Coburn announced he was dropping out of the group due to disagreements with Senator Durbin over discretionary and Medicare cuts, the whole thing appeared to be dead. Chambliss signaled that to make a deal work, “Coburn would have to be brought back into the fold,” since he was a key conservative voice. As time went on, the now “Five Guys” fell out of the media.\n\nJust when everyone seemed to give up hope on a bipartisan proposal, on July 19, a proposal emerged from the Gang of Six. They characterized it as a 10-year, $3.7 trillion deficit-cutting plan. Senator Chambliss reportedly had stayed close to Senator Coburn, “having dinner almost every evening” talking about “whether the left-for-dead Senate gang could really work.” Coburn did indeed return to pitch the plan to his colleagues on Tuesday, exclaiming, “I’m back.”\n\nThe plan’s summary (PDF) states the following:\n\nSpending\n\n$500 billion “down payment” spending reductions\n\nShift to chained-CPI inflation measure government-wide, starting in 2012\n\nImpose statutory spending caps on discretionary spending through 2015\n\nSenate Finance Committee will have to cut $300 billion in health savings, while resolving how Medicare pays doctors, and is instructed to determine how Social Security can be made solvent for the next 75 years\n\nSenate committees are instructed to find $250 billion in cuts in other various departments\n\nTax\n\nSimplify the individual income tax code by broadening the tax base while reducing tax rates. The tax rates would be three brackets of between8-12 percent, 14-22 percent, and 23-29 percent, while maintaining or increasing the progressivity of the tax code. The tax base changes would reform, but not necessarily eliminate, tax deductions and credits for health, charitable giving, homeownership, and retirement\n\nRetain the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit, or provide at least the same level of support for qualified beneficiaries\n\nRepeal the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)\n\nChange, in a revenue-neutral manner, the corporate tax rate to between 23 percent and 29 percent and switch from a worldwide to a territorial system\n\nSince the release, the senators have been pitching their plan to build up support. They have received mixed reviews, including cautious optimism, eager support, and critiques, and not all along partisan lines. Republican Paul Ryan issued a statement skeptically asking questions about further details, and the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Chris Van Hollen, insisted on seeing details before he supports the plan. Positive statements have been issued by a number of individuals on the Hill and in the media (see, for example, Ezra Klein and Fox News). Former Bush-43 OMB official James Capretta savaged the plan in an op-ed. President Obama has praised the debt ceiling plan, although it is ultimately up to Congress what happens with it.",

Comey, whose firing in May is part of the Russia probe, according to the New York Times.\n\nRepublicans, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, have pointed to political donations to Democrats made by members of Mueller’s team as evidence of a political bias. But Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a Trump appointee who assigned Mueller with the task of overseeing the Russian probe, told senators last month that he sees no conflicts of interest in the donations, many of which occurred before 2016.\n\nIn an eye-opening interview with the New York Times on Wednesday, one that reportedly caught Trump’s advisors off guard, the president ignited speculation he’s considering firing Mueller should the investigation veer toward Trump’s business dealings as part of the investigation.\n\nHowever, only Rosenstein has the authority to dismiss the former FBI director, which means Trump would have to replace one of his own appointees (Rosenstein) with someone willing to fire Mueller. Bloomberg pointed out that this would be a bold move, echoing President Richard Nixon’s infamous “Saturday Night Massacre” in which U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy resigned instead of obeying Nixon’s order to fire the special prosecutor involved in the Watergate investigation.\n\n\"It would be unprecedented in American history for a president to be successful in removing that special counsel and dictating the terms of an investigation into possibly him and his family and his associates,\" Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro told CNN.\n\nEfforts to undermine Mueller’s investigation are part of an increasingly caustic relationship between the White House and the Department of Justice. In the interview with the New York Times, Trump said he would have picked a different attorney general had he known Jeff Sessions would recuse himself from the investigation into Russian election-meddling.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBy condemning Sessions and threatening Mueller should the investigation look into Trump’s private business dealings, the president appears either to be testing the limits of his authority, or is unaware of the limits to his power.\n\nMeanwhile, all of this boundary-testing and saber-rattling by the president appears to be too much for some. Politico reports that Mark Corallo, the spokesmen for Trump’s legal team, has resigned after two months on the job. According to people familiar with the matter, Corallo didn’t like the strategy of attacking Mueller’s credibility, nor was he sure he was being told the truth about “various matters.”",

He also is accused of fatally shooting 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at a Jewish retirement home in nearby Overland Park.\n\nNone of the victims was Jewish.\n\nMiller, who has emphysema, was brought into the Johnson County courtroom Thursday in a wheelchair. After Judge Thomas Kelly Ryan scheduled a three-day preliminary hearing in March, Miller protested, shouting, “What about my speedy trial?”\n\nAfter Howe announced his intention to seek the death penalty, Miller responded that he wasn’t afraid because he is dying anyway. He offered to “grease the tracks” for prosecutors if they cooperated with him, but Ryan cut him off and said he needed to communicate through his attorneys.\n\nHowe and Miller’s attorneys declined to comment after the hearing.

Miller responded angrily that the delays were meant to help the prosecutor get re-elected.\n\nMiller said he became concerned during an emergency room visit in late March that he didn’t have much time left to live. In several phone calls to the Associated Press, Miller said he killed the three because he thought he was dying and he felt it was his duty. He said he regretted shooting the teenager.\n\nHe has told the AP and other media outlets that he planned and executed the fatal attacks, and that it was his intent to use the trial as a means to “put the Jews on trial where they belong”.\n\nMiller, also known as Frazier Glenn Cross, is a Vietnam War veteran from southwest Missouri who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party.\n\nHe was the target of a nationwide manhunt in 1987, when federal agents tracked him and three other men to a rural Missouri home stocked with hand grenades and automatic weapons. He was indicted on weapons charges and accused of plotting robberies and the assassination of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s founder. He served three years in federal prison.\n\nMiller also ran for the US House of Representatives in 2006 and the Senate in 2010 in Missouri, each time espousing a white-power platform.",

  "latent_20000": "Two weeks ago, the National Football League held its annual draft. For a select few, the draft was a time of excitement and expectation, but for many others, it was a time of extreme and profound anxiety. Academe has its own version of the draft complete with scholastic combines, scouting reports, and team visits. Of course in academic speak, these are more familiarly known as conference interviews, letters of recommendation, and campus visits (Team ProfHacker has addressed some of these issues already in the links above). The academic draft lasts for more than a weekend, and unfortunately, even a best-case scenario doesn’t usually involve multi-million dollar contracts, but nevertheless, there are some useful similarities. Namely, such a comparison can help to explain some of the idiosyncrasies of the academic job market to civilians—that is, non-academics. For a host of different reasons, the summer tends to bring with it the questions from well-intentioned family and friends about what the future might hold. Perhaps rephrasing the issue in more familiar terms can help to shed some light on the challenges and difficulties of the market for those who haven’t experienced it themselves.\n\nBefore I get ahead of myself, it’s worth pointing out that this analogy has been in circulation for a few years now, and there is even a thread dedicated to it on the CHE Forum. Moreover, there are several other analogies that might be useful here if you are not a football fan. The NBA, NHL, or the PGA might be your vehicle of choice if basketball, hockey, or golf is more your style. Or you might opt for American Idol, America’s Next Top Model, Big Brother, or even Survivor (certainly the show’s motto “Outwit, Outplay, Outlast” seems relevant here!). In each case, where sports or reality television, the stakes are high, and there is a kind of pressure-cooker stress-intensifying anxiety that is unlike anything most candidates will have experienced previously. As many of us know, the job market can make even the coolest of cucumbers sweat bullets, and it has a way of eroding the confidence of the most self-possessed candidate.\n\nBut I’m interested in the NFL analogy here, not only because I am a football fan myself, but also because this year’s draft had an interesting twist that I’ll get to shortly.\n\nBut first, a few key similarities:\n\nThere are more players than there are spots. While this is not the case in every discipline, it is a fact of life in many of them. As a result, every year talented people are forced to make very difficult decisions. In the words of the immortal Clash, “Do I stay, or do I go?” Put another way, do they accept visiting or contingent positions (if they have the opportunity), or do they look for employment outside of academe? Or do they try both and hope for options? It isn’t easy to contemplate walking away from a career for which one has trained for 5, 6, or more years. And at the same time, one has to eat, pay rent, and often provide for children.\n\nPlayers go where they are drafted. It often doesn’t matter where you would like to live, where your family lives, or where your spouse lives. In many fields, if a candidate wants a job, they go where the offer takes them, be it Green Bay, Dallas, or Detroit. I’ve known more than a few people who have ended up in locations that they love, but such an outcome is no guarantee.\n\nPlayers often get traded. It is increasingly common for academics to change jobs at some point in their careers. In some cases, mobility has been more of an issue in the current economic crisis for many academics, but it is still a possibility. Some faculty apply elsewhere looking for the elusive “better fit” while others face the elimination of positions due to budget cuts and are forced to look for other opportunities.\n\nIf your last name happened to be Manning or Tebow, your agent might be able to contact a coach and express interest in playing for the team, otherwise, forget it. In most cases, cold-calling a department of InMyDreams University won’t give a candidate any advantage whatsoever. For many non-academics, this is the part of the market that is most difficult to process.\n\nThere is life after football. Or at least, so it seems. Being a professional athlete requires a skill set that isn’t easily or obviously transferrable to a wide range of other vocations. Similarly, a Ph. D. in medieval French monasticism or contemporary American poetry doesn’t seem like it would necessarily prepare one for a career outside of the academy. But appearances can be deceiving. The difficulty is repackaging the degree into the marketable skills which helped you to earn it. The Chronicle has featured several articles on non-academic and alternative academic career paths, some serious; others less so. Those who have pursued such paths have reported that not only are their personally rewarding, but many of them are also financially more rewarding that an academic career. Finding those jobs is another issue.\n\nIn a particularly interesting twist this year, one undrafted athlete received a great deal of attention because despite receiving calls from several teams with contract offers, he wanted to pursue his education. Specifically, he wanted to pursue a Ph.D. in history. When I read that, my heart sank. Not because I am opposed to the pursuit of higher education (clearly, that isn’t the case) or because I think that this particular person is unsuited for the degree. I’ve never met this student, so who am I to suggest what he might or might not be capable of achieving. But I have read the essays by Thomas Benton and others about the difficulties of securing full-time employment in the humanities (See “Graduate School in the Humanities: Just Don’t Go” for a start), and I could not help but worry while many in the sports media applauded him for choosing his education over football. In fact, in many other scenarios, I myself would applaud an student for choosing their education over other pursuits, be the athletic or artistic or otherwise extracurricular. Of course, if a student plans to make their living as a concert violinist, then she better spend her time in the practice room, but if that same student plans to apply to medical school after college, then at a certain point, the bow must be placed in the case in favor of the pencil (or laptop). Please note, I spent three years as a music major in college, so I’m not at all knocking those who make other choices here.\n\nUltimately, Scott Sicko decided to sign with the Dallas Cowboys and put his dreams of a graduate degree in history on hold for the time being. At the end of the day, it sounds like he is happy with his decision, and that’s what really matters. The only thing I know for certain is that if he does decide to go back to school at some point, those NFL paychecks (even if they aren’t for millions of dollars) will make life as a graduate student in the humanities a whole lot easier.\n\nBut for the rest of us who were not actual NFL prospects, perhaps this analogy might help to explain the difficulties of the profession to those outside of it. How do you explain academia to family and/or friends? Have you found other strategies?

We asked China-based journalist Steven Schwankert to give us the Chinese perspective on censorship, Google, and the US call for more \"Internet freedom.\"\n\nOfficial responses\n\nOn January 12, Google said on its corporate blog that it was considering its options after discovering cyber attacks against it that had resulted in the theft of Google intellectual property. The post said that the company believed the attacks originated from China and had also targeted the e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists, who were not named.\n\nThe Chinese government has vehemently denied any involvement in the attacks. The government's ire increased when US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joined the fray on January 21, with her speech on Internet freedom. Ironically, considering the topic and China's repeated claims to run an \"open\" Internet, the link to the US State Department speech transcript is blocked in China, although the State Dept.'s website itself is not.\n\nThe government and its state-run media have been more aggressive in the reaction to Clinton than in addressing Google directly. China's Ministry of Commerce said at a press conference on January 15 that it had not received any notification of Google's complaints or impending withdrawal from China, and added blandly that all \"foreign-funded enterprises should respect the host country's laws and regulations.\"\n\nChinese Vice-Foreign Minister He Yafei said on January 21 that \"people should not read too much into the 'Google incident.'\" He said that \"Google and other foreign enterprises operating in China face problems [which] should be resolved through Chinese law and courts, and that the Chinese government is willing to help them solve these problems. The 'Google incident' should not be linked to the two governments and bilateral ties.\"\n\nBoth he and the Ministry of Commerce's remarks are Chinese government boilerplate responses.\n\nThe Chinese press has been slightly less restrained in its handling of the issue, but it too has focused not on Google but on what is perceived as US \"information imperialism.\"\n\nThat phrase has appeared in several articles, including a January 25 article in the Chinese edition of Global Times, one of the country's more nationalist newspapers. That piece suggested that \"Obama and Hillary (as the Secretary of State is known, to distinguish her from her former president husband of the same surname) risk the backing of the world.\"\n\n\"Whether Democrats or Republicans, American foreign policy has long had a tendency to make a particular group or country a target,\" it added. It said that \"for China, [Clinton's speech] amounted to 'information imperialism,' a huge gap between the two sides in different values and political systems.\"\n\nThe country's English-language media has maintained a full-court press, with articles about alleged US hypocrisy popping up daily. The January 28 China Daily included the article \"US duplicity in Internet freedom.\"\n\n\"The US is not advocating Internet freedom, but just US interests,\" it said. Chinese media also gave prominent coverage to Bill Gates' statement that restrictions in China were \"very limited.\"\n\nRedefining \"open\"\n\nChina routinely refers to its Internet access as \"open,\" despite being one of the most closely monitored and heavily regulated in the world. Blocking of access to foreign websites began in 1996. The first to be walled off were Western news sites like NYTimes.com and CNN.com, those supporting independence movements in Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang, and those trafficking in brand-name pornography (like Playboy.com).\n\nBlockings are now more sophisticated. For example, some pornography sites are blocked, but a Google Image search that seems to be revealing too much skin will see most or all of the image results coming up blank. Google News can be reached easily, and some news searches are allowed. However, many searches involving the word \"China\" will display results—but not permit access to them directly.\n\nChina's blocking strategy has moved away from news sites and now more directly targets social networking sites. Facebook and Twitter are blocked for their ability to organize groups with anti-government intentions. Google's YouTube is also unavailable; the site was blocked in March 2009, when video of anti-Chinese riots in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa appeared on the site. Leading Chinese video sites Youku.com and Tudou.com actively monitor submissions and delete those that they consider inappropriate or in violation of Chinese law.\n\nUnlike most markets, where Google is dominant, it has always trailed in China. Competitor and search engine market leader Baidu launched in 2000. Although the Google.com site was available earlier in China, with searching in Chinese supported since September 2000, Google's Chinese-language site did not launch until 2006.\n\nThat launch took Google into treacherous waters. In order to launch Google.cn, a China-based, Chinese-language interface, it agreed to censor its search results, a move that led many to question whether the company was violating one of its own mottos: \"Don't be evil.\"\n\nEven the launch of the Chinese-language site did not close the gap between Baidu and Google significantly, though. Baidu has around 60 percent market share; Google, around 30 percent.\n\nGoogle.com and Google.cn both offer Chinese-language results to queries in Chinese. However, although a China-based user of Google.com may see controversial results regarding topics like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, access to those links may be blocked by Chinese filtering software and firewalls. Google.cn users would likely not, at least not prior to Google's January 12 announcement, even see those results. Google.cn's servers are based in China.\n\n\"Baidu leveraged Chinese netizens' natural propensity to share and create content and seamlessly integrated it in to the overall search experience way before Google's attempts,\" said Sam Flemming, founder and chairman of CIC, an Internet word-of-mouth monitoring and consulting firm based in Shanghai.\n\nVox populi\n\nLost in the shuffle of the US-China, Google-China conflict is the end user in China, as it usually is in any discussion of Internet freedom here. What will the impact of these disputes be for Chinese users, and what do they think?\n\nAlthough the filtering policy has critics both in China and abroad, how much those debates ultimately affect the average user is questionable. The vast majority of China's 400 million Internet users will turn to Youku.com or Tudou.com for video content, not YouTube. They'll turn to Taobao.com for online commerce, although Amazon does have a presence here via its Amazon.cn site.\n\nFor search, there's Baidu. Sina, Sohu, and Netease emerged in the 1990s as China's top portal sites and have never looked back. The trio are still the top online news sources for Chinese users.\n\nOpinions of a possible Google departure ranged from apathy to regret.\n\n\"I don't think they'll really leave,\" said Cici Deng, who runs a travel agency in Beijing. \"I use Baidu more, but not exclusively. I use them for different things.\" Deng said she prefers Baidu for news, Google for pure search.\n\n\"I don't really care. It doesn't bother me. I use both, but if Google leaves, whatever,\" said Sherry Qiu, an ad sales manager for a Beijing-based Internet company.\n\n\"It's really a shame if Google leaves. We won't have any choice then,\" said Vivian Hu, a magazine editor.\n\n\"I use Google.com, and I like it much better,\" said Molly Li, who works for a European technology company. Because she searches often in both Chinese and English, sticking with Google makes more sense rather than switching back and forth with Baidu.\n\nChina's blogosphere has been particularly active in taking on the issue. Blogger Hong Bo, better known as Keso, one of China's most popular IT bloggers, displays the phrase \"F--- the GFW [Great Firewall]\" prominently on his blog. On January 13, he wrote an impassioned assessment of what a Google withdrawal would mean to him.\n\n\"For me, this is a painful choice. For most of my online life, I rely on Google. I use Google search, Gmail e-mail, I use Google Reader to read the content of a large number of subscriptions, and use Google Docs to handle all office document processing, photos on Picasa, and geo-tagging for all of these, I do not have any alternative third-party tools,\" he said. \"Not to mention that there are a large number of Chinese enterprises, such as Alibaba, that rely on Google's search and advertising for global marketing.\n\n\"YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Blogger, WordPress, Google the world's best sites and services, one by one removed from China, this may be our generation's greatest tragedy for the Chinese people.\"",
  "latent_20269": "On Sunday President Donald Trump plans to interview four candidates to replace ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn: acting adviser Keith Kellogg, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, and Lieutenant General Robert Caslen, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe president said that he expects to make a decision in the \"next couple of days.\"\n\nAmbassador John Bolton has emerged as the favorite among senior White House officials and members of the National Security Council, according to The Washington Free Beacon:\n\nAmong Bolton's most vocal supporters are senior administration officials loyal to Flynn and who are upset at the general's firing. Multiple sources described an effort by these Flynn loyalists to ensure that Bolton is selected as his replacement. The selection of Bolton as the next national security adviser would empower Flynn's allies still in the White House and send a message that his national security vision is represented within the Trump administration. Bolton is also favored by White House staffers who are opposed to the selection of any candidate who criticized President Trump during the 2016 campaign. President Donald Trump has not settled on a final selection yet and is also eyeing retired Army Gen. Keith Kellogg, who has been acting national security adviser since Flynn's departure, as well as other candidates. \"There's a strong inclination in the NSC towards the kind of experienced leadership Bolton would represent,\" said one current official, who requested anonymity to speak freely about the situation. \"He knows the ins and outs of D.C. but he's not an establishment, Never Trump type. There's also a lot of respect for General Kellogg and KT McFarland, both of whom have really stepped up under challenging circumstances.\"\n\nBolton, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration, is seen to have the experience necessary to give the White House credibility at a time when the administration is facing intense criticism from the media and subversion from Obama holdovers in the State Department.\n\n\"The one thing that makes Bolton more qualified than anyone else for the Trump era is that he has a veteran genius-level understanding of the organizational structure of our nation's diplomatic and intelligence apparatus,\" a veteran foreign policy insider told the Free Beacon.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, Bolton would be able to \"help root out Obama administration holdovers still working in the government.\n\nA source close to the NSC and the White House told PJ Media:\n\nHistorically, the most successful national security advisers have been those with a fearless vision in tune with the presidents they serve. More often than not, the successful ones aren't military leaders, despite their remarkable and honorable service to America.",

  "latent_20552": "Discarded and corroded cans of methyl bromide found on a wildlife preserve. (Photo: Michael McCullough)\n\nIt sounds more like the sinister scheme of a villain in a thriller movie than a Delaware family’s sleepy island vacation: A month ago, a tasteless, odorless, colorless neurotoxin poisoned a family of four while on vacation on the Virgin Islands. The two teenage sons remain in comas.\n\nTurns out, it wasn’t an evil plot; it was your neighborhood pest control company, which sprayed a banned pesticide in the condominium below the family’s rented abode. In late April, an expanded investigation by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uncovered the use of the banned pesticide in Puerto Rico as well. But what about here on the mainland?\n\nThe fumigant responsible for the incident, methyl bromide, was banned for structural use many years ago due to extreme health risks. It’s also been linked to birth defects. And it was supposed to be completely phased out in the United States in 2005, for its role as an ozone depleter, through the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement, according to the EPA. (The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, US territories, must also abide by the EPA’s rulings.)\n\nYet, millions of pounds of the fumigant continue to be used – in US agriculture. Using methyl bromide on strawberries and other fruit, potting soil, nuts, grains and more, California alone used almost 4 million pounds of methyl bromide in 2012, under critical use exemptions and quarantine and pre-shipment exemptions provided by the EPA.\n\nAcute exposures of families on vacation are sensational, dramatic and rare; exposure to pesticides on the fields and in agricultural communities, however, can be an everyday occurrence. Workers re-entering fields after fumigation may or may not see a warning sign; applications may be caught in a breeze and move toward nearby schools or homes; workers applying the chemicals may not have sufficient training, may not have access to safety equipment and may face the risk of heat illness when wearing the protective gear.\n\nAlthough the exposures may not always cause seizures or a coma, it may cause other acute reactions, like headaches, dizziness, burning eyes or nausea. And chronic exposures can lead to long-term problems; long-term residence on or near a farm that uses pesticides is linked to early onset of Parkinson’s disease. It’s also on California’s Proposition 65 list, linking exposure to reproductive harm.\n\nFrom a clinician’s perspective, pesticides are troubling. Acute exposures can be hard to diagnose. Methyl bromide exposure symptoms, for example, can be confused with the flu. Health issues from chronic exposures are particularly difficult to pin down on pesticides, and aren’t required to be reported to state authorities. That’s why clinicians – particularly clinicians focused on serving farm worker populations – have to maintain a heightened index of suspicion of pesticide exposure for agricultural workers and those living in rural communities. We at Migrant Clinicians Network (MCN) continue to partner with community health centers to provide education and resources for primary care providers to better recognize exposures – and to keep that index of suspicion high.\n\nWhen we do identify acute exposures, we’re required to report them, in the majority of states, including in California. Pesticide incident reports are extremely valuable to state and federal regulators, allowing them to spot trends and identify practices or products that are particularly hazardous. These trends alert regulators of the need to improve protections for farm workers such as instances where a required restricted entry interval (REI) is not long enough to protect field workers. MCN’s online map assists clinicians in quickly accessing reporting information.\n\nGrowers may counter that they have had trouble transitioning to an effective pesticide alternative – hence the critical use exemptions. Yet, growers in Europe have already found alternatives, as methyl bromide is fully banned there. Here in the states, DDT, another colorless, tasteless pesticide, was far more integrated into the agricultural industry than methyl bromide is today, when it was banned in the early 1970s. Perhaps we wouldn’t have seen the dramatic rebound of many bird species, like the bald eagle, if we provided exemptions on the use of DDT in the US agricultural sector.\n\nSo, how does this thriller end? Movie villains are easy to deal with – just send in the superhero. While few of us would claim that the federal government is our superhero, it has the power to stop future methyl bromide poisonings. The EPA has agreed to the 100 percent phaseout of methyl bromide by 2005, and yet, 10 years later, the pesticide is still in use because of those exemptions. The environmental and human health toxicity of the pesticide is well-documented, and merits a full phaseout, without exceptions.",
  "latent_20557": "The prospect of Trump or Cruz at the top of the ticket makes Republicans holding onto control of the Senate much more difficult. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nWith Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz seemingly positioned to fight it out for the Republican presidential nomination, Democrats are now poised to take over the Senate in November.\n\nThe two Republicans still in the race who could help their party’s Senate prospects, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, continue to flounder. While a deadlocked GOP convention in Cleveland could, at least in theory, nominate a candidate with broad appeal and low enough negatives to revive the party’s Senate prospects, that development is both a long way in the future and a long shot.\n\nNo, there is little hard evidence yet that a huge Democratic electoral wave has started to develop and at this point, Democratic control of the Senate is not yet inevitable. But that should not obscure the fact that a fundamental shift has occurred in the electoral cycle over the past six weeks.\n\nUp to this point, the burden of proof has been on Democrats to demonstrate that they can oust four or five Republican senators and win control of the chamber. But now, with Republicans in disarray and the party flirting with selecting a weak general election nominee, the benefit of the doubt has shifted away from the GOP and to the Democrats.\n\nThe burden is on Republican strategists and nominees to prove that they can hold the Senate majority even in light of the party’s civil war.\n\nSome suggest that Republican down-ballot candidates might be able to retain their seats even if the top of the ticket performs poorly, primarily by localizing their races. That conclusion seems more than a bit naïve given what happened in 1964, 1972 and 1980.\n\nIt was one thing for Democrat Heidi Heitkamp to eke out a narrow North Dakota Senate victory even when Republican Mitt Romney was carrying the state in 2012. But the situation would be dramatically worse for a Republican running for re-election in a swing state when his or her party is in the middle of a political civil war and with a controversial, radioactive nominee at the top of the ticket.\n\nAs the Republican nominee, the uncompromising Cruz would end up defining his party’s positions on key issues, while the controversial Trump would inject himself into every race across the country. Either candidacy would make it very difficult for GOP Senate nominees to run their own races and establish their own brand.\n\nPart of the argument for both Trump and Cruz is that each man would turn out new voters on Election Day – populists for Trump and conservatives for Cruz – who would help down-ballot Republicans. That might be true. But it is also very likely that both would lose more usually reliable Republican voters, who would vote Democratic or stay away from the polls because they find Cruz too conservative or unlikeable and Trump too crude and authoritarian.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton’s personal favorable numbers are poor, sitting generally in the low 40s, Trump’s favorable ratings are usually in the 30s and Cruz’s are even a hair lower.\n\nEven with her obvious weaknesses, Clinton would be a solid favorite over Trump or Cruz to win the White House. That would mean that Democrats would need to net only four Senate seats instead of the five they would need if a Republican were elected president.\n\nWhen this cycle began, every reputable analyst noted that the GOP faced a difficult challenge in trying to hold the Senate. The combination of presidential year turnout, more straight-ticket voting and the Senate seats up in 2016 conspired to work to the Democrats’ advantage.\n\nGiven what has happened inside the Republican Party over the past few months, it is difficult to believe that the party’s Senate prospects are as good as they once were, when most observers assumed the GOP would nominate a mainstream candidate.\n\nAt least five incumbent GOP senators from Democratic-leaning or competitive states were facing difficult re-election races this year even under the most favorable circumstances – Mark Kirk of Illinois, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Rob Portman of Ohio. A Republican open seat in Florida also looked at great risk.\n\nAdd in the deep division within the Republican Party, and the possibility of Trump or Cruz leading the national GOP ticket, and all – or at least almost all – of those races suddenly look much more uphill. In addition, states like North Carolina, Indiana, Missouri and Arizona look more interesting.\n\nThe fight for the Senate obviously took on greater importance with the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The GOP’s worsening position for November raises new questions of whether the Republican Senate should take up President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, when he makes that nomination, or risk dealing with a new Democratic president and a Democratic Senate majority in 2017.\n\nRelated:\n\nRoll Call Race Ratings Map: Ratings for Every House and Senate Race in 2016 Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.",

The panel, now made up of 45 countries, is \"exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women.\" Many are upset with the decision, as official policy in Saudi Arabia forces gender segregation for those who aren't related, among other extreme policies and practices.\n\nHillel Neuer‏, the executive editor of UN Watch (a nongovernmental watchdog that monitors the United Nations), said that the inclusion of Saudi Arabia on the women's panel is like \"making an arsonist into the town fire chief\" and called it \"a black day for women's rights, and for all human rights.\"\n\n\"Saudi discrimination against women is gross and systematic in law and in practice,\" Neuer said. \"Every Saudi woman must have a male guardian who makes all critical decisions on her behalf, controlling a woman’s life from her birth until death.

  "latent_20673": "Dallas Eakins’ rookie season as a National Hockey League head coach didn’t quite live up to the advance billing.\n\nHe arrived in Edmonton, the product of a Toronto media market that habitually overrates its hockey people, then inherited a goaltending situation in Edmonton that Scotty Bowman could not have succeeded with in his prime.\n\nHe had a plan and wasn’t afraid to say he knew how to make it succeed. But in the end, it doesn’t matter how good the driver is if the car is running on three cylinders, and the Oilers were out of the playoff picture by Dec. 1, completely irrelevant by the new year.\n\nUndeterred, this summer Eakins has set out to learn from two football men about building “a program” that can succeed in Edmonton. His general manager has afforded him a stronger roster to work with, and Eakins has gone to school — literally — to give that roster a better chance of finally crawling out of the NHL basement.\n\n“It’s for me,” he said of his travels, “but it’s for our organization, our staff… and in the end, it’s for our players. That’s who it ends up being for, every time.”\n\nEakins spoke to Sportsnet Tuesday from the University of Missouri campus, between meetings with Tigers head football coach Gary Pinkel. There he listened and learned how a successful program was erected from the ashes, pretty much identical to what they’re hoping for in Edmonton.\n\n“I want to make sure that we are open to all ideas on better ways to prepare the players. Whatever is going to help these players play better and win hockey games, then that’s my job to go seeks it out. It will never end.”\n\nGive Eakins credit. While some coaches are at the lake cabin or on the golf course, he has spent the summer revamping his own program in Edmonton.\n\nGone is assistant coach Steve Smith, while longtime Oilers assistant Kelly Buchberger has been reassigned within the organization. The young head coach recruited veteran assistant Craig Ramsay, promoted Rocky Thompson from the farm club as the third assistant (Keith Acton remains from last year), and hired an analytics man in Tyler Dellow.\n\nThen he went to spend some time prior to the Dallas Cowboys training camp in Oxnard, Calif., with Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett.\n\n“The one thing that’s happening in hockey is, our staffs are getting bigger and bigger. Not just coaches, but strength guys, [dieticians], etc. It just keeps growing and growing. I’m not prepping a team; I’m prepping a staff,” Eakins said. “Dallas… is a big machine — a team that’s followed very closely by a lot of fans and a lot of media. I was able to get a real good look at Jason Garrett’s program with his coaches, how he delegates authority how he runs his meetings.\n\n“We had great chats on our availability to the media, how he goes about it. I sat with their PR guy. They were really open, and I was honoured to be there. It was fabulous.”\n\nThe theme continued at Mizzou, where Pinkel took a Southeastern Conference doormat and over 12 years has built them into a perennial contender.\n\n“These college teams, it’s [all] about the program,” Eakins said. “There tends not to be a lot of change, so they really get their identity down, what it means to be a Tiger here. The accountability level, the responsibility level — all those things. I wanted to see that from Gary, because I now he’s really built an amazing program here. And I wanted to see how he handled his staff. And… he handles it differently [from Garrett].”\n\nHe’s an interesting cat, Eakins. Like him or not, he’s no cookie-cutter version of what a hockey coach is supposed to be.\n\nHe’s in Leadville, Colo., today in preparation for his fourth Leadville Trail 100, a grueling mountain bike race that goes Saturday. And though he’s often accused of being overconfident, Eakins is the first guy out there asking questions of coaches in other sports, trying to become a better coach.\n\n“The game, it just keeps changing,” he said. “I want to make sure that we have every box checked off. I like where we’re at right now, and I want the players to know we’re doing everything we can to prepare them for success. The right coaching, the right system, the right everything.”",
  "latent_20720": "This November, voters in Massachusetts will be asked whether to legalize marijuana. Our state has already decriminalized the drug for personal use, and we’ve made it legally available for medical use. The question before us now is whether marijuana should be fully legal and widely available for commercial sale. We think the answer is “no.”\n\nWhere marijuana is legal, young people are more likely to use it, according to a January report from the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. The report found that while use among minors has declined nationwide in recent years, states like Colorado have seen an increase. There, young people are 20 percent more likely to have used marijuana regularly since it became legal for adults two years ago. And they’re 40 percent more likely to be regular users than their peers in Massachusetts. Kids in states that have legalized marijuana have easier access to the drug. And many believe that, since the drug is legal for adults, it must be safe to use.\n\nWhat the evidence shows us, though, is that marijuana is not safe. Regular use that starts in adolescence has been shown to impair brain development, shrink school and career outcomes, and even lower IQ. With the high THC levels in marijuana today — it’s up to seven times more potent than it was in the 1970s — about one in six users who start as teenagers become physically dependent. And increasingly, medical science is also showing a frightening correlation between regular marijuana use and severe mental health issues. Even an untrained eye can see differences between the MRI brain images of those who habitually use marijuana and those who don’t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also serious and immediate implications for public safety. In the year after the drug was legalized in Colorado, marijuana-related emergency room visits increased nearly 30 percent, as did traffic deaths involving marijuana. Edible marijuana products — often in the form of brownies, candy, or soda — pose a particular threat for children, who may mistake them for regular treats. According to data from the National Poison Data System, marijuana exposure has been on the rise among children under six, particularly in states where the drug is legal. High potency edible products also pose a risk to adults, who can easily consume more marijuana than intended and experience serious adverse effects. These products are rarely labeled properly to reflect their psychoactive THC content, which is particularly concerning given that edible marijuana products constitute almost half of the legal marijuana market in Colorado.\n\nGet Today in Opinion in your inbox: Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday-Friday. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nThe costs to our first responders, our medical system, and our cities and towns must be factored in when we speculate about the potential increase in tax revenues from legalizing marijuana. In Colorado, marijuana sales taxes account for just a fraction of one percent of total state revenues. Here in Massachusetts, we face the possibility that any new revenue would be vastly insufficient to cover the cost of ambulance rides, emergency room visits, and treatment. And these are just the hard costs; they don’t include the suffering of the injured and their families.\n\nThe financial backers of legalization are not neighborhood leaders, medical professionals, or grass-roots activists. They’re big businesses and investors, who are spending millions on campaigns across the country because they will profit from the legalization of marijuana. A high-level official at the Marijuana Policy Project, a driving force behind the Massachusetts initiative, recently resigned from the organization due to his growing alarm that the marijuana industry is putting profits over people and taking over the movement for legalization. Motivated by the profit potential of dominating a new marketplace, proponents know it’s not in their best interest to disclose or address the serious threats to public health and safety, nor to represent accurately the experiences of Colorado and other states.\n\nWe hope voters will listen to the doctors, counselors, and substance-abuse specialists in our own world-class medical community who are expressing concerns over legalization. Decades of research have now debunked the myth that marijuana is harmless. The science also shows that regular marijuana users — especially those who start at a young age — are more likely to try more dangerous drugs.\n\nFor the past year, our teams have worked tirelessly, together and with our partners across Massachusetts, to combat the heroin and prescription-drug epidemic that is ravaging our state. Our emergency departments and drug treatment centers are beyond capacity, and our first responders are stretched to their limits. We should not be expanding access to a drug that will further drain our health and safety resources.\n\nCharlie Baker is the governor of Massachusetts. Maura Healey is the state attorney general.

We delight hundreds of millions monthly active users around the world through franchises including Activision's Call of Duty®, Destiny and Skylanders®, Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft®, Overwatch®, Hearthstone®, Diablo®, StarCraft®, and Heroes of the Storm®, and King's Candy Crush™, Pet Rescue™, Bubble Witch™ and Farm Heroes™. The company is one of the Fortune \"100 Best Companies To Work For®\". Headquartered in Santa Monica, California, Activision Blizzard has operations throughout the world, and its games are played in 196 countries. More information about Activision Blizzard and its products can be found on the company's website, www.activisionblizzard.com.\n\n1 Based on data from the NPD Group and GfK Chart-Track\n\n2 U.S. ranking for Apple App Store and Google Play Store combined, per App Annie Intelligence for fourth quarter 2016\n\n3 Per internal tracking\n\nA Monthly Active User (“MAU”) Definition: We monitor MAUs as a key measure of the overall size of our user base and their regular engagement with our portfolio of games. MAUs are the number of individuals who played a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who plays two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision Publishing and King, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.\n\nB Gross bookings is an operating metric that represents the total cash spent by players in the period for the purchase of virtual items. King uses gross bookings to evaluate its results of operations, generate future operating plans and assess performance. Gross bookings is the total price paid by players, which includes indirect taxes (sales tax or value added tax etc.), platform providers fees, and King’s share of revenues.\n\nC Net effect of accounting treatment from revenue deferrals on certain of our online enabled products. Some of our games’ online functionality represents an essential component of gameplay and, as a result, a more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable. As a result, we recognize revenues attributed to these game titles over their estimated service periods, which is generally less than a year. The related cost of revenues is deferred and recognized as an expense as the related revenues are recognized. Impact from changes in deferrals refers to the net effect from revenue deferrals accounting treatment for the purposes of revenues, and together with the related cost of revenues deferrals treatment and the related tax impacts for the purposes of EPS. Internally, management excludes the impact of this change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues when evaluating the company’s operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of its management team. Management believes this is appropriate because doing so enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers. In addition, management believes excluding the change in deferred revenues and the related cost of revenues provides a much more timely indication of trends in our operating results.\n\nNon-GAAP (as previously defined) and Non-GAAP (redefined) Financial Measures: In accordance with the updated Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations issued by the SEC staff on May 17, 2016, beginning with the reporting of our second-quarter 2016 results, we have reported our financial results and provided our outlook using GAAP and non-GAAP (redefined). We have historically provided Non-GAAP (as previously defined) financial measures. The only difference between the two measures is the inclusion (Non-GAAP (redefined)) or exclusion (Non-GAAP (as previously defined)) of the impact from revenue deferrals accounting treatment on certain of our online enabled products. Please see materials from July 29, 2016 call for further details.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: As a supplement to our financial measures presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), Activision Blizzard presents certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as more important than, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with the company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nActivision Blizzard provides net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share and operating margin data and guidance both including (in accordance with GAAP) and excluding (non-GAAP) certain items. When relevant, the company also provides constant FX information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, Activision Blizzard provides EBITDA (defined as GAAP net income (loss) before interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and adjusted EBITDA (defined as non-GAAP operating margin (see non-GAAP financial measure below) before depreciation). The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items, as applicable in any given reporting period and our outlook:\n\nexpenses related to stock-based compensation;\n\nthe amortization of intangibles from purchase price accounting;\n\nfees and other expenses related to the King acquisition, inclusive of related debt financings, and refinancing of long-term debt, including penalties and the write off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs;\n\nrestructuring charges;\n\nother non-cash charges from reclassification of certain cumulative translation adjustments into earnings as required by GAAP; and\n\nthe income tax adjustments associated with any of the above items (tax impact on Non-GAAP pre-tax income is calculated under the same accounting principles applied to the GAAP pre-tax income under ASC 740, which employs an annual effective tax rate method to the results).\n\nIn the future, Activision Blizzard may also consider whether other items should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures used by the company. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional useful information to measure Activision Blizzard’s financial and operating performance. In particular, the measures facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and help investors to better understand the operating results of Activision Blizzard by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company’s core business, operating results or future outlook. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, along with others, in assessing the company’s operating results, and measuring compliance with the requirements of the company’s debt financing agreements, as well as in planning and forecasting.\n\nActivision Blizzard’s non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, and the terms non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP or adjusted EBITDA do not have a standardized meaning. Therefore, other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors a comparable view of Activision Blizzard’s performance in relation to other companies.\n\nManagement compensates for the limitations resulting from the exclusion of these items by considering the impact of the items separately and by considering Activision Blizzard’s GAAP, as well as non-GAAP, results and outlook, and by presenting the most comparable GAAP measures directly ahead of non-GAAP measures, and by providing a reconciliation that indicates and describes the adjustments made.\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements: The statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about (1) projections of revenues, expenses, income or loss, earnings or loss per share, cash flow or other financial items; (2) statements of our plans and objectives, including those related to releases of products and services; (3) statements of future financial or operating performance; (4) statements relating to the acquisition of King and expected impact of that transaction, including without limitation, the expected impact on Activision Blizzard, Inc.'s future financial results; and (5) statements of assumptions underlying such statements.

Although these forward-looking statements are believed to be true when made, they may ultimately prove to be incorrect.

Several models representing different phases of the mission such as the ground operations processes, engineered systems, and range components such as failure tree, blast, gas dispersion, and debris modeling are explained. These models are built using different simulation paradigms such as continuous, system dynamics, discrete-event, and agent-based simulation modeling. The High Level Architecture (HLA) is the backbone of this distributed simulation. The different design decisions and the information fusion scheme of this unique environment are explained in detail for decision-making. This can also help in the development of exploration missions beyond the International Space Station.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nDistributed simulation plays an important role in modeling complex systems. Space vehicle ground operations processing as well as ascent and decent phases are complex processes whose interactions give rise to the appearance of emergent properties [1–3]. For these cases, a Virtual Test Bed (VTB) was designed as the architecture to facilitate the integrated execution of different simulation models with other supporting nonsimulation applications [4–9].\n\nOur completed initial VTB development efforts (see Section 2) for modeling space shuttle missions and operations at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) are based on the High Level Architecture (HLA) and the run-time infrastructure (RTI). The RTI, a software implementation of the HLA Interface Specification, defines the common interfaces for distributed simulation systems during the execution of the HLA simulation [10–13]. It is the architectural foundation that promotes portability and interoperability. All shared information exchanged during a federation (i.e., a set of simulation models) execution must be passed through the RTI. The objective of the VTB developments is to provide a collaborative computing environment that supports the creation, execution, and reuse of simulations that are capable of integrating multidisciplinary models representing the elements of launch, ranges, and spaceport operations in order to assist with the cost analysis, flow optimization, and other important decision-making factors. The High Level Architecture (HLA) is used as a distributed simulation framework in the VTB. In general, simulation languages/packages may have special areas of use, distinct advanced features, and require specific computing environments such as operating systems (OSs), external application interfaces, and scripting languages. These characteristics of the modeling languages may impose difficulties when attempting to seamlessly integrate them with other simulation modeling languages/packages. As the application of HLA distributed simulation architectures widely spreads to different areas of application, the need for middleware development and/or adapters/controllers for communications becomes necessary [6, 12, 14]. The web can provide additional functionality to the HLA/RTI configurations.\n\nA number of distributed simulation research work have been focused on global cooperation via the web and its architectures [13, 15–20]. Our enhanced VTB approach considers the capabilities and constraints of web-enabled HLA/RTI configurations. Traditionally, vendor specific HLA/RTI implementations and different RTI versions imposed a number of restrictions on distributed simulations interoperability characteristics and services for heterogeneous domains. However, developments of HLA-based web service tools have enabled the introduction of simulation functionalities to heterogeneous users in remote locations in distributed simulation systems architectures [16]. For example, 3D visualization simulation capabilities can be introduced in a distributed simulation environment as a separate heterogeneous platform in a remote location. Tu et al. [18] proposed an HLA web-enabled type architecture to improve federate interoperability and agility within it distributed components. Their architecture developed a web-service bridge and server as an API to the Portico RTI implementation. In addition, other HLA-based web-service architecture implementations developed by researchers grant interoperation between heterogeneous simulation systems as discussed by Tang et al. [16]. According to Tang et al. [16], web-service architecture capability introduces the concept of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) which enables HLA-based architectures to deliver federate designs as applications with specific functionalities as a service to end users in remote locations. These developments support the concept of layered architectures.\n\nOur new developments with the VTB are based on a layered approach. The enhanced VTB architecture design approach adopts the benefits of layered architectures and more flexible middleware solutions to achieve a desirable interoperability and scalability distributed simulation platform. Al-Zoubi and Wainer [15] explain that structural rules inherent in many distributed simulation middleware solutions, like HLA/RTI, impose constraints in scalability and interoperability capabilities. In their work the authors propose the RESTful Interoperability Simulation Environment (RISE) architecture for distributed simulation designs in open computing networks like the Web. Their distributed simulation environment allows for better decoupling through middleware HLA/RTI configurations for achieving enhanced scalability of distributed simulation designs. Further, Topcu and Oguztuzun [17] explain how the layered architecture approach to distributed simulation systems separates the user-interface, the simulation main control method, and the HLA-specific federate communication mechanisms for enhancing the system flexibility. Their idea is that designers can develop or implement the different federation components in their programming languages or platforms of choice and to capture the repetitive HLA interface implementation in one layer for design simplicity. The layered approach is taken into consideration in our enhanced VTB configuration for the implementation of the mission of the SLS and MPCV vehicles being launched from KSC to the International Space Station.\n\nThis paper expands on lessons learned from our initial developments carried out in order to start the modeling of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) being launched from KSC to the International Space Station (ISS). In addition, this paper discusses the different design decisions and the information fusion scheme of the VTB for decision-making that can help in the development of exploration missions beyond the ISS.\n\n2. Initial Efforts and Lessons Learned\n\nSince 2002, we have developed several configurations using the VTB. NASA and the Defense Industry have been our major supporters. The dominant architecture was a centralized one (i.e., centralized RTI Node [13]). Figure 1 illustrates the distributed simulation configuration of the NASA space shuttle launch. The basic federates in this configuration are described as follows.\n\nFigure 1: Space shuttle distributed simulation configuration using HLA/RTI (local area network (LAN)/virtual private network (VPN)).\n\n(1) The Shuttle Model Federate (SMF). This federate is a simulation model written in Arena (http://www.arenasimulation.com/Arena_Home.aspx). SMF was developed by experts in discrete-event simulation and space shuttle operations. SMF simulates the flow of a space shuttle from landing at KSC through its normal processing assembly flow and its launch pad flow [21]. If the mission is a success, this federate displays the Shuttle flying around the earth and returning to KSC followed by landing and repeating the operational cycle. However, if the mission ends up in an accident then the display screen changes and shows the explosion of the shuttle, the date and time of the accident, coordinates where the explosion occurred, and amount of contaminants released into the atmosphere from the shuttle's unused propellants at that location. When the shuttle to be launched to the space reaches the launch pad, a signal is sent through the RTI indicating that the shuttle is ready for launch. This signal is received by the Control Room Model Federate (CRMF), and the shuttle waits for authorization for liftoff.\n\n(2) Control Room Model Federate (CRMF). The Control Room Model Federate (CRMF) is an AnyLogic- (http://www.anylogic.com/) based model which simulates the behavior of the shuttle’s hardware/software systems. This model is based on continuous simulation and electronics/Boolean logic. It is developed by experts in continuous simulation and electrical/mechanical and systems/software engineers with experience in the NASA shuttle hardware/software systems. When the shuttle arrives at the launch pad, a message is sent to the CRMF. On receiving the message that the shuttle is ready for launch, the CRMF is activated. CRMF checks for failure in four systems—electronic, electrical, communications, and propulsion systems. After verifying that no delays or scrubs occurred, CRMF waits for a go-ahead signal from the Weather Expert Model Federate (WEMF), and then it authorizes the launch by sending a message through the RTI that the systems in the CRMF are all green and the launch is a “GO.”\n\n(3) Weather Expert Model Federate (WEMF). Weather Expert Model Federate (WEMF) is a sophisticated Java-based model. The main functionality of this federate is to show a summary of the weather forecast (updated at specific intervals of time (e.g., minutes, hours)) [22]. The information is collected by Java servlets from different web sites, like the temperature and wind speed from http://weather.noaa.gov/weather (some of these websites are of open access and others are military/classified). The WEMF has several processing systems based on neural networks and wavelets that perform the required analysis of the weather conditions and the images. A set of Java servlets get the data or images from various sources across the US. Information about a 7-day weather forecast is combined with images from the GOES satellite (http://www.goes.noaa.gov/) with daily weather forecasts. Apart from these images, specific weather details like humidity, wind speed, barometric pressure, heat index, and dew point are updated at very short intervals. The US cloud classification is provided by the Naval Postgraduate School at Monterey, California. The lightning data is provided by the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) and at every 30 minute interval; details about lightning strikes across the US are updated. The surface temperature contour and surface wind speed are provided by the National Weather Service. The sea state analysis is provided to understand the booster rocket recovery operations. Weather criteria for an emergency landing at the Transoceanic Abort Landing Sites (TALS) are monitored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Spain and North Africa (http://www.srh.noaa.gov/smg/smgwx.htm). The data is downloaded from various agencies in the format of images and numerical data. Once the data is downloaded, the images are processed and specific values are derived for Florida/KSC. The data is used as inputs to an expert system that suggests the shuttle launch decision by GO or NO-GO. The WEMF receives a message from the CRMF that all the systems are a GO. Then WEMF checks if the weather conditions are also a GO and sends a message through RTI for authorizing the launch. Weather information can be accessed by querying WEMF through the RTI at any time.\n\n(4) Monte Carlo Model Federate (MCMF). The Monte Carlo Model Federate (MCMF) is a discrete model developed in Arena (http://www.arenasimulation.com/Arena_Home.aspx). MCMF is notified through the RTI when the simulated shuttle lifts off. It also receives a message from the CRMF that a launch took place. The MCMF then determines if the launch will result in a success or if a disaster will occur by generating random numbers as is done in all MCMF (this is based on historical data and very sophisticated failure models at the subcomponent level developed for the NASA Shuttle; see Figure 2). As per the outcome of the simulation, an appropriate message indicating the success or the accident result is sent through the RTI.\n\nFigure 2: Top of the failure tree adapted from the reliability study of Fragola and Maggio [ Top of the failure tree adapted from the reliability study of Fragola and Maggio [ 23 ], where LOV is loss of vehicle, SSME is Space shuttle Main Engines, SRB is Solid Rocket Boosters, ORB is Orbiter, ET is External Tank, FTCEGD is Failure to Contain Energetic Gas and Debris, FTMPP is Failure to Maintain Proper Propulsion, FTMPC is Failure to Maintain Proper Configuration, and SMEDS is Simultaneous Dual SSME Premature Shutdown. Probabilities of failure are also indicated.\n\n(5) Virtual Range Federate (VRF). The Virtual Range Federate (VRF) is composed of several simulation models and software systems. The simulation models are continuous and model the shuttle trajectory, gas dispersions, and clouds of the huttle fuel systems. The Shuttle trajectory model was provided by the NASA experts in rocket trajectories using MATLAB/Simulink (http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/). The gas dispersion and clouds simulation model are a modification of CALPUFF (http://gcmd.nasa.gov/records/CALPUFF.html). CALPUFF is an advanced nonsteady-state meteorological and air quality modeling system developed by Atmospheric Studies Group (ASG—http://www.src.com/calpuff/calpuff1.htm). The model has been adopted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) [24–26]. In addition, VRF has an incorporated geographical information system (ArcGIS—http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis) with several databases. This federate displays a counter of the number of launches and a summary of the current weather if the message from the MCMF indicates successful launch. In case an accident results from the MCMF, the VRF activates and determines the location of an accident in the space (using the trajectory simulation model) and the amount of the contaminants released into the atmosphere (using the gas and cloud dispersion model). Similar to all other federates, VRF includes a clock displaying the date and time. Information from the VRF is transmitted through the RTI to SMF federate. The concentration of the contaminant in different locations around the accident site is determined by the VRF one hour after the accident by initiating the gas dispersion model and using the weather conditions for the day of the simulated launch (obtained from the WEMF). This information is provided to the geographical information system (ArcGIS) as an input, and the geographical points where the concentration of the pollutant exceeds the limits determined by the contaminant’s Exposure Response Curves are then displayed over a map of Florida. The population exposed to the contaminated area is determined by some of the databases that are layered in ArcGIS. At the end, the number of people exposed to toxic levels released by toxic propellants is shown on the map of Florida by the VRF.\n\n2.1. Data Communications\n\nSince each component in the distributed environment is developed using a dedicated simulation modeling tool (e.g., Arena, AnyLogic), different schemes are used for data transfer and conversion. It is important to emphasize that all information shared and exchanged by these federates during a federation execution must pass through the RTI. Each federate has a libRTI library, which includes the RTIambassador and the FederateAmbassador class. The libRTI library enables each federate to access RTI services specified in the Interface Specification [10]. Data transfer and exchange processes between federates occur by calling services in the RTIambassador. Transfer and exchange processes from the RTI to the federates are done by asynchronously invoking the FederateAmbassador callback functions that are implemented according to the function of the simulation.\n\nThe CRMF is an AnyLogic-based federate. It possesses a code generator which converts the model logic into Java code that supports HLA/RTI interoperability. This model integration is accomplished through the use of the HLA Support Module (HSM) provided by AnyLogic. The HSM enables AnyLogic to support a wide range of RTI services such as Federation Management, Declaration Management, Object Management, and Time Management. The HSM uses a StepHook [27] interface. This StepHook interface places specific methods on the engine that is performing the model’s time steps. These methods enable models to exchange messages and synchronize local simulation times to the global time of the federation.\n\nThe WEMF is a Java-based federate which is HLA compliant. Its data publications and subscriptions are queried through the RTI from the CRMF. Messages are sent and received in the GO or NO-GO form.\n\nThe SMF, VRF, and MCMF federates are Arena-based models. The integration of these federates is accomplished through the use of the Distributed Manufacturing Simulation (DMS) adapter, which is a component of the HLA Infrastructure for distributed simulation of enterprise facilities. This adapter minimizes the changes needed for simulations to participate in federations by providing time coordination mechanisms, message exchange, and object creation, update, storage, deletion, and transfer. The adapter maintains internal data for each federate: its federate number, federate list, time management data, local/remote object cache, incoming/outgoing message queue, adapter instance properties, and subscription and filtering data. Additionally, the adapter allows the user to set some of the simulation properties using XML, such as: Initialization of SimulationTime, SimulationStepSize, SimulationName, FederationName, and DebugMode. These XML documents are used to specify an “initialization file” and to describe objects and messages. The simulation object, its attributes, and the interactions or parameters of the simulations are stored in XML format which could be accessed through the XML Path Language (XPATH) and the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL).\n\n2.2. Lessons Learned: Several RTI Platforms Are Available and You Have to Select an Appropriate One\n\nOne of the lessons learned during this initial effort was the selection of the RTI. The performance of the RTI is crucial to the optimization of the federation. For this reason, the evaluation and choice of an RTI were considered during the design phase. The implementation language of the RTI can have an impact on performance. For example, Java implementations may require more system resources, while the cross-platform nature of Java enables it to run without modification on any Java-enabled platform. Other independent variables that affect performance include number of federates, distribution of federates, Data Distribution Management, network transport mode, objects per federate, attributes per object, interactions per federate, parameters per interaction, attribute buffer size, interaction buffer size, and data bundling. The effects of these independent variables on measures of comparison such as latency and throughput should be evaluated before a choice of an open source or commercial RTI is made [11].\n\nThere are several commercial and noncommercial implementations of the run-time infrastructure. Some open source RTIs include PoRTIco (http://www.porticoproject.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), CERTI (http://www.nongnu.org/certi/), and EODisP (http://www.pnp-software.com/eodisp/). PoRTIco is a fully supported open source RTI implementation which is supported by different platforms. It is licensed under the Common Developer and Distribution License (CDDL) and is funded by the Australian Defense Simulation Office (ADSO). PoRTIco is implemented mainly in Java and sometimes runs into compatibility issues with real-time simulations. Interested developers can have access to the project’s source code. CERTI was developed in C++ by the French Aerospace Laboratory (ONERA) to enable it to delve into research in the distributed discrete event simulation domain. The goal of the open source CERTI project is to spread the usage and knowledge of HLA and to foster collaboration with an international open source community. EODiSP was developed by the European Space Agency under the GNU General Public License to support development of end-to-end simulators for Earth observation satellite missions. Development of EODiSP stopped in 2006, and there is presently minimal support provided to developers when they run into difficulties.\n\nCommercial RTIs are more robust in operation than open source RTIs. Commonly used commercial HLA-compliant RTI implementations are the MÄK Real-time RTI, Pitch portable RTI (pRTI), and RTI Next Generation. One advantage of Pitch is its learning curve: Pitch is very visual and can be used to build a fast and complex federation structure. Table 1 gives more information on the aforementioned commercial HLA RTIs.\n\nTable 1: MÄK Real-time RT, Pitch portable RTI (pRTI), and RTI Next Generation RTIs.\n\n2.3. Lessons Learned: Advanced Visualization Is Important\n\nAnother important lesson learned was related to visualization. Visualization is a very important feature of modern simulation modeling environments. As our research of different visualization paradigms continues, we find that two types of visualizations are required in the context of the VTB distributed simulation [28]. First, a visualization of data and/or the specialized functions is an essential part of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) tools. In order to integrate the visualization tool into the VTB, a federate has to be created. This federate will interact with both the RTI and the visualization’s external interface. A second type of visualization will have a simulation engine which includes a set of integrated animation facilities to display the state of the system being simulated, which may allow user-model interaction.\n\nOur research has found that there are many visualization tools available. For space operations, among the most sophisticated tools are the Real-Time Advanced Graphics Engine (RAGE) from White Sands Missile Range [29], EDGE (http://active.boeing.com/mission_systems/products/index.cfm?content=products.cfm&pageid=m24121) from Boeing Autometric, and customized environments using JAVA 3D and the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) as depicted in Figure 3 and other extensions using the Extensible Markup Language (XML), such as X3D, Web3D, and Xj3D.\n\nFigure 3: JAVA 3D space exploration environment created for the VTB and VRML/X3D object (the space shuttle).\n\nIn addition, another system with distributed capabilities and one of the most popular and complete simulation and visualization COTS available is SIMbox from Simigon (http://www.simigon.com/overview.html), a Modeling, Simulation & Training solutions provider. It is a platform which provides the ability to create, modify, manage, and deploy any simulation-based content.\n\n3. The Enhanced VTB and Demo\n\nWe are building an enhanced VTB using a distributed hierarchical simulation platform based on HLA and cloud computing with emphasis on the new NASA systems for exploration. These are very unique developments. These demos will be utilized to measure the flexibility of an approach for mission design, validation of strategies, and advancements in tackling complex problems where advanced engineered systems are used. The first demo is of the mission of the SLS and MPCV being launched from the KSC to the ISS.\n\n3.1. Security and Cloud and Tablet Computing\n\nA deficiency of the HLA is that it is not well suited for large-scale distributed simulation systems. Hence, a cloud-based simulation system can enhance the capability of the HLA. Cloud computing provides computing services remotely to users through the internet, thereby minimizing the burden related to managing computing resources and facilities [30]. The benefits that can be realized from cloud computing include but are not limited to on-demand simulation resources, shared and reuse of simulation resources, and load balancing capacity improvement [30, 31]. Other advantages of cloud computing are cost reduction, resource sharing, and time saved for new service deployment.\n\nHLA provides very few security features when used as a distributed simulation framework. It cannot guarantee integrity and confidentiality of the data exchanged between different federates connected through the web. There are possibilities of intrusion as illegal users can access network through web-enabled HLA/RTI, and any federate may connect and get access to data exchanged between federates [20]. It is also possible for intruders to tamper with the data in transmission networks. To deal with security problems involved in web-enabled HLA/RTI, cloud security features such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), Identity-based cryptography (IBC), and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can be adopted. The communication between federates and RTI needs security checks, and also requests for data require authentication. Users can be authenticated to prevent unauthorized users joining the federation, and sensitive data can be encrypted to maintain the confidentiality.\n\nTablets provide ease of operation over traditional desktop computers. Tablets can even provide simplicity over laptops to astronauts in order to perform various procedures and scientific experiments. Apple, Samsung, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are some of the leading companies involved in the production of tablets. At present, the most widely used operating systems on tablets are iOS by Apple and Android by Google. Tablets are light in weight which makes them more portable. However, they provide less storage space as compared to desktops or laptops. To overcome local storage space and processing power drawbacks, tablets can work in conjunction with the cloud.\n\nThe application of tablet computing in the cloud can provide flexibility of operation in spacecraft systems. Tablets can be used by astronauts as mobile devices for monitoring and visualization of space. The tablet can work as a display interface, while all computing and processing is done via the cloud. Data processed on the tablet can also be saved into cloud. Astronauts can query the system, input their observations, and perform online data mining to spot trends through the use of tablets. With voice and gesture recognition, astronauts can connect with components to form “network ontology.” Using the computing hierarchical/distributed infrastructure, astronauts can also study correlations and run simple simulation models of the current observed situations.\n\n3.2. Demo: Mission to the International Space Station (ISS)\n\nNASA has announced that the next manned spacecraft will be the MPCV, which is based on the Orion, the Apollo era crew capsule design (Figure 4(a)). The MPCV and SLS (Figure 4) are central to NASA’s plan for the future of space exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 gives NASA until 2016 to field a heavy-lift rocket (now called the Space Launch System) and crew vehicle. This act authorizes approximately $10 billion in spending on the two projects over the next three years [34]. To meet the above goal, NASA plans to implement the MPCV and the Space Launch System (SLS) programs, including transition of relevant design and developmental activities of the previous programs. A major element of the transition involves shifting design and developmental efforts away from a closely coupled system to a more general launch vehicle (i.e., SLS based on the Heavy Lift Vehicle, Figure 4(b)) and crew vehicle (i.e., MPCV, Figure 4(a)).\n\nFigure 4: The MPCV and SLS [ The MPCV and SLS [ 32 33 ]. (a) Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) [ 21 ]. (b) Evolution of the Space Launch System (SLS) [ 15 ].\n\nTherefore, our first demo is the implementation of a mission of the SLS and MPCV being launched from KSC to the ISS. The mission is modeled at a very high level (in the hierarchy) using agent-based modeling. Several discrete models representing different parts of the mission such as the ground operations (e.g., transportation, assembly/stacking), the launching process, and reentry are being developed. Several of these models are built by consulting NASA experts and using as a baseline the processing times/features of the NASA shuttle and the current infrastructure such as the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB; see Figure 5) that is going to be used in the future processes. Another model is a sophisticated decision level fusion approach based on Distribution Envelope Determination. Several models are connected that implement fragmentation of debris, release of toxic gases, and propagation of blast waves, which are the three majors hazards to be produced by the SLS. Examples of some of the developed simulation federates are explained below.\n\nFigure 5: The Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) was built for the Apollo program. The VAB was designed to house the assembly and final checkout of the 110-meter-tall Saturn V launch vehicle. One of the VAB’s most notable features is its 139-meter-high doors. It was also used for the assembly/stacking of the NASA Space shuttle. The VAB will be used for the assembly/stacking of the SLS and the MPCV. Photo courtesy of NASA.\n\n3.2.1. Mission Process Agent Federate\n\nThe Mission Process Agent is the heart of the hierarchy. It describes the life cycle of a mission and owns different environments where the different decision-maker agents, resource agents, and other process agents can work together and collaborate [12]. However, the advantage of using the agent framework is the assignation of environments and features which allow other agents to use the environment and participate and collaborate with other subprocesses in the process. The following processes are required (see Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: State chart of a mission to the ISS using AnyLogic ( State chart of a mission to the ISS using AnyLogic ( http://www.anylogic.com/ ) for the MPCV and SLS.\n\n(1) Supply Chains, Rollover and Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB; See Figure 5). This step in the life cycle of the mission details the different resources and systems between NASA Centers and NASA Headquarters (HQ) for the mission and the external supply chain (i.e., the interactions between NASA and Major Contractors). In addition, the rollover of the major systems and the different processes occur inside the VAB.\n\n(2) Rollout. This step is very short in time. The vehicle is transferred from the VAB to the launch pad.\n\n(3) Launch Operations. This step includes prelaunch operations to be performed on the vehicle on the launch pad. There are many interactions among different agents. The decision-maker agents such as the launch director, range safety, weather officers, and the crew technician agents are heavily involved during this step. Scrubs are simulated, and the assignment of potential launch dates is also modeled. The weather and the range systems are executed accordingly. The final launch is modeled.\n\n(4) Ascent Phase. This is a step with a short period of time. It simulates the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) and the phases being released.\n\n(5) Orbiting, Rendezvous, Docking, Orbit Operations, and Undocking. This step simulates the orbit, rendezvous, and docking of the vehicle (MPCV and the service module) with the ISS. Undocking and the planning of the reentry and landing (interactions of the different agent decision-makers such as the entry flight director, weather, and range safety officers, etc.) are simulated.\n\n(6) Orbiting, Entry, and Landing/Recovery. This is the final step of the mission with the final orbiting, the release of the service module, the entry and landing at a particular location (e.g., California Coast), and the logistics of the recovery.\n\nThe simulation platform selected is AnyLogic (http://www.anylogic.com/). An “Agent” in AnyLogic is a unit of model design that can have behavior, memory (history), timing, and contacts. Agents can represent people, companies, projects, assets, vehicles, cities, animals, ships, products, and so forth. AnyLogic has classes for developing agents as it has all necessary properties to define variables, events, statecharts, system dynamics stock, and flow diagrams.\n\n3.2.2. Simulation Model of the Stacking in the VAB of the SLS Federate\n\nThis is a discrete-event simulation model. It was built by consulting NASA experts and uses the processing times/features of the NASA shuttle as a baseline. The SLS being developed consists of different modules as shown in Figure 7. These modules must be assembled in the VAB. The following sequences are required (see Figure 8) for an implementation using AnyLogic (http://www.anylogic.com/).\n\nFigure 7: This picture (adapted and modified from [ This picture (adapted and modified from [ 35 ]) describes one of the models of the SLS. The SLS will be the most powerful space launch vehicle ever flown. Additional boost from a pair of the largest solid rocket motors (SRBs) ever to be built will be required to lift the payload into orbit. The assembly/stacking of the different boosters, stages/phases, and the MPCV will occur at the VAB.\n\nFigure 8: Partial depiction of the discrete-event model for the SLS and MPCV stacking operations inside the VAB using AnyLogic ( Partial depiction of the discrete-event model for the SLS and MPCV stacking operations inside the VAB using AnyLogic ( http://www.anylogic.com/ ).\n\n(1) Phases 1 and 2 Transfer to VAB. The first phase and second phases arrive at KSC. They are inspected and then off loaded and towed to the VAB transfer isle where they are stored until integrated with the SRB stack.\n\n(2) Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) Stacking in the VAB High Bay. The Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) stacking consists of placing an SRB’s aft skirt onto hold-down posts on the Mobile Launch (ML in one of the VAB High Bays (HB)). The SRBs are then stacked one segment at a time until all five segments are stacked. At this time the forward extension that houses the avionics and parachutes is added and the SRB stacking is complete. As explained by [25] “These boosters are derived from the Space shuttle boosters, though they are larger and of an improved design. Whereas the shuttle boosters were made in four segments, the SLS boosters are made in five. These segments contain the fuel, which is composed of ammonium perchlorate, powdered aluminum, iron oxide, a polymer (such as Polybutadiene acrylonitrile (PBAN) or Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)) and an epoxy curing agent.”\n\n(3) Phases (i.e., Stages) 1 and 2 Are Assembled and Mated to the SRB Stack in the VAB. This is accomplished by raising the phases to a vertical position in the transfer isle, lifting it up and over into the HB and mating it to the stacked SRBs.\n\n(4) MPCV with Service Module to VAB. The MPCV is towed to the VAB and placed in the VAB transfer isle. A strong back is attached to the MPCV and service module, and the vehicle is lifted up and moved, lowered and attached to the Phase 1/Phase 2/SRB stack.\n\n3.2.3. Simulation Models of Range Safety Federate\n\nThis federate includes several models (mainly continuous) that abstract the potential destruction of the vehicle and its consequences such as gas dispersion, debris, and blasts from sound waves. The loss of two of the five Space shuttles during both the launch and the return phases of flights has raised public awareness on the safety issues related to space launches. Therefore, simulating mission failures which may result in the loss of life or property is a capability which was deemed important to integrate in the VTB. This federate considers the three main hazards, that is, debris dispersion, gas dispersion, and blast propagation. This subsection introduces briefly each of the models and discusses the information-fusion-based metric which was developed to estimate more appropriately the risk of operating a vehicle of a particular type, on a particular day, from a particular spaceport. A full discussion of this fusion-based methodology can be found in [24, 36].\n\n(1) Debris Modeling. As its name indicates, the purpose of a debris model is to model the fragmentation and debris impact dispersion resulting from the breakup of a space vehicle in flight. For example, NASA uses the Common Real-Time Footprint (CRTF) in its decision to abort a launch. A debris dispersion simulation model was developed and validated with actual debris locations recovered from Space shuttle Columbia, the details of which can be found in [37]. Uncertainties accounted for when calculating the trajectories of debris include real-time state vector, fragment initial velocity, drag, lift, and wind. Figure 9 shows debris areas of three simulated break-up times of a vehicle launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The outputs are overlaid on an ArcGIS map (http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis). The areas increase exponentially as the breakup occurs later in flight.\n\nFigure 9: Partial details of a debris model for a spacecraft [ Partial details of a debris model for a spacecraft [ 24 ].\n\n(2) Blast Modeling. An explosion is generally defined as a rapid release of energy into the atmosphere. This energy generates blast waves that can significantly damage the area surrounding the source of the explosion. In conventional launcher designs, the weight of the propellant carried by the vehicle can represent up to 90% of its total gross weight at launch. Therefore, it is important to understand the explosion potential of this propellant to reliably assess the level of risk to the public and the surrounding infrastructure (which may extend beyond the spaceport) associated with the use of a launch vehicle. A well-known software for blast modeling is the Distant Focusing Overpressure software (BlastDFO) developed by Acta Inc. This software incorporates real-time weather data in order to predict the potential for window breakage and casualties if an on-pad or early flight explosion occurs [24].\n\n(3) Gas Dispersion and Toxicity Modeling. Given the amount and toxicity of fuels carried by launch vehicles, modeling the dispersion of gas released during an explosion is critical. A prominent example of systems developed to model such phenomenon is CALPUFF, an advanced nonsteady-state meteorological and air quality modeling system [8]. For the present effort, AERMOD, another model recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was used. AERMOD is a modeling system designed to calculate air pollutant concentration in all types of terrain, from flat surfaces to complex, mountainous terrains [24]. These capabilities are useful for modeling operations in different types of terrain, which could include both spaceport located on each coast (such as KSC in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California) and those that could be envisioned inland (such as the Oklahoma Spaceport).\n\n(4) Estimating Launch Risk through Information Fusion. Estimating the risk incurred by the public as the result of operating a launch system is a complex task, and ensuring that the safety of the public is a significant cost driver of space launchesOne cannot be too cost conscious as this may result in operation that is unsafe for the public. On the other hand, being too conservative leads operations to be cost-prohibitive in many instances. As advocated by Sala-Diakanda [24–26, 36], the right course to adopt is to shift the practice from a risk avoidance philosophy to a risk management philosophy. Understandably, current approaches are too conservative because there are simply too many uncertainties associated with such operating launchers. These uncertainties are introduced by such factors as (1) the difficulty in capturing all the failure modes of a system and their probability of occurrence due the lack of historical data and the sheer complexity of those systems, (2) the difficulty in modeling population distribution and hazard-specific sheltering scheme, or (3) the complex interdependencies between the different hazards when it comes to estimating the potential number of casualties. Indeed, if one is considered a casualty from a debris dispersion perspective, it is perhaps too conservative to count such a person from gas dispersion perspective as well.\n\nAn information-fusion-based metric, based on Distribution Envelope Determination (DEnv), also known as Interval-Based Dependency Bounds Analysis, was proposed by Sala-Diakanda [24, 36]. DEnv is a convolution-based method for determining dependency bounds of binary arithmetic operations on random variables. This metric addresses precisely the problems of the uncertainty surrounding the mean number of casualties (the current metric) and the prevailing assumption of independence between the effects of all hazards by generating minimum and maximum joint cumulative distribution functions of variables that are dependent, but whose dependencies are unknown or only partially known.\n\nThe proposed metric shifts the focus from a mean value whose uncertainty is too large to a confidence around the “probability of exceeding a predetermined safety threshold.” Therefore, from a decision maker perspective, with this metric, the decision to be taken is shifted from being based upon a subjective assessment of the size of the uncertainty around the mean to being based upon a range of probabilities of exceeding a prespecified safety threshold. And with respect to the assumption of independence, Sala-Diakanda [24] suggested that a better assumption than independence is ‘‘no assumption at all.” To illustrate, suppose that the threshold value for the expected number of casualties is 3 (i.e. ), then the proposed metric may generate an estimate of the form\n\nHere, and are, respectively, the minimum and maximum probabilities of a fused expectation of casualties of exceeding the safety threshold. A detailed case-study illustrating the benefits of such information-based metric, how it can be used and interpreted, was discussed in [24, 36]. The concept is illustrated graphically in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10: Curves bounding the true cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the fused output . , , and are expectation of casualties’ random variables generated, respectively, by blast propagation, debris fragmentation, and gas dispersion. is defined as the fused expectation of casualties random variables generated by DEnv.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nDistributed simulation is very important to tame complexity. It is essential to emphasize the hybrid nature of distributed simulation models where discrete-event and continuous models are required due to the nature of the engineered systems [37, 38]. There are many sources of expertise required to build and model these engineered systems. Then, there is a need for different type of models to have the analysis capability to encompass their subsystems, processes, and life cycles.\n\nThe importance of simulation has been highlighted by the NASA Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT). NASA OCT explains that [39] “a digital twin is an integrated multi-physics, multi-scale, probabilistic simulation of a vehicle or system that uses the best available physical models, sensor updates, fleet history, and so forth, to mirror the life of its flying twin.” Our approach can support the development of digital twins. In addition, components of one mission can be used in the planning for other types of missions.\n\nThis approach of Hierarchical/Distribution simulation modeling can be used for planning at different levels (i.e., strategic, operational, and tactical). It is very important to appreciate the level of integration to be achieved with other information systems and the real-time issues involved in particular for advanced digital twin concepts. Scripted visualization and simulation visualization are very different concepts. Simulation visualization is the one requested by the analysts.\n\nA very important component of our current research focuses on the uncertainty aspects at the levels of data and operations. We are studying fuzzy logic and deep learning neural network approaches to model imprecision and ambiguity [40]. In addition, we are studying behavioral simulation in order to model team productivity effects of the human part of the systems [41].\n\nThis paper outlined some of our preliminary work that will evolve toward a more sophisticated and responsive simulation environment. We will report our progress in future papers.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to express their great appreciation to the different/numerous “friends” and supporters in NASA.

Based in London, InsureX’s goal is to create a new, alternative insurance marketplace that disrupts the current inefficiency system in the insurance industry. The InsureX platform uses blockchain technology to streamline the process between buyers and sellers of insurance products. The platform also allows managing the downstream processes related to programs, policies, premiums and claims. Target users of InsureX's platform include reinsurers, insurers, brokers, and general companies. Key features of InsureX’s platform: List and market insurance products Insurance products can be listed to a public audience or limited to a selected group of buyers only. A product listing includes the key characteristics and potentially targets specific regions and markets. Transaction Execution When the parties have agreed on the terms, a transaction is added to the distributed ledger. Because of the shared nature of blockchain, there is no need for a third party to verify and confirm the transaction. Participants in the transaction who have the right permissions will be able to see the same information in real-time. Portfolio Management InsureX’s portfolio functionality allows users to get an overview of the transactions executed and a summary view of key metrics. High-level information such as risk, premium, claims and performance information is available and can be visualized and exported. Market Insights InsureX can provide a detailed overview of market activity across regions, market sectors, exposures etc. Introduction video of InsureX (video is 2:06 long):\n\nHow advanced ﻿is ﻿the project? The project is just starting out. They have a local team developing the platform. However, they don’t have a prototype or MVP yet. InsureX will use 70% of the ICO funding on team expansion, the majority of which will be on hiring software developers. Here is the roadmap for the project: Q2 - 2017:\n\nR&D. Research into blockchain technology and insurance markets.\n\nPrototype. The development team starts to work on a first prototype of the product.\n\nEstablish partnerships. Establish relationships with people from the insurance and blockchain industry.\n\nQ3 - 2017:\n\nFunding. Launching of the crowdsale campaign.\n\nTeam expansion. InsureX will expand the development team and hire experts in the insurance and development sectors.\n\nMVP. Fully functional version of the platform with minimal functionality.\n\nQ4 - 2017:\n\nSign up 10 clients. Having 10 clients using the platform in daily operation.\n\nExtend downstream processes.\n\nService organization. Set up a support team to help clients.\n\nGeneral availability. Initial version available for all the client.\n\nQ1 - 2018:\n\nGo to market. Establish a sales and support organization.\n\nScale the platform. Ensure the platform can scale up.\n\nHow can token ﻿holders ﻿make money? IXT serves as the currency for the InsureX platform and fuels all the activities that happen on the platform. Hence, the success of the token hinges on whether the platform can succeed and capture a significant market share in the insurance industry. InsureX charges a commission on transactions being executed on the marketplace and an annual subscription for memberships. As the InsureX community grows, the transaction volumes will increase and new products and services will be available. Each activity on the platform has an associated cost specified in IXT. Examples of token transactions include:\n\nTransaction execution reward\n\nReward for providing data\n\nPlatform access\n\nAPI licences\n\nOf all fees collected by the platform, a portion is burnt. This introduces a predictable and effective reward structure for using IXT. The remainder is reinvested in the operation and growth of the platform.\n\nLike What﻿﻿ ﻿﻿You Are Reading?

The co-founders have a strong background in their respective field. Ingemar Svensson, Founder & CEO/CTO – Before founding InsureX, Ingemar was the CTO of Risk and Valuation at SunGard Asset Management. His experience ranges from managing large organizations to hands-on software development. Ingemar has spent 20 years building mission critical systems in various roles at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Lehman Brothers and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance. Cristina Dolan, Co-founder & COO – Cristina is an MIT Media Lab alumna with over two decades of experience building software, content, and Internet based products and businesses. She was a co-founder of OneMain.com, which grew to be the 10th largest ISP and was acquired by Earthlink. She is a member of Forbes Technology Council and in 2016 was judge at the IBM Blockchain Hackathon. Mikael Olofsson, Co-founder – Mikael has over 17 years of experience from the financial markets and start-up sector. Previous to founding InsureX, he was Co-founder of TikkR.co, an on-demand insurance platform. Before this, Mikael worked as Senior Equity Derivatives Broker and Commodities Broker in London, New York, Geneva and Paris.\n\nOpportunities The project has some strong team members and advisors, including the Chief Underwriter for General Re in Europe.\n\nGen Re is one of the largest insurance companies in the world with $5.6 billion of premium in 2016. It is also a member of the Berkshire Hathaway group of companies. If Gen Re becomes one of the first companies to use InsureX’s platform, it can be a lot easier for other insurance companies to follow suit.\n\nThere is a genuine need for decentralized platform to improve efficiency of the entire process in the insurance industry.\n\nThe insurance industry is currently manual, paper heavy, slow, and error-prone, which allows a lot of room for blockchain technology to disrupt the industry.\n\nThere is a network effect in play for this project – the bigger this platform is, the more attractive it is for other insurance companies to join the marketplace.\n\nThe project doesn’t really have a direct competitor now:\n\nEtherisc can be complementary to InsureX’s platform.\n\nACORD’s partnership with R3 can be complementary to InsureX’s platform and InsureX has a strong connection to R3.\n\nLemonade is B2C vs. InsureX’s B2B focus.\n\nConcerns The project is nothing but an idea now – there is no completed product to show for. Even if everything goes according to plan, they won’t begin signing up clients until Q4 2017. You need to trust that the team will be able to deliver.\n\nThe CEO of InsureX is also listed as the founder of another startup, Finserve. It is unclear how he will allocate his time between the two ventures.\n\nConclusion",
  "latent_21639": "Harry Kane is poised to return to the training pitch on Monday after being sidelined for a month and Tottenham Hotspur are cautiously optimistic that there will be more encouraging injury news about Toby Alderweireld, who is due to undergo a scan after he was taken off on a stretcher on Saturday.\n\nAlthough Alderweireld was in a lot of pain at the time of the injury, the Belgian was able to walk out of The Hawthorns after the 1-1 draw with West Bromwich Albion.

He has not played since injuring ankle ligaments against Sunderland on 18 September, but this week should represent another step forward for the striker. “Hopefully as soon as possible we can recover him, and the team will get stronger,” Pochettino said. “The Champions League game on Tuesday is too soon for him but maybe Monday he will start to train on the pitch.”\n\nDanny Rose will be restored to the starting lineup in Leverkusen after being rested against West Brom. “After his injury he played against Manchester City and then it wasn’t in the plan to play two games with the national team,” Pochettino said. “But because [Ryan] Bertrand was injured, he had to play two games.\n\n“We don’t want to take risks. I think this is too much for a player coming from the injury to play two games in one week. For that [reason] we gave him a rest to be ready for the next two games.”\n\nWith Alderweireld out, the manager is likely to ask Eric Dier to partner Jan Vertonghen at centre-back. “The good thing about Eric is he can play like a midfielder and a centre-back, and can perform good in several positions,” Pochettino said. “That is important and we will see about the decision for Tuesday. It is one option more that we have.”",

More Specs Less Specs\n\nText description provided by the architects. The new Port House in Antwerp repurposes, renovates and extends a derelict fire station into a new headquarters for the port – bringing together the port’s 500 staff that previously worked in separate buildings around the city.\n\nWith 12 km of docks, Antwerp is Europe’s second largest shipping port, serving 15,000 sea trade ships and 60,000 inland barges each year.\n\nAntwerp handles 26% of Europe’s container shipping, transporting more than 200 million tonnes of goods via the ocean-going vessels that call at the port and providing direct employment for over 60,000 people, including more than 8,000 port workers. Indirectly, the Port of Antwerp ensures about 150,000 jobs and has ambitious targets for future expansion to meet the continent’s growth and development over the next century.\n\nIn 2007, when the former 1990s offices of the Port of Antwerp had become too small, the port determined that relocation would enable its technical and administrative services to be housed together, providing new accommodation for about 500 staff. The port required a sustainable and future-proof workplace for its employees, representing its ethos and values in an ever-expanding local and international arena.\n\nAs the threshold between the city and its vast port, Mexico Island in Antwerp’s Kattendijk dock on Quay 63 was selected as the site for the new head office. The waterside site also offered significant sustainable construction benefits, allowing materials and building components to be transported by water, an important requirement to meet the port’s ecological targets.\n\nFollowing the construction of a new fire station with facilities needed to service the expanding port, the old fire station on the Mexico Island site – a listed replica of a Hanseatic residence – became redundant and relied on a change of use to ensure its preservation. This disused fire station had to be integrated into the new project. The Flemish government's department of architecture, together with the City and Port authorities organized the architectural competition for the new headquarters.\n\nZaha Hadid Architects' design is informed by detailed historical research and a thorough analysis of both the site and the existing building.\n\nMarc Van Peel, president of the Port of Antwerp, said: “There was only one rule laid down in the architectural competition, namely that the original building had to be preserved. There were no other requirements imposed for the positioning of the new building. The jury was therefore pleasantly surprised when the five shortlisted candidates all opted for a modern structure above the original building. They all combined the new with the old, but the design by Zaha Hadid Architects was the most brilliant.”\n\nWorking with Origin, leading heritage consultants in the restoration and renovation of historic monuments, ZHA’s studies of the site’s history and heritage are the foundations of the design which firstly emphasises the north-south site axis parallel with the Kattendijkdok linking the city centre to the port. Secondly, due to its location surrounded by water, the building's four elevations are considered of equal importance with no principal facade. ZHA’s design is an elevated extension, rather than a neighbouring volume which would have concealed at least one of the existing facades. ZHA and Origin’s historic analysis of the old fire station also highlighted the role of its originally intended tower - a grand, imposing component of the fire station's Hanseatic design. Its bold vertical statement, intended to crown the imposing volume of the building below, was never realised.\n\nThese three key principles define the design’s composition of new and old: a new volume that ‘floats’ above the old building, respecting each of the old facades and completing the verticality of the original design’s unrealised tower.\n\nLike the bow of a ship, the new extension points towards the Scheldt, connecting the building with the river on which Antwerp was founded.\n\nSurrounded by water, the new extension's façade is a glazed surface that ripples like waves and reflects the changing tones and colours of the city’s sky. Triangular facets allow the apparently smooth curves at either end of the building to be formed with flat sheets of glass. They also facilitate the gradual transition from a flat façade at the south end of the building to a rippling surface at the north.\n\nWhile most of the triangular facets are transparent, some are opaque. This calibrated mix ensures sufficient sunlight within the building, while also controlling solar load to guarantee optimal working conditions. At the same time, the alternation of transparent and opaque facade panels breaks down the volume of the new extension, giving panoramic views of the Scheldt, the city and the Port as well as providing enclosure.\n\nThe façade’s rippling quality is generated with flat facets to the south that gradually become more three-dimensional towards to the north. This perception of a transparent volume, cut to give the new building its sparkling appearance, reinterprets Antwerp’s moniker as the city of diamonds. The new extension appears as a carefully cut form which changes its appearance with the shifting intensity of daylight. Like the ripples on the surface of the water in the surrounding port, the new façade reflects changing light conditions.\n\nThe old fire station’s central courtyard has been enclosed with a glass roof and is transformed into the main reception area for the new Port House. From this central atrium, visitors access the historic public reading room and library within the disused fire truck hall which has been carefully restored and preserved. Panoramic lifts provide direct access to the new extension with an external bridge between the existing building and new extension giving panoramic views of the city and port.\n\nThe client requirements for an ‘activity based office’ are integrated within the design, with related areas such as the restaurant, meeting rooms and auditorium located at the centre of the upper levels of the existing building and the bottom floors of the new extension. The remaining floors more remote from the centre, comprise open plan offices.\n\nCollaborating with services consultant Ingenium, ZHA developed a sustainable and energy-efficient design reaching a ‘Very Good’ BREEAM environmental rating. Despite the challenges of integrating with a protected historic building, high standards in sustainable design were achieved by implementing effective strategies at each stage of construction. A borehole energy system pumps water to a depth of 80m below grade in over 100 locations around the building to provide heating and cooling. In the existing building, this system uses chilled beams. In the new extension, it uses chilled ceilings. Waterless lavatory fittings and motion detectors minimise water consumption while building automation and optimal daylight controls minimise artificial lighting.\n\nWith constant references to the Scheldt, the city of Antwerp and the dynamics of its port, married with the successful renovation and reuse of a redundant fire station - integrating it as a fully-fledged part of its headquarters - the new Port House will serve the port well through its planned expansion over future generations.\n\nMarc Van Peel said: “The architectural style of the original building, a replica of the former Hansa House, recalls the 16th century, Antwerp's \"golden century.\" But now above this original, a contemporary structure in shining glass has been built, which I am sure, represents a new golden century for Antwerp.”",
  "latent_21702": "So far, Sebastian Stan‘s Bucky Barnes (a.k.a. Winter Soldier) has functioned mostly as a supporting character to Chris Evans‘ Captain America: part sidekick, part nemesis, part damsel in distress. But Captain America: Civil War gave Bucky the opportunity to mingle with some of Marvel’s other big names, with spectacularly entertaining results. Now he could reunite with one of his new acquaintances in the not-too-distant future.\n\nSpeaking at a recent event, Stan hinted Bucky might return in 2018’s Black Panther, alongside Civil War co-star Chadwick Boseman. It’ll be Bucky’s first appearance in a non-Captain America movie (unless you count that Ant-Man post-credits scene, which you shouldn’t since it was really just a clip from Captain America: Civil War). SPOILERS for Captain America: Civil War follow.\n\nStan dropped by the Wizard World Comic Con in Philadelphia last weekend with his Marvel BFFs Evans and Anthony Mackie. A fan asked Stan which non-Captain America, non-Avengers Marvel movie he wanted to see Winter Soldier appear in. Evans and Mackie good-naturedly warned Stan to “be careful” with his answer, lest the “break the internet.” But Stan pressed onward anyway and offered this tantalizing response:\n\nI don’t know, man. I mean, there’s obviously a very clear answer, but I’m not going to maybe say it, now. Where did he end up at the end of the movie? That’s the movie he should be in, I think. I feel like that would be the natural… but I don’t know. I don’t know anything.\n\nThe ending Stan is referring to comes in the mid-credits scene for Captain America: Civil War, which shows Bucky, Steve, and T’Challa in a high-tech facility in Wakanda. Bucky has decided to go into suspended animation until someone finds a way to undo the Hydra brainwashing that turned him into the Winter Soldier. Steve warns T’Challa that people will be coming after Bucky. T’Challa replies, in true badass fashion, “Let them try.”\n\nWhile the scene does not explicitly confirm Winter Soldier will resurface in Black Panther, it sets up an obvious opportunity to bring him back of the Marvel gods will it. And it’s hard to blame Stan for wanting a piece of that action. With Ryan Coogler set to direct, and Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong’o tapped for leading roles alongside Boseman, Black Panther is already shaping up to be one of the most promising features on Marvel’s upcoming slate.\n\nBucky isn’t the only familiar face who could make his way to Wakanda for Black Panther. Andy Serkis made his debut as classic Black Panther villain Ulysses Klaue in Avengers: Age of Ultron. And Martin Freeman‘s government agent Everett Ross, who briefly showed up in Civil War, is often associated with Black Panther in the comics. As of now, though, Boseman’s T’Challa is the only Marvel character confirmed to appear in Black Panther.\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16, 2018.",
  "latent_21770": "Kansas University offensive lineman Tanner Hawkinson spent most of Saturday hanging out at his older brother’s house in Lawrence with friends and family, eating, smiling and waiting for the official word about where he would begin his NFL career.\n\nThe news came via a phone call from Cincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis a little before 2 p.m., and, with his support system smiling and stuffing their faces around him, Hawkinson quietly stepped outside and took the call.\n\n“My agent had been talking to teams throughout the day, and he told me that the Bengals were interested,” said Hawkinson, whom the Bengals took with the 23rd pick in the fifth round, No. 156 overall. “It was just crazy. Just a great feeling of relief to finally get that call.”\n\nHawkinson becomes the second former KU offensive lineman selected in the NFL Draft by Cincinnati. The Bengals made former KU All-American Anthony Collins the 112th overall selection in Round 4 of the 2008 draft. Although Hawkinson and Collins’ careers never overlapped, Hawkinson said their paths had crossed.\n\n“I remember early in my career he would come back and work out with the old staff,” Hawkinson said of Collins. “We kind of said what’s up, but nothing more really. It’s great to know that you have another guy on your future team from your alma mater.”\n\nAlthough the two former Jayhawks play the same position, the addition of Hawkinson does not necessarily spell bad news for Collins. That’s one of the things that inspired the Bengals to make Hawkinson the first Jayhawk drafted since Dezmon Briscoe was picked in the sixth round in 2010.\n\n“They said they liked my versatility,” Hawkinson said. “(Bengals offensive line) coach (Paul) Alexander said he thought I could play all three positions: tackle, guard and even possibly sliding down to center.”\n\nAlexander confirmed as much in a news conference announcing the pick.\n\n“He’s going to play all the spots and make everyone’s seat a little uncomfortable,” Cincinnati’s O-line coach said. “Whoever has a bad practice, I’m going to put (Hawkinson) right behind him the next day.”\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 298-pound Hawkinson, who leaves KU with a school record 48 consecutive starts, said he was thrilled with the opportunity to join the Bengals, a playoff team in 2011 and 2012, and added that he never thought this would be his path when he signed with Kansas out of McPherson High.\n\n“Playing sports all throughout my life, you always have the thought in the back of your mind that if you have the chance to play in college that’s great,” Hawkinson said. “I was always just focused on that next step, enjoying my time at KU. As my career unfolded here, I realized that it was possible to make it to the next level, and the fact that it happened today is a pretty crazy feeling.”\n\nJayhawks earn free agent invites\n\nFellow-combine invitee Bradley McDougald, a 6-foot, 210-pound safety who many expected would be selected, went undrafted but wasted no time securing a free-agent deal with Kansas City. McDougald was one of three former Jayhawks to get a shot from the nearby Chiefs. Quarterback Dayne Crist and defensive end Toben Opurum also were targeted by Kansas City, and all three will report to Chiefs mini-camp on May 9.\n\nIn other undrafted free agent news: cornerback Greg Brown caught on with the San Diego Chargers; offensive lineman Trevor Marrongelli was invited to camp by the Detroit Lions and linebacker Tunde Bakare received a camp invite from the Chicago Bears.\n\nNone of KU’s free agents are guaranteed anything. They first have to make it through mini-camp and then survive a round of cuts leading up to the finalization of each team’s 53-man roster late this summer. Despite those odds against them, their message was unanimous and best summed up in a tweet from Opurum.\n\n“Chiefs mini-camp invite,” Opurum wrote. “All I asked for was an opportunity.”",
  "latent_21859": "FITCHBURG -- Fitchburg State University and the University of Massachusetts Law School have signed a first-of-its kind agreement that will allow students to earn their bachelor and law degrees in six years instead of seven.\n\nThe agreement was signed Wednesday by FSU President Robert V.

  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nBob Herbert writes about the unemployed:\n\nFifteen million Americans are locked in the nightmare of unemployment, nearly 10 percent of the work force. A third have been jobless for more than six months. Thirteen percent of Latinos and 15 percent of blacks are out of work. (Those are some of the official statistics. The reality is much worse.) ….A national survey of jobless workers by a pair of professors at Rutgers University shows just how traumatized the work force has become in this downturn. Two-thirds of respondents said that they had become depressed. More than half said it was the first time they had ever lost a job, and 80 percent said there was little or no chance that they would be able to get their jobs back when the economy improves. ….It’s eerie to me how little attention this crisis is receiving. The poor seem to be completely out of the picture.\n\nIt is kind of eerie, and I’ve noticed the difference in mood too. It’s true that the unemployment rate isn’t quite as high (yet) as it got in 1981-82, but it’s pretty damn close — and yet the tone of news coverage seems quite different. My recollection of the early 80s is of lots and lots of coverage of plant closures, homelessness, food banks, and a serious sense of panic and despair. This time, not so much. Has this been purely a difference in media coverage? A difference in the way unemployment is distributed? The fact that hard times have only been with us for about a year so far? A genuine difference in the way people are reacting? Or what? I really don’t know the answer. But yes, it feels quite different than it did in 1981.\n\nHelp me out, fellow oldsters. Does it feel different to you too? Or am I just imagining this?",
  "latent_22156": "According to AuthO , JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard ( RFC 7519 ) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA .\n\nIn using jwt, the information in the token, is the only thing required to authenticate a user. so our main here is to validate the information in the token and convert jwt to IPrincipal object. Iprincipal object, according to msdn , simply means the functionality of a principal object, what then is a principal object, A principal object represents the security context of the user on whose behalf the code is running, including that user's identity ( IIdentity ) and any roles to which they belong.\n\nTo make this JWT authentication to work, we must utilize a message handler, a message handler is simply a class that receives an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response. Instead of implementing our own message handler, we are going to be using an existing nugget package, JWTAuthForWepAPI.\n\nThe information structure in JWT token it’s as follows\n\n1.Header: JSON format which is encoded as a base64\n\n2.

  "latent_22236": "I went to see The Rite this weekend. So did a lot of other people: as of this morning, The Rite is the number one movie in America.\n\nMaybe Catholic horror is on its way back? Do I dare to hope? Even such a weak offering as this is better than naught! I saw The Rite in a building which used to also have a Borders, a cell phone store, an Italian restaurant, an art gallery, and a portrait studio. Now, the only thing in it is the theater. One of the escalators is seemingly permanently broken, and there are lots of “no loitering” signs posted. It’s all empty storefronts and mirrors someone is keeping shiny. The theater—which, itself, is somewhat ghostly due to the fact that it has a large second-floor snack bar that has been closed for years—has also seen better days. The little mall is in a “downtown” area full of empty storefronts that are now showcases for local schoolchildren’s artwork. I have a feeling there must be a lot of places in America like this. Places where you look around and wonder when, exactly, the plot was lost. Could we get exorcisms for buildings, cities, countries?\n\nOn to the movie. Spoilers ahead. There’s this guy, Michael Kovak, who lives in some crappy part of America with his aging father, a creepy mortician who made young Michael assist in the embalming of his own mother. We first see him working on a woman with a bracelet that appears to have an evil-eye charm and a “lil’ devil” tattoo on her shin. (Young ladies: if you take away nothing else from this movie, consider this: how tacky is your corpse going to look with all those marks on you? Think before you ink.) He decides to go to the seminary because everyone in his family is either a mortician or a priest. He tells this to his friend outside a local bar, where a comely young barmaid lets Michael know her shift will be over soon. Michael’s friend is agog and tells him to “say goodbye to his dick.” Michael assures him that he’s only getting on board for the free college education, after which he will opt out. I was practically yelling “It’s called the Army, dumbass!” and probably should have since there were only, like, two other lone people at the showing anyway.\n\nFour years later, he writes an email stating that he wants out, that he doesn’t have any faith. His superior tells him that if he doesn’t take his final vows, the church will bill him for $100,000 in student loans. And that he sees something in Michael and isn’t letting him get away so easily. So it’s off to Rome for Michael ’cause the Pope has just announced that he wants an exorcist in every parish in America. The older priest tells him to take the class and see how he feels afterwards. Then Michael is in Rome and waltzing in late to a special class for exorcists and the priest in charge stops the class, greets him, and tells him he’s heard a lot about him.\n\nThen Michael gets hooked up with Anthony Hopkins, an “unorthodox” Jesuit exorcist (complete with crumbling, solitary residence and pack of cats) and fails, time and time again, to swallow the Kool-Aid of evil. Hopkins, too, “sees” something in Michael. It’s a failure of screenwriting and of acting because we, the audience, see nothing there. He’s numb in every scene. I began to wonder if, given the shortage of priests, which Michael’s elder mentions to him when he tries to quit, if you’re a heterosexual, not a pedophile, and breathing, you get anointed as a Wonder Boy?\n\nMichael mumbles a lot about not having faith, but he doesn’t really seem torn about it. He’s not suffering a crisis like the noble, tormented Fr. Damian Karras in The Exorcist. At the last minute Michael summons up something like conviction and exorcizes Baal for all he’s worth, then ends up back in an empty parish in the US hearing confessions, which is, I guess, supposed to be proof that he finally converted, but seems to me more of his just-going-along-with-whatever. Were I an aspiring priest who got to play on the big stage of Rome, there’s no way I’d give that up for dreary church duties. I was reminded of Ray Liotta at the end of Goodfellas, in the witness-protection program, picking up his newspaper in his bathrobe in his dreary suburban neighborhood. He says, in voiceover, “Today everything is different. There’s no action. I have to wait around like everyone else. Can’t even get decent food. Right after I got here I ordered some spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup. I’m an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.”\n\nBut maybe this will herald a new age of Catholic horror movies? There’s plenty of evil in the world which needs exorcising, and it usually doesn’t come in the form of people spitting and scratching and rolling their eyes back in their head. I see a whole franchise for, say, Gabriel Byrne as a weary priest who travels the world and smokes the devil out with only his wits, a rosary, holy water, and a crucifix. Of course, true evil is banal and wears the disguise of normalcy—respectability!—while committing its nefarious deeds. Maybe it’s better to stick with the obvious metaphors.",

There is only Islamic liberation.\" -- Moshe Sharon, Professor Emeritus of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n\nNot only does no other religion in Turkey, other than Islam, have the power, influence or financing of the Religious Affairs Directorate (Diyanet) -- whose budget even surpasses that of most ministries; other religions are either not officially recognized (as in the cases of Alevism and Yazidism), or are on the verge of complete governmental elimination -- as in the cases of Judaism, Greek Orthodoxy, Assyrian (Syriac) and Armenian Christianity.\n\nThe debate over whether Islam has been hijacked by fundamentalists -- or whether the religion itself preaches the kind of hatred that leads to terrorism -- has been raging since the 9/11/2001 attacks on the United States. Although this issue has not been resolved, one thing is clear: in the Muslim world, the demonization of Jews and Christians is commonplace.\n\nTake Turkey, for example, where anti-Semitism has been exhibited publicly for decades by prominent members of government, the religious establishment and the media. In June this year, the head of the government's Religious Affairs Directorate -- the \"Diyanet\" -- joined the chorus.\n\nIn a speech he delivered in Gaziantep -- a transcript of which was posted on the Diyanet's official Twitter account -- Prof. Dr. Mehmet Görmez announced that Islam was brought to the world by Allah to correct the \"distortions\" of Judaism and Christianity. At the center of Judaism, he said, was \"material, money and wealth.\" Christianity, he asserted, took the opposite, albeit equally \"wrong,\" interpretation of the divine, as it \"came up with an understanding that denigrated the world and deemed property and wealth almost forbidden [haram].\"\n\nMehmet Görmez, President of Turkey's Religious Affairs Directorate (Diyanet), announced in June that Islam was brought to the world by Allah to correct the \"distortions\" of Judaism and Christianity. (Image source: Tezkiretul/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Diyanet was established in 1924 by the founding government of Turkey, under the Republican People's Party, after the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate, as a successor to Sheikh ul-Islam, the previous religious-affairs authority. It has many departments, chief among them the High Board of Religious Affairs, whose duties include:\n\n\"[M]ak[ing] decisions, shar[ing] views and answer[ing] questions on religious matters by taking into consideration the fundamental source texts and methodology, and historical experience of the Islamic religion as well as current demands and needs.\"\n\nNot only does no other religion in Turkey, other than Islam, have the power, influence or financing of the Diyanet -- whose budget surpasses that of most ministries; other religions are either not officially recognized (as in the cases of Alevism and Yazidism), or are on the verge of complete governmental elimination -- as in the cases of Judaism, Greek Orthodoxy, and Assyrian (Syriac) and Armenian Christianity.\n\nTurkey is not alone in this practice, which brings us back to the question of why \"Muslims hate Jews so much.\"\n\nAccording to Andrew Bostom, author of The Legacy of Islamic Antisemitism: From Sacred Texts to Solemn History, the answer lies in the Koran, whose \"central anti-Jewish motif... is found in verse 2:61 , repeated at verse 3:112.\"\n\nThey have been put under humiliation [by Allah] wherever they are overtaken, except for a covenant from Allah and a rope from the Muslims. And they have drawn upon themselves anger from Allah and have been put under destitution. That is because they disbelieved in the verses of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That is because they disobeyed and [habitually] transgressed. (3:112) SAHIH INTERNATIONAL\n\nIn a 2008 interview, Bostom says:\n\n\"This is where the Jews are accused of slaying the Prophets and transgressing against the will of Allah, and so they are condemned and cursed eternally. Verse 2.61 says 'shame and misery' are 'stamped upon them.' And this verse is coupled to verses like 5:60, and other verses about the Jews being transformed into apes and pigs, which is part of their curse. Verse 5:78 describes the curse upon the Jews by David and Jesus, Mary's son. There is a related verse, 5:64, which accuses the Jews of being spreaders of war and corruption, a sort of ancient antecedent of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. (Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas cited this verse during a diatribe against the Jews of Israel, in 2007.) More generally, the Koran's overall discussion of the Jews is marked by a litany of their sins and punishments, as if part of a divine indictment, conviction, and punishment process.\"\n\nTaking this beyond the Koran, Moshe Sharon, Professor Emeritus of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, explains that the\n\n\"basic attitude is that all history is in fact Islamic history...that all major figures of history basically are Muslim − from Adam down to our own time. So, if the Jews or Christians are demanding something and basing it on the fact that there was a king called Solomon or a king called David, or a prophet called Moses or Jesus, they say something which is not true or, in fact, they don't know that all these figures were basically Muslim figures.\"\n\nSharon continues:\n\n\"In fact, since the creation of the world there is only one religion and it is the religion of Islam. So, if anybody says 'Look, there is a place connected with Solomon and that is the place where the Temple of Solomon stood,' a true Muslim would tell you: 'Yes, you're absolutely right. But don't forget that Solomon was a Muslim and David was a Muslim. And Abraham was a Muslim. And Isaac was a Muslim, and Jesus was a Muslim.' This is what they mean by the Islamization of history.\"\n\nSharon says that through this \"Islamization of history,\" there is also an \"Islamization of geography,\" such that,\n\n\"Anywhere which was connected with these people or with these prophets who were all Muslims becomes a Muslim territory. And therefore, when Islam was not in that area before Mohammed came to it, it should have been there. By that area, I mean the Middle East or other parts outside of the Middle East which are now Muslim. So any place like this had to be freed, not to be conquered. They had to be liberated. So, Islam appeared in history in the time of Mohammed -- or reappeared in history from their point of view -- as a liberator. And therefore, there is no Islamic occupation. If somebody occupies anything, it will always be somebody else, not the Muslims. So, there is no Islamic occupation. There is only Islamic liberation.\"\n\nThis combination of hate-filled Koranic verses, as highlighted by Bostom, and revisionist Islamist history, as illustrated by Sharon, have created a monster in the form of an existential threat to the Judeo-Christian world. To counter it, the West needs to implement unapologetic policies to safeguard the religious liberty of both non-Muslims and non-extremist Muslims, wherever they reside.\n\nTo be effective, however, these policies must include conducting an honest and open discussion of the history and doctrine of Islam, as well as its contemporary iteration, not as a \"religion of peace\" – which, in Islam, is to occur only after the entire world has accepted Allah as well as Islamic law, Sharia -- but as one of war and terror.",

  "latent_22541": "I’d hate to be thrown off a roof. I mean, imagine if I landed on this face. But that’s the future Europe and even the US are sleepwalking into if we let wacky progressive hand-wringers keep apologising for radical Islam and calling the rest of us racist for expressing our concern at mass immigration from cultures that care nothing for the rights of women and gays.\n\nYou want to see a “patriarchy”? Fly to Riyadh or Tehran. In the former, women can’t drive. (Alright, fair enough, they might be on to something there.) In the latter, gays are hanged, often from cranes in public places. ISIS is even more brutal, hurling fags off the roof after ritually humiliating them. In Raqqa you’ll see women and children sold for a few hundred dollars.\n\nThese are the attitudes we’re importing by allowing millions of Muslims to settle in western Europe. Sorry if that sounds intolerant, but remember women and gays aren’t just treated like shit by ISIS, but mainstream Muslim culture, too. I can’t remember how many Muslim countries have the death penalty for homosexuality. What is it, ten? Eleven?\n\nWe now know that at least one of the Paris terrorists came into Europe posing as a “refugee.” This confirms all the worst fears of progressive commentators who were hoping the political Right was wrong about the security threat mass immigration presented.\n\nBut there’s a more general concern for liberal western democracies: it’s not just the jihadis, but the attitudes of ordinary Muslims that are a grave cause for concern, not just for the women being gang-raped in Malmö but homosexuals everywhere in Europe.\n\nSo you can accuse me of being “islamophobic” if you want, because no, I don’t want to be shouted at or spat on in the street. Maybe my gayness is standing in the way of a Muslim utopia… but I’m going to be selfish here and say maybe we don’t import all the people who want to murder me.\n\nI’m serious. Gay people are getting stoned to death all the time in the Middle East, and not in the fun way: in the throw-big-rocks-at-your-head-until-you-die way. I don’t mean to be callous, but what are we gaining by letting these people in? Why can’t we help them with overseas aid? Why do they need to come here? Aren’t we just encouraging more of them to risk the trip by throwing our borders open?\n\nPut like that, I hope you can appreciate why I’m considering a move to the US and just what you’re giving up by transforming your societies and turning a blind eye to sharia courts where a woman’s testimony is, legally, worth less than a man’s.\n\nYou don’t hear progressives complaining about that sort of thing, of course, because somehow crybully Muslims occupy an even more prestigious position on the Oppression League Tables than women and homos. Why are Left-wingers so ferociously pro-immigration from these fucking awful countries? I really don’t get it.\n\nOf course, I realise there are some other options available to me. I could always take the veil. Terrorists pretend to be women by wearing it, so why can’t I pretend to be one too, to avoid being queer-bashed in Bradford? Plus, I wouldn’t get hit on by Pakistani rape gangs because as we all know they prefer helpless young white girls to their own beefy, hirsute womenfolk.\n\nBut when I think about it, British weather can be awfully muggy, and those things really don’t look very comfy. And how am I supposed to cruise handsome dads in the park wearing a black bedsheet?\n\nFrom what I can tell, it’s not women and children coming over in these “refugee crises” but strong 22-year-old men. Under ordinary circumstances I’d be fine with a bit of Middle Eastern rough, but I prefer my nocturnal encounters with dark-skinned men to be at least partially consensual.\n\nThe Left’s wilful, suicidal ignorance about Muslim culture is at odds with virtually every one of their cherished social justice prescriptions. They look for sexism in “mansplaining” and flirtatious remarks, yet turn a blind eye to a culture where the only acceptable role for women is head-scarfed housewife.\n\nThey see intolerance in Halloween costumes, yet ignore the regular atrocities of cultures that mass-murder each other over regional, tribal, and sectarian differences. They think conservatives who disagree with their definition of gay marriage to be bigots worthy of social ostracism, yet welcome into their midst a culture that wants to execute queers like me.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, just look at what’s happening in Sweden. A gay pride march that planned to go via a Muslim area was criticised and called “needlessly provocative” by progressives who care more about protecting an immigrant’s right to be a hateful bigot than the rights of gay citizens to express their sexual identity. What am I missing here?\n\nI know this is the point at which I’m supposed to say not all Muslims in the west are bad people, but I can’t bring myself to care about caveats when 1,200 girls are getting raped in Rotherham and Britain is sending more fighters to ISIS than almost any other country. As the journalist and activist Brigitte Gabriel points out, the peaceful majority are irrelevant.\n\nLiberals refuse to face the fact that Muslim immigrants will never adapt to western cultures and become typical Britons without some kind of massive re-education and assimilation. They expect us to expand our progressive worldview by accepting Islam’s bronze-age barbarism.\n\nThe problem with accepting all of these people, and their culture, is there’s no place for me in it. You get to have your ISIS friends, or you get to have Milo, because when you invite us to the same party… off the roof I go.\n\nPerhaps this is the Left’s plan all along. Banning me from campuses hasn’t dented my popularity, so perhaps murder is the only way the Left can get rid of me. I would take it as a compliment, but even I’m not egotistical enough to want western civilisation to be destroyed on my account.\n\nFollow Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) on Twitter and Facebook, or write to him at milo@breitbart.com.

  "latent_22654": "Edited post-HN: Wow, big response! WARNING: May contain traces of opinion, and naughty words like ‘shit’ and ‘internet explorer’.\n\nThis blog post was written in 2013, and many things have progressed. The predictions made have generally come true.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nUse jQuery for what it is meant for, not everything.\n\nIf you do stupid shit with the DOM, it will perform poorly.\n\nIf your web-app is slow, it’s because of your code, not the DOM.\n\nWhenever the native versus web argument arises, the biggest issue people usually have with web is performance. They quote figures like ‘60fps‘ and ‘scroll speed’, and, back when browsers were just getting good, i would say “OK, there’s work to be done, but they will get there”, which was met with anything from “Yeah maybe” to “No it will never happen!”.\n\nORLY?\n\nReally? You don’t think it can be as fast? You think that your proficiency as a developer outstrips the devs working under the hood of chrome? firefox? Interne..wait yeah you’re probably better than IE devs… But for decent browsers, it is a ridiculous assumption that your average iOS or Android developer is going to be able to custom implement a function that a Chrome or Firefox developer provides to you via an API. Not to mention the fact that these abstractions are constantly being tweaked and reviewed by thousands of developers every day.\n\nBut really, this point is redundant anyway, because when you get down to it, even C is an abstraction on assembly, and if you are an Android developer, you’re coding against Dalvik… which is just as much of an abstraction as JavaScript is anyway! Abstraction is more likely to increase speed, because someone smarter than you has written the bit that needs to be fast.\n\nBut again, this isn’t the topic of the post.\n\nPeople often throw around the statement “The DOM is slow”. This is a completely false statement. Utterly stupid. Look: http://jsfiddle.net/YNxEK/. Ten THOUSAND divs in about 200 milliseconds. For comparison, there are about 3000 elements on a Facebook wall, and you could, using JavaScript, render the whole thing in about 100 milliseconds. In a recent project, we needed a list of groups of items that would filter based on a users input. There were about 140 items, and it had to be fast on a phone. Currently, the implementation is as follows:\n\nOn filter change:\n\nDelete everything. Render everything from scratch.\n\nAnd it has absolutely no perceivable lag what so ever on a mobile phone. None. This is pretty much the worst implementation possible, but it was all that was needed because it was easily fast enough. Why then, do people say that the DOM is slow?\n\nI blame jQuery.\n\nThese days, when hiring for a front end developer position, there is a very simple way to determine how good a candidate is. “What are your thoughts on jQuery?”. This simple question will cull about 80% of applicants off the bat. Some cull-able answers (which I have actually seen):\n\n“I love JavaScript”. – Help them find the door, they will probably struggle on their own.\n\n“It’s a really helpful framework ” – A victim of group ignorance.\n\n” – A victim of group ignorance. “It’s good but not as fast as HTML5” – Haha… get out.\n\nI’m dead serious when I say these are all real answers from real people.\n\nYes, jQuery is the compatibility tool of choice these days, and for good reason; it solves the tedious problems it aims to solve in a really easy way. The problem is, most, and I do mean, the majority of ‘web developers’ think it is the only way to work with the DOM. It isn’t even that jQuery is slow; for what it does, it is quite fast. The issue is that a huge number of developers use it to do quite literally everything.\n\nActually, I blame developers…\n\nThis whole ‘DOM is slow’ is really just “I’m too stupid to know that what I’m doing is stupid”, and practically no one is immune. I once worked for a large ‘software’ company that came to me one day with a laggy screen in a ‘web app’ and said “fix this”. The bespoke JavaScript for this one screen was around 400 lines long, and had nearly 500 jQuery selections in it. Worse, many selections were being made within a loop, for no apparent reason! I ended up being able to delete about 90% of the selectors, by just assigning the selection to a variable, which resulted in a 1000% performance increase! Whenever you select an element (or elements) with jQuery, you’re instantiating a very feature-rich wrapper.\n\nIf all you are doing is making HTML elements, DO NOT USE JQUERY. About the worst possible way to create HTML is like this:\n\n$(‘<div class=”imAMoron”><span>derp</span></span>’);\n\nNot only will this be insanely slow in comparison to using the DOM method (document.createElement), it also leaves your code looking like a steaming pile of shit. If you need to make a lot of DOM in JavaScript, use a tool like laconic, or crel. And I do recommend creating lots of DOM in JavaScript, it is definitely faster than requesting the same structure from a server, then letting the browser parse the HTML to DOM, and then selecting the elements back out of the DOM to manipulate them.\n\nWhat now?\n\nFirst: ignore pretty much anything Facebook has to say about DOM performance. They really have no idea what they are talking about. Sencha was able to make a version of the Facebook mobile app with their framework, and it was FASTER than the official, native app, and Sencha isn’t even particularly fast.\n\nSecond: Stop using DOM libraries out of habit! If your target browser is IE8 or above, jQuery hardly provides any features that aren’t shipped on the host object anyway. document.querySelectorAll will pretty much do everything you need. jQuery is a tool, not a framework. Use it as such.\n\nThird: Use document fragments. If you are changing the state of the UI in a loop, don’t change it while that DOM is in the document, because every change you make will cause a re-draw or re-flow.\n\nFourth: USE THE GODDAMN PROFILER! In almost every case, the bottleneck will end up being your code, not the DOM.\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_22872": "(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nFor the first time on record, Americans are as likely to die by a gunshot as in a traffic accident, according to new federal data. Gun deaths now outnumber vehicle deaths in 21 states and the District of Columbia. That was true in just two states a decade ago, Alaska and Maryland.\n\nThe trend was driven largely by the sharp drop in the rate of traffic fatalities, a result of a series of laws and safety measures aimed at making driving safer. Gun homicide rates also have fallen in recent years, but have been offset by the rising prevalence of suicides. Today, suicides account for roughly two out of every three gun deaths.\n\nFrank McGeorge, an emergency medicine physician who works midnight shifts at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, said he has seen a big change in the types of cases he gets over his 25 years in medicine.\n\n“Cars are safer. Diagnoses and treatments have improved, with regard to accidents,” McGeorge said. “At the same time, guns are not any safer. There has been no change in the speed at which a 9 mm bullet travels; no change in the size of a 9 mm bullet.”\n\nBased on steady trends in recent years, public health experts have for some time expected gun deaths to catch up with traffic deaths. The 2014 rates were reported this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMedical ailments, like cancer and heart attacks, kill considerably more people each year than either guns or automobiles, according to the CDC. But firearms and motor vehicles are among the leading non-medical causes of mortality in the U.S., killing more people than falls and considerably more people than alcohol.\n\nGuns and traffic accidents each killed about 34,000 people in the U.S. last year, or about 93 people per day.\n\nThe rate at which Americans are killed in traffic accidents has dropped by more than half since the late 1960s. That decline can be attributed to a combination of improved technology, smarter regulation, and improved care in the hospital.\n\nThe federal government mandated the presence of seat belts in the 1960s. The ‘70s brought anti-lock brakes. The ‘80s saw a rise in anti-drunk driving advocacy and mandatory seat belt use. Then airbags came along in the '90s. More recent years have seen mandates on electronic stability systems that help prevent vehicles from spinning out and increased penalties for distracted driving.\n\nBrian Schaeffer, assistant chief of fire department in Spokane, Wash., said simple changes to highway engineering, such as erecting a physical divider between two lanes of traffic on a highway, also have dramatically improved chances of survival.\n\nIn the 1990s, Schaeffer said he regularly saw penetrating traumas or amputations in car collisions and routinely needed the Jaws of Life to extricate people from deadly accident scenes.\n\n“We’d just have horrible trauma, something you’d probably would only see in a battlefield,” Schaeffer said. Now, when responding to a high-speed crash, first responders often find the passengers and drivers walking around, he said.\n\nOn gun deaths, the story has been more complicated. Fatalities declined precipitously during the 1990s, but have plateaued since then. While gun homicides have continued to decline, suicides have risen.\n\nThose divergent trends reflect two different pictures of gun violence in the U.S. Black Americans are significantly more likely to be victims of homicide, but just one in five black households have guns. White Americans are more than twice as likely to have guns in their homes and they experience gun violence largely through suicides.\n\nRichard Reeves, a Brookings researcher who studies inequality, said the differences in how guns affect black and white Americans speak to the need to “think multidimensionally” about the problem. “The nature of those deaths are hugely different,” he said. Opponents and supporters of gun rights often “need to be honest that one blanket solution will not solve the problem.”\n\nThe history of regulations on guns has been erratic. Restrictions passed in earlier eras, like the assault weapons ban, have been undone recently in the face of strong political opposition. During the Bush administration, Congress passed laws that prohibited law enforcement from releasing data that shows where criminals obtained their guns and granted gunmakers immunity from some civil lawsuits.\n\nTechnological advances, like smart-gun technology that prevents people other than the owner from firing a gun, have been stymied by opposition from the National Rifle Association and from many gun owners. Even regulatory changes that enjoy overwhelming support from the American public, like universal background checks, have been thwarted.\n\nCongress has a longstanding ban on many types of federal gun research, which has affected not only federal agencies like the CDC, but also academic researchers.\n\nGaren Wintemute of University of California-Davis had to donate $1 million of his own money to keep his research going. He estimates that there are only a dozen full-time gun violence researchers in the U.S.\n\nOn the other hand, government and the auto industry have all invested in research, generating a lot of information on how cars crash and improvements in highway safety.\n\n“Tell me a scenario on how you crashed your car and I can almost always tell you what your injuries are without even looking at you,” said Babak Sarani, director of trauma and acute care surgery at the George Washington University Hospital.\n\nBut limited research funding has restricted innovations in gun safety and the development of policies that can improve gun safety and reduce firearm deaths.\n\n“We made an important difference with motor vehicle-related violence, and we chose not to do that with firearms,” Wintemute said. “This is the result.”",
  "latent_22915": "When Harold Haig was 10 years old, a man in a suit came to visit. \"He said to me, 'Would you like to go to this wonderful place called Australia where the sun shines all day every day and you pick oranges off the trees, live in a little white cottage by the sea and ride a horse to school?'\" remembers Haig, who is 73 but looks younger, with Pete Postlethwaite cheekbones and flowing white hair. \"While I was letting this sink in, he added, 'Well, you know you're an orphan, your parents are dead, you've got no family, you might as well go.'\"\n\nHaig was one of 7,000 children from British care homes who were shipped mostly to Australia and Canada between the second world war and 1967. The scandal of the lies and abuse suffered by these child migrants was exposed thanks to the tireless work of Margaret Humphreys, a social worker from Nottingham, who, in 1987, took it upon herself to help them find their families. As Oranges and Sunshine, a moving new film by Jim Loach – son of Ken – shows, Humphreys defied death threats to discover the truth about these former child migrants and their past lives. When Haig begins to talk, it is eerie because his softly spoken words and manner exactly resemble those of Jack, a traumatised former child migrant in the film who is played by Hugo Weaving. The British-Australian actor met and talked to Haig about his experiences before taking the role.\n\nApart from the man in the suit talking of oranges and sunshine, Haig barely remembers anything of his childhood in Britain. \"Because of my lack of memories, I may as well have been born in Australia when I was 11 years old,\" he says, bleakly. He was sure he had a sister called Marie, but he could not remember anything at all about his mother: no image, no voice, no smell. \"Just a blank. An absolute blank.\"\n\nSurrounded by other \"orphaned\" children, the voyage to Australia was an adventure (\"we ran riot\"). When Haig arrived, he was dispatched to a Church of England boarding school in Melbourne. Other child migrants were less fortunate, as Oranges and Sunshine reveals through the story of Len, played by David Wenham. Many ended up in the care of the notorious Christian Brothers where they were treated as slave labour and suffered horrific physical and sexual abuse. One victim told an official inquiry that his Christian Brother carers competed to become the first to rape him 100 times.\n\nHaig escaped such trauma – he would be beaten with a strap if he did anything wrong – but, as he says: \"The thing missing in an institution for children is that there is no love. You get punished but there is no one there to put their arm around you and say it's OK.\" One of many powerful scenes in Oranges and Sunshine is when the character based on Haig falteringly explains how he feels: \"There's an emptiness in me. There always has been and I think the only thing that could fill it was her, my mother.\" Haig says something similar when he talks of how he married, had three children and established a successful signwriting business: \"Anyone would've thought there's a fella who's got everything, but it was like I had a block of ice inside me. I felt empty. I knew I was missing something. I couldn't work out what it was. And there was this feeling – I didn't know who I was. I didn't know where I'd come from. I didn't belong to anybody. I was in this void.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Haig sank into a deep depression. He was prescribed antidepressants, saved them up and swallowed them all. \"I wanted to die. I wanted to go to sleep and not wake up to get rid of this pain, this emptiness,\" he says. His wife, normally a good sleeper, woke up and saved his life. He wishes he hadn't tried to take his life at home, while his children slept.\n\nThe \"beautiful\" younger sister he was always convinced he had eventually traced him through the Salvation Army. Marie had been separated from their mother and Haig, and raised in care homes in Britain; unlike Haig, she remembered her sibling. One day, in 1987, Marie told him she was coming to Australia with a social worker, Margaret Humphreys, who she wanted him to meet. Haig, by then divorced and wandering the Australian outback (\"I don't know what I was looking for\"), was unimpressed. \"I'd seen a lot of social workers and I had no respect for any of them,\" he says.\n\nWhile Oranges and Sunshine shows Humphreys struggling to win the trust of some child migrants, Haig quickly came to respect her. She was the first to raise the possibility that Haig had been told a terrible untruth – that he might not be an orphan after all. \"I didn't think anyone would be so cruel to tell you that sort of a lie,\" he says. He is amazed by Emily Watson's performance as Humphreys in the film. \"I could've been watching Margaret,\" he says.\n\nHaig visited Britain for six months in 1989 to get to know Marie, who passed away 14 years ago, and to help Humphreys track down his mother. With so little record-keeping by the authorities, still in denial over the scale of the trauma they created, it took another few years for them to get confirmation that Haig had not been an orphan. His parents had separated during the war, and with two children, no benefits and no relatives nearby, his mother had been forced to give up her son and daughter.\n\nHumphreys discovered Haig's mother had lived two miles from where he was kept in homes (eight institutions in 14 months before he was \"deported\" – as the former child migrants say – to Australia) and had died just a year before he first visited Britain. The belated release of more suppressed information 10 years ago also helped Humphreys, who was awarded a CBE this year, finally identify Haig's deceased father.\n\nNo photographs remain of his mother, and Haig will forever wonder why he was given up and whether his mother tried to find him. As Oranges and Sunshine shows, parents were often deceived by the authorities and told their children had been adopted or even that they were dead. \"Mothers went to their graves never knowing that their children were still alive, and happy, and well,\" says Haig. \"It's criminal. I don't know what worse you can do to people.\"\n\nWhy did this happen? For the British authorities, a one-way ticket to Australia was cheaper than looking after children in care homes. For the Australian government, petrified they would be overrun by Asian immigrants, white children were ideal fodder for the racist \"White Australia\" policy.\n\nIn 2009, the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd apologised to child migrants. \"It's a day we'll never forget,\" says Haig, who is secretary of the International Association of Former Child Migrants and their Families, and is still good friends with Humphreys. Gordon Brown followed with an apology on behalf of the British government a year later.\n\nThe trauma of all these state-sanctioned lies and abuse has left a long, scarring legacy. Haig is still estranged from his two daughters who felt deserted when his depression destroyed his marriage. \"They think I abandoned them, and in many ways I did. I had trouble looking after myself,\" he says, anguish in his voice. He has since been reconciled with his son, and he hopes the film might yet bring him back together with his daughters.\n\n\"What Margaret did for me and for thousands of child migrants is to give us back our lives, give us back our identity, and shine a light in where there was just darkness.\" Where would he be without Humphreys? \"I have my doubts about whether I'd be here alive,\" he says. \"You should ask, where would all of us be?\"",

  "latent_23178": "Unattended barbecue pit blamed for Waukegan restaurant fire\n\nhello\n\nA fire damaged Hillery's Bar-BQ Thursday morning, and fire officials say the restaurant will likely be closed for a month or so while repairs are made. Photo courtesy of Steven Lenzi\n\nBurning charcoal that grew too hot in the barbecue pit at Hillery's Bar-BQ is to blame for a fire there that has shut down the Waukegan restaurant, fire officials say.\n\nWaukegan firefighters were called at about 9:30 a.m. to the restaurant, 2021 N. Lewis Lane, and arrived to discover fire in the BBQ pit and heavy flames coming out of the chimney, Waukegan Fire Marshal Steven Lenzi said.\n\nThe fire had spread from the pit -- a cooking area resembling a large glass aquarium atop a solid steel base where charcoal is kept burning -- and up through the metal hood and into the chimney that carries smoke away from the cooking meat, Lenzi said.\n\n\"They had already been cooking for a while this morning,\" Lenzi said. \"They continued to add charcoal as needed and added too much charcoal. If it gets going too hot, they'll spray it down with water. It happened during an employee break time, and it just got away from them.\"\n\nThe front cooking area of the restaurant was also affected, he said, with about $50,000 in total damage to the building and another $25,000 in damage to the contents.\n\nThe fire was brought under control within 30 minutes.\n\n\"(Firefighters') quick actions and efforts will allow this business to reopen to their longtime Waukegan patrons in a much quicker manner,\" Lenzi said.\n\nLenzi expects the restaurant to remain closed for about a month while owners repair the drop ceiling and some light fixtures, in addition to the damaged pit area and smoke damage.\n\nThe cause of the fire is considered unattended cooking, Lenzi said. Nobody was injured.\n\nLenzi wanted to remind people that Thanksgiving is the No. 1 time of year for cooking fires.\n\n\"Hopefully we can all learn from the mistakes of a professional cook and make the most of a bad situation,\" he said. \"Hopefully we can prevent fires during the upcoming holiday season.\"",

  "latent_23526": "This article will go through tips on how to become a better programmer and is written by Natasha Postolovski, a Graduate Software Developer at ThoughtWorks. You can follow her on Twitter: @npostolovski.\n\nAs a Junior Developer, I often seek feedback from more experienced developers around me to learn how I can improve my code and be better at my job. At ThoughtWorks, I’m lucky to be surrounded by people who care about sharing what they know, and helping others to be better. Six months into my career as a Software Developer I feel like I’ve learned a lot about how to avoid some of the most common mistakes Junior developers make, and I wanted to share these tips with you today.\n\nWhether you’re working your first Software Development job, learning to code and building your first app, or hoping to break into the industry for the first time, I hope you’ll find this useful\n\nOfficial docs over Stack Overflow\n\nWhen you first start learning to code, Stack Overflow is your best friend. It allows you to make progress when you’re uncertain, or when you run into bugs that you don’t know how to fix. But I’ve noticed that more senior developers are much less likely to seek out answers on Stack Overflow, and instead prefer to turn to the official docs for the language or tool they’re using. They understand the benefits of having a real understanding of the tool or language they’re trying to work with, not just seeking out a quick fix in order to solve the problem at hand. Whenever I end up on Stack Overflow, most of the time it’s because I don’t have a deep enough understanding of the technology I’m working with. It can be helpful in a pinch, but shouldn’t be used to cover up a shallow understanding of your chosen tool or language.\n\nNii Ashikwei Tetteh is a software developer at ThoughtWorks, and has also been a trainer at its five-week boot camp for graduate (Junior) developers, called ThoughtWorks University. He has worked with dozens of Junior developers, and says: “While it’s good to reach out to the larger community and use example code or find solutions that work, it’s much more important to understand why and how they work, and what you could have done to get there on your own.” He says that while reading documentation can be a little boring, it’s crucial to gain a real understanding of the language or framework you’re dealing with.\n\nZoom out\n\nJunior developers tend to have a much smaller zone of focus when working within a system. It’s as if we look at the code through a microscope, while more senior developers look at it through a wide-angle lens. More experienced developers will take time to think through the potential side effects of what they’re working on, as well as how it fits into the overall system. They’ll ask questions like: is this consistent with how things have been done elsewhere in the codebase? Is the code reused elsewhere in the system? Will this code be easy to maintain in the future? As you work, remember to zoom out and think about how your code fits within the context of the system as a whole.\n\nDo your own quality assurance (QA)\n\nMost teams will have some combination of automated and/or manual testing to ensure that new features meet requirements, are of high quality, and don’t break any existing functionality. You may even be lucky enough to have a dedicated tester on your team, someone who can make sure that what you’ve built is fit for purpose and think through a variety of scenarios to test. In Agile environments, it’s an anti-pattern when work is pushed back (i.e. from the ‘In Development’ stage, to the ‘Review’ (QA) stage, back to the ‘In Development’ stage again). This usually occurs when the developer did not understand or did not meet the acceptance criteria – the laundry list of things the work must do in order to be considered ‘done’.\n\nBy doing rigorous testing if your own work before it gets to this review step, you’ll get better at producing quality work, thinking through test scenarios and edge cases, save time for the rest of your team, and keep work moving forward rather than backwards. If you’re working alone, this additional QA step is even more important. If you don’t discover bugs and errors before they make it into production, nobody else will!\n\nDon’t ignore the world around your work\n\nIt’s easy to feel like nothing is more important than the next feature or problem to be solved. Meetings, research and time spent gathering broader context for your work can feel like painful interludes between getting your hands dirty in the code. However, you’ll soon come to realise that understanding the whys of what you’re doing are more important than the hows. If you’re missing context or an understanding of the business, industry or organization that you’re working within, you may end up building things that people don’t need, or won’t use. A significant chunk of Junior developer mistakes are due to us misunderstanding or making assumptions about the domain we’re working in. Take the time to understand how things work in the real world before trying to translate them into code.\n\nTests are your safety net, and your compass\n\nWriting tests is extremely important for Junior developers, especially when you’re working on a team, or contributing to a larger system being maintained by multiple developers. Tests are an excellent way to drive out your implementation, but more importantly for Junior developers, they’re a fantastic safety net to guard you as your work. Good tests will let you know as soon as you’ve broken something. Try to run your test suite at intervals as you work to make sure nothing you’ve done has had unintended side effects. Tests will give you the confidence to make the changes and improvements that the codebase needs.\n\nIf you’re working on your own and not yet writing tests, it’s worth taking the time to learn to write unit tests in your language of choice.\n\nSeparate your concerns\n\nWhether you’re working with object-oriented or functional languages, a good separation of concerns is the mark of a skilled developer. Experienced developers have an instinct for identifying separate concerns and the boundaries between them. But what does ‘concern’ mean, in this context?\n\nAreas of responsibility in the code\n\nAreas of focus in the code\n\nOr a particular ‘job’ the code is doing\n\nJunior developers often struggle to identify and separate different concerns. A good rule is to create one file for each area of responsibility in the code.\n\nA useful trick for identifying separate areas of responsibilities is the ‘AND Test’: if when you are describe a file or class in your code you need to use the word ‘AND’, you’ve probably identified responsibilities that could (and probably should) be separated.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nThe Conference class is responsible for scheduling AND displaying conference timetables. (Fails the AND test).\n\nInstead, what about:\n\nThe ConferenceScheduler class is responsible for scheduling conferences.\n\nThe SchedulePresenter is responsible for presenting schedules.\n\nWhen you divide your code like this you may end up with files that are quite concise – less than 50 lines, even. This is OK! An application composed of small classes that work well together is likely to be much easier to work with than a monolithic application composed of several large classes that each do many different things.\n\nWrite short methods\n\nIf there’s one code smell I see often among Junior developers, it’s long methods/functions. A common pattern is a method, named after its end result, which does absolutely everything needed to achieve that end result, often over many lines of code, and working at a very low level (manipulating strings, looping over data). This can make your methods hard to work with and understand – in fact, there are few things more intimidating than trying to understand a long, complex method that triggers a Rube Goldberg Machine-like chain of events in order to achieve some end result.\n\nOne way to approach this is to allow your implementation to start as one long method, then break it out into private methods that perform a step, and document what is being done.\n\nHere’s an example in Ruby. We want to be able to call a method that makes us a delicious pizza with our chosen toppings, something like:\n\ndef make_pizza_with(toppings) preheat_oven divide_and_roll_dough add_toppings(toppings) bake_pizza slice_and_serve end\n\nThe ‘make_pizza_with’ method calls a number of other methods that each perform a step in the process. They each have their own set of sub-steps that go into completing them, for example:\n\ndef preheat_oven(temperature, time) walk_to_oven turn_on_oven turn_dial_to(temperature) set_timer_for(time)\n\nYou could easily implement the ‘make_pizza_with’ method at this low level of detail, eliminating the separate steps and instead including all the various details needed to make a pizza, like walking to the oven, taking toppings out of the fridge, or getting a pizza tray out of the cupboard. And yet, a recipe written like this would be quite annoying. As a reader, we’re interested in the high-level steps in a process, not all the nitty gritty details. Your code will be more readable and easier to maintain if you treat your methods in the same way.\n\nBut when do you extract parts of a large method into smaller methods? Often, you’ll find that when you have an urge to write a comment to explain what part of your code does, you should extract it into a separate method instead.\n\nSeek constructive criticism\n\nPraise is fantastic, and it’s something that we seek out to fuel us and keep us going. While praise is important, constructive criticism is also essential to help you improve as a developer. You’re a Junior developer because you still have a lot to learn, and constructive criticism can help you identify those areas where you can improve your approach, and your code. If you work with other developers who are reviewing your pull requests, you’re probably getting regular feedback on your code on a line by line basis, but may be missing feedback on your overall approach to solving problems, or other skills like how you work with others on your team. If you work on a team with a different development workflow, like pairing, you’re likely to get much more immediate feedback.\n\nThe easiest way to get constructive criticism is to ask for it. Ask someone who’s worked with or seen your code to coffee and say you’d love to get some feedback from them. Give them some notice so they can think of concrete things to say. Do them the favour if giving them some feedback in return. If you ask for constructive feedback, people will most likely think of something to say, even if it’s not that big of a deal. Remember that the issue likely isn’t as bad as it seems in the moment, and that if this person is taking time out of their day to give you feedback, it means that they care about your progress. Andy Marks is a software developer with over ten years of experience. He says: “If you take pride in your code, it shows when you read it. If you don’t take pride in your code, that also shows. The people who recognise your sense of pride are people you want to work with.”\n\nIt can be more difficult to gather feedback for developers who’re working alone. Find ways to program with others whenever possible, whether that’s contributing to open source, taking part in hackathons, or having pizza and code sessions with developer friends.\n\nFind a mentor\n\nWhether you work on a team with other developers, or do most of your programming alone, a technical mentor can help you grow your skills faster and avoid common mistakes. The question is, how do you actually get a mentor? Rarely do we walk up to a colleague or friend and say ‘Will you be my mentor?’ Instead, it often starts with asking someone to coffee, and goes from there.\n\nSoftware Developer Nii Ashikwei Tetteh says: “We’re building on work that started decades ago, and those that came before us even by a few years have a wealth of knowledge we can benefit from. You will always be responsible for doing the groundwork, but you should have someone who can have some objective oversight on what you’re doing and where you’re going if you want to make sure you don’t deviate from your goals.”\n\nCodementor is also another place to find long-term mentorship from expert developers.\n\nGet really familiar with your text editor/IDE, and know its keyboard shortcuts\n\nLike a blacksmith’s hammer, a scientist’s microscope, or a teacher’s chalkboard, your text editor or IDE is an essential tool for your work. If you’re comfortable and quick with your tool of choice, you’ll work faster, smarter, and other developers will enjoy pairing with you. If you’ve ever pair programmed with someone who’s not comfortable with their editor, you’ll know how frustrating that can be. Try to avoid doing the same to others.\n\nIt doesn’t matter so much which editor or IDE you choose as your own. In the hands of someone who really understands it, just about any text editor or IDE can be an extremely powerful tool. Take the time to know your tool, and let it help you in return. Andy Marks adds: “If you’re using a modern IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ and a static language like Java, your IDE will give you lots of suggestions for improvements in your code, like unused attributes and methods, or expressions that can be simplified. Listen to these suggestions!”\n\nPair program with more experienced developers\n\nPair programming with more experienced developers can be daunting. They’re most likely faster than you in many senses of the word: faster at writing code, faster at solving problems, and faster at identifying the cause of bugs and errors. ‘Driving’ (controlling the keyboard) while a more senior developer is ‘navigating’ (sitting back and directing) can feel slightly painful if you’re still working out all the shortcuts in your IDE, or how to think through problems on the fly. However, you’ll learn a great deal through pairing. It can sometimes feel easier or more rewarding to work on problems on your own, but you may not learn as much.\n\nIdeally, you’ll do a mix of pairing and occasionally working on your own. In addition to pair programming, Junior developers need the chance to make mistakes, make decisions, and try things out on our own, at our own pace, and the space to figure out how things work without feeling like we’re slowing someone else down.\n\nListen to and respect more senior developers around you, as well as other juniors\n\nAlana George is a developer at ThoughtWorks, and another former ThoughtWorks University trainer. She says: “I’ve seen people respect the other experienced people around them, but disrespect other Juniors, or think that those Junior don’t know as much as them. Remember that you can learn from everyone around you.” Software development is an enormous field, and everyone has something to teach you.\n\nUse good method/variable names instead of comments\n\nThe use of comments consistently divides software developers. Some appreciate a few well-placed comments, while others regard them as almost universally unnecessary. There are arguments to be made for both sides, but either way, moments where you’re tempted to write a comment provide a good opportunity to pause and reflect, and ask yourself the following questions:\n\nIs this a sign that my implementation is complex or difficult to read?\n\nInstead of writing a comment to explain what the code does, could I pull the code out into a separate variable, method or function with a descriptive name?\n\nDo I really need a comment here, or am I just stating the obvious?\n\n“Good comments explain why, not what,” says Andy Marks. “Do more of the former and none of the latter. A well named method or variable will beat a well-written comment every day.”\n\nExpose your ignorance, daily\n\nSoftware development is an immense, multifaceted field that touches on a huge number of domains. Experts exist in almost every subset of software development, from databases, to security, to performance optimization. Even experienced software developers can’t know everything, and as a Junior, you are most likely missing a great deal of knowledge. The best way to accelerate the rate at which you gain that missing knowledge is by exposing your ignorance.\n\nAt least once a day you’ll hear or read about a term or technology you don’t understand. Don’t nod along and pretend you understand – ask. If you don’t speak up, it’s a missed opportunity to learn. You will go further in your career as a software developer if you prize genuine understanding and learning before appearances. You’ll also notice that it’s often the most senior and experienced developers who are most comfortable with admitting when they’ve made a mistake, or when they don’t understand something. Alana George says: “A lot of people are scared to look stupid or expose their ignorance, but it’s something you have to do in order to learn, so ask questions, clarify stuff and then verify your understanding is correct.”\n\nHave side projects\n\nYour side projects are your playground, a place to follow your interests and try out new tools without harsh deadlines or high stakes. For Junior developers, side projects are a great way to fill gaps in your knowledge, build your experience, make decisions – and deal with the consequences, both good and bad – all on your own.\n\nYour side projects don’t need to be big or impressive. In fact, side projects you can finish in a day’s work or less are ideal. They’re small enough not to be daunting, but big enough that they can accomplish something useful. If you’re stuck for ideas, try solving a small problem in your life with a technical solution. For example:\n\nBuild a tool that downloads the session times from your local cinema once a week and emails you if there are any films showing with an iMDB rating of 8 or higher\n\nBuild a simple app to tell you when your favorite band is touring in your city\n\nBuild a custom dashboard for the prices of stocks or collectable items you own\n\nCreate a website to showcase your photography, where each page’s color scheme changes dynamically based on the dominant colors in each photograph\n\nNii Ashikwei Tetteh says: “In order to keep growing you can’t rely on your main job alone. Your company and its clients and customers each have their priorities, and you have yours. Work life balance is important, but so is making the time and space to do what you want to do with your skills and see how you’ve grown, build something fun and share your skills with the larger world outside of your work.”\n\nJunior developers, what has helped you improve the most?

  "latent_23700": "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery\n\nGood morning and thank you all for being here. I am joined today by FBI Executive Assistant Director Paul Abbate, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California Brian Stretch and Office of International Affairs Director Vaughn Ary.\n\nWe are here to announce a major law enforcement action related to one of the largest data breaches in U.S. history.\n\nToday, we are announcing the indictment of four individuals responsible for the 2014 hack into the network of email provider Yahoo, the theft of information about at least 500 million Yahoo accounts and the use of that information to obtain the contents of accounts at Yahoo and other email providers.\n\nThe defendants include two officers of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), an intelligence and law enforcement agency of the Russian Federation and two criminal hackers with whom they conspired to accomplish these intrusions.\n\nDmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, both FSB officers, protected, directed, facilitated and paid criminal hackers to collect information through computer intrusions in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nThey worked with co-conspirators Alexsey Belan and Karim Baratov to hack into computers of American companies providing email and internet-related services, to maintain unauthorized access to those computers and to steal information, including information about individual users and the private contents of their accounts.\n\nThe defendants targeted Yahoo accounts of Russian and U.S. government officials, including cyber security, diplomatic and military personnel. They also targeted Russian journalists; numerous employees of other providers whose networks the conspirators sought to exploit; and employees of financial services and other commercial entities.\n\nBelan has been indicted twice before in the United States for three intrusions into e-commerce companies that victimized millions of customers, and he has been one of the FBI’s most wanted cyber criminals for more than three years.\n\nBelan’s notorious criminal conduct and a pending Interpol Red Notice did not stop the FSB officers who, instead of detaining him, used him to break into Yahoo’s networks.\n\nMeanwhile, Belan used his relationship with the two FSB officers and his access to Yahoo to commit additional crimes to line his own pockets with money.\n\nSpecifically, Belan used his access to Yahoo to search for and steal financial information, such as gift card and credit card numbers, from users’ email accounts.\n\nHe also gained access to more than 30 million Yahoo accounts, whose contacts were then stolen to facilitate an email spam scheme.\n\nWith these charges, the Department of Justice is continuing to send the powerful message that we will not allow individuals, groups, nation states or a combination of them to compromise the privacy of our citizens, the economic interests of our companies, or the security of our country.\n\nFor those not familiar with the FSB, it is an intelligence and law enforcement agency and a successor to the Soviet Union’s KGB. The FSB unit that the defendants worked for, the Center for Information Security, aka Center 18, is also the FBI’s point of contact in Moscow for cyber-crime matters.\n\nThe involvement and direction of FSB officers with law enforcement responsibilities makes this conduct that much more egregious. There are no free passes for foreign state-sponsored criminal behavior.\n\nThrough the work of the National Security Division, the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Offices around the country, we continue to pursue national security cyber threats, using all available tools to investigate malicious activity and attribute it to the country, agency and even individuals involved.\n\nWhen possible, and supported by the evidence, we intend to charge those individuals and bring them to justice.\n\nAs I wrap up, I am also pleased to announce that a fourth co-conspirator charged in the indictment, Karim Baratov, was arrested just yesterday in Canada on a U.S. government provisional arrest warrant.\n\nI’d like to thank all of those who worked diligently to bring the investigation to this point, including the men and women of the National Security Division, the FBI, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California and the Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs for their tireless work.\n\nI’d also like to thank Yahoo and Google, whose customers were targeted, and who cooperated with us.

  "latent_23788": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi insurgents are preparing for an assault on Baghdad, with sleeper cells planted inside the capital to rise up at “Zero Hour” and aid fighters pushing in from the outskirts, according to senior Iraqi and U.S. security officials.\n\nMembers of the Iraqi security forces take their positions during an intensive security deployment west of Baghdad, June 24, 2014. REUTERS/Ahmed Saad\n\nSunni fighters have seized wide swathes of the north and west of the country in a three week lightning advance and say they are bearing down on the capital, a city of 7 million people still scarred by the intense street fighting between its Sunni and Shi’ite neighborhoods during U.S. occupation.\n\nThe government says it is rounding up members of sleeper cells to help safeguard the capital, and Shi’ite paramilitary groups say they are helping the authorities. Some Sunni residents say the crackdown is being used to intimidate them.\n\nIraqis speak of a “Zero Hour” as the moment a previously-prepared attack plan would start to unfold.\n\nA high-level Iraqi security official estimated there were 1,500 sleeper cell members hibernating in western Baghdad and a further 1,000 in areas on the outskirts of the capital.\n\nHe said their goal was to penetrate the U.S.-made “Green Zone” - a fortified enclave of government buildings on the west bank of the Tigris - as a propaganda victory and then carve out enclaves in west Baghdad and in outlying areas.\n\n“There are so many sleeper cells in Baghdad,” the official said. “They will seize an area and won’t let anyone take it back... In western Baghdad, they are ready and prepared.”\n\nA man who describes himself as a member of one such cell, originally from Anbar province, the mainly Sunni Western area that has been a heartland of the insurgency, said he has been working in Baghdad as a laborer while secretly coordinating intelligence for his group of Sunni fighters.\n\nThe attack on the capital will come soon, said the man, who asked to be called Abu Ahmed.\n\n“We are ready. It can come any minute,” he told Reuters during a meeting in a public place, glancing nervously around to see if anyone was watching.\n\n“We will have some surprises,” he said. He pulled his baseball cap down tight on his face and stopped speaking anytime a stranger approached.\n\nA portly man in his mid-30s wearing a striped sports shirt, the man said he fought as part of an insurgent group called the 1920 Revolution Brigades during the U.S. occupation and was jailed by the Iraqi government from 2007-2009.\n\nHe gave up fighting in 2010, tired from war and relatively optimistic about the future. But last year, he took up arms again out of anger at a crackdown against Sunni protesters by the Shi’ite-led government, joining the Military Council, a loose federation of Sunni armed groups and tribal fighters that has since emerged as a full-fledged insurgent umbrella group.\n\nWhile it was not possible to verify all details of his story, Reuters reporters are confident of his identity.\n\nLike many Sunni fighters, Abu Ahmed is not a member of the al Qaeda offshoot once known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, and is ambivalent about the group which launched the latest uprising by seizing the main northern city Mosul on June 10 and shortened its name this week to the Islamic State.\n\nMany Sunni armed groups turned against al Qaeda during the U.S. occupation but are now rallying to ISIL’s rebellion against the Shi’ite led government, though some say they deplore ISIL’s tactics of killing civilians and branding Shi’ites heretics.\n\nAbu Ahmed said his own group, which includes former officers in Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein’s disbanded army, supports some aims of ISIL. “There are some good members of ISIL and some bad,” he said. Of the good ones: “We have the same cause.”\n\nSECURITY PLANS\n\nThe government says it can protect the capital and has spies who are tracking sleeper agents like Abu Ahmed to round them up.\n\n“We have ample security plans. The sleeper cells are not only in Baghdad but in all other provinces and they are waiting for any chance to carry out attacks,” said Lieutenant-General Qassim Atta, the prime minister’s military spokesman.\n\n“We keep those cells under careful and daily scrutiny and follow up. We have arrested some of them. We have dispatched intelligence members to follow up those cells closely and we have special plans to counter their activities.”\n\nAn attempt to take Baghdad, a majority Shi’ite city with heavily fortified areas, would be a huge task for a rebellion that has so far concentrated on controlling Sunni areas. Many Baghdadis, Sunnis as well as Shi’ites, say they would fight an insurgency led by militants who want to establish a caliphate.\n\nThe Iraqi capital was the principle battlefield in Iraq’s worst sectarian bloodletting from 2006-2007, with tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, killed in fighting between Sunni insurgents, Shi’ite militias and U.S. troops.\n\nThen, millions of people fled the capital and millions more fled homes within it, turning previously mixed neighborhoods into fortresses dominated by one sect or the other.\n\nAlthough it has been at least six years since warring Sunni insurgents and Shi’ite militia last held open sway over whole sections of Baghdad, the capital has remained vulnerable to infiltration by ISIL suicide bombers, who strike Shi’ite and government targets almost daily.\n\nA senior U.S. intelligence official said Washington had evidence that ISIL was in the process of configuring its forces for a Baghdad assault using a plan that would include coordinated ISIL suicide strikes.\n\nHowever, other U.S. officials believe ISIL could overextend itself were it to try to take all of Baghdad. They say the more likely scenario would be for fighters to seize a Sunni district and cause disruption with bomb attacks.\n\nISIL fighters insist that their plan is to take the capital and topple Baghdad’s political elite.\n\n“We will receive orders about Zero Hour,” said Abu Sa’da, an ISIL fighter reached by telephone in Mosul. He said the group had cells in Baghdad and communicated with them by e-mail despite the government’s sporadic blocking of Internet in an effort to disrupt the militants.\n\nCAT AND MOUSE\n\nFor now, it is a cat and mouse game in the city. Abu Ahmed said the insurgency had agents in the Iraqi security forces, government ministries and inside the Green Zone. Men like him try to dodge an intensified campaign by the security forces and Shi’ite militias to round up conspirators.\n\nThere are “more detentions right now especially of ex-military officers and those who had been in American jails,” he said. “Their houses are raided by special police and militias, then we never hear about them again. We check the jails, they are not there.”\n\nSo far, they’ve managed to free 12 of them, at least one with the help of a 20,000 U.S. dollar bribe. He blames harsh treatment by the Iraqi government for forcing them to war, opening his shirt to reveal two dark scars on his chest he says came from interrogations in custody. There was no way to verify his allegations of abuse by the security forces.\n\nThe prospect of an assault on Baghdad has led Shi’ite paramilitaries, mainly underground since 2008, to mobilize this year to help the authorities fight ISIL. Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, a Shi’ite group Washington believes is funded and armed by Iran, says it has helped round up insurgent agents in Baghdad.\n\nThe movement says it is taking orders from the government and responding to a fatwa by Shi’ite clergy three weeks ago calling on citizens to help the armed forces.\n\nThe insurgents’ “goal is to control Baghdad and also to forestall the political process in Baghdad. They will try to execute this plot with their sleeper cells,” said Asaib Ahl al-Haq spokesman Ahmed al-Kinani. “We arrest them and hand them over to security forces.”\n\nMany Sunnis in Baghdad say such activity has brought back memories of the last decade’s civil war, when Shi’ite militias and Sunni insurgents prowled the streets, capturing and killing the innocent under the excuse of rooting out terrorist foes. Now people are disappearing again.\n\nA Sunni woman who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared retribution from Asaib Ahl al-Haq, said her brother was first held by police for 13 days in April. Eight hours after he was released, masked Asaib fighters stormed into their house and took him.\n\n“Their faces were covered. They had no number plates on their cars,” she said. That was the last time she saw him.",

  "latent_24807": "The continued outbreak of Salmonella from raw poultry has policymakers in Congress questioning whether current standards and inspection practices are enough to keep consumers safe.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced recently that since March 2013 about 480 people across 25 states have become sick from consuming chicken contaminated with an antibiotic-resistant strain of Heidelberg Salmonella. Nearly two out of every five of those people had to be hospitalized.\n\nOn the same day as the CDC announcement, representatives from Foster Farms – based in California – issued a statement lauding the company’s commitment to food safety, while publicizing its revamped and comprehensive “multifaceted Salmonella control program.”\n\nInvestigations conducted by local, state and federal officials indicated that consumption of Foster Farms brand chicken is “the likely source” of the Salmonella outbreak.\n\nNo other chicken brands or companies were mentioned.\n\n“[U.S. Department of Agriculture officials have affirmed that the interventions are working and confirmed, ‘Foster Farms is performing far better than the industry average,’” the company stated in a Monday, March 3 release. “Recent, in-market testing conducted by Foster Farms at the point of purchase further underscored that while Salmonella can be present in all brands of chicken, Foster Farms is among the safest choices available to consumers.”\n\n\"Recent, in-market testing conducted by Foster Farms at the point of purchase further underscored that while Salmonella can be present in all brands of chicken, Foster Farms is among the safest choices available to consumers.\"\n\nCalls to Foster Farms for further comment were unreturned.\n\nThe number of sick consumers may be as many as 17,000 people based on CDC estimates, which state that the actual number of Salmonella cases could be 29 times higher than reported cases because people who only become mildly sick often do not report their cases.\n\nPeople infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. Illness typically lasts anywhere from four to seven days. But in severe cases, infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, possibly resulting in death.\n\nSecond Salmonella outbreak from Foster Farms sparks criticism\n\nA different Salmonella outbreak linked to Foster Farms reportedly infected another 134 people across a dozen states in July.\n\n“An outbreak of food-borne illness on the scale of that reported by the CDC in July is undoubtedly disconcerting to the American public,” wrote Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), who serves on the subcommittee responsible for overseeing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and agriculture, in a statement. “A second outbreak emanating from the same company is wholly unacceptable.”\n\nSteve Matzker/For Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting\n\nRep. Louise Slaughter (D-NY), who has been a vocal food-safety proponent while serving in Congress by repeatedly attempting to pass legislation to limiting the use of antibiotics in livestock feed, has also been critical.\n\nSlaughter said failures related to the Foster Farms outbreak show the weaknesses of the USDA, while saying that “it is a disgrace” that the department did not prevent the two different Foster Farms outbreaks from happening.\n\n“The USDA’s toothless decisions endangers public health today, and encourages bad actors in the food industry to continue to break the law tomorrow,” said Slaughter in a statement. “The American people need a regulatory agency that works for them and not the food industry.”\n\nA December report by Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit organization that seeks to “improve public policy” and “inform the public,” echoed similar concerns.\n\nThe report concluded that current standards for Salmonella contamination for chicken do not adequately protect public health because there are no Salmonella performance standards for chicken parts, which are purchased more widely than whole chickens.\n\nIt also noted that companies receive advance notice from the Food Safety and Inspection Service before samples from their facilities are tested for Salmonella, and that the agency cannot close a plant based only on results from salmonella testing.\n\nFurthermore, the report found that the Food Safety and Inspection Service does not consider Salmonella as an adulterant in raw poultry, but rather as an indicator-organism used to determine whether a company is producing safe food overall.\n\nAnd it also noted that the USDA agency also does not have the authority to enforce mandatory recalls, which help prevent the spread of known contaminated poultry.\n\nFacing criticism, FSIS stands by its inspection practices\n\nThe USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service is the public health regulatory agency responsible for inspecting meat, poultry and processed egg products. The agency’s jurisdiction on inspections starts at the slaughterhouse, where each day inspectors examine carcasses for disease and ensure that animals are slaughtered in a sanitary manner.\n\nSalmonella and campylobacters are among the possible threats that inspectors monitor.\n\nMore on Salmonella outbreaks: The current Salmonella outbreak is particularly potent because the strain is resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics. Thirteen percent of the sick people linked to the chicken have developed blood infections as a result of their illness. Typically, only 5 percent of those with Salmonella infections develop blood infections.People who have become ill range are less than one year old to people to older than 93 years old. The median age is 18 years old.Three out of every four Salmonella cases linked to the Foster Farms outbreak occur in California, reported the CDC. Other recent Salmonella outbreaks include one announced on Jan. 10, when the Food Safety and Inspection Service reported that Tyson Foods mechanically separated chicken was the source of a seven-person Salmonella outbreak at a Tennessee correctional facility. Two of those individuals were hospitalized. About 42,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States each year, according to the CDC. About 400 people die from severe cases.\n\nBut when dealing with raw food products, such as raw poultry, a certain level of Salmonella is inevitably expected, said Dan Engeljohn, assistant administrator for the Food Safety and Inspection Service Office of Field Operations.\n\n“Salmonella is not an adulterant,” said Engeljohn. “It is expected to be there, although we’re taking steps to force there to be a reduction in the frequency of its presence.”\n\nTo minimize the risk of Salmonella, inspectors test one sample of food product for 51 consecutive days.\n\nFor broiler carcasses, or whole chickens processed for meat, the performance standard on Salmonella is 7.9 percent, meaning no more than 7.9 percent of the sampled chicken can test positive for Salmonella. To keep up with increased demand in food safety, the accepted rate has been on its way down in the last few decades.\n\nIn 1996, the performance standard was more than 20 percent.\n\nBut, as cited in the Pew report, there currently is no performance standard for chicken parts.\n\nHowever, Engeljohn said that the Food Safety and Inspection Service had been discussing implementing a new standard to include chicken parts even before the Pew report came out, and that the new standard could possibly be enacted sometime within the fiscal year.\n\n“We don’t yet have a performance standard for chicken parts,” said Engeljohn. “But we believe it’s essential to move forward with the chicken-parts pathogen-reduction performance standard, where we would identify what is the industry norm and then what is the level of reduction and contamination we believe will have a significant impact on reducing illnesses.”\n\nEngeljohn said the performance standard for chicken parts would be somewhere around 25 percent, meaning 25 percent of raw chicken parts would be expected to naturally test positive for Salmonella\n\nFSIS can only ‘pull product’ with a definite match between food and illness\n\nWhen Food Safety and Inspection Service officials determine there has been an outbreak, such as the current outbreak likely related to Foster Farms, they work with the CDC to establish a connection between the specific food product that has caused the illness and the specific establishment that made the food product.\n\nTo make that connection, officials analyze stools samples from people who have reported illness and determine what specific pathogen caused the illness. Then, they test the specific pathogen and match it up to see if its “fingerprints” are consistent with poultry products from establishments that they have tested.\n\n“Often times, when we can make a match and we can identify the particular production lot from which that product came from,” said Engeljohn. “We can and we have the authority to have that product pulled out of the market place so that there are not additional illnesses associated with it.”\n\nSteve Matzker/For Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting\n\nWith the current Foster Farms case, the agency has simply not been able to conclusively make that specific match, Engeljohn said. There have been links and there has been evidence associating the Salmonella outbreak with Foster Farms, but Engeljohn said officials have not been able to form a direct and definite connection to pull product.\n\n“We don’t have a specific establishment that produced that product on a specific day,” said Engeljohn.\n\nOfficials from the agency need to find such a strong connection before pulling product because, if they do not, they become vulnerable to lawsuits, such as the infamous Supreme Beef Lawsuit from the 1990s.\n\nAfter three failed Salmonella tests in eight months, the agency attempted to permanently remove its inspectors from a Supreme Beef Processors facility in Texas, an action equal to shutting the plant down entirely. In one test, inspectors found that almost half of the tested meat showed positive signs of Salmonella.\n\nSupreme Beef took the USDA to court, claiming that the department did not have the authority to set limits on allowable levels of Salmonella in meat.\n\nOn the same day that the company filed the law suit, the court issued a temporary restraining order that prevented the government from removing inspectors. Eventually, courts ruled that USDA actions were not within the scope of their authority.\n\n“We have to be sure that when we take an action, we can be defensible in the sense that we can have a positive outcome in that court action,” said Engeljohn.\n\nEven though the Food Safety and Inspection Service did not pull Foster Farms product from grocery store shelves, it still forced the company to make changes by issuing a 72-hour notice of intended enforcement threatening that the agency would pull its inspectors from the company.\n\nAs a result of the notice, Engeljohn said Foster Farms has been installing new antimicrobial treatments to reduce the level of contamination on chicken parts.\n\n“It’s a fairly significant outcome with what we were able to force upon them in the absence of doing a recall, which would have pulled product out of the market place even though we didn’t have the kind of evidence we needed to do that,” said Engeljohn. “We took what we believed to be the next substantive action, which was to force them to make a major investment in producing products with a significantly lower level of contamination.”",
  "latent_24836": "Women around the world put on their pussy hats and marched around this weekend to tell Donald Trump to keep his tiny hands away from their genitalia.\n\nThe non-violent Women’s March drew in hundreds of thousands of participants in America alone and hyped as a major world-historical event by the press, in spite of its lack of a coherent message excpet for “we hate Trump.” Many saw it as a sign of the coming age of progressive activism that will ultimately bring down Trump.\n\nHowever, other left-wing demonstrations may prove to be better indicators of what’s to come in Trump’s America than the pink hat ladies walking around with ridiculous signs. That’s the prospect of left-wing political violence becoming both common and morally justified in the United States.\n\nDuring Trump’s inauguration Friday, anarchists ran wild in downtown D.C., smashing store front windows and setting trashcans and a limo on fire. These actions were roundly condemned by several liberals and most of the Left was in agreement that the destruction was not to be tolerated. But there was one violent act of the black bloc anarchists liberals were ecstatic over\n\nWhite nationalist and alt-right coiner Richard Spencer was giving a TV interview right near the chaos unfolding in D.C. on Friday. Right in the middle of it, an anarchist punched him in the face, and the the video of it became a viral sensation.\n\nThe respectable Left couldn’t get enough of it.\n\nI don’t care how many different songs you set Richard Spencer being punched to, I’ll laugh at every one. — Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) January 21, 2017\n\nI have typed and deleted at least 5000 responses https://t.co/sD4veFc4aW — Vann R. Newkirk II (@fivefifths) January 20, 2017\n\nwaaaa i got punched and the cops didnt bring me cocoa and my teddy waaaaa pic.twitter.com/NKnjZdtMWg — bitch it's saturday (@libbycwatson) January 21, 2017\n\nIf we make Nazi punching a social media challenge for white teens on FB, we might just speed this whole thing up. — Morgen (@MorgenBromell) January 21, 2017\n\nThe euphoria over Spencer’s punch prompted The New York Times to publish an article entitled, “Attack on Alt-Right Leader Has Internet Asking: Is It O.K. to Punch a Nazi?” The piece admitted “[t]here was little substantive debate online about the ethics of punching Mr. Spencer,” because it all occurred on Twitter. People, of course, answered in the affirmative on Twitter that it is perfectly right to punch a Nazi in response to the article.\n\nI believe in non-violence.\n\nBut in a just war, we have a different obligation.\n\nWe are now in a just war.https://t.co/twMPMtfsUR — Victoria Brownworth (@VABVOX) January 22, 2017\n\nA more in-depth argument for why it’s okay to punch fascists came from British comic book writer Warren Ellis. Ellis believes it is always correct to punch Nazis — and you shouldn’t just stop there.\n\n“[Nazis] lost the right to not be punched in the face when they started spouting genocidal ideologies that in living memory killed millions upon millions of people. And anyone who stands up and respectfully applauds their perfect right to say these things should probably also be punched, because they are clearly surplus to human requirements,” Ellis wrote in his newsletter.\n\nThat argument was widely praised on social media, even though it expanded who you should punch to basically anyone who stands up for free speech. Not surprising for a comic book guy to have such a childish view, but it is for respectable liberals who tweeted out their support of it.\n\nThe Nation, a prominent left-wing outlet, published a breathless paean to the anarchists who caused havoc downtown and assaulted Spencer. The article offered another defense of political violence against right-wing political opponents because it can amount to a glorious act of “resistance.”\n\nThe problem with all this cheering of violence towards a political opponent is that gives encouragement to any individual who wants to attack anyone they see as a “Nazi” to do so. There’s already an example of this mentality going very wrong.\n\nBreitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos spoke at the University of Washington last weekend amid tumultuous protests at his presence. Yiannopoulos is frequently called an alt-right nationalist by mainstream publications and liberals, even though he is certainly not one. (RELATED: The Media Keeps Getting The Alt-Right Wrong)\n\nOutside of his event, a man was shot in the middle of the raucous anti-Milo demonstration. But no Milo supporters were involved in the altercation.\n\nThe person shot was actually an anti-fascist protester, and the non-white shooter attacked him because he thought his victim was a Nazi. The man who suffered a life-threatening gunshot wound voted for Bernie Sanders, has an anti-Nazi tattoo and was at the event to express his disgust for Yiannopoulos. (RELATED: Milo Protester Shoots Suspected Conservative, No Charges After He Points To ‘Racism’)\n\nHowever, that evidence appears to have been discarded by police who decided to not press charges against the shooter because he claimed the man he shot was a “white supremacist.”\n\nThis shows the dangerous slippery slope you embark upon when you say it’s morally justifiable to attack Nazis. Considering the pervasive arguments that Trump, his advisers and even all of his supporters are fascists, this opens up the possibility that it’s perfectly fine to assault anyone on the political Right.\n\nAnti-Trump violence was justified on similar grounds when the future president held rallies that were disrupted by riots and attacks on his supporters.\n\nSince calling anyone you disagree a Nazi is very common in our political discourse, who would be subject to attack could be endless. Hell, if you really agree Jonah Goldberg’s famous book “Liberal Fascism,” conservatives could justify their attacks on liberals because they’re the “real Nazis.”\n\nBut, of course, very few people would defend a conservative doing such a thing because the institutions that increasingly determine what’s morally good — the media, entertainment, academia, even several churches — in our society are dominated by the Left. Everyone would condemn the Trump supporter who would punch a liberal in the face because he thought he was a Nazi.\n\nNot so much if it was the other way around, as we’ve seen with last weekend’s events.\n\nWhen the Trump administration starts to implement its most controversial policies — such as increasing the number of deportations of illegal immigrants — it’s likely that the demonstrations against such actions will resemble the violence of the anarchists rather than that of the pussy hat brigades.\n\nAnd instead of smashing the windows of progressive-friendly businesses like Starbucks, the leftists could direct their energy towards hunting down anyone they deem a “Nazi.”\n\nThat’s a great way of turning America into the Weimarian nightmare the Left dreads to see again.\n\nFollow Scott on Twitter and pre-order his upcoming book, “No Campus for White Men” on Amazon",

Without further ado, I present the antlion. Antlions are a family of insects (Myrmeleontidae) which comprise over two-thousand species. Neither ants, nor lions, they are named because they mainly prey on ants.\n\nWhile antlions live their adult stage as a large flying insect, superficially resembling something akin to a dragonfly or damselfly (though they are of no relation and are in a different taxonomic order), they spend their larval stage mainly underground. Here they dig pits in the sand and lie at the bottom, motionless. When, say, an ant wanders over the lip of the pit, they are immediately assaulted with thrown sand from the antlion causing them to slip on the loose substrate and fall to the bottom of the pit, where the jaws of the antlion await.\n\nThe prey is then dragged under the sand where they are consumed by the larval antlion. Using straw-like jaw projections, the antlions suck the prey dry and then flick their prey’s desiccated corpses out of the pit.

These include asking if they candidates would institute a personhood law in the state, a ban on sex selection abortion, spousal consent laws, opting out of the Affordable Care Act provision for abortion insurance coverage and a U.S. constitutional amendment banning abortion.\n\nSeveral of the questions ask if candidates support instituting abortion policies already in place in the Sunflower State, including a parental consent law, a ban on spending taxpayer funds on abortion, and a partial birth abortion ban.\n\nThe questionnaire, which can be viewed here, also asks about possibility of a ban on what is described as \"home abortion kits\" and the abortion-inducing drug, RU-486. The questionnaire does not differentiate between external ultrasounds or transvaginal ultrasounds in asking whether candidates favor mandatory ultrasounds prior to abortions.\n\nThe questionnaire comes months after the Kansas legislature rejected a sweeping 76-page anti-abortion bill, which would have established that life begins at conception and allowed doctors to withhold information from women that could cause them to seek an abortion. This would include preventing women from filing a lawsuit in the event the withheld information caused medical harm. The bill also would have placed a sales tax on abortion and potentially jeopardized the state's medical education program. The legislation also would have outlawed all state employees -- ranging from doctors to motor vehicle workers -- from performing abortions during the workday.\n\nThe anti-abortion bill passed the conservative Republican-controlled state House of Representatives, but stalled in the more moderate Republican-controlled state Senate. Gov. Sam Brownback (R) told The Huffington Post in February that he would sign the bill even though he had not read it. During the 2010 campaign, Brownback pledged to sign all anti-abortion legislation.\n\nWith conservative Republicans poised to control the state Senate next year after defeating moderates in the August primary, abortion legislation is expected to dominate the 2013 state legislative session.\n\nThe questionnaire hit candidate mailboxes days after Republican Jack Wu, a Westboro Baptist Church member running for the Kansas Board of Education, accused Brownback of not being anti-abortion enough.

  "latent_24911": "Canada’s nuclear watchdog has approved part of a quarter-billion-dollar plan to clean up an abandoned uranium mine in northern Saskatchewan.\n\nIn a written decision issued Friday, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) gave the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) the go-ahead to begin “remediating” 4.4 million tonnes of radioactive tailings at the derelict Gunnar uranium mine site.\n\n“(T) he Commission is satisfied that SRC … will continue to make adequate provision for the protection of the environment, the health and safety of persons and the maintenance of national security and measures required to implement international obligations to which Canada has agreed,” the CNSC stated in its decision.\n\nThe SRC, which is contracted by the provincial government to clean up the site, began work on the Gunnar mine in 2010 by demolishing asbestos-contaminated buildings. Now, it will begin looking for a contractor to cover the tailings deposits with a 0.6-metre-thick earthen cover, according to SRC vice president of environment Joe Muldoon.\n\n“It’s a competitive process,” Muldoon said. “Whoever comes up with the best quality work that’s going to maximize local involvement and economic benefits while still delivering an efficient and effective cover over those tailings, that’s the contractor that we will (select).”\n\nA contractor will be chosen in late winter or early spring, and work on the tailings deposits will begin once the weather permits access to the site. It will continue for “up to four field seasons,” Muldoon said. The exact cost and timing of the tailings remediation will depend on the procurement process and factors such as the weather, he added.\n\nLocated near Uranium City, about 800 kilometres north of Saskatoon, the Gunnar uranium mine began production in 1955 and was shuttered in 1964. Virtually no cleanup work was done before the site was abandoned.\n\nIn 2006, the provincial and federal governments agreed to clean up the deserted mine. The project was originally expected to cost $24.6 million, to be split evenly, and take 17 years. Costs have ballooned significantly since the project was announced.\n\nCleaning up the Gunnar site is expected to cost $268 million, according to the provincial government.\n\nWhat isn’t clear is who will foot the bill.\n\n“(T) here has been no resolution on cost sharing. We continue to believe that the federal government has a responsibility to contribute to the cost of the cleanup and look forward to continued discussions with them,” Laurie Pushor, deputy minister Saskatchewan’s Ministry of the Economy, said in an emailed statement.\n\n“The Government of Canada has agreed to provide up to $12.3 million of funding for the project,” Natural Resources Canada spokeswoman Danica Vaillancourt said, also in an emailed statement.\n\n“$1.13 million in funding for Phase 1 of the project was provided in 2007. Funding of up to $11.17 million will be made available after approvals from the (CNSC) and the Saskatchewan Ministry of the Environment are provided, allowing the project to move into the implementation phase of the remediation,” the statement said.\n\namacpherson@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/macphersona",

When the campaign season started over a year ago, many candidates were vying for the White House — in fact, at one time early in the race, more than 90 people said they were running.\n\nWhat happened to all of these candidates? For the most part, they were shunned by the corporate media and the political establishment, except for the privileged few who were well-connected. Those few would be Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This is American politics today, where privilege overrides democracy.\n\nOur choices for president were quickly boiled down for us by the corporate media and the political establishment to one Democrat and one Republican. The wealthy 1 percent and corporate America continue to be their partners in this crime.\n\nI no longer see a difference between the Democratic and Republican parties. Many of the Democrats and Republicans in national politics have large corporate sponsors who have bought and paid for their candidacies. They own these candidates. They have no real interest in helping the average working American who lives on Main Street America.\n\nClinton and Trump are the political aristocracy of America today. They represent Wall Street and the wealthy 1 percent. They are not going to represent those of us that occupy the 99 percent category. If you believe these two candidates are going to do something good for America, you are sadly mistaken.\n\nClinton and Trump will say anything to get elected.

These debates mean nothing. Don't get sucked into believing that they matter. Fact-checkers for these debates are overwhelmed by the lies and half-truths. These debates should be disqualified as having any kind of legitimacy. They are not sanctioned by the American people.\n\nClinton apologized at the first debate for her email scandal, claiming that she made a mistake. She thinks that the American people are that naive. FBI Director James Comey performed a major political favor by not indicting her. How many political favors has Clinton received from the Obama administration to cover her lawbreaking? Add the DNC/Clinton rigged primary elections to that list.\n\nJill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate, is the only answer to America's political conundrum. Here is a quote from Stein's website: \"My Power to the People Plan creates deep system change, moving from the greed and exploitation of corporate capitalism to a human-centered economy that puts people, planet, and peace over profit.\n\n\"It offers direct answers to the economic, social and ecological crises brought on by both corporate political parties.

The power to create this new world is not in our hope, it's not in our dreams — it's in our hands.\"\n\nYou have to admire Stein for fighting through so many tough roadblocks put in her way by the Democrats and Republicans to gain national recognition. Stein is a fighter on behalf of America's poor, the hungry and the racially abused. Stein has shown her strength of character and worthiness by working side-by-side with the flood victims in Louisiana and protesting with the Native Americans against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

  "latent_25244": "Part 1\n\nIntroduction Canadians should not be surprised by the fact that our Liberal Foreign Minister, Chrystia Freeland, has been hiding a big Nazi skeleton in her family closet. Like so many other ultranationalists in the Ukrainian émigré community whose forbears came to Canada soon after WWII, Freeland has covered up the truth about a close and revered family member who collaborated with the Nazi regime. In that way, Freeland's case is not terribly unusual. What is truly impressive about this whole story is how the ultranationalist Ukrainian diaspora, the Liberal government and the mainstream corporate media have managed to keep a lid on broader issues surrounding Ukrainian collaboration with the Nazis in executing mass murder and genocide, including the Holocaust. Even now, after the story has been \"covered\" by the mainstream mass media, precious few details have actually been allowed to creep out about Freeland's grandfather (her dido in Ukrainian). This \"coverage\" amounts to more \"cover up\" because, while it exposes some information, it falls far short of revealing far more damaging truths. It is what the \"intelligence\" community calls a \"limited hangout.\" [i] Michael Chomiak (1905-1984) held the influential position of editor in chief for the Nazi's leading Ukrainian-language newspaper, Krakivs'ki visti (Krakow News). As the flagship Nazi propaganda mouthpiece for Ukrainians all across Greater Germany and occupied Europe, this daily newspaper played a key role in riling up widespread support within Ukrainian community for the military efforts of Canada's wartime enemies. Under Chomiak's guidance and oversight, this Nazi-empowered newspaper spouted vile antiSemitic fake news which helped Ukrainians to justify and rationalise the liquidation of some seven million Jews. The newspaper also actively promoted vile hatred towards the most powerful enemy of Nazism, namely, the Soviet Union. In case anyone has forgotten, that country lost 25 to 30 million citizens as a result of the Nazi onslaught against their homeland. This incredible death toll included about 8.7 million members of the Red Army who died fighting the Nazis. The Soviets eventually repelled the Nazi military and chased them back to Germany. It is no wonder that the Soviet people called WWII, \"The Great Patriotic War.\" Chomiak was officially responsible for at least one other newspaper, a weekly called Kholmska zemlia (Cholmer Land). It, like Krakivs'ki visti, contained many edited speeches by Nazi leaders including Adolph Hitler, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Governors Hans Frank and Otto Wächter, and many others. Baron von Wächter was a lawyer, Nazi politician and the SS-Gruppenführer (Major General) who oversaw the creation of the 14th Waffen SS Galician division in 1943. This Ukrainian military formation was funded, armed, controlled and led by the Nazi regime. Its members were volunteers who swore a religious oath to fight to the death for their supreme leader, Adolph Hitler. Recruitment for the Waffen SS Galicia was done by the Nazis, Ukrainian church leaders and Ukrainian newspapers, including that leading propaganda organ, with Chomiak at its helm, Krakivs'ki visti. The many Nazi leaders whose words and deeds were so favourably promoted in the pages of Krakivs'ki visti and Kholmska zemlia, represented the master race of fake news in their day. For his part, Michael Chomiak was their faithful servant, turning out a daily whirlwind of Nazi news, and spinning war stories to suit their propaganda needs. As chief editor and office manager for these newspapers of the officially-sanctioned Ukrainian Publishing House, Michael Chomiak facilitated the largest mass media outlet by which the Nazi's psychopathic political phobias against Judaism and communism were spread to the Ukrainian diaspora across Europe.\n\nAs we'll see, Michael Chomiak's direct boss was Volodomyr Kubijovych, the chief shareholder and Chair of the Board of Directors of the Ukrainian Publishing House, which oversaw the production, printing and distribution of newspapers, magazines, books and other propaganda materials under the Nazi regime. More importantly, Kubijovych was the president of the Ukrainian Central Committee, the main political body of Ukrainians that was coordinating their national collaboration with the Nazi's Government which controlled German-occupied Poland. This collaborationist committee had a close relationship with the Nazi's Abwehr (\"Defence\"), the German military intelligence organisation. Pawel Markiewicz, a Polish doctoral candidate now writing his PhD thesis on Kubijovych and the Ukrainian Central Committee, explains that: \"The Central Committee building at Grunestrasse ... was in fact a shared building. The Ukrainians were headquartered there as well as the German military intelligence or Abwehr.\"[ii] When a German Colonel, Alfred Bisanz, was arrested near the war's end, he gave insights into the relationship between Kubijovych's Ukrainian Central Committee and the Nazi authorities which created, funded and controlled it. Bisantz testified that: \"Kubiyovych's Ukrainian Central Committee [UCC] was created by the Abwehr in Krakow in 1940. From the first day of its existence, it was directly supervised by the intelligence body of Abwehrstelle-Krakow. Actually, this function was discharged by the Second Department of the Abwehrstelle-Krakow, headed by Major von Deml. As an assistant to the head of the Department, I was charged with directing UCC activity. Without the Abwehrstelle's permission and my personal clearance, Kubiyovych had no right to include any person in the Committee or take any action.... Likewise, financing the UCC was also carried out through me. Each month throughout 1940, I personally handed Kubiyovych and UCC Secretary-General Hlibovitsky a sum of 50-60 thousand zlotys.\"[iii] This means Nazi payments to the UCC in Krakow were between 600,000 and 720,000 zlotys in 1940. (This is calculated to be the equivalent of between $2.8 and $3.36 million today.) One of the Committee's expenses was Michael Chomiak's salary. In an official 1946 \"Military Questionnaire\" (which Chomiak completed in German), he reported that his annual salary as chief editor for 1940 was 5,000 zlotys. This starting salary is calculated to be worth the equivalent $23,300 in 2017 Canadian dollars. It was increased to $35,000 the following year and by 1944, his annual salary was the equivalent of about $44,500.[iv] Meanwhile, elsewhere, another UCC was being formed by another antiSemitic, anticommunist government. Yes, the Canadian government, like the Nazi government in Germany, formed a Ukrainian organisation with the same acronym, UCC. The UCC that the Liberal government formed in Canada was the Ukrainian Canadian Committee. It's name was changed in the 1980s to the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. (Click here to learn more about the Canadian UCC, its fascist roots, and its links to both Michael Chomiak and Chrystia Freeland.) The Liberal government of Canada facilitated the creation of their UCC for two basic reasons: (1) to consolidate the right-wing Ukrainian diaspora community in Canada, and (2) to provide a bulwark to oppose the left-leaning Ukrainian Canadians whose organisations then dominated the Ukrainian political landscape in this country. After the war, Canada's UCC surged with power as it benefited from the massive influx of tens of thousands of ultranationalist Ukrainians who the Liberal government brought here. This migration included thousands of Waffen SS Galician division veterans and other military formations of Ukrainians that fought against Canada's Soviet allies during WWII. While Canadians certainly deserve to learn the truth about their foreign minister's maternal grandfather, they should also be exposed to information about some broader, and much more important secrets that have been hidden from them for far too long. Let's not settle for just pulling Michael Chomiak out of Minister Freeland's family closet and into the light of public awareness. We have an opportunity now to throw light on many other Nazi skeletons that have for far too long been lurking in the shadows of large Canadian wardrobes. In particular, let's look at the Freeland family secret in the context of the three large social institutions with which she is most closely associated: (1) the ultranationalist Ukrainian Canadian diaspora, represented by the Ukrainian Canadian Congress,\n\n(2) the Liberal Party of Canada, and\n\n(3) the mainstream corporate media.\n\nIn this much-needed process of \"Truth and Reconciliation\" our blessed \"Canadian values\" will be put to the test. Are we up for the challenge of trying to understand why prominent Canadian citizens and huge social institutions have been covering up certain deeply unpleasant historical truths like genocide, at home and abroad? Let's see...\n\n(Continue reading this article)",

  "latent_25938": "Classification Edit\n\nThis species was previously placed in the family Peramelidae, along with the bilbies, as the subfamily Chaeropodinae by McKenna and Bell (1997). However, its form is quite distinct from the Peramelidae and bilbies, and recent molecular evidence supports this distinction. It is believed to be the sister group of the rest of the Peramelmorphia and has been assigned to its own family Chaeropodidae.[1]\n\nDescription Edit\n\nTaxidermied specimen at Melbourne Museum The pig-footed bandicoot had a body size of 23–26 cm and a 10–15 cm long tail.[3] In form, it was almost bilby-like on first sight, having long, slender limbs, large, pointed ears, and a long tail. On closer examination, however, it became apparent that the pig-footed bandicoot was very unusual for a marsupial. The forefeet had two functional toes with hooves, rather similar to a pig or deer;[4] this is possibly due to juveniles being deposited in the pouch through external stalks, thus relieving them of using the forelimbs while as joeys.[5] The hind feet had an enlarged fourth toe with a heavy claw shaped like a tiny horse's hoof, with the other toes being vestigial:only the fused second and third toes being useful, and that not for locomotion but for grooming. It had a broad head, and a long yet slender snout. Its fur was coarse and straight, but not spiny. In color it varied from grizzled grey through fawn to orange-brown, the belly and underparts were white with the fur on the ears being of chestnut color. This species had five pairs of upper and three pairs of lower incisor teeth. The females of the species had eight nipples and the opening of the pouch was faced backwards, not forwards as is the case with kangaroos.[6][7] According to Indigenous Australian trackers, the species was known as \"Landwang\" and \"Tubaija\" .[8][9]\n\nDistribution and habitat Edit\n\nThe pig-footed bandicoot was native to western New South Wales and Victoria, the southern part of the Northern Territory as well as South Australia and Western Australia.[6] It inhabited a wide range of habitat types: from grassy woodland and grassland plains to the spinifex country and arid flats of central Australia. Despite its wide range, the species had a sparse distribution and was never abundant.[10]\n\nBehaviour and ecology Edit\n\nIllustration by John Gould Few scientists had the opportunity to observe a live pig-footed bandicoot, with the only existing account of its behaviour suggesting that it moved \"like a broken-down hack in a canter, apparently dragging the hind quarters after it\".[11] This is contradicted by the Aboriginal people of central Australia, who knew it well and reported that if disturbed, it was capable of running with considerable speed by breaking into a smooth, galloping sprint. It was a solitary, nocturnal animal that would sleep in its shelter during the day and emerge in the evening to feed, using its keen sense of smell to find food.[3] Depending on the habitat, pig-footed bandicoots used a variety of shelters to hide from predators and for sleeping. In wooded areas and grasslands these ranged from hollow logs and nests made out of grass, while in arid treeless country this animal used to dig short, straight burrows with a nest at the end. From surviving eyewitness reports and analyses of gut contents, dentition, and gut structure of museum specimens, it appears that the pig-footed bandicoot was the most herbivorous of bandicoots; although captive specimens were fond of meat and Aborigines reported that it ate grasshoppers, ants and termites, the bulk of its diet was almost certainly leaves, roots and grasses. In captivity it was observed that they drank \"a good deal of water\".[10] Tim Flannery suggests that breeding occurred between May and June and that twins may have been the norm for this species. From the size of its pouch and comparison with other marsupials of this size, it can be inferred that pig-footed bandicoots did not carry more than four young per litter.[3]\n\nExtinction Edit\n\n1902 illustration According to Indigenous Australian oral tradition this species was rare even before the arrival of Europeans on the continent[7] and was in a serious decline even as it first came to scientific notice in the middle years of the 19th century. Two specimens of pig-footed bandicoot were obtained by local people in 1857 for Gerard Krefft, who accompanied the Blandowski Expedition. Despite the trouble taken in gaining living specimens, Krefft recorded his observations with an apology for eating one of them.[12][13] Only a handful of specimens were collected through the second part of the 19th century, mostly from northwestern Victoria, but also from arid country in South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. By the start of the 20th century, it had become extinct in Victoria and the south-west of Western Australia. The last certain specimen was collected in 1901. By 1945 the species vanished from South Australia and was reported to be limited to \"a slight foothold in central Australia\".[7] Nevertheless, Aboriginal people report that it survived as late as the 1950s in the Gibson Desert and the Great Sandy Desert of Western Australia.[14] The cause of the extinction remains uncertain: neither of the two most destructive introduced exterminator species, the fox and the rabbit, had yet arrived in south-west Western Australia when the pig-footed bandicoot disappeared from that area. Feral cats were already common, which may offer an explanation; it is perhaps more likely that the decline was caused by a double habitat change. Firstly, the end of many thousands of years of Aboriginal burning which, being confined to a patchwork of small areas at any one time, had ensured both fresh new growth in the recently burnt areas and adjacent older growth for shelter and as a base for recolonisation. However, Australia's Aboriginal population had declined by around 90% during the 19th century, largely because of the introduction of European diseases, and the remaining Aborigines were often no longer permitted to carry on their traditional land-management and hunting practices. Secondly, following on the heels of the near-extermination of the Aborigines, came the introduction of vast numbers of sheep and cattle, leading to significant changes in soil structure, plant growth, and food availability.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nAug. 15, 2016, 10:55 PM GMT / Updated Aug. 15, 2016, 11:16 PM GMT By Maggie Fox\n\nEvidence is building that sitting for too long can cause heart disease and diabetes — even in people who exercise, the American Heart Association said Monday.\n\nThe trouble is, it’s hard to measure just how inactive people are and there’s not enough evidence yet to show just how much, or how often, you have to exercise to counteract the effects of sitting, the group said in a scientific update.\n\nIn the meantime, then, people should try to sit less and move more, the heart association’s team of experts advised.\n\n“The evidence to date is suggestive, but not conclusive, that sedentary behavior contributes to cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk,” a team led by Deborah Rohm Young, of Kaiser Permanente, Southern California wrote.\n\nRelated: Here's Just How Bad Sitting Around Is\n\n“Given the current state of the science on sedentary behavior and in the absence of sufficient data to recommend quantitative guidelines, it is appropriate to promote the advisory, ‘Sit less, move more’.”\n\nAt least 30 minutes a day of moderate exercise — walking briskly rather than strolling around the house – should be the minimum goal, they advise.\n\n\"It is appropriate to promote the advisory, ‘Sit less, move more’.”\n\nAnd it may be worthwhile to encourage desk-bound workers to get up and move a bit every hour or so.\n\nYet even this may not outweigh the effects of sitting at a computer all day, driving home in a car, and then relaxing in front of the TV or with a tablet computer.\n\n\"Regardless of how much physical activity someone gets, prolonged sedentary time could negatively impact the health of your heart and blood vessels,\" Young said in a statement.\n\n\"There are many important factors we don’t understand about sedentary time yet. The types of studies available identify trends but don’t prove cause and effects,\" she added.\n\nThey did define sedentary behaviors: They include sitting, reclining, or lying down while awake as well as reading, watching television or working on the computer. Light housework or slow, leisurely walking doesn’t rise to the level of moderate to vigorous physical activity.\n\nRelated: You Sitting Down? That Can Kill You\n\n“Based on existing evidence, we found that U.S. adults are sedentary for about six to eight hours a day,” Young said. “Adults 60 years and older spend between 8.5 — 9.6 hours a day in sedentary time.”\n\n“Regardless of how much physical activity someone gets, prolonged sedentary time could negatively impact the health of your heart and blood vessels.\"\n\nThe researchers cited a study that showed half of all jobs required some sort of activity in the 1960s, but now fewer than 20 percent do.\n\n\"There are clearly physiological changes that occur when physically active individuals become inactive,\" Young's team wrote in the journal Circulation. This includes changes in the way the body uses insulin to convert food efficiently to glucose that the body can use.\n\n\"Despite these potentially relevant findings on how physical inactivity can be associated with biological dysregulation, we do not have direct evidence that this leads to cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nThe American Heart Association has tips on how to get active here.",

Eight sports stars compete against one another, taking on tough physical and mental challenges in a bid to prove which sport and which athlete is the ultimate champion.\n\nRower James Cracknell, footballer Matt Le Tissier, javelin thrower Fatima Whitbread, long jumper Jade Johnson, middle distance runner Liz McColgan, rugby player Shane Williams, badminton player Gail Emms and sprinter Christian Malcolm will be tested to the max as they are assessed for psychological endurance, reaction speed, agility, hand-eye coordination, strength, stamina, visualisation, strategy, adaptability, and recovery time.\n\nRichard Bacon hosts the series, and world renowned sports scientist and two time Olympian Professor Greg Whyte OBE, who has trained, motivated and successfully coached celebrities including David Walliams who swam across the English Channel and Davina McCall who completed her ‘Beyond Breaking Point’ 506-mile ultra-triathlon, will be providing an insight into the sports science behind each challenge.\n\nThe series has been filmed in the beautiful setting of Croatia and the competitors will be seen living together as well as taking on challenges in various locations in the Eastern European country. They’ll be hanging over the open waters of the Adriatic and searching for objects submerged in the deep sea. At other times their feet will be firmly on the ground and they’ll be tested for hand-eye co-ordination, reaction and strategy.\n\nEternal Glory follows the eight stars, all prize-winners in their own sport, but how will they fare when pushed beyond their area of expertise? Each episode comprises of four tough physical or mental challenges. One athlete goes home in each episode, determined by the ‘night duel’ where the two sports stars with the lowest scores will go head-to-head in a battle of focus and reactions. Finally only one will emerge triumphant and achieve Eternal Glory.\n\nThe competition is fierce as all of the sporting heroes are determined to win. Professor Greg Whyte (OBE) said: “Even on early tests, they (the sports stars) were absolutely going for it.” He continued, “It’s one of those age old pub debates – who is the best athlete? This show can prove scientifically, with evidence, who is the best all rounder of them all.”\n\nAhead of the competition, the sports stars said…\n\nMatt Le Tissier: “It’s been 13 years since I retired and I’ve realised that I’ve been very comfortable and not done anything I don’t want to do, so I thought it was about time I put myself outside my comfort zone for a change and give myself a bit of a challenge.”\n\nFatima Whitbread: “This show is probably more up my street than most things and I like to think I’m crazy enough to want to do it. It’s a challenge, it’s different and it’s like-minded sportsmen and women so you know it’s going to be competitive. I love being competitive – to me it’s something that made me the champion I was.”\n\nJames Cracknell: “I knew what we were doing every day for four year cycles in my career, and I’d embraced that, so there’s an appeal to doing something where you don’t know what you’re going to be doing. It’s a real mix of challenges in terms of what we’re going to do, but also the different people.”\n\nChristian Malcolm: “The opportunity to do this came up and it seemed different and fun. At the same time, I don’t know what I’m getting myself into because I have a fear of deep water!”\n\nLiz McColgan: “I wanted to do this show to challenge myself again, to see if I can get back into that competitive mind-set. When I go into a competition I’m in it to win it. I hope that kicks in when this competition starts.”\n\nGail Emms: “As an ex-athlete these kind of things still appeal to you. Straightway something goes off in your brain, competition, yippee!”\n\nShane Williams: “Since I finished playing rugby I do miss the competitiveness, competing against people and going one on one against people. I do miss that, so when this opportunity came up it was an easy decision.”\n\nJade Johnson: “This show appealed to me because I love the fact that it’s got a sports element with Greg, and also a bit of wanting to understand what athletes are really like.”\n\nEternal Glory has already achieved strong success throughout Europe. It recently completed its sixth season for NRK Norway, where it regularly attracted a 65% share, and Sweden’s series 7 concluded on 31st May 2015 with a 61% share and 2.58 million viewers. Other European versions include three series in Belgium, as well as series for Denmark, Finland and Holland.",
  "latent_26193": "By Lola at Friday, March 01, 2013 10:52:00 AM\n\nI had the tremendous honour to interview Ocean Quigley, the Creative Director for SimCity. Quigley is a veteran in the video game industry; his knowledge, passion and experience is invaluable and demands respect from developers and gamers alike. Even if you are not a fan of the genre he specialises in, Life Simulation, you cannot help but be impressed with the creative processes and genius of his work.Join me for a walk through the mind of the creator of exceptional worlds.\n\nYou have been involved in the Sims universe for more than a decade. What is it about the franchise that keeps you pouring your life into it?\n\nThese sorts of games, games where you create a little world and see them come to life, and you control them, games that have this kind of aspect of creativity around them are the sorts of games that interest me the most. And, really Maxxis is the only company making games of this depth and sophistication.\n\nCurrent technology enabled you to incorporate features into SimCity that you must’ve dreamed about for years. Can you tell us about some of those features?\n\nYes, certainly. Most prominent is the fact that it’s fully 3D. The previous SimCity’s were basically like paintings of cities, or maybe like maps of cities that you could sort of look at from a distance and you could zoom into like you were looking at a map, but you never had the chance of entering the city. You never had the sense of being in a place. So it is that transition from a map to a place where you could go to that I’ve been dreaming of for years.\n\nThe other major thing is that in previous Sim City’s, like Sim City 4 was the last one where I was the Art & Creative Director on. We were so limited in the computation we could do because computers were a lot less powerful and so we couldn’t do things like make every person a real person in the simulation, for example that they would have a name and an agenda and a place where they came from and something they are trying to get to. But now computers are so much more powerful that we can populate the city with the people that live in and we can have all the behaviour of the city emerge out of their reaction, instead of it being an extract, a statistical file simulation.\n\nEnabling players to connect to games emotionally has been a strong theme in the industry, especially since last year. Was this an even stronger focus in SimCity than before, and if so, how did you strengthen that connection in the game?\n\nYou see that it hasn’t been, exactly it’s a game that’s mostly about buildings and around some infrastructure and the people were attractive enough that you didn’t feel that in previous Sim games. With the new SimCity I wanted to make the people in the city part of the focus of the game.\n\nYou know I mean the real city is not just the buildings and physical infrastructure it is also the people that live there. I wanted to make you feel responsible for those people. So in order for that to be do-able we had to make the people fragile. So you have a population that is vulnerable and you can be a good mayor and help them live education, wealthy & happy lives fulfilled in their needs or you can be a bad or mean mayor and let their houses burn down, or let them get killed by criminals and have them breathe polluted air and drink contaminated water and so forth.\n\nAnd if you do those terrible things to them they suffer and so I wanted to make one of the emotions you feel from the game be the guilt and responsibility for the people who live there. So they tell you how they are doing, you click on somebody and that little person walking down the street will tell you that they are completely impoverished and that they are looking for a job and they need to find a job real soon, or they are going to be homeless. So it is in part up to you to build an environment where they can succeed, or if you are sadistic build an environment where you can see them fail.\n\nWho is the gamer customer that you have targeted with SimCity? Who is your focus group?\n\nThere is really two the way I think of it, and this is true for other Maxxis games as well. There are two categories of players: There are people who are pretty serious gamers and they are playing it as a game challenge, they are trying to do things like having a high population or making a lot of money, or they are trying to accomplish some of the difficult and significant goals in the game and they are comparing themselves to each other – so those are the types you would think of as hard-core gamers.\n\nThen there is another broader type of category who is building models for the pleasure of it. More creative people and not so much gamers. They are building a world to satisfy their emotions or their creative aesthetic edges. I am more in the latter category. I don’t play the game in order to beat it, I play it to build something beautiful and to sort of feel what it would be like to live in such a place. That comes from my original motivations for. But the other people in the team, there are a lot that are much more serious gamers.\n\nWhat are the aspects of SimCity that you personally like the most?\n\nThere’s a bunch of things that I’m very proud of and that I like a lot. One of them is the visual aesthetic style of the game and that whole part of the game is my responsibility. The thing that I like most about it is how all artwork is doing the job. When you look at the game it looks like a city, but it’s doing the job of telling you what is going on in the simulation.\n\nSo for example, when you see a puff of smoke come from a smoke stack that is not a decoration – [it is the artwork] that is telling you that stuff is polluting. When you see the lights on in a house it’s not just for decoration, the lights are on because someone is in the house right now and of course it’s got power in it. And when you see cars in front of a building that means somebody is home. The art of the game is entirely motivated by expressing to you as the player what the simulation is doing. There is nothing in there that is arbitrary, all the art is doing the job, and the job is to communicate the depth of the simulation to you.\n\nWould you say SimCity is a reasonably accurate virtual presentation of real life? If so, what are the building blocks of the game to make that presentation real to the player?\n\nI would be careful to make too many claims as to the realism of SimCity. What we attempted to do was to sortof simplified version of the different systems that make a city. A real city for example is made out of all these systems; things like the sewage, water and electrical systems and each one of those have multiple components. If you take electricity, for example, there is the consumer of the electricity, there is infrastructure taking the electricity to the consumer, there is a power plant that generates the electricity, there are workers in the plant who work there.\n\nWith fuel [it would require] a fossil power plant [and then] there is the land infrastructure if you are doing something more like solar wind. So each one of these systems are simplified and in the game. We do represent all of them, and we do represent all their interactions.\n\nSo it is more like a simplified working model of a city including even the economics of it where people have to have jobs and they have to commute to work. A factory needs workers and workers of different skill levels and the workers themselves are of different wealth classes and so forth. So it is a pretty fabulously sophisticated and complex model city, but it is an abstraction of a real city of course.\n\nOne last part I want to mention about the city is that we are doing all of the traffic in the city - the cars and busses as actual agents moving through the simulation. That stuff is actually reasonably accurate in terms of its behaviour. It is the same technique that you see used in more academic special purpose traffic modelling simulations. So we are using the same technologies and we wind up with the same type of behaviour in the traffic simulation as you would see in real life. [For example] you see spontaneous traffic jams form. All that is about as realistic as you would get for actual traffic simulations.\n\nTell us about how the Massive Multi-City scale adds another dimension to the game?\n\nMy initial motivation there was if you think about real cites, real cities are not in bubbles, they are not isolated from each other. Almost all cities are in relationship with other cities. People might live in one city, but they need to work in another city. So there are these sort of network relationships that do a bunch things, they connect cities to each other and they enable cities to specialize and differentiate as a consequence. So a city that is a big industrial centre is going to look different than a city which is a university town which in turn will be different from a casino city and so forth. One of the things I wanted to do was to enable different outcomes in your cities so that they would not all wind up being homogenous at the end of the play session, but instead they would end up spreading out into all different kinds of possibilities.\n\nThe technology I used to do that were two things: One was to take all of the functions out of the cities (the power, the water and all those systems that I mentioned earlier) and allowed them to be distributed across a region so that all the things that take place in one city could also be exploded across an entire region and different cities could interact with each other providing different components of those services.\n\nThe second part was that I wanted to enable specific design specialisation so that if you happen to be in a city which is over big oil deposits you can use those oil reserves to finance your city. You can use those oil reserves to power your power plant. So I’m attempting to model in a simplified way the economics because behaviour of the city is in large part determined by the economic underpinnings.\n\nSo we came up with this concept of the region. In previous SimCity’s, like Sim City 4, I came up with a region idea but it came up really late in the project and I didn’t really have time to fully develop it. In the new SimCity we started with the idea of a region where your cities would not ever be in a vacuum, they would always be in a context of a larger region.\n\nAt Maxxis, we were running the simulation on our servers that let the cities talk and interact with each other. With things like that, the obvious thing to do was to enable different people to take on the role of mayor in those different cities and interact with each other so that they could build things in collaboration. So you have essentially in the larger region up to 16 cities which you are welcome to play all solo by yourself, but you could also invite your friends to play and up to 16 people can be in a single region.\n\nDo you think SimCity can be used not only as entertainment, but also as a vehicle for player contemplation of subjects like morality, ethics and social responsibility?\n\nThe game itself is a sandbox; it isn’t making moral judgements. We don’t have a bias for one thing or another. You’re more than welcome to make a city where everyone is homeless and miserable, or a city where criminals go free, or a city where you are extracting wealth from your population to build an opulent mansion with it. The game takes a relatively neutral perspective on those things; it is just providing systems with which to explore the ideas.\n\nBut, since we are humans and we are humans playing the game we cannot help but read moral and ethical values into. It is just like a real city, the morals come from the people within it and their response to it. Your ethics, ideals and your morals are reflected in the sort of city that you build. The only way it can have meaning is if you are able to build a city that is hellish, or you can build a city that is utopian: if you see a response from the citizen that live in it, it reflects that. We at Maxxis have to give you a system that you can do all these things in, in order for it to mean anything.\n\nYou’ve got a heroes and villains aspect in it as well, and people can explore going to one extreme or the other.\n\nIn fact, the heroes and villains aspect is a bit more interesting and complex than you might have expected. The evil Dr Vu has got really positive benefits for your city as well. He promotes education [and as a result] you might have a booming high-tech industrial sector. The price you are paying for that booming industrial sector is that part of your city is becoming criminal cultists around Dr Vu and are going out and lobbying and giving back money to him. You as the player are making the trade-off between putting up with the negative / criminal consequences of Dr Vu’s complex rule in order to get the benefits.\n\nConversely, the Maxis man hero is a much more sort of middle ground figure when you look into him in more detail. You actually have to pay him off in order to do heroic deeds for your city. He is no altruist. He is someone if you pay him enough money he will go and put out those fires or he will go and get those criminals. He is a much more mercenary figure.\n\nI think one of the things you are always trying to do is you are trying to give a player interesting and nuanced choices to make and interesting follow-ons and consequences to those choices. So I very much did not want to just make some pure evil person that you put down and he turns your city evil or some good that you put down – it just seems idiotic.\n\nIt’s really interesting to see and I hope there are players that try out the complete evil and complete utopia to see how it plays out.\n\nI have no doubt! We are already seeing that on the Dev team as there are already people who play as true wealth maximizers for example and have no thought or care as to the effect of wealth-maximization on the populations. For example, they power their cities with coal, they extract coal from the middle of the city. They don’t care about water pollution or air pollution or the people dying in the mines. They don’t care about any of that stuff; they are just trying to make money as quickly as they can.\n\nOne of the things that are interesting is the effects of education. You can choose an educated population or not, and if you choose an educated, then they get a bunch of benefits. They start living safer, cleaner lives and have high tech jobs. They become must less likely to injure themselves or get sick and they start fire less frequently. So there are a lot of benefits in educating the population. But for you as the mayor a poorly educated population are a lot more compliant and willing to put up with a lot more.\n\nDo they revolt or protest if they are educated?\n\nYes, they will come and protest at City Hall and be much more vocal about their protests. The more educated the less they will put up with, until eventually if you have an educated population and you are a terrible mayor they will just pack up and leave. That is the ultimate and you end up with big chunks of unpopulated city which you would not necessarily have had if you had a poorly educated population. Education is a double-edge sword, you have to decide if you’d rather have an educated population or not, and there are pros and cons to both.\n\nAny plans for additions to SimCity in the future?\n\nRight now we are just getting the basic game out and that is the most important thing. We are going to be maintaining it and patching it almost continually. As we start to get feedback from the game and we start seeing what people do and how they play we will continually tune and update the game. The previous SimCity’s we offered in a monolithic fashion, they were offered as one complete thing that made it very difficult to change the behaviour, add or subtract to it or tune for that matter. The new SimCity are much more build out of little pieces that are assembled to build the city which puts us in a position to add new pieces, add new behaviour that deepen and make richer the overall simulation. So as we get a little bit further along I’m sure we will be adding stuff, we have not announced anything yet though, so it is more a general principle than a specific promise right now.\n\nDo you have any insider tips and tricks for future City Builders in SimCity?\n\nYes! A bunch! In part it depends on what kind of city you want to build. I’m very good at building the kind of city that I want to build which are not necessarily the kind you or anyone else like to build.\n\nI [would suggest] to start off by laying out the city with cheap dirt roads and only start upgrading your road once the money start to come in. You want to make sure you keep your sewage system far away from your fresh water supply. Don’t put sewage pumps next to fresh water pumps. Trees are beautiful so I like to plant lots and lots of trees all over the place and they also have the nice side-effect of cleaning up air pollution.\n\nYou want to make sure that you put all your dirty and filthy industries, your power plants down-wind from your population. If you have a nice residential neighbourhood and you put the power plant up-wind from it the people are going to be breathing the exhaust from coal plant and it will go on and make them really sick and kill them.\n\nThere are a lot of really practical tips. One of the big realisations especially for those who have played SimCity before is that you don’t need to do everything in one city. You can have your residential area in one city and then you can have the dirty industry in another city and people will commute back and forth. You can start to think about specializing cities to separate out the sorts of behaviours you want [from that city].\n\nIs there anyone that you would like to give a shoutout to?\n\nYes! I’d like to in particular mention our user interface designer, Christian Stratton. He is the guy that did most of the design work on the UI and also on the data visualization layers. He is a long time UI designer for Maxxis in that he did the UI design for Sim City 4 and for Sim City 3000 as well.\n\nSimCity, was a project that I wanted to do for a long, long time. The time just wasn’t right to do it, but when I finished up working on “Spore” with Andrew Willmot, (who was the lead Graphics Engineer for Sim City 4), he and I basically snuck off into a corner and started working on this new SimCity in secret for 6-8 months or so, really without anyone’s permission. We dealt the first rough cut version of the game, just the two of us, and then were able to convince people that this was a good idea and that we should build a new SimCity based on these ideas.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nSimCity is a deeply layered, complex life simulation, and a rare gem in the video games industry. You can play it as a creative outlet, as a curiosity to explore evil and or good behaviour or as a hard-core mega, multi city builder.\n\nYour world, your choices.\n\nSimCity releases on March 5 for PC, let the building begin!

  "latent_26282": "The doorbell rang.\n\nAntonella Tripiciano was expecting it. Her son, Nico Oneto, wasn't.\n\nA week after Nico returned home from his latest extended hospital stay, a surprise awaited the 10-year old.\n\nTripiciano turned to Nico and said, \"You remember that man that plays for Alabama? He's at the door.\"\n\nAfter some urging from his mother, Nico went and opened the door. Standing there was Tide All-American defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick and his father.\n\n\"His jaw just dropped,\" Tripiciano said. \"The smile on his face and the shock like 'Is he really at my house?' It was a priceless moment.\"\n\nFitzpatrick and Nico first connected in September, shortly after the Alabama standout learned of Nico's ongoing battle with cancer. Dec. 14 was the first time they met in person, when Fitzpatrick was back home in New Jersey.\n\nThis young boy and this friendship are why Fitzpatrick has had \"Nico\" written on his elbow sleeve for several games this season.\n\nFitzpatrick has encouraged Nico, and Nico has inspired the Tide's star safety.\n\n'It felt like a brick hit me'\n\nThe nurse at Arleth Elementary School in New Jersey called Tripiciano Nov. 30, 2014. An 8-year old Nico had a 102-degree fever and needed to be picked up.\n\nIt didn't seem overly serious at first. Nico tested positive for strep throat the next day and was put on an antibiotic. He didn't get better, though. Two rounds of blood work led to Nico's pediatrician recommending that Nico go see a local oncologist, a doctor who treats cancer.\n\nTripiciano remembers asking, \"An oncologist? Are you telling me my son has cancer?\"\n\n\"No,\" the pediatrician responded, \"We just need to look at a few things.\"\n\nYou can see \"Nico\" written on Minkah Fitzpatrick's elbow sleeve during Alabama's win over Kent State in September.\n\nNico underwent a bone marrow biopsy the next week. Ninety minutes following the procedure, a nurse took Tripiciano to a room with three doctors. One delivered the news, \"Your son has cancer. He has acute myeloid leukemia.\"\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) starts in the bone marrow and often quickly moves into the blood. Only 26 percent of people with AML live more than five years, according to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nMaking it even worse is that Nico has a rare form of AML that is very aggressive. Patients with this form of AML are more likely to relapse after remission.\n\n\"It felt like a brick hit me,\" Tripiciano said. \"It was like a tractor trailer hit me and ran me over. I was a mess -- tears, everything.\"\n\nAn ongoing battle\n\nNico underwent his first bone marrow transplant May 6, 2015 after three unsuccessful cycles of chemotherapy that caused him to lose his hair, made him consistently sick and led to him dropping from 122 pounds to 91.\n\nEarlier this year, Tripiciano began to suspect the cancer was back. Her fears were confirmed in August. As tough as Nico has been through the entire process, it was difficult news to bear.\n\n\"I don't want to do another transplant,\" a crying Nico told his family. \"If God wants to take me, then why doesn't He just take me? Why's He making me suffer?\"\n\nTripiciano, consoling her son, told him, \"I think He's just giving you another obstacle that you need to overcome.\"\n\nNico was readmitted to the hospital in mid-September and underwent his second bone marrow transplant a month ago. Before the operation, doctors gave Tripiciano a grave warning. \"Brace yourself,\" they said. \"He might not come home.\"\n\n\"As far as statistics go, they thought the toxicity in my child would have been so bad that he would have never made it,\" Tripiciano said. \"He proved them wrong again.\"\n\nNico returned home Dec. 5 and was able to spend Christmas with his family. There's still concern, though. The donor for the first transplant was a perfect match. His mom, the donor for the second transplant in November, was only a 6 out of 10 match.\n\n\"This is not a cure for my son,\" Tripiciano said, beginning to cry. \"They make it very clear to us to just enjoy life because it can change in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, with everything that Nico has endured already, we have no options left if he does relapse and the leukemia comes back. We still have like a good three or four months that his body can reject my cells, so that's still in the back of my head. If that happens, there's nothing they can do for him.\"\n\nAfter returning home, Nico told his parents that he didn't want any presents for Christmas. He insisted they instead buy gifts for other children at the hospital. \"This year's all about giving,\" he told his mother. \"Everybody gave to me, and I want to give back to them this year.\"\n\nTripiciano and her fiance obliged his request, buying iTunes gift cards, board games, dolls, Legos and more for children on Nico's old floor in the hospital.\n\n'Keep fighting'\n\nFitzpatrick's mom, Melissa, first heard about Nico in September when she was in attendance for Fitzpatrick's 9-year old brother's youth football game.\n\n\"I was really upset because I didn't have any money on me at the time, and it bothered me that I couldn't give anything,\" Melissa Fitzpatrick said. \"But I came back home. And on Facebook, somebody put Nico's picture up, and I was like 'Thank God' that we have a way that we can reach out.\"\n\nAfter going through a Facebook page that provides updates on Nico, Melissa told Minkah about Nico and reached out to Tripiciano.\n\n\"I just told her that their story really touched my family and that we're going to continue to pray for them,\" Melissa said. \"And I asked if she would mind if Minkah reached out to Nico because we thought that might put a smile on his face.\"\n\nThe families have gotten close ever since. The two moms talk regularly about their sons. Minkah periodically sends inspirational messages for Nico.\n\nWhy Minkah Fitzpatrick is like a younger Nick Saban Alabama's star defensive back is more than just big, fast and strong\n\nInside the process that led to Lane Kiffin landing at FAU It all started with a meeting in New York Dec. 6\n\nThe day they met, Nico wasn't feeling well. That changed when Minkah arrived.\n\nMinkah and his father were there for more than two hours, praying, eating pizza and playing with the family. Nico taught Minkah how to play Uno. Minkah gave Nico a pair of football gloves, and the two took pictures together.\n\nAfter Minkah left, a smiling Nico said, \"Mom, that was cool. A famous person came to visit me.\"\n\nNico keeps the gloves he got from Minkah in a Ziploc bag. \"He says that no one can go near them,\" his mom said laughing.\n\nBefore leaving that day, Minkah told Nico something he's said to him several times since they first connected: \"Keep fighting.\"\n\n*** Follow the Nico's Ninjas Facebook page to keep up with Nico's fight against cancer.\n\n*** Click here to make a donation to Nico's Acute Myeloid Leukemia Fund.",

  "latent_26371": "\"Aśoka\" and \"Asoka\" redirect here. For other uses, see Ashoka (disambiguation)\n\nAshoka ( English: ; IAST: Aśoka, Brāhmi: 𑀅𑀲𑁄𑀓, Asoka),[4] sometimes Ashoka the Great, was an Indian emperor of the Maurya Dynasty, who ruled almost all of the Indian subcontinent from c. 268 to 232 BCE.[5][6] The grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism. Considered by many to be one of India's greatest emperors,[according to whom?] Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east. It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. The empire's capital was Pataliputra (in Magadha, present-day Patna), with provincial capitals at Taxila and Ujjain.\n\nAshoka waged a destructive war against the state of Kalinga (modern Odisha),[7] which he conquered in about 260 BCE.[8] In about 263 BCE, he converted to Buddhism[7] after witnessing the mass deaths of the Kalinga War, which he had waged out of a desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations.[9] He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts, for sending Buddhist monks to Sri Lanka and Central Asia, and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha.[10]\n\nBeyond the Edicts of Ashoka, biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later, such as the 2nd-century CE Ashokavadana (\"Narrative of Ashoka\", a part of the Divyavadana), and in the Sri Lankan text Mahavamsa (\"Great Chronicle\"). The emblem of the modern Republic of India is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka. His Sanskrit name \"Aśoka\" means \"painless, without sorrow\" (the a privativum and śoka, \"pain, distress\"). In his edicts, he is referred to as Devānāmpriya (Pali Devānaṃpiya or \"the Beloved of the Gods\"), and Priyadarśin (Pali Piyadasī or \"He who regards everyone with affection\"). His fondness for his name's connection to the Saraca asoca tree, or \"Ashoka tree\", is also referenced in the Ashokavadana. In The Outline of History, H.G. Wells wrote, \"Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Ashoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star.\"[11]\n\nBiography\n\nAshoka's early life\n\nAshoka was born to the Mauryan emperor, Bindusara and Subhadrangī (or Dharmā).[12] He was the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya dynasty, who was born in a humble family, and with the counsel of Chanakya ultimately built one of the largest empires in ancient India.[13][14][15] According to Roman historian Appian, Chandragupta had made a \"marital alliance\" with Seleucus; there is thus a possibility that Ashoka had a Seleucid Greek grandmother.[16][17] An Indian Puranic source, the Pratisarga Parva of the Bhavishya Purana, also described the marriage of Chandragupta with a Greek (\"Yavana\") princess, daughter of Seleucus.[18][19]\n\nThe ancient Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain texts provide varying biographical accounts. The Avadana texts mention that his mother was queen Subhadrangī. According to the Ashokavadana, she was the daughter of a Brahmin from the city of Champa.[20][21]:205 She gave him the name Ashoka, meaning \"one without sorrow\". The Divyāvadāna tells a similar story, but gives the name of the queen as Janapadakalyānī.[22][23] Ashoka had several elder siblings, all of whom were his half-brothers from the other wives of his father Bindusara. Ashoka was given royal military training.\n\nRise to power\n\nThe Buddhist text Divyavadana describes Ashoka putting down a revolt due to activities of wicked ministers. This may have been an incident in Bindusara's times. Taranatha's account states that Chanakya, Bindusara's chief advisor, destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made himself the master of all territory between the eastern and the western seas. Some historians consider this as an indication of Bindusara's conquest of the Deccan while others consider it as suppression of a revolt.[20]\n\nGovernor of Ujain\n\nFollowing this, Ashoka was stationed at Ujain, the capital of Malwa, as governor.[20] A commemorative inscription found in Saru Maru, Madhya Pradesh, mentions the visit of Piyadasi (honorific name used by Ashoka in his inscriptions) as he was still an unmarried Prince.[25][26] This inscription confirms Ashoka's presence in Madhya Pradesh as a young man, and his status while he was there.[27]\n\nCommemorative inscription of Ashoka from Saru Maru, Madhya Pradesh. Translation\n\n(English) Transliteration Transcription\n\n(Brahmi script) Inscription\n\n(Prakrit in the Brahmi script) The king, who (now after consecration) is called \"Piyadasi\", (once) came to this place for a pleasure tour while still a (ruling) prince, living together with his unwedded consort. Commemorative Inscription of the visit of Ashoka, Saru Maru. Translated by Falk.[27] Piyadasi nāma\n\nrajakumala va\n\nsamvasamane\n\nimam desam papunitha\n\nviahara(ya)tay(e) 𑀧𑀺𑀬𑀤𑀲𑀺 𑀦𑀸𑀫\n\n𑀭𑀸𑀚𑀺𑀓𑀼𑀫𑀮 𑀯\n\n𑀲𑀁𑀯𑀲𑀫𑀦𑁂\n\n𑀓𑀺𑀫𑀁 𑀤𑁂𑀲𑀁 𑀧𑀧𑀼𑀦𑀺𑀣\n\n𑀯𑀺𑀅𑀳𑀭𑀬𑀝𑀬𑁂\n\nBindusara's death in 272 BCE led to a war over succession. According to the Divyavadana, Bindusara wanted his elder son Susima to succeed him but Ashoka was supported by his father's ministers, who found Susima to be arrogant and disrespectful towards them.[28] A minister named Radhagupta seems to have played an important role in Ashoka's rise to the throne. The Ashokavadana recounts Radhagupta's offering of an old royal elephant to Ashoka for him to ride to the Garden of the Gold Pavilion where King Bindusara would determine his successor. Ashoka later got rid of the legitimate heir to the throne by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. Radhagupta, according to the Ashokavadana, would later be appointed prime minister by Ashoka once he had gained the throne. The Dipavansa and Mahavansa refer to Ashoka's killing 99 of his brothers, sparing only one, named Vitashoka or Tissa,[3] although there is no clear proof about this incident (many such accounts are saturated with mythological elements). The coronation happened in 269 BCE, four years after his succession to the throne.[29]\n\nBuddhist legends state that Ashoka was bad-tempered and of a wicked nature. He built Ashoka's Hell, an elaborate torture chamber described as a \"Paradisal Hell\" due to the contrast between its beautiful exterior and the acts carried out within by his appointed executioner, Girikaa.[30] This earned him the name of Chanda Ashoka (Caṇḍa Aśoka) meaning \"Ashoka the Fierce\" in Sanskrit. Professor Charles Drekmeier cautions that the Buddhist legends tend to dramatise the change that Buddhism brought in him, and therefore, exaggerate Ashoka's past wickedness and his piousness after the conversion.[31]\n\nAscending the throne, Ashoka expanded his empire over the next eight years, from the present-day Assam in the East to Balochistan in the West; from the Pamir Knot in Afghanistan in the north to the peninsula of southern India except for present day Tamil Nadu and Kerala which were ruled by the three ancient Tamil kingdoms.[23][32]\n\nMarriage\n\nFrom the various sources that speak of his life, Ashoka is believed to have had five wives. They were named Devi (or Vedisa-Mahadevi-Shakyakumari), the second queen, Karuvaki, Asandhimitra (designated agramahisī or \"chief queen\"), Padmavati, and Tishyarakshita. He is similarly believed to have had four sons and two daughters: a son by Devi named Mahendra (Pali: Mahinda), Tivara (son of Karuvaki), Kunala (son of Padmavati, and Jalauka (mentioned in the Kashmir Chronicle), a daughter of Devi named Sanghamitra (Pali: Sanghamitta), and another daughter named Charumati.\n\nAccording to one version of the Mahavamsa, the Buddhist chronicle of Sri Lanka, Ashoka, when he was heir-apparent and was journeying as Viceroy to Ujjain, is said to have halted at Vidisha (10 kilometers from Sanchi), and there married the daughter of a local banker. She was called Devi and later gave Ashoka two sons, Ujjeniya and Mahendra, and a daughter Sanghamitta. After Ashoka's accession, Mahendra headed a Buddhist mission, sent probably under the auspices of the Emperor, to Sri Lanka.[34]\n\nConquest of Kalinga & Buddhist conversion\n\nWhile the early part of Ashoka's reign was apparently quite bloodthirsty, he became a follower of the Buddha's teachings after his conquest of the Kalinga on the east coast of India in the present-day states of Odisha and North Coastal Andhra Pradesh. Kalinga was a state that prided itself on its sovereignty and democracy. With its monarchical parliamentary democracy it was quite an exception in ancient Bharata where there existed the concept of Rajdharma. Rajdharma means the duty of the rulers, which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and dharma. The Kalinga War happened eight years after his coronation. From his 13th inscription, we come to know that the battle was a massive one and caused the deaths of more than 100,000 soldiers and many civilians who rose up in defence; over 150,000 were deported.[36]\n\nEdict 13 of the Edicts of Ashoka Rock Inscriptions expresses the great remorse the king felt after observing the destruction of Kalinga:\n\nDirectly after the Kalingas had been annexed began His Sacred Majesty’s zealous protection of the Law of Piety, his love of that Law, and his inculcation of that Law. Thence arises the remorse of His Sacred Majesty for having conquered the Kalingas, because the conquest of a country previously unconquered involves the slaughter, death, and carrying away captive of the people. That is a matter of profound sorrow and regret to His Sacred Majesty.[37]\n\nLegend says that one day after the war was over, Ashoka ventured out to roam the city and all he could see were burnt houses and scattered corpses. The lethal war with Kalinga transformed the vengeful Emperor Ashoka to a stable and peaceful emperor and he became a patron of Buddhism. According to the prominent Indologist, A. L. Basham, Ashoka's personal religion became Buddhism, if not before, then certainly after the Kalinga war. However, according to Basham, the Dharma officially propagated by Ashoka was not Buddhism at all.[38] Nevertheless, his patronage led to the expansion of Buddhism in the Mauryan empire and other kingdoms during his rule, and worldwide from about 250 BCE.[39] Prominent in this cause were his son Mahinda (Mahendra) and daughter Sanghamitra (whose name means \"friend of the Sangha\"), who established Buddhism in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).[40]\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nAshoka ruled for an estimated 36 years and died in 232 BCE. Legend states that during his cremation, his body burned for seven days and nights.[42] After his death, the Mauryan dynasty lasted just fifty more years until his empire stretched over almost all of the Indian subcontinent. Ashoka had many wives and children, but many of their names are lost to time. His chief consort (agramahisi) for the majority of his reign was his wife, Asandhimitra, who apparently bore him no children.\n\nIn his old age, he seems to have come under the spell of his youngest wife Tishyaraksha. It is said that she had got Ashoka's son Kunala, the regent in Takshashila and the heir presumptive to the throne, blinded by a wily stratagem. The official executioners spared Kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife Kanchanmala. In Pataliputra, Ashoka heard Kunala's song, and realised that Kunala's misfortune may have been a punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself. He condemned Tishyaraksha to death, restoring Kunala to the court. In the Ashokavadana, Kunala is portrayed as forgiving Tishyaraksha, having obtained enlightenment through Buddhist practice. While he urges Ashoka to forgive her as well, Ashoka does not respond with the same forgiveness.[30] Kunala was succeeded by his son, Samprati, who ruled for 50 years until his death.[citation needed]\n\nThe reign of Ashoka Maurya might have disappeared into history as the ages passed by, had he not left behind records of his reign. These records are in the form of sculpted pillars and rocks inscribed with a variety of actions and teachings he wished to be published under his name. The language used for inscription was in one of the Prakrit \"common\" languages etched in a Brahmi script.[44]\n\nIn the year 185 BCE, about fifty years after Ashoka's death, the last Maurya ruler, Brihadratha, was assassinated by the commander-in-chief of the Mauryan armed forces, Pushyamitra Shunga, while he was taking the Guard of Honor of his forces. Pushyamitra Shunga founded the Shunga dynasty (185-75 BCE) and ruled just a fragmented part of the Mauryan Empire. Many of the northwestern territories of the Mauryan Empire (modern-day Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan) became the Indo-Greek Kingdom.[citation needed]\n\nKing Ashoka, the third monarch of the Indian Mauryan dynasty, is also considered as one of the most exemplary rulers who ever lived.[45]\n\nBuddhist kingship\n\nOne of the more enduring legacies of Ashoka was the model that he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and the state. Emperor Ashoka was seen as a role model to leaders within the Buddhist community. He not only provided guidance and strength, but he also created personal relationships with his supporters.[46] Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia, the model of rulership embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated (in the Angkor kingdom, for instance). Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimise his rule not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist sangha. Following Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom. Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign. This development ultimately led to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported Buddhism of Thailand and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader. Ashoka also said that all his courtiers always governed the people in a moral manner.[citation needed]\n\nAccording to the legends mentioned in the 2nd-century CE text Ashokavadana, Ashoka was not non-violent after adopting Buddhism. In one instance, a non-Buddhist in Pundravardhana drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of Nirgrantha Jnatiputra (identified with Mahavira, 24th Tirthankara of Jainism). On complaint from a Buddhist devotee, Ashoka issued an order to arrest him, and subsequently, another order to kill all the Ajivikas in Pundravardhana. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order.[21][47] Sometime later, another Nirgrantha follower in Pataliputra drew a similar picture. Ashoka burnt him and his entire family alive in their house.[47] He also announced an award of one dinara (silver coin) to anyone who brought him the head of a Nirgrantha heretic. According to Ashokavadana, as a result of this order, his own brother was mistaken for a heretic and killed by a cowherd.[21] However, for several reasons, scholars say, these stories of persecutions of rival sects by Ashoka appear to be clear fabrications arising out of sectarian propaganda.[47][48][49]\n\nHistorical sources\n\nAshoka had almost been forgotten, but in the 19th century James Prinsep contributed in the revelation of historical sources. After deciphering the Brahmi script, Prinsep had originally identified the \"Priyadasi\" of the inscriptions he found with the King of Ceylon Devanampiya Tissa. However, in 1837, George Turnour discovered an important Sri Lankan manuscript (Dipavamsa, or \"Island Chronicle\" ) associating Piyadasi with Ashoka:\n\n\"Two hundred and eighteen years after the beatitude of the Buddha, was the inauguration of Piyadassi, .... who, the grandson of Chandragupta, and the son of Bindusara, was at the time Governor of Ujjayani.\" Dipavamsa.[50]\n\nSince then, the association of \"Devanampriya Priyadarsin\" with Ashoka was confirmed through various inscriptions, and especially confirmed in the Minor Rock Edict inscription discovered in Maski, directly associating Ashoka with his regnal title Devanampriya (\"Beloved-of-the-Gods\"):[51][52]\n\n[A proclamation] of Devanampriya Asoka.\n\nTwo and a half years [and somewhat more] (have passed) since I am a Buddha-Sakya.\n\n[A year and] somewhat more (has passed) [since] I have visited the Samgha and have shown zeal.\n\nThose gods who formerly had been unmingled (with men) in Jambudvipa, have how become mingled (with them).\n\nThis object can be reached even by a lowly (person) who is devoted to morality.\n\nOne must not think thus, — (viz.) that only an exalted (person) may reach this.\n\nBoth the lowly and the exalted must be told : \"If you act thus, this matter (will be) prosperous and of long duration, and will thus progress to one and a half. Maski Minor Rock Edict of Ashoka.[53]\n\nAnother important historian was British archaeologist John Hubert Marshall, who was director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India. His main interests were Sanchi and Sarnath, in addition to Harappa and Mohenjodaro. Sir Alexander Cunningham, a British archaeologist and army engineer, and often known as the father of the Archaeological Survey of India, unveiled heritage sites like the Bharhut Stupa, Sarnath, Sanchi, and the Mahabodhi Temple. Mortimer Wheeler, a British archaeologist, also exposed Ashokan historical sources, especially the Taxila.[citation needed]\n\nInformation about the life and reign of Ashoka primarily comes from a relatively small number of Buddhist sources. In particular, the Sanskrit Ashokavadana ('Story of Ashoka'), written in the 2nd century, and the two Pāli chronicles of Sri Lanka (the Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa) provide most of the currently known information about Ashoka. Additional information is contributed by the Edicts of Ashoka, whose authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts (Priyadarshi—'He who regards everyone with affection') as a title or additional name of Ashoka Maurya. Architectural remains of his period have been found at Kumhrar, Patna, which include an 80-pillar hypostyle hall.[citation needed]\n\nEdicts of Ashoka -The Edicts of Ashoka are a collection of 33 inscriptions on the Pillars of Ashoka, as well as boulders and cave walls, made by Ashoka during his reign. These inscriptions are dispersed throughout modern-day Pakistan and India, and represent the first tangible evidence of Buddhism. The edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of Buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings of Indian history, offering more information about Ashoka's proselytism, moral precepts, religious precepts, and his notions of social and animal welfare.[54]\n\nAshokavadana – The Aśokāvadāna is a 2nd-century CE text related to the legend of Ashoka. The legend was translated into Chinese by Fa Hien in 300 CE. It is essentially a Hinayana text, and its world is that of Mathura and North-west India. The emphasis of this little known text is on exploring the relationship between the king and the community of monks (the Sangha) and setting up an ideal of religious life for the laity (the common man) by telling appealing stories about religious exploits. The most startling feature is that Ashoka's conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war, which is not even mentioned, nor is there a word about his belonging to the Maurya dynasty. Equally surprising is the record of his use of state power to spread Buddhism in an uncompromising fashion. The legend of Veetashoka provides insights into Ashoka's character that are not available in the widely known Pali records.[30]\n\nObv: Symbols including a sun and an animal Rev: Symbol Dimensions: 13.92 x 11.75 mm Weight: 3.4 g.

It covers the period from the coming of King Vijaya of Kalinga (ancient Odisha) in 543 BCE to the reign of King Mahasena (334–361). As it often refers to the royal dynasties of India, the Mahavamsa is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the Indian subcontinent. It is very important in dating the consecration of Ashoka.[citation needed]\n\nDwipavamsa -The Dwipavamsa, or \"Dweepavamsa\", (i.e., Chronicle of the Island, in Pali) is the oldest historical record of Sri Lanka. The chronicle is believed to be compiled from Atthakatha and other sources around the 3rd or 4th century CE. King Dhatusena (4th century) had ordered that the Dipavamsa be recited at the Mahinda festival held annually in Anuradhapura.[citation needed]\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe caduceus appears as a symbol of the punch-marked coins of the Maurya Empire in India, in the 3rd-2nd century BCE. Numismatic research suggests that this symbol was the symbol of king Ashoka, his personal \"Mudra\".[56] This symbol was not used on the pre-Mauryan punch-marked coins, but only on coins of the Maurya period, together with the three arched-hill symbol, the \"peacock on the hill\", the triskelis and the Taxila mark.[57]\n\nPerceptions and historiography\n\nThe use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka, as well as the interpretations of his Edicts. Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution. Some scholars have tended to question this assessment. Romila Thappar writes about Ashoka that \"We need to see him both as a statesman in the context of inheriting and sustaining an empire in a particular historical period, and as a person with a strong commitment to changing society through what might be called the propagation of social ethics.\"[58] The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time: Buddhism, Brahmanism, Jainism, and Ajivikaism, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept. For example, Amartya Sen writes, \"The Indian Emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE presented many political inscriptions in favor of tolerance and individual freedom, both as a part of state policy and in the relation of different people to each other\".[59]\n\nHowever, the edicts alone strongly indicate that he was a Buddhist. In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance. Furthermore, many edicts are expressed to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an \"upasaka\", and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts. He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites, but did not do so for the sites of other religions. He also used the word \"dhamma\" to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word. However, he used the word more in the spirit than as a strict code of conduct. Romila Thappar writes, \"His dhamma did not derive from divine inspiration, even if its observance promised heaven. It was more in keeping with the ethic conditioned by the logic of given situations. His logic of Dhamma was intended to influence the conduct of categories of people, in relation to each other. Especially where they involved unequal relationships.\"[58] Finally, he promotes ideals that correspond to the first three steps of the Buddha's graduated discourse.[60]\n\nThe Ashokavadana presents an alternate view of the familiar Ashoka; one in which his conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war or about his descent from the Maurya dynasty. Instead, Ashoka's reason for adopting non-violence appears much more personal. The Ashokavadana shows that the main source of Ashoka's conversion and the acts of welfare that followed are rooted instead in intense personal anguish at its core, from a wellspring inside himself rather than spurred by a specific event. It thereby illuminates Ashoka as more humanly ambitious and passionate, with both greatness and flaws. This Ashoka is very different from the \"shadowy do-gooder\" of later Pali chronicles.[30]\n\nMuch of the knowledge about Ashoka comes from the several inscriptions that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire. All his inscriptions present him as compassionate and loving. In the Kalinga rock edits, he addresses his people as his \"children\" and mentions that as a father he desires their good.[61] These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to dharma (duty or proper behaviour), and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might. One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga War and Ashoka's allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration. The Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath is the most notable of the relics left by Ashoka. Made of sandstone, this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath, in the 3rd century BCE. It has a four-lion capital (four lions standing back to back), which was adopted as the emblem of the modern Indian republic. The lion symbolises both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the Buddha. In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire. It is difficult to determine whether or not some events ever actually happened, but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered.[citation needed]\n\nFocus of debate\n\nRecently scholarly analysis determined that the three major foci of debate regarding Ashoka involve the nature of the Maurya empire; the extent and impact of Ashoka's pacifism; and what is referred to in the Inscriptions as dhamma or dharma, which connotes goodness, virtue, and charity.[62] Some historians[who?] have argued that Ashoka's pacifism undermined the \"military backbone\" of the Maurya empire, while others have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been \"grossly exaggerated\". The dhamma of the Edicts has been understood as concurrently a Buddhist lay ethic, a set of politico-moral ideas, a \"sort of universal religion\", or as an Ashokan innovation. On the other hand, it has also been interpreted as an essentially political ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire. Scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the Edicts (particularly in regard to imperial vision), and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of a \"virtually subcontinental, and culturally and economically highly variegated, 3rd century BCE Indian empire. Nonetheless, it remains clear that Ashoka's Inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the Indian subcontinent, and therefore prove to be a very important innovation in royal practices.\"[63]\n\nLegends of Ashoka\n\n[64][2] Ashoka and his two queens, in a relief at Sanchi . The identification with Ashoka is confirmed by the similar relief from Kanaganahalli inscribed \"Raya Asoka\".\n\nUntil the Ashokan inscriptions were discovered and deciphered, stories about Ashoka were based on the legendary accounts of his life and not strictly on historical facts. These legends were found in Buddhist textual sources such as the text of Ashokavadana. The Ashokavadana is a subset of a larger set of legends in the Divyavadana, though it could have existed independently as well. Following are some of the legends narrated in the Ashokavadana about Ashoka:\n\n1) One of the stories talks about an event that occurred in a past life of Ashoka, when he was a small child named Jaya. Once when Jaya was playing on the roadside, the Buddha came by. The young child put a handful of earth in the Buddha's begging bowl as his gift to the saint and declared his wish to one day become a great emperor and follower of the Buddha. The Buddha is said to have smiled a smile that “illuminated the universe with its rays of light”.[20] These rays of light are then said to have re-entered the Buddha's left palm, signifying that this child Jaya would, in his next life, become a great emperor. The Buddha is said to have even turned to his disciple Ananda and is said to have predicted that this child would be “a great, righteous chakravarti king, who would rule his empire from his capital at Pataliputra”.\n\n2) Another story aims to portray Ashoka as an evil person in order to convey the importance of his transformation into a good person upon adopting Buddhism.[20] It begins by stating that due to Ashoka's physical ugliness he was disliked by his father Bindusara. Ashoka wanted to become king and so he got rid of the heir by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. He became famous as “Ashoka the Fierce” because of his wicked nature and bad temper. He is said to have subjected his ministers to a test of loyalty and then have 500 of them killed for failing it. He is said to have burnt his entire harem to death when certain women insulted him. He is supposed to have derived sadistic pleasure from watching other people suffer. And for this he built himself an elaborate and horrific torture chamber where he amused himself by torturing other people. The story then goes on to narrate how it was only after an encounter with a pious Buddhist monk that Ashoka himself transformed into “Ashoka the pious”. A Chinese traveler who visited India in the 7th century CE, Xuan Zang recorded in his memoirs that he visited the place where the supposed torture chamber stood.\n\n3) Another story is about events that occurred towards the end of Ashoka's time on earth. Ashoka is said to have started gifting away the contents of his treasury to the Buddhist sangha. His ministers however were scared that his eccentricity would be the downfall of the empire and so denied him access to the treasury. As a result, Ashoka started giving away his personal possessions and was eventually left with nothing and so died peacefully.[20]\n\nAt this point it is important to note that the Ashokavadana being a Buddhist text in itself sought to gain new converts for Buddhism and so used all these legends. Devotion to the Buddha and loyalty to the sangha are stressed. Such texts added to the perception that Ashoka was essentially the ideal Buddhist monarch who deserved both admiration and emulation.[20]\n\nAshoka and the relics of the Buddha\n\nAccording to Buddhist legend, particularly the Mahaparinirvana, the relics of the Buddha had been shared among eight countries following his death.[66] Ashoka endeavoured to take back the relics and share them among 84,000 stupas. This story is amply depicted in the reliefs of Sanchi and Bharhut.[67] According to the legend, Ashoka obtained the ashes from seven of the countries, but failed to take the ashes from the Nagas at Ramagrama. This scene is depicted on the tranversal portion of the southern gateway at Sanchi.\n\n[2] King Ashoka visits Ramagrama, to take relics of the Buddha from the Nagas , but in vain. Southern gateway, Stupa 1, Sanchi\n\nContributions\n\nApproach towards religions\n\nAccording to Indian historian Romila Thapar, Ashoka emphasized respect for all religious teachers, and harmonious relationship between parents and children, teachers and pupils, and employers and employees.[68] Ashoka's religion contained gleanings from all religions.[69] He emphasized the virtues of Ahimsa, respect to all religious teachers, equal respect for and study of each other's scriptures, and rational faith.[69]\n\nGlobal spread of Buddhism\n\nStupa of Sanchi . The central stupa was built during the Mauryas, and enlarged during the Sungas , but the decorative gateway is dated to the later dynasty of the Satavahanas\n\nAs a Buddhist emperor, Ashoka believed that Buddhism is beneficial for all human beings as well as animals and plants, so he built a number of stupas, Sangharama, viharas, chaitya, and residences for Buddhist monks all over South Asia and Central Asia. According to the Ashokavadana, he ordered the construction of 84,000 stupas to house the Buddha's relics.[70] In the Aryamanjusrimulakalpa, Ashoka takes offerings to each of these stupas traveling in a chariot adorned with precious metals.[71] He gave donations to viharas and mathas. He sent his only daughter Sanghamitra and son Mahindra to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka (then known as Tamraparni).\n\nAccording to the Mahavamsa (XII, 1st paragraph),[72] in the 17th year of his reign, at the end of the Third Buddhist Council, Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to nine parts of the world (eight parts of Southern Asia, and the \"country of the Yonas (Greeks)\") to propagate Buddhism.[73]\n\nAshoka also invited Buddhists and non-Buddhists for religious conferences. He inspired the Buddhist monks to compose the sacred religious texts, and also gave all types of help to that end. Ashoka also helped to develop viharas (intellectual hubs) such as Nalanda and Taxila. Ashoka helped to construct Sanchi and Mahabodhi Temple. Ashoka also gave donations to non-Buddhists. As his reign continued his even-handedness was replaced with special inclination towards Buddhism.[74] Ashoka helped and respected both Shramanas (Buddhists monks) and Brahmins (Vedic monks). Ashoka also helped to organise the Third Buddhist council ( c. 250 BCE) at Pataliputra (today's Patna), conducted by the monk Moggaliputta-Tissa.[75][76]\n\nEmperor Ashoka's son, Mahinda, also helped with the spread of Buddhism by translating the Buddhist Canon into a language that could be understood by the people of Sri Lanka.[77]\n\nIt is well known that Ashoka sent dütas or emissaries to convey messages or letters, written or oral (rather both), to various people. The VIth Rock Edict about \"oral orders\" reveals this. It was later confirmed that it was not unusual to add oral messages to written ones, and the content of Ashoka's messages can be inferred likewise from the XIIIth Rock Edict: They were meant to spread his dhammavijaya, which he considered the highest victory and which he wished to propagate everywhere (including far beyond India). There is obvious and undeniable trace of cultural contact through the adoption of the Kharosthi script, and the idea of installing inscriptions might have travelled with this script, as Achaemenid influence is seen in some of the formulations used by Ashoka in his inscriptions. This indicates to us that Ashoka was indeed in contact with other cultures, and was an active part in mingling and spreading new cultural ideas beyond his own immediate walls.[78]\n\nHellenistic world\n\nIn his edicts, Ashoka mentions some of the people living in Hellenic countries as converts to Buddhism and recipients of his envoys, although no Hellenic historical record of this event remains:\n\nNow it is conquest by Dhamma that Beloved-of-the-Gods considers to be the best conquest. And it (conquest by Dhamma) has been won here, on the borders, even six hundred yojanas away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the Cholas, the Pandyas, and as far as Tamraparni. Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the Kambojas, the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamktis, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in Dhamma. Even where Beloved-of-the-Gods' envoys have not been, these people too, having heard of the practice of Dhamma and the ordinances and instructions in Dhamma given by Beloved-of-the-Gods, are following it and will continue to do so. Edicts of Ashoka, Rock Edict (S. Dhammika)[82]\n\nIt is not too far-fetched to imagine, however, that Ashoka received letters from Greek rulers and was acquainted with the Hellenistic royal orders in the same way as he perhaps knew of the inscriptions of the Achaemenid kings, given the presence of ambassadors of Hellenistic kings in India (as well as the dütas sent by Ashoka himself).[78] Dionysius is reported to have been such a Greek ambassador at the court of Ashoka, sent by Ptolemy II Philadelphus,[83] who himself is mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka as a recipient of the Buddhist proselytism of Ashoka. Some Hellenistic philosophers, such as Hegesias of Cyrene, who probably lived under the rule of King Magas, one of the supposed recipients of Buddhist emissaries from Asoka, are sometimes thought to have been influenced by Buddhist teachings.[84]\n\nThe Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as Dharmaraksita, are described in Pali sources as leading Greek (Yona) Buddhist monks, active in spreading Buddhism (the Mahavamsa, XII[85]).\n\nSome Greeks (Yavana) may have played an administrative role in the territories ruled by Ashoka. The Girnar inscription of Rudradaman records that during the rule of Ashoka, a Yavana Governor was in charge in the area of Girnar, Gujarat, mentioning his role in the construction of a water reservoir.[86][87]\n\nAs administrator\n\nAshoka's military power was strong, but after his conversion to Buddhism, he maintained friendly relations with three major Tamil kingdoms in the South—namely, Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas—the post-Alexandrian empire, Tamraparni, and Suvarnabhumi. His edicts state that he made provisions for medical treatment of humans and animals in his own kingdom as well as in these neighbouring states. He also had wells dug and trees planted along the roads for the benefit of the common people.[61]\n\nAnimal welfare\n\nAshoka's rock edicts declare that injuring living things is not good, and no animal should be sacrificed for slaughter. However, he did not prohibit common cattle slaughter or beef eating.[89]\n\nHe imposed a ban on killing of \"all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible\", and of specific animal species including several birds, certain types of fish and bulls among others. He also banned killing of female goats, sheep and pigs that were nursing their young; as well as their young up to the age of six months. He also banned killing of all fish and castration of animals during certain periods such as Chaturmasa and Uposatha.[90][91]\n\nAshoka also abolished the royal hunting of animals and restricted the slaying of animals for food in the royal residence.[92] Because he banned hunting, created many veterinary clinics and eliminated meat eating on many holidays, the Mauryan Empire under Ashoka has been described as \"one of the very few instances in world history of a government treating its animals as citizens who are as deserving of its protection as the human residents\".[93]\n\nAshoka Chakra\n\nThe Ashoka Chakra (the wheel of Ashoka) is a depiction of the Dharmachakra (the Wheel of Dharma). The wheel has 24 spokes which represent the 12 Laws of Dependent Origination and the 12 Laws of Dependent Termination. The Ashoka Chakra has been widely inscribed on many relics of the Mauryan Emperor, most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of Sarnath and The Ashoka Pillar. The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of the National flag of the Republic of India (adopted on 22 July 1947), where it is rendered in a Navy-blue color on a White background, by replacing the symbol of Charkha (Spinning wheel) of the pre-independence versions of the flag. The Ashoka Chakra can also been seen on the base of the Lion Capital of Ashoka which has been adopted as the National Emblem of India.[citation needed]\n\nThe Ashoka Chakra was created by Ashoka during his reign. Chakra is a Sanskrit word which also means \"cycle\" or \"self-repeating process\". The process it signifies is the cycle of time—as in how the world changes with time.[citation needed]\n\nA few days before India became independent in August 1947, the specially-formed Constituent Assembly decided that the flag of India must be acceptable to all parties and communities. A flag with three colours, Saffron, White and Green with the Ashoka Chakra was selected.[94]\n\nStone architecture\n\nAshoka is often credited with the beginning of stone architecture in India, possibly following the introduction of stone-building techniques by the Greeks after Alexander the Great.[95] Before Ashoka's time, buildings were probably built in non-permanent material, such as wood, bamboo or thatch.[95][96] Ashoka may have rebuilt his palace in Pataliputra by replacing wooden material by stone, and may also have used the help of foreign craftmen.[98] Ashoka also innovated by using the permanent qualities of stone for his written edicts, as well as his pillars with Buddhist symbolism.\n\nPillars of Ashoka (Ashokstambha)\n\nThe Ashokan pillar at Lumbini Nepal , Buddha's birthplace\n\nThe pillars of Ashoka are a series of columns dispersed throughout the northern Indian subcontinent, and erected by Ashoka during his reign in the 3rd century BCE. Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected. The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi. The wheel represents the sun time and Buddhist law, while the swastika stands for the cosmic dance around a fixed center and guards against evil.[citation needed]\n\nLion Capital of Ashoka (Ashokmudra)\n\nThe Lion capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of four lions standing back to back. It was originally placed atop the Ashoka pillar at Sarnath, now in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. The pillar, sometimes called the Ashoka Column, is still in its original location, but the Lion Capital is now in the Sarnath Museum. This Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the National Emblem of India and the wheel (\"Ashoka Chakra\") from its base was placed onto the center of the National Flag of India.[citation needed]\n\nThe capital contains four lions (Indian / Asiatic Lions), standing back to back, mounted on a short cylindrical abacus, with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion, separated by intervening spoked chariot-wheels over a bell-shaped lotus. Carved out of a single block of polished sandstone, the capital was believed to be crowned by a 'Wheel of Dharma' (Dharmachakra popularly known in India as the \"Ashoka Chakra\"). The Sarnath pillar bears one of the Edicts of Ashoka, an inscription against division within the Buddhist community, which reads, \"No one shall cause division in the order of monks.\"[citation needed]\n\nThe four animals in the Sarnath capital are believed to symbolise different steps of Lord Buddha's life.[citation needed]\n\nThe Elephant represents the Buddha's idea in reference to the dream of Queen Maya of a white elephant entering her womb.\n\nThe Bull represents desire during the life of the Buddha as a prince.\n\nThe Horse represents Buddha's departure from palatial life.\n\nThe Lion represents the accomplishment of Buddha.\n\nBesides the religious interpretations, there are some non-religious interpretations also about the symbolism of the Ashoka capital pillar at Sarnath. According to them, the four lions symbolise Ashoka's rule over the four directions, the wheels as symbols of his enlightened rule (Chakravartin) and the four animals as symbols of four adjoining territories of India.[citation needed]\n\nConstructions credited to Ashoka\n\nIllustration of the original temple built by Asoka at Bodh-Gaya on the location of the Mahabodhi Temple , sculpture of the Satavahana period at Sanchi , 1st century CE.\n\nThe British restoration was done under guidance from Weligama Sri Sumangala.[99]\n\nIn art, film and literature\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\nAshoka Mauryan dynasty Died: 232 BCE Preceded by\n\nBindusara Mauryan Emperor\n\n272–232 BCE Succeeded by\n\nDasharatha",
  "latent_26386": "Another problem also cropped up — the reporting of missing persons cases. Cases of missing persons 18 years old and younger must be reported, but reporting adult missing persons cases is voluntary. Only a handful of states have laws that require law enforcement agencies to prepare missing person reports on adults. Overall, there is a low rate of reporting these cases through NCIC. One of the major goals of NamUs is to meet this challenge. For example, NamUs will work with state clearinghouses and the public to ensure that data is included in NamUs and other national-level databases.\n\nTo further investigate the extent of the problem, NIJ assembled an expert panel of medical examiners and coroners who found that the primary need was for a central reporting system for unidentified human remains.\n\nAs of 2004, more than half (51 percent) of the nation’s medical examiners’ offices had no policy for retaining records — such as X-rays, DNA, or fingerprints — on unidentified human decedents.\n\nIt had been estimated that there are approximately 40,000 unidentified human remains in the offices of the nation’s medical examiners and coroners or were buried or cremated before being identified. In a typical year, medical examiners and coroners handle approximately 4,400 unidentified human decedent cases, 1,000 of which remain unidentified after one year.\n\nNamUs was created to solve just such problems as arose with Bandy.\n\nA Nevada County family has achieved some much-needed closure, after their sister — first reported missing in 1996 — was found to have been killed in a traffic accident in 1993 and buried as a Jane Doe in Texas.\n\nThe Nevada County Sheriff's Office took the missing persons report on Pamela Louise Bandy in November 1996, said Sgt. Bob Jakobs.\n\n\"She hadn't been seen in about two years,\" Jakobs said.\n\nBandy's sister, Marcie Beaver, reported her missing, and told deputies she had a history of mental illness and bouts with drug use, Jakobs said, adding that it was not unusual for family members not to hear from her for a long time.\n\nAccording to Beaver, Bandy had drifted in and out of Nevada County after the family moved here, settling in the county in the mid-1980s.\n\nBandy's father remembered having spoken to her on the phone several years prior from a truck stop in Arizona.\n\nRecommended Stories For You\n\n\"She was hitchhiking,\" Beaver said. \"He got mad at her and she hung up.\"\n\nThat was the last time anyone ever heard from her.\n\nBandy was entered into the state and national databases for missing persons; the trail was cold, however, and no information was ever received.\n\nFlash forward to 2013, when DNA samples were collected from several family members and uploaded into a national DNA index system with DNA profiles contributed by federal, state, and local participating forensic laboratories, that looks for matches from crime scenes and from registered offenders.\n\n\"We never did receive any matches,\" Jakobs said.\n\nIn April of this year, Bandy's information was entered into NamUs, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System — a national centralized repository and resource center for missing persons and unidentified (and unclaimed) decedent records launched in 2009. NamUs is a free online system that can be searched by medical examiners, coroners, law enforcement officials and the general public from all over the country.\n\nUnlike the National Crime Information Center, which is only accessible to law enforcement, the information is accessible to the public, Jakobs explained.\n\n\"We are in the process of having all our missing persons and unidentified remains cases uploaded into NamUs,\" he said. \"It's a process that takes some time — we are going back all the way into the 1970s.\"\n\nInitially, Jakobs said, no match was found.\n\nFinally, clues surface\n\nThen Bandy's profile was published to the California Attorney General website for missing persons. In late May, staff from NamUs coordinated with the Attorney General's office so that it could access more biometric data, such as fingerprints, dental and DNA records.\n\nBandy's FBI record was run and it was found that it had been purged, with an indication that she was deceased, Jakobs said; police in Temple, Texas had reported her death in November 1993.\n\nEven then, local law enforcement kept running into brick walls.\n\n\"I reached out to authorities in Temple, but they had no record of her,\" Jakobs said, adding that he also contacted the Dallas bureau of vital statistics, the Southwestern Institute of Forensic Science in Dallas and the state Department of Health Services in Austin.\n\nNo one had any records or a death certificate for Bandy.\n\nAt that point, Jakobs said, he was steered to Texas Ranger Marcus Hilton. After Jakobs told Hilton that he hadn't been able to find a record for Bandy, and raised the possibility she was listed as a Jane Doe, Hilton started searching for any Jane Doe death certificates that matched the November 1993 date.\n\nHilton soon found a match — a Jane Doe killed in a traffic collision in Bell County, south of Temple.\n\nThe medical examiner pulled the records but they were \"quite limited.\" There were, however, some tattoo descriptions that convinced Jakobs he had found Bandy, along with some minimal dental records.\n\nThe mortuary no longer had Jane Doe's records, but the cemetery was able to locate her gravesite.\n\nThen, another roadblock. Jakobs couldn't track down Jane Doe's fingerprints, so discussions began on the possibility of exhuming the body.\n\n\"We were in the process,\" he said. \"But on Nov. 9, I got a call saying they had found the print card from the autopsy.\"\n\nPamela Bandy finally had been found.\n\n\"We confirmed her identity and we were able to remove her from the missing persons system,\" Jakobs said. \"They are amending the death certificate.\"\n\nBy all accounts, Bandy's death was simply an accident.\n\nAccording to the incident report, she was seen sitting beside the road, waving her arms, at about 2:15 a.m. on Nov. 30, 1993. She suddenly jumped into the road and was hit, the report stated. Her cause of death was listed as multiple traumatic injuries; she had no ID on her.\n\nDeaths in Texas typically are investigated by a justice of the peace, Jakobs explained.\n\n\"We know her prints were taken and sent to the FBI,\" he said. \"We don't know where the disconnect happened — we don't know that we'll ever get to the bottom of that mystery. But at least we're able to give the family closure at this point.\n\n\"This was the family's mystery, as to what happened to her.\"\n\nBeaver said she was relieved to find that her sister's death was simply an accident.\n\n\"I thought she had been murdered, to be honest,\" she said. \"I knew something had happened to her.\n\n\"Closure is comforting,\" Beaver mused. \"Her whole story is tragic. She went through a lot of abuse in her life. The tragedy is drugs and alcohol.\"\n\nTo contact City Editor Liz Kellar, email lkellar@theunion.com or call 530-477-4229.",
  "latent_26461": "Six members of the U.S. House of Representatives discussed the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and obstacles to closer U.S.-Armenian commercial ties with Armenian government officials and parliamentarians during a visit to Yerevan on Tuesday.\n\nThe congressional delegation met with Prime Minister Karen Karapetian, parliament speaker Ara Babloyan and several other Armenian lawmakers representing different political parties. The delegation comprised three of the four co-chairs of the Congressional Caucasus on Armenian Issues: Frank Pallone, Jackie Speier and David Valadao.\n\nThe unresolved Karabakh dispute was high on the agenda of the meetings, with Karapetian and Babloayn praising U.S. mediation of Armenian-Azerbaijani peace talks. Both sides agreed on the need for the conflict’s peaceful resolution.\n\nAnna Eshoo, another member of the U.S. delegation, said she and her colleagues stressed the importance of a Karabakh settlement for Armenia’s economic development. “I think that the future of Armenia very much rests on a peaceful resolution,” she told RFE/RL’s Armenian service (Azatutyun.am).\n\nEshoo insisted that a compromise solution to the conflict is possible despite the current deadlock in the negotiation process. “I think that we need to be optimistic,” said the California Democrat.\n\nMost of the visiting lawmakers have strongly supported direct U.S. economic assistance to Karabakh provided for almost two decades. Some of that aid has been spent on humanitarian demining operations conducted by the HALO Trust, a British charity. As recently as two weeks ago the House of Representatives approved $1.5 million in fresh funding for such activities.\n\nValadao, who represents another California constituency home to many Armenian Americans, travelled to Karabakh on Monday to inspect the HALO Trust’s mine-clearing activities. He said in Yerevan that he is not worried about being blacklisted by Azerbaijan for visiting the Armenian-populated territory without Baku’s permission.\n\n“That’s their choice to make those types of decisions,” the Republican congressman told RFE/RL’s Armenian service. “I can’t worry about that.”\n\nThe U.S. lawmakers also spoke with their Armenian colleagues about ways of boosting U.S. investments in Armenia. Eshoo said they stressed the importance of combatting government corruption in the country. “[Corruption] is anathema to American companies,” she said.\n\n“They listened very carefully,” the congresswoman said of the Armenian parliamentarians. “I think it’s important that friends always tell friends the truth.”\n\nThe meeting with Karapetian also touched upon prospects for signing a U.S.-Armenian agreement on the avoidance of double taxation.\n\nAn Armenian deputy minister for transport and communications, Boris Demirkhanian, said such an agreement is especially important for Armenia’s burgeoning information technology (IT) sector when he spoke at the American delegation’s separate meeting with local tech executives. The visiting legislators were briefed on strong U.S. presence in the sector, according to a statement by the Armenian Ministry of Transport, Communications and Information Technology.\n\nThe sector has expanded by an average of over 20 percent annually in the past decade. It is dominated by the Armenian branches of U.S. tech giants like as Synopsys, National Instruments, Mentor Graphics and VMware.",

The country’s President, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party, previously expressed support for equal marriage.\n\nThere is some opposition to the legislation, however, primarily from Western-inspired fundamentalist church groups, who have some influence in the region.\n\nThe anti-LGBT Alliance of Religious Groups for the Love of Families Taiwan has vowed to protest the change.\n\nThe group’s head Chang Shou-yi fumed: “What gay activists want is for their lifestyle to be affirmed by society, but why do they need to change the traditional institution of marriage, which goes back thousands of years?”",
  "latent_26632": "The Reds have claimed first baseman Christian Walker off waivers from the Braves and designated right-hander Jumbo Diaz for assignment in order to clear a spot on the 40-man roster, tweets Zach Buchanan of the Cincinnati Enquirer. Atlanta had just picked up Walker off waivers a couple of weeks ago, but they clearly weren’t able to succeed in passing him through waivers themselves.\n\nWalker, 26 later this month, was long viewed as a potential first base/DH option in the Orioles organization, but both of those spots are blocked in the long-term by Chris Davis and Mark Trumbo. Beyond that, Walker had seen himself leapfrogged by fellow first base/DH prospect Trey Mancini within the Orioles’ ranks.\n\n[Related: Updated Cincinnati Reds Depth Chart]\n\nWalker saw brief cups of coffee with Baltimore in both 2014 and 2015, hitting just .148/.258/.296 in a minuscule sample of 31 plate appearances. And while the former fourth-round pick (2012) has turned in solid overall numbers across parts of three Triple-A campaigns, he’s never exactly exhibited any sort of mastery over upper-level minor league pitching. In 1332 plate appearances with Baltimore’s Triple-A affiliate in Norfolk, Walker has a .260/.324/.429 batting line to go along with 42 homers and 72 doubles.\n\nWhile he’s been primarily a first baseman in his pro career, Walker did spend some time in left field last year (90 games), so he could be an option as a bench bat with Cincinnati. The Reds do have a left-handed-hitting right fielder in Scott Schebler, so Cincinnati could potentially utilize some sort of platoon if the team is comfortable with Walker’s relative lack of corner outfield experience. In that sense, he could be competing with non-roster invitee Ryan Raburn for a roster spot. Additionally, he has a minor league option remaining, so the Reds could simply send him to Louisville to open the season, where he’d serve as a depth option.\n\nAs for Diaz, the 33-year-old posted what looked on the surface to be a solid 3.14 ERA in 43 innings with the Reds last year, but his peripheral numbers painted a less optimistic picture. Diaz posted career-worst marks in K/9 (7.7), BB/9 (4.0), swinging-strike rate (10.4 percent) and average fastball velocity (95.9 mph). He also benefited greatly from a .239 average on balls in play and an 80.4 percent strand rate — both of which seem likely to regress in 2017 and beyond.\n\nOf course, those velocity and swinging-strike rate marks are still better than the league average, so perhaps there’s hope yet that Diaz could rebound and again work as a serviceable middle-relief option. In 138 frames at the Major League level, Diaz sports a 3.65 ERA with a 144-to-51 K/BB ratio and a 43.7 percent ground-ball rate. Given his age and the current juncture of Spring Training, Diaz could certainly clear waivers and remain with the Reds in a non-roster capacity.",
  "latent_26634": "CLOSE For the past 20 years, Congress has relied more on temporary measures to keep the government running. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nThe U.S. Capitol (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats urged President Trump on Monday to back off his demand to begin funding a Southwest border wall, saying it would risk shutting down the government at the end of the week.\n\n\"Instead of risking government shutdown by shoving this wall down Congress' and the American peoples' throats, the president ought to just let us come to an agreement,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a conference call with reporters Monday.\n\nSchumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Democrats and Republicans have been negotiating well on a bill to fund the government beyond midnight Friday, when a stop-gap funding measure is set to expire. Lawmakers are trying to come up with a bill to fund federal agencies through the end of fiscal 2017, which ends on Sept. 30.\n\n\"Our appropriators were well on a path to resolving their differences and finding their common ground, respecting each other's priorities, until the White House intervened,\" Pelosi said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi speaks at her weekly press conference on Capitol Hill on April 6, 2017. (Photo: Aaron P. Bernstein, Getty Images)\n\nTrump has asked Congress to add an emergency funding request for $33 billion to the bill. The president wants $30 billion in extra defense and combat spending and $3 billion more for border security, including about $1.4 billion to begin building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. He also called for $18 billion in cuts to domestic programs to help pay for his priorities.\n\nEarlier this month, Congress appeared to be heading toward agreement on a bill giving Trump about $15 billion of the additional money he wanted for defense while largely ignoring his controversial requests for border wall funding and budget cuts. The Republican-led Congress needs support from Democrats to pass the legislation, and Democrats are fiercely opposed to the wall, which Schumer called \"a pointless waste of taxpayer money.\" Some border-state Republicans, including Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, also have said the wall costs too much and would ultimately prove ineffective.\n\nRepublican leaders had indicated that they would rather wait and fully debate the border wall funding when Congress takes up the 2018 spending bills.\n\nHowever, the White House last week stepped up its demands for immediate border wall funding, suggesting that the president might not sign the bill if the money for the barrier is not included. Building a border wall to reduce illegal immigration was one of Trump's top campaign promises.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Monday that the border wall, border security and defense spending remain Trump's top priorities. But he stopped short of saying the president would veto the bill if the wall was not funded.\n\n\"The president's priorities have been very clear from the beginning,\" Spicer said. \"To pre-judge where it (the bill) ends up at this point is not prudent.\"\n\nSpicer added, \"We feel very confident the government's not going to shut down.\"\n\nIt still wasn't clear Monday exactly what the funding bill will contain. The legislation was expected to be unveiled Tuesday when the House returns from a two-week recess.

  "latent_26764": "Here’s an update to my investigating the story Fox News printed in which they astonishingly suggested that Bulletstorm would cause rape. Scott Steinberg, CEO of TechSavvy Global, and all-round industry guru, got in touch with me to show me the answers he submitted to Fox when they approached him for comment. The full answers are reproduced below, because what results is a fantastic interview on the subject of adult game content and regulation.\n\nFox chose to use none of Steinberg’s comments in their final piece, opting instead for the more sensational claims of those with no expertise in the subject (neither of whom have found time to reply to our emails). But seeing these answers also provides further insight into how the mainstream media coverage of gaming stories works. Far from being a reporter ignorant of the subject and twisted by naive contributors, Fox correspondent John Brandon was equipped with a wealth of factual information and informed opinion before composing his frantic article. The below, combined with our previously reported unedited response from M2 Research’s Billy Pidgeon, show quite how determined the final story was to ignore the facts in favour of scaring its readers.\n\nI am continuing to post on this matter not because I think Fox’s story is unusual for either mainstream gaming coverage (although this is a particularly egregious example), nor indeed for the Fox News house style. And not because I believe Bulletstorm needs defending. (Although I’m proud that we’ve provided a place to restore the reputation of contributors who were completely misrepresented by the selective quoting.) It is because I believe this is an interesting case study of the nature of sensationalist coverage of gaming in the mainstream press. By going deeper on this occasion, it provides a useful reference point. And, as I say above, these answers are superb and well worth a read independently of the Fox nonsense. So here are Steinberg’s (ignored) responses, along with the questions Fox News sent him, in full.\n\nFox News: Is there a line on what is inappropriate in a video game? Should there be?\n\nScott Steinberg: Appropriateness is in the eye of the beholder, but anything that violates the tenets of basic social mores or common decency is doubtless to come under intense scrutiny. Should there be limits on appropriateness in video games? Undoubtedly, but as to what extent, that’s for greater minds to say, given that the true challenge is how to define the boundaries, let alone who’s qualified to delineate them. Many would suggest that anything which promotes an agenda of hate, discrimination, injustice, moral corruption or intolerance would meet the criteria for inappropriate content. But however you slice it, it’s a slippery slope, given what passes for acceptable today at the box office, record store, bookstore and on television – a problem compounded by games’ unique trait of interactivity, which serves to further blur the barriers which keep observers in other mediums one step removed from the action portrayed.\n\nFox: In Bulletstorm, you can shoot people in the privates, wrap them with a spiked chain and pull them in and kill them, and shoot people when drunk — all for extra points. There are also a lot of F-words. Do you think the game goes too far, why or why not?\n\nSteinberg: No – because it’s an unapologetically and straightforwardly satirical game meant for discerning adults that’s written in the vernacular of the times and speaks in a cultural context that’s the same as that its target audience has long been indoctrinated in by mainstream media and pop culture. From Saw to South Park, look at what passes for modern entertainment at the movies or on basic cable, let alone on the Internet – this isn’t the first blockbuster (or big-budget game, for that matter) to aim below the belt or slather on the salty language. Yes, it’s shameless, but also knowingly so, because it actively aims to parody much of both the gaming field and larger cultural zeitgeist’s more asinine elements. The designers make no secret of their intentions, or to whom the title caters – The Oregon Trail, this isn’t. The giant M for Mature rating on the\n\nfront of the box says it all: Only discerning adults need apply.\n\nFox: Is the only answer found in better parenting (telling your own kids they can’t play the game) and ratings boards? Or is there something else that should be done?\n\nSteinberg: The answer, as ever, lies in education: Being acutely aware of what and how your children play, and the manner in which they do so, which requires maintaining an open-minded perspective and taking the time to spend time with your kids, their games and the systems which play these titles. A multitude of resources exist from the ESRB to WhatTheyPlay, FamilyFriendlyVideoGames.com and Common Sense Media, as well as leading review websites such as IGN, GameSpot and 1up, which can help provide more info on today’s top titles, trends and topics. Not only can all help provide insight into children’s interests, motivations and the manner in which they consume game content, but the context needed to help steer them towards other, more appropriate titles which might better fit their age range or pique their interest. As with movies, albums and books featuring explicit content, you can help steer kids towards more viable substitutes that are equally compelling for healthier or more constructive reasons.\n\nFox: Is Bulletstorm one of the more egregious examples are are there a lot of other more violent games?\n\nSteinberg: Like comic books, rock-and-roll and film, video games have long been subject to vilification for their subject matter due to popular misconceptions that they’re meant for children, when in fact the average player is actually a mature, discerning adult in their mid-30s. Accordingly, there’s been a long and storied range of titles featuring graphic and violent content (among other, more mundane subjects and fanciful topics) that speaks to this audience, just as there have been a long and storied range of films and TV shows (see: The Godfather, The Sopranos, every horror movie stocking movie store rental shelves since the ‘70s, etc.) that speak to moviegoers with more adult tastes. From Postal to Grand Theft Auto III to Scarface: The World is Yours, you could cite a grand history of supposedly “egregious” games dating back to the halcyon days of early arcade and computing hits such as Death Race and Leisure Suit Larry. But the reality is that the vast majority of all games produced are perfectly suitable for children and adolescents. BulletStorm just happens to be one of many examples that fall into the category of games for mature audiences, but it’s hardly among the more head-turning ones, as those who’ve played previous outings such as human prey simulator Manhunt 2 can attest.",

As seen here, Lavandeira responded by publishing the missive, along with Wargo's name and her office e-mail address (she worked for a senior living center called Menorah Park).\n\nAccording to a Court of Common Pleas lawsuit filed yesterday by Wargo and her husband, the publication of the e-mail resulted in Wargo receiving 'several hundred emails threatening her and her family' and 'many threatening phone calls to her listed home phone number.' Additionally, Wargo's Menorah Park supervisors were also contacted by angry Perez Hilton readers, some of who posted scathing comments about her on the popular blog. Wargo contends that she was fired as a 'direct result of the negative publicity and ongoing harassing emails and phone calls' triggered by her e-mail with its anti-gay sentiments.\n\n'Indeed, Mrs. Wargo would not have been fired, but for the publication of her email address,' contends the July 14 complaint, which was first reported by Courthouse News. Shortly after Lavandeira posted Wargo's e-mail, a Menorah Park official wrote him to renounce the 'inappropriate' and 'unauthorized communication' sent by Wargo via the firm's e-mail system. Lavandeira appended that e-mail to his original posting of Wargo's note to him. (11 pages)",

It would replace the personal income tax structure -- which is based on a taxpayer's ability to pay -- with a single, low rate and eliminate the \"corporate net worth tax\" (a minimum tax on certain businesses). While the bill's limit on itemized deductions could raise taxes for certain high-income taxpayers, and its increases in the personal and dependent exemptions would help less-affluent filers, its benefits would mostly go to those who are well off, exacerbating the state's high inequality.\n\nThese changes would cost the state between $281 and $442 million annually -- a large price tag which, on the high end, is more than what Georgia spends on pre-k programs, its technical college system, or the Department of Public Health.\n\nThe other bill (SR 756) proposes a constitutional amendment that would gradually cut the income tax. The amendment would require Georgia to cut the top personal income tax rate by 0.1 percentage point in any year in which the general fund met certain revenue and reserve targets. It specifies no minimum \"floor\" for the personal income tax, so the tax ultimately could disappear altogether -- making it nearly impossible for Georgia to pay for high-quality schools and other services without large sales or property tax increases in the future. Should the legislature pass this bill, the amendment would go to the ballot in the fall.\n\nThe experience of other states shows that personal income tax cuts are a poor strategy for economic growth and poorly targeted to support job growth. Georgia would be much better off instead reinvesting in its school system, which has faced some of the worst cuts to state funding nationally in recent years.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Off the Charts, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' blog",

  "latent_27493": "Can Anyone Stop Trump If He Decides to Start a Nuclear War?\n\nPresident Donald Trump won a victory, at least a temporary one, in the simmering crisis on the Korean Peninsula recently when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un backed down on his threats to launch missiles into waters near Guam. The president tweeted that Kim “made a very wise and well reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!”\n\nFor many Americans, however, the North Korean climbdown was less significant than the alarming rhetoric from President Trump in response to North Korea’s missile development in the first place, rhetoric that all but explicitly threatened nuclear confrontation if the North Koreans continued making threats. We’ll leave it to others to debate whether Trump’s rhetoric was tactical or impulsive. The escalating war of words left many observers in the United States concerned not merely with North Korean nuclear weapons and missiles but also with difficult questions about Trump’s control over American nuclear arms.\n\n“In a fit of pique, [if] he decides to do something about Kim Jong Un, there’s actually very little to stop him,” former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday after watching Trump’s speech in Phoenix the night before. “The whole system is built to ensure rapid response if necessary. So there’s very little in the way of controls over exercising a nuclear option, which is pretty damn scary.”\n\nIndeed, it took the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, to remove from the news cycle vexing questions about the wisdom of placing the world’s most powerful nuclear arsenal in the hands of a single individual — or, at least, of this single individual. How can a man who cannot responsibly manage a Twitter account hold the power to destroy the planet? How can a man who cannot convey a consistent message about anything convey a consistent message of nuclear deterrence to an unstable actor with nukes? How can a man as impulsive and vindictive as Trump have his finger, and solely his finger, on the proverbial nuclear button?\n\nAnd unsurprisingly, since the North Korea flare-up began, there has been a flurry of talk about limiting the president’s authority over the nuclear arsenal. The talk raises a sticky set of questions: Is it actually possible to constrain the president’s power over nuclear launch? And if so, is it a good idea?\n\nThe larger North Korea problem — and much of the present crisis — is not President Trump’s fault. It is not Trump’s fault that Kim Jong Un is the murderous leader of a personality-cult state armed with nuclear weapons and a fast-developing missile program. It is not his fault that Kim menaces two allied nations — Japan and South Korea — and is in a position to kill millions of people in one of the world’s great metropolises with artillery only a few miles away. It is not Trump’s fault that Kim is now poised to be able to deliver nuclear weapons to American shores.\n\nIndeed, any president would be facing the same crisis as Trump is today. It is the product of decades of policy since the Korean War that has failed to rein in the Kim dynasty. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush both pursued a North Korea strategy focused on preventing the Hermit Kingdom from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Both failed. Presidents Bush and Barack Obama both subsequently pursued a policy toward the country focused on denuclearization. Both failed. No one has yet offered a good strategy for what to do now. It’s a cliché to say that there are no good options with respect to North Korea — but it’s really true.\n\nOne aspect of the current crisis, however, is entirely Trump’s own doing — namely, his incendiary rhetoric in fueling a situation that needs firm, clear signaling to be managed effectively. Trump’s talk of “fire and fury” — along with his more general bombastic verbal flailing — has raised questions in a lot of people’s minds about the current president’s fitness to oversee the U.S. nuclear arsenal. President Richard Nixon famously articulated the “madman theory,” the notion that creating uncertainty as to the rationality of the nuclear actor offers strategic advantages. As Garrett Graf wrote recently:\n\nThat unilateral launch authority is so powerful, so unchecked, and so scary that, years before Watergate, Nixon had turned it into its own geopolitical strategy, the so-called Madman Theory, with which he threatened the Soviets and the Vietnamese that he might actually be crazy enough to nuke Hanoi—or Moscow—if they didn’t accede to his demands. The “mutually assured destruction” of the Cold War was predicated on the idea that the leaders of both superpowers were rational enough to avoid a war that would end with the destruction of both nations. The Madman Theory forced the world to consider a more frightening option: That the man in charge of the nukes might not be rational at all.\n\nTrump himself has declared that he wants the United States to be less predictable. The trouble is that he has delivered on this convincingly not merely to the North Koreans but also to many of his own compatriots. Indeed, if you’re using public diplomacy and rhetoric as your means of communication, as Trump has been, it is probably not possible to convince only foreign adversaries that you’re on a hair trigger and might go off at any minute. The American public sees it all, too. And many people will respond nervously, as they have with Trump.\n\nIt’s possible, of course, that the entire spectacle was an act. But for present purposes let’s assume that it wasn’t and that the concerns about Trump’s fitness to command the nuclear arsenal are reasonable ones. What, if anything, can be done with this nervousness without denuding the presidency of the vital capacity to protect the country? The answer, rather scarily, is that probably not all that much can be done.\n\nPresidential sole command of the nuclear forces did not develop to make the nuclear trigger more sensitive. To the contrary, it developed — driven largely by Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s — because of the desire not to have field commanders freelance with nuclear weapons. The idea was that because these were not ordinary weapons, the decision to use them was no mere tactical decision to be left to fighting officers. Particularly as it could mean the end of the world, it was something that only a president should be able to order.\n\nThis centralization of power over a particular class of weapons took place in the context of a larger, more controversial migration of power to the president: the drift from Congress to the executive of the power to initiate uses of force to begin with. These two migrations of power, whatever one thinks of them, dovetailed with one another. That is, with the power to go to war migrating laterally between the branches, and the power to use a particular class of weapons migrating vertically within the executive branch, the postwar American presidency suddenly found itself with the ability to escalate a war of words into a nuclear holocaust with essentially no check.\n\nHere, it’s worth considering an arresting comment made a few years ago on a panel at American University by Brad Berenson, who served in the White House Counsel’s office under Bush. The presidency is an office, he said, of terrifying power — power that includes the authority to order a preemptive nuclear strike on Tehran. The only thing, Berenson said, scarier than a president who has such power in his sole command is a president who does not have that power.\n\nAt least in some circumstances, Berenson is clearly right. Consider, for example, the circumstances in which a foreign country has actually launched nuclear weapons against the United States, and there are only minutes before an American city is destroyed. While there is an argument that submarine-based weapons ensure a U.S. retaliatory capability and there is thus no need any longer for an instant response, it is certainly unconstitutional to deprive the commander in chief of the power to respond to an ongoing military operation against the United States. Under these circumstances, where there is no time to go to Congress for approval, there simply has to be some degree of unreviewable presidential power to launch — just as there is unreviewable power to order the military to repel a foreign surprise attack of any other kind.\n\nNow consider circumstances just short of that — where the adversary’s missiles are not yet in the air but their launch is genuinely imminent. Under both domestic constitutional law and international law, a preemptive response is lawful under such circumstances. So to put restrictions on the president’s launch authority in this type of situation would, again, bureaucratize the nation’s defense under time-sensitive crisis conditions. If it did so effectively, it could gravely undermine American deterrence by sending a message to adversaries that the U.S. nuclear capacity is tied up with red tape — at least until someone launches a nuclear strike against the country.\n\nBut there’s also reason to doubt that it would do so effectively. To whom, after all, could Congress give the power to stymie the president on a launch to whom the president could not issue an order and remove that person if he or she does not comply? Imagine if the Saturday Night Massacre took place not over the firing of a special prosecutor but over a nuclear launch order and you begin to see how difficult it would be to limit at least time-sensitive presidential launch orders.\n\nThis aspect, at least, of the president’s power over the nuclear arsenal is almost certainly irremediable by Congress — that is, it inheres in the nature of the presidential office. A case in point is the recent bill proposed by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) that would forbid the president from using the U.S. military to “conduct a first-use nuclear strike unless such strike is conducted pursuant to a declaration of war by Congress that expressly authorizes such strike.” Even if Trump had real-time satellite imagery of North Korea arming an intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead for launch toward California, this bill would prevent nuclear preemption in the absence of congressional action. Imagine dealing with the Cuban missile crisis under such a law.\n\nIt’s easier to imagine restrictions in circumstances where conditions of imminent strike are not present. That is, Congress probably could pass a law preventing the president from, say, on his own ordering an unprovoked nuclear strike against Great Britain — or North Korea — because he felt like it in the absence of an imminent threat. But such a strike is already unlawful; under international law, it’s a resort to force not in self-defense. And under domestic constitutional law, it’s a nondefensive use of force without authorization from Congress. True, there is currently no procedural check on a president who wants to do it, and one could add one. But a president willing to behave unlawfully and order the strike in the first instance is probably willing to ride roughshod over the procedural check as well.\n\nThe more realistic check here is the possibility that military officers might refuse to carry out the unlawful order, a possibility that already exists under current law and that Sarah Grant and Jack Goldsmith have explored in detail on Lawfare. The other check, unfortunately the main one, is presidential sanity — a condition not obviously in play right now.\n\nThe point is that it’s not entirely clear what protections additional legal restrictions would add. Moreover, distinguishing between conditions of imminence and conditions short of imminence is tricky; the executive branch has interpreted the concept of imminence sufficiently expansively that it’s reasonable to expect that regulation of any plausible use of nuclear weapons would either impinge on the space the executive branch regards as its sole domain or would merely redundantly stand for the proposition that the president may not do that which he may not do.\n\nIn the end, presidential sole authority over nuclear weapons is probably still what it ever was: the worst possible option except all the others. Trump is forcing people to think about whether there may be a better way to design controls over the U.S. nuclear arsenal — and if not, what fail-safes there might be for an unlawful launch order. But as with North Korea itself, there are no good answers to these questions. The only way to make the presidency resistant to madmen is not to elect madmen to the office.\n\nPhoto credit: CHIP SOMODEVILLA/Getty Images",
  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nHeat-Spurs Preview\n\nBy BRIAN MAHONEY\n\nPosted Jun 10 2013 7:59PM SAN ANTONIO (AP) Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili sat in mostly stunned silence, all that playoff experience not preparing them for how they felt after two games. They were satisfied, yet shaken. The San Antonio Spurs had taken home-court advantage away from the Miami Heat, but then the reigning champions took them apart. So as they prepared to bring the NBA Finals back home for the first time in seven years, the veterans struggled with how they were supposed to sum up their situation. Getting one in South Florida was an accomplishment, but nothing that provided them any momentum after the Heat's 103-84 victory Sunday in Game 2. \"Not after tonight. I think they regained that,\" Duncan said. \"Obviously we were glad to win a game here in Game 1. Our goal was to get two. But they got the one tonight. We get to go back home. We got a game here. We have three at home, so we're excited about that. But if we play like we did tonight, that's not going to matter.\" The teams took Monday off, with the series resuming Tuesday night. The Spurs will also host Game 4 on Thursday and Game 5 on Sunday. The finals were once as much a part of June as the heat in this city deep in the heart of Texas. San Antonio won four titles in a nine-year span starting in 1999, but hasn't hosted a game in the NBA's championship round since the Spurs took a 2-0 lead over LeBron James and Cleveland in 2007. Here comes James again, needing to win one here - which hasn't been easy for Miami - and not concerned that the finals' 2-3-2 format now gives the advantage to the Spurs. \"It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"Two best teams in the NBA at this point. Both teams have won and can win on each other's floor. So it's not a biggie.\" The Heat are just 3-22 in San Antonio, though they did win this year even while James, Dwyane Wade and Mario Chalmers sat out the late-season meeting. James had no cause for concern after Game 2, which validated his belief that he can depend on his teammates until he gets rolling, as he did late in the third quarter and well into the fourth. But a little doubt seemed to creep into the Spurs' Big Three, unusual for a group that has been there, done that. Duncan, Parker and Ginobili have teamed for 99 postseason victories together, second-most in NBA history, a trio that is well aware of how quickly things can change in the playoffs. They changed really quickly in this series, about the time it took James to turn Tiago Splitter's dunk attempt into a forever finals highlight with a blocked shot. \"Of course if you look at the result, being 1-1, it's not bad. But you don't want to play like this in an NBA Finals,\" Ginobili said. \"You don't want to give them that much confidence, and you feeling bad about yourself.\" Duncan was admittedly awful in Game 2, shooting 3 of 13 for nine points. Parker offset his five baskets in 14 attempts with five turnovers, and Ginobili had three of the Spurs' 17 turnovers that led to 19 points. The Spurs, like every other team in the NBA, know that there's no way to beat the Heat with that kind of ball handling. \"We have to play better. Definitely have to play better,\" Parker said. \"You know, we're playing the defending champs. They're a great team. We knew they were going to come in and play with a lot more energy and play harder. That's what they did tonight. \"So it's always easy to bounce back after a loss, and now it's our turn to see how we're going to handle our loss and how we're going to respond.\" Big Three against Big Three provided plenty of buildup to the series, and Ginobili said the Spurs stand little chance of winning if their trio plays poorly. But James, having seen the Heat not have enough when they were largely just he, Wade and Chris Bosh two years ago, insists his current team is deep enough to do big damage even when it doesn't come from the big names. \"I think the supporting cast is really why both teams are here,\" James said. \"They've been making an impact all year long, and they feel like their supporting cast is better. We feel like our supporting cast is better. It's who goes out and do it each and every night to help seal wins.\" The Spurs are shooting just 41 percent and averaging 88 points in the series, perhaps lucky to not be down 2-0. Duncan, the three-time NBA Finals MVP who always seemed to be more reliable the later in the season it was, has made only 11-of-32 shots. \"Obviously, they're contested shots, but they're the shots I feel I can make. So whether it be them or me or whatever it may be, I'm going to get back in the gym tomorrow and hopefully come out with a better stroke,\" he said. \"But I'm getting the shots I want. I just have to knock them down.\"\n\nCopyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

Either undrafted or unwanted, they were once more likely to be found playing in summer league or some other country than against the mighty Miami Heat. On Tuesday, they led the San Antonio Spurs to one of the best-shooting, biggest blowouts in NBA Finals history. Green made seven of the Spurs' finals-record 16 3-pointers, Tim Duncan had 12 points and 14 rebounds, and the Spurs clobbered the Heat 113-77 on Tuesday night to take 2-1 lead in the series. Green scored 27 points and Gary Neal made six 3-pointers while scoring 24 as San Antonio went 16 of 32 from behind the arc, rolling to the third-biggest victory in finals history. \"Those guys shot incredibly,\" Duncan said. \"Gave us the breathing room when we needed it.\" Neal could be even more important going forward, after starting point guard Tony Parker revealed fresh concerns about his sore hamstring. He plans to get an MRI on Wednesday. Duncan bounced back from his worst game ever in the finals, and the Spurs' combination of fresh faces and old reliables dominated the NBA's winningest team before an eager crowd that hadn't seen the finals here since 2007. \"It shouldn't be a surprise,\" said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. \"These are the last two teams standing. I don't think either one of them is going to get down if they have a bad night.\" The Spurs were as good as fans remembered in the old days, shutting down James until they had built a huge lead late in the third quarter. James finished with 15 points and 11 rebounds, but missed 11 of his first 13 shots against the excellent defense of Kawhi Leonard, who had 14 points and 12 rebounds. \"Honestly, I just have to play better,\" James said. \"I can't have a performance like tonight and expect to win.\" Game 4 is Thursday here, where the Heat are 3-22 in the regular season and so far zero wins and one really bad beating in the postseason. \"We got what we deserved,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"I didn't even recognize the team that was out there tonight.\" Duncan shot 3 of 13 for nine points, his worst performance ever in his 25 NBA Finals games, in the Heat's 103-84 victory Sunday. Parker wasn't much better, shooting 5 of 14 and committing five turnovers, and Manu Ginobili admitted afterward the veteran trio had to play well for the Spurs to win. They were fine, but the lesser-knowns were better. Parker and Ginobili combined for 14 assists, but the bigger story was the guys who had never played on this stage before. - Neal, who went undrafted after playing for LaSalle and Towson, then playing overseas for three seasons in Italy, Spain and Turkey. -Green, who had been cut multiple times - including by James' Cavaliers - and now has the shot to stick. -Leonard, the draft-night trade acquisition from San Diego State who played the NBA's four-time MVP to a stalemate. \"It's a dream come true,\" Neal said. \"Me and Danny both went through a lot of stuff together. We were guys that showed up two hours before practice started to get shots up and to prove to the coaching staff that we belong, and we're going to do whatever we need to do to get minutes. \"So me and Danny, we were able to play great tonight.\" Mike Miller made all five 3-pointers and scored 15 points for the Heat, who broke open Sunday's game and seized momentum in the series with a 33-5 run in the second half. The Spurs seized it right back, improving to 18-7 in the finals, the best winning percentage of any team with 20 or more games. A brief flurry by James had Miami within 15 after three quarters, but Neal, Green and Leonard combined on a 13-0 run to open the fourth, Green's 3-pointer making it 91-63. \"All of my teammates and Pop. They do a great job of encouraging me. They continue to tell me to shoot the ball. They continue to tell me whenever I'm open, to let it fly,\" Green said. The NBA hadn't made its way along San Antonio's River Walk this late in the season since 2007, and fans couldn't wait to have the Spurs back. They sang and danced and clapped around the concourse and in their seats, as if their favorite rock band had returned for a concert. And they were thrilled to see the Duncan they recognized from his first 24 finals appearances. He got right on the board in this one, with a short jumper 20 seconds into the game. The Spurs, who had played from behind most of the series, had a 24-20 lead after making 11 of 18 shots in the first quarter. Duncan hit a pair of three throws and another basket, and after a jumper by Neal, he threw a long outlet to Leonard for a dunk that made it 40-30. Neal's 3 made it 43-32, but Miller hit a pair of 3-pointers in a 12-1 run that tied it at 44 with 37 seconds in the half, the Heat appearing set to go into the half with momentum. But Parker drilled a 3 from the corner, and after Green blocked James' shot, the Spurs rushed it up for a 3-pointer by Neal that fell at the buzzer, the reserve guard pointing back toward his defenders before the Spurs headed to the locker room with a 50-44 advantage. The party played on all right, with a huge roar when Tracy McGrady, a former perennial All-Star now in his first finals appearance as a member of the Spurs' bench, checked in midway through the fourth quarter. He was scoreless with three assists. James started 2 for 13, then made his final four shots of the third as the Heat got within 13 before Ginobili fired a nifty pass to Tiago Splitter under the basket for a score with 0.1 seconds remaining, making it 78-63 and setting the stage for the big fourth-quarter finish. \"They came out in the third quarter and they kicked our butt pretty good and frustration started to set in,\" the Heat's Dwyane Wade said. It was a potentially pivotal victory for the Spurs in their quest to go 5 for 5 in the finals. Since the NBA Finals went to a 2-3-2 format in 1985, the Game 3 winner when the series was tied 1-1 has gone on to win 12 of the 13 titles - though the Heat were the lone one that didn't, in 2011. Notes: The previous NBA Finals record for a team was 14 3-pointers, held by three teams. ... Miami's first victory in San Antonio came on Dec. 23, 1996, in its 11th try. David Robinson broke his left foot in the second quarter of the Heat's 90-79 victory, missed the rest of the season, and the Spurs fell into the lottery, which they ended up winning so they could take Duncan with the No. 1 pick in the 1997 draft.\n\nCopyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27666": "The new chair of the TTC is moving to reverse service cuts passed under her predecessor, mayoral candidate Karen Stintz.\n\nCouncillor Maria Augimeri was appoitned to the transit commission board in February after Stintz stepped down to run for mayor. Under Stintz's tenure, in 2012 bus and streetcar service was cut when Mayor Rob Ford directed that all city departments slash their budgets by 10 per cent.\n\nService was reduced on 35 routes during peak periods and 36 routes during off-peak periods. Crowding standards across the entire system were lowered to allow the commission to pack more people onto less vehicles that often came less frequently.\n\nOn some routes, wait times increased by over six minutes and some service during less busy times of the day was eliminated altogether.\n\nAt the time, the service reductions were projected to save the TTC $14 million.\n\nAt the board's meeting next Wednesday, Augimeri plans to introduce motions asking the commission for a report on reinstitution some of those lost services, starting next year. According to draft wording obtained by NOW, one motion asks staff to look into \"improving service levels and quality in the form of more frequent service and reduced crowding.\"\n\nThe same motion asks for a report on introducing new services like more express buses and a \"network of ten-minute-or-better bus routes,\" as well as the possibility of extending the life of the current streetcar fleet.\n\nA second motion asks for a report on whether buses normally used for construction-related route changes could become available next year during the Pan-Am Games moratorium on roadwork. Augimeri hopes the vehicles can be redeployed to enhance service on existing routes.\n\n\"I opposed the service cuts when they were proposed in 2011 and ever since,\" she says. \"When I was elected chair, I promised a focus on TTC operations, and I am delivering on that promise.\"\n\n\"It is crazy to cut buses and streetcars on a system where people are increasingly packed in like sardines,\" she adds.\n\nThe cost to reverse the cuts is unknown, but it's not simply a matter of running vehicles more frequently. Additional drivers and maintenance workers might have to be hired and trained, and it's unclear if the TTC has enough vehicles to increase service.\n\nAsked how she hopes to fund the service improvements, Augimeri says that will be up to the next term of council. Final decisions on the reports won't be made until after the October 27 municipal election under a new TTC board. Augimeri has said she will not seek to be re-appointed as TTC chair if she's re-elected to council next term.\n\nStintz, who still sits on the board, declined an interview request because she had not seen the proposed motions.\n\nCouncillor Gord Perks, who before joining council pushed the TTC to adopt the service-boosting Ridership Growth Strategy, supports Augimeri's move. He says debates over major projects like the relief subway line shouldn't overshadow the need to invest in surface routes.\n\n\"If we're going to continue to grow and accommodate all the new people and new jobs that are coming into the city of Toronto, we absolutely need more people to take transit,\" he says. \"But they're only going to do it if you make the service attractive. And the best way to do that is boring, plain vanilla investing in frequent service and a dense network of bus service.\"\n\nAlan Heisey, one of the citizen members on the TTC board, has yet to see Augimeri's motions but he supports the idea behind them.\n\n\"We don't have many empty seats at rush hour, if any,\" he says. \"And I think there's a case to be made that we need more capacity in surface transit. I'd be very supportive of a debate for the need to do that.\"\n\nHeisey believes that the funding can be found if politicians are serious about improving transit.\n\n\"I'm almost 60. When I was a boy and a young man there was no shortage of money for capital and public transit. It was provided mainly by the provincial government,\" he says. \"It's not about enough money, it's about lack of political will.\"",

  "latent_27722": "Kernel Heap\n\nNo longer updated! You are viewing the a post of the first edition of “Writing an OS in Rust”, which is no longer updated. You can find the second edition You are viewing the a post of the first edition of “Writing an OS in Rust”, which is no longer updated. You can find the second edition here\n\nIn the previous posts we created a frame allocator and a page table module. Now we are ready to create a kernel heap and a memory allocator. Thus, we will unlock Box , Vec , BTreeMap , and the rest of the alloc crate.\n\nAs always, you can find the complete source code on GitHub. Please file issues for any problems, questions, or improvement suggestions. There is also a comment section at the end of this page.\n\nThe heap is the memory area for long-lived allocations. The programmer can access it by using types like Box or Vec. Behind the scenes, the compiler manages that memory by inserting calls to some memory allocator. By default, Rust links to the jemalloc allocator (for binaries) or the system allocator (for libraries). However, both rely on system calls such as sbrk and are thus unusable in our kernel. So we need to create and link our own allocator.\n\nA good allocator is fast and reliable. It also effectively utilizes the available memory and keeps fragmentation low. Furthermore, it works well for concurrent applications and scales to any number of processors. It even optimizes the memory layout with respect to the CPU caches to improve cache locality and avoid false sharing.\n\nThese requirements make good allocators pretty complex. For example, jemalloc has over 30.000 lines of code. This complexity is out of scope for our kernel, so we will create a much simpler allocator. Nevertheless, it should suffice for the foreseeable future, since we'll allocate only when it's absolutely necessary.\n\n🔗 The Allocator Interface\n\nThe allocator interface in Rust is defined through the Alloc trait, which looks like this:\n\npub unsafe trait Alloc { unsafe fn alloc( &mut self, layout: Layout) -> Result< *mut u8 , AllocErr>; unsafe fn dealloc( &mut self, ptr: *mut u8 , layout: Layout); […] // about 13 methods with default implementations }\n\nThe alloc method should allocate a memory block with the size and alignment given through Layout parameter. The deallocate method should free such memory blocks again. Both methods are unsafe , as is the trait itself. This has different reasons:\n\nImplementing the Alloc trait is unsafe, because the implementation must satisfy a set of contracts. Among other things, pointers returned by alloc must point to valid memory and adhere to the Layout requirements.\n\ntrait is unsafe, because the implementation must satisfy a set of contracts. Among other things, pointers returned by must point to valid memory and adhere to the requirements. Calling alloc is unsafe because the caller must ensure that the passed layout does not have size zero. I think this is because of compatibility reasons with existing C-allocators, where zero-sized allocations are undefined behavior.\n\nis unsafe because the caller must ensure that the passed layout does not have size zero. I think this is because of compatibility reasons with existing C-allocators, where zero-sized allocations are undefined behavior. Calling dealloc is unsafe because the caller must guarantee that the passed parameters adhere to the contract. For example, ptr must denote a valid memory block allocated via this allocator.\n\nTo set the system allocator, the global_allocator attribute can be added to a static that implements Alloc for a shared reference of itself. For example:\n\n#[global_allocator] static MY_ALLOCATOR : MyAllocator = MyAllocator { ... }; impl < 'a > Alloc for &'a MyAllocator { unsafe fn alloc( &mut self, layout: Layout) -> Result< *mut u8 , AllocErr> { ... } unsafe fn dealloc( &mut self, ptr: *mut u8 , layout: Layout) { ... } }\n\nNote that Alloc needs to be implemented for &MyAllocator , not for MyAllocator . The reason is that the alloc and dealloc methods require mutable self references, but there's no way to get such a reference safely from a static . By requiring implementations for &MyAllocator , the global allocator interface avoids this problem and pushes the burden of synchronization onto the user.\n\n🔗 Including the alloc crate\n\nThe Alloc trait is part of the alloc crate, which like core is a subset of Rust's standard library. Apart from the trait, the crate also contains the standard types that require allocations such as Box , Vec and Arc . We can include it through a simple extern crate :\n\n// in src/lib.rs #![feature(alloc)] // the alloc crate is still unstable [ ... ] #[macro_use] extern crate alloc;\n\nWe don't need to add anything to our Cargo.toml, since the alloc crate is part of the standard library and shipped with the Rust compiler. The alloc crate provides the format! and vec! macros, so we use #[macro_use] to import them.\n\nWhen we try to compile our crate now, the following error occurs:\n\nerror[E0463]: can't find crate for `alloc` --> src/lib.rs:10:1 | 16 | extern crate alloc; | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ can't find crate\n\nThe problem is that xargo only cross compiles libcore by default. To also cross compile the alloc crate, we need to create a file named Xargo.toml in our project root (right next to the Cargo.toml ) with the following content:\n\n[ target.x86_64-blog_os.dependencies ] alloc = {}\n\nThis instructs xargo that we also need alloc . It still doesn't compile, since we need to define a global allocator in order to use the alloc crate:\n\nerror: no #[default_lib_allocator] found but one is required; is libstd not linked?\n\n🔗 A Bump Allocator\n\nFor our first allocator, we start simple. We create a memory::heap_allocator module containing a so-called bump allocator:\n\n// in src/memory/mod.rs mod heap_allocator; // in src/memory/heap_allocator.rs use alloc::heap::{Alloc, AllocErr, Layout}; /// A simple allocator that allocates memory linearly and ignores freed memory. #[derive(Debug)] pub struct BumpAllocator { heap_start: usize , heap_end: usize , next: usize , } impl BumpAllocator { pub const fn new(heap_start: usize , heap_end: usize ) -> Self { Self { heap_start, heap_end, next: heap_start } } } unsafe impl Alloc for BumpAllocator { unsafe fn alloc( &mut self, layout: Layout) -> Result< *mut u8 , AllocErr> { let alloc_start = align_up(self.next, layout.align()); let alloc_end = alloc_start.saturating_add(layout.size()); if alloc_end <= self.heap_end { self.next = alloc_end; Ok(alloc_start as *mut u8 ) } else { Err(AllocErr::Exhausted{ request: layout }) } } unsafe fn dealloc( &mut self, ptr: *mut u8 , layout: Layout) { // do nothing, leak memory } }\n\nWe also need to add #![feature(allocator_api)] to our lib.rs , since the allocator API is still unstable.\n\nThe heap_start and heap_end fields contain the start and end address of our kernel heap. The next field contains the next free address and is increased after every allocation. To allocate a memory block we align the next address using the align_up function (described below). Then we add up the desired size and make sure that we don't exceed the end of the heap. We use a saturating add so that the alloc_end cannot overflow, which could lead to an invalid allocation. If everything goes well, we update the next address and return a pointer to the start address of the allocation. Else, we return None .\n\nIn order to simplify alignment, we add align_down and align_up functions:\n\n/// Align downwards. Returns the greatest x with alignment `align` /// so that x <= addr. The alignment must be a power of 2. pub fn align_down(addr: usize , align: usize ) -> usize { if align.is_power_of_two() { addr & ! (align - 1 ) } else if align == 0 { addr } else { panic!( \"`align` must be a power of 2\" ); } } /// Align upwards. Returns the smallest x with alignment `align` /// so that x >= addr. The alignment must be a power of 2. pub fn align_up(addr: usize , align: usize ) -> usize { align_down(addr + align - 1 , align) }\n\nLet's start with align_down : If the alignment is a valid power of two (i.e. in {1,2,4,8,…} ), we use some bitwise operations to return the aligned address. It works because every power of two has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. For example, the numbers {1,2,4,8,…} are {1,10,100,1000,…} in binary. By subtracting 1 we get {0,01,011,0111,…} . These binary numbers have a 1 at exactly the positions that need to be zeroed in addr . For example, the last 3 bits need to be zeroed for a alignment of 8.\n\nTo align addr , we create a bitmask from align-1 . We want a 0 at the position of each 1 , so we invert it using ! . After that, the binary numbers look like this: {…11111,…11110,…11100,…11000,…} . Finally, we zero the correct bits using a binary AND .\n\nAligning upwards is simple now. We just increase addr by align-1 and call align_down . We add align-1 instead of align because we would otherwise waste align bytes for already aligned addresses.\n\n🔗 Reusing Freed Memory\n\nThe heap memory is limited, so we should reuse freed memory for new allocations. This sounds simple, but is not so easy in practice since allocations can live arbitrarily long (and can be freed in an arbitrary order). This means that we need some kind of data structure to keep track of which memory areas are free and which are in use. This data structure should be very optimized since it causes overheads in both space (i.e. it needs backing memory) and time (i.e. accessing and organizing it needs CPU cycles).\n\nOur bump allocator only keeps track of the next free memory address, which doesn't suffice to keep track of freed memory areas. So our only choice is to ignore deallocations and leak the corresponding memory. Thus our allocator quickly runs out of memory in a real system, but it suffices for simple testing. Later in this post, we will introduce a better allocator that does not leak freed memory.\n\n🔗 Using it as System Allocator\n\nAbove we saw that we can use a static allocator as system allocator through the global_allocator attribute:\n\n#[global_allocator] static ALLOCATOR : MyAllocator = MyAllocator { ... };\n\nThis requires an implementation of Alloc for &MyAllocator , i.e. a shared reference. If we try to add such an implementation for our bump allocator ( unsafe impl<'a> Alloc for &'a BumpAllocator ), we have a problem: Our alloc method requires updating the next field, which is not possible for a shared reference.\n\nOne solution could be to put the bump allocator behind a Mutex and wrap it into a new type, for which we can implement Alloc for a shared reference:\n\nstruct LockedBumpAllocator(Mutex<BumpAllocator>); impl < 'a > Alloc for &'a LockedBumpAllocator { unsafe fn alloc( &mut self, layout: Layout) -> Result< *mut u8 , AllocErr> { self. 0. lock().alloc(layout) } unsafe fn dealloc( &mut self, ptr: *mut u8 , layout: Layout) { self. 0. lock().dealloc(ptr, layout) } }\n\nHowever, there is a more interesting solution for our bump allocator that avoids locking alltogether. The idea is to exploit that we only need to update a single usize field byusing an AtomicUsize type. This type uses special synchronized hardware instructions to ensure data race freedom without requiring locks.\n\n🔗 A lock-free Bump Allocator\n\nA lock-free implementation looks like this:\n\nuse core::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering}; /// A simple allocator that allocates memory linearly and ignores freed memory. #[derive(Debug)] pub struct BumpAllocator { heap_start: usize , heap_end: usize , next: AtomicUsize, } impl BumpAllocator { pub const fn new(heap_start: usize , heap_end: usize ) -> Self { // NOTE: requires adding #![feature(const_atomic_usize_new)] to lib.rs Self { heap_start, heap_end, next: AtomicUsize::new(heap_start) } } } unsafe impl < 'a > Alloc for &'a BumpAllocator { unsafe fn alloc( &mut self, layout: Layout) -> Result< *mut u8 , AllocErr> { loop { // load current state of the `next` field let current_next = self.next.load(Ordering::Relaxed); let alloc_start = align_up(current_next, layout.align()); let alloc_end = alloc_start.saturating_add(layout.size()); if alloc_end <= self.heap_end { // update the `next` pointer if it still has the value `current_next` let next_now = self.next.compare_and_swap(current_next, alloc_end, Ordering::Relaxed); if next_now == current_next { // next address was successfully updated, allocation succeeded return Ok(alloc_start as *mut u8 ); } } else { return Err(AllocErr::Exhausted{ request: layout }) } } } unsafe fn dealloc( &mut self, ptr: *mut u8 , layout: Layout) { // do nothing, leak memory } }\n\nThe implementation is a bit more complicated now. First, there is now a loop around the whole method body, since we might need multiple tries until we succeed (e.g. if multiple threads try to allocate at the same time). Also, the loads operation is an explicit method call now, i.e. self.next.load(Ordering::Relaxed) instead of just self.next . The ordering parameter makes it possible to restrict the automatic instruction reordering performed by both the compiler and the CPU itself. For example, it is used when implementing locks to ensure that no write to the locked variable happens before the lock is acquired. We don't have such requirements, so we use the less restrictive Relaxed ordering.\n\nThe heart of this lock-free method is the compare_and_swap call that updates the next address:\n\n... let next_now = self.next.compare_and_swap(current_next, alloc_end, Ordering::Relaxed); if next_now == current_next { // next address was successfully updated, allocation succeeded return Ok(alloc_start as *mut u8 ); } ...\n\nCompare-and-swap is a special CPU instruction that updates a variable with a given value if it still contains the value we expect. If it doesn't, it means that another thread updated the value simultaneously, so we need to try again. The important feature is that this happens in a single uninteruptible operation (thus the name atomic ), so no partial updates or intermediate states are possible.\n\nIn detail, compare_and_swap works by comparing next with the first argument and, in case they're equal, updates next with the second parameter (the previous value is returned). To find out whether a switch happened, we check the returned previous value of next . If it is equal to the first parameter, the values were swapped. Otherwise, we try again in the next loop iteration.\n\n🔗 Setting the Global Allocator\n\nNow we can define a static bump allocator, that we can set as system allocator:\n\npub const HEAP_START : usize = 0o_000_001_000_000_0000 ; pub const HEAP_SIZE : usize = 100 * 1024 ; // 100 KiB #[global_allocator] static HEAP_ALLOCATOR : BumpAllocator = BumpAllocator::new( HEAP_START , HEAP_START + HEAP_SIZE );\n\nWe use 0o_000_001_000_000_0000 as heap start address, which is the address starting at the second P3 entry. It doesn't really matter which address we choose here as long as it's unused. We use a heap size of 100 KiB, which should be large enough for the near future.\n\nPutting the above in the memory::heap_allocator module would make most sense, but unfortunately there is currently a weird bug in the global allocator implementation that requires putting the global allocator in the root module. I hope it's fixed soon, but until then we need to put the above lines in src/lib.rs . For that, we need to make the memory::heap_allocator module public and add an import for BumpAllocator . We also need to add the #![feature(global_allocator)] at the top of our lib.rs , since the global_allocator attribute is still unstable.\n\nThat's it! We have successfully created and linked a custom system allocator. Now we're ready to test it.\n\nWe should be able to allocate memory on the heap now. Let's try it in our rust_main :\n\n// in rust_main in src/lib.rs use alloc::boxed::Box; let heap_test = Box::new( 42 );\n\nWhen we run it, a triple fault occurs and causes permanent rebooting. Let's try debug it using QEMU and objdump as described in the previous post:\n\n> qemu-system-x86_64 -d int -no-reboot -cdrom build/os-x86_64.iso … check_exception old: 0xffffffff new 0xe 0: v=0e e=0002 i=0 cpl=0 IP=0008:0000000000102860 pc=0000000000102860 SP=0010:0000000000116af0 CR2=0000000040000000 …\n\nAha! It's a page fault ( v=0e ) and was caused by the code at 0x102860 . The code tried to write ( e=0002 ) to address 0x40000000 . This address is 0o_000_001_000_000_0000 in octal, which is the HEAP_START address defined above. Of course it page-faults: We have forgotten to map the heap memory to some physical memory.\n\n🔗 Some Refactoring\n\nIn order to map the heap cleanly, we do a bit of refactoring first. We move all memory initialization from our rust_main to a new memory::init function. Now our rust_main looks like this:\n\n// in src/lib.rs #[no_mangle] pub extern \"C\" fn rust_main(multiboot_information_address: usize ) { // ATTENTION: we have a very small stack and no guard page vga_buffer::clear_screen(); println!( \"Hello World {} \" , \"!\" ); let boot_info = unsafe { multiboot2::load(multiboot_information_address) }; enable_nxe_bit(); enable_write_protect_bit(); // set up guard page and map the heap pages memory::init(boot_info); use alloc::boxed::Box; let heap_test = Box::new( 42 ); println!( \"It did not crash!\" ); loop {} }\n\nThe memory::init function looks like this:\n\n// in src/memory/mod.rs use multiboot2::BootInformation; pub fn init(boot_info: & BootInformation) { let memory_map_tag = boot_info.memory_map_tag().expect( \"Memory map tag required\" ); let elf_sections_tag = boot_info.elf_sections_tag().expect( \"Elf sections tag required\" ); let kernel_start = elf_sections_tag.sections() .filter(|s| s.is_allocated()).map(|s| s.addr).min().unwrap(); let kernel_end = elf_sections_tag.sections() .filter(|s| s.is_allocated()).map(|s| s.addr + s.size).max() .unwrap(); println!( \"kernel start: {:#x} , kernel end: {:#x} \" , kernel_start, kernel_end); println!( \"multiboot start: {:#x} , multiboot end: {:#x} \" , boot_info.start_address(), boot_info.end_address()); let mut frame_allocator = AreaFrameAllocator::new( kernel_start as usize , kernel_end as usize , boot_info.start_address(), boot_info.end_address(), memory_map_tag.memory_areas()); paging::remap_the_kernel( &mut frame_allocator, boot_info); }\n\nWe've just moved the code to a new function. However, we've sneaked some improvements in:\n\nAn additional .filter(|s| s.is_allocated()) in the calculation of kernel_start and kernel_end . This ignores all sections that aren't loaded to memory (such as debug sections). Thus, the kernel end address is no longer artifically increased by such sections.\n\nin the calculation of and . This ignores all sections that aren't loaded to memory (such as debug sections). Thus, the kernel end address is no longer artifically increased by such sections. We use the start_address() and end_address() methods of boot_info instead of calculating the adresses manually.\n\nand methods of instead of calculating the adresses manually. We use the alternate {:#x} form when printing kernel/multiboot addresses. Before, we used 0x{:x} , which leads to the same result. For a complete list of these “alternate” formatting forms, check out the std::fmt documentation.\n\nIt is important that the memory::init function is called only once, because it creates a new frame allocator based on kernel and multiboot start/end. When we call it a second time, a new frame allocator is created that reassigns the same frames, even if they are already in use.\n\nIn the second call it would use an identical frame allocator to remap the kernel. The remap_the_kernel function would request a frame from the frame allocator to create a new page table. But the returned frame is already in use, since we used it to create our current page table in the first call. In order to initialize the new table, the function zeroes it. This is the point where everything breaks, since we zero our current page table. The CPU is unable to read the next instruction and throws a page fault.\n\nSo we need to ensure that memory::init can be only called once. We could mark it as unsafe , which would bring it in line with Rust's memory safety rules. However, that would just push the unsafety to the caller. The caller can still accidentally call the function twice, the only difference is that the mistake needs to happen inside unsafe blocks.\n\nA better solution is to insert a check at the function's beginning, that panics if the function is called a second time. This approach has a small runtime cost, but we only call it once, so it's negligible. And we avoid two unsafe blocks (one at the calling site and one at the function itself), which is always good.\n\nIn order to make such checks easy, I created a small crate named once. To add it, we run cargo add once and add the following to our src/lib.rs :\n\n// in src/lib.rs #[macro_use] extern crate once;\n\nThe crate provides an assert_has_not_been_called! macro (sorry for the long name :D). We can use it to fix the safety problem easily:\n\n// in src/memory/mod.rs pub fn init(boot_info: & BootInformation) { assert_has_not_been_called!( \"memory::init must be called only once\" ); let memory_map_tag = ... ... }\n\nThat's it. Now our memory::init function can only be called once. The macro works by creating a static AtomicBool named CALLED , which is initialized to false . When the macro is invoked, it checks the value of CALLED and sets it to true . If the value was already true before, the macro panics.\n\n🔗 Mapping the Heap\n\nNow we're ready to map the heap pages. In order to do it, we need access to the ActivePageTable or Mapper instance (see the page table and kernel remapping posts). For that we return it from the paging::remap_the_kernel function:\n\n// in src/memory/paging/mod.rs pub fn remap_the_kernel<A>(allocator: &mut A, boot_info: & BootInformation) -> ActivePageTable // new where A: FrameAllocator { ... println!( \"guard page at {:#x} \" , old_p4_page.start_address()); active_table // new }\n\nNow we have full page table access in the memory::init function. This allows us to map the heap pages to physical frames:\n\n// in src/memory/mod.rs pub fn init(boot_info: & BootInformation) { ... let mut frame_allocator = ... ; // below is the new part let mut active_table = paging::remap_the_kernel( &mut frame_allocator, boot_info); use self::paging::Page; use { HEAP_START , HEAP_SIZE }; let heap_start_page = Page::containing_address( HEAP_START ); let heap_end_page = Page::containing_address( HEAP_START + HEAP_SIZE - 1 ); for page in Page::range_inclusive(heap_start_page, heap_end_page) { active_table.map(page, paging:: WRITABLE , &mut frame_allocator); } }\n\nThe Page::range_inclusive function is just a copy of the Frame::range_inclusive function:\n\n// in src/memory/paging/mod.rs #[derive(…, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)] pub struct Page {...} impl Page { ... pub fn range_inclusive(start: Page, end: Page) -> PageIter { PageIter { start: start, end: end, } } } pub struct PageIter { start: Page, end: Page, } impl Iterator for PageIter { type Item = Page; fn next( &mut self) -> Option<Page> { if self.start <= self.end { let page = self.start; self.start.number += 1 ; Some(page) } else { None } } }\n\nNow we map the whole heap to physical pages. This needs some time and might introduce a noticeable delay when we increase the heap size in the future. Another drawback is that we consume a large amount of physical frames even though we might not need the whole heap space. We will fix these problems in a future post by mapping the pages lazily.\n\nNow Box and Vec should work. For example:\n\n// in rust_main in src/lib.rs use alloc::boxed::Box; let mut heap_test = Box::new( 42 ); * heap_test -= 15 ; let heap_test2 = Box::new( \"hello\" ); println!( \" {:?} {:?} \" , heap_test, heap_test2); let mut vec_test = vec![ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]; vec_test[ 3 ] = 42 ; for i in & vec_test { print!( \" {} \" , i); }\n\nWe can also use all other types of the alloc crate, including:\n\nthe reference counted pointers Rc and Arc\n\nthe owned string type String and the format! macro\n\nLinked List\n\nthe growable ring buffer VecDeque\n\nBinaryHeap\n\nBTreeMap and BTreeSet\n\n🔗 A better Allocator\n\nRight now, we leak every freed memory block. Thus, we run out of memory quickly, for example, by creating a new String in each iteration of a loop:\n\n// in rust_main in src/lib.rs for i in 0 .. 10000 { format!( \"Some String\" ); }\n\nTo fix this, we need to create an allocator that keeps track of freed memory blocks and reuses them if possible. This introduces some challenges:\n\nWe need to keep track of a possibly unlimited number of freed blocks. For example, an application could allocate n one-byte sized blocks and free every second block, which creates n/2 freed blocks. We can't rely on any upper bound of freed block since n could be arbitrarily large.\n\none-byte sized blocks and free every second block, which creates freed blocks. We can't rely on any upper bound of freed block since could be arbitrarily large. We can't use any of the collections from above, since they rely on allocations themselves. (It might be possible as soon as RFC #1398 is implemented, which allows user-defined allocators for specific collection instances.)\n\nWe need to merge adjacent freed blocks if possible. Otherwise, the freed memory is no longer usable for large allocations. We will discuss this point in more detail below.\n\nOur allocator should search the set of freed blocks quickly and keep fragmentation low.\n\n🔗 Creating a List of freed Blocks\n\nWhere do we store the information about an unlimited number of freed blocks? We can't use any fixed size data structure since it could always be too small for some allocation sequences. So we need some kind of dynamically growing set.\n\nOne possible solution could be to use an array-like data structure that starts at some unused virtual address. If the array becomes full, we increase its size and map new physical frames as backing storage. This approach would require a large part of the virtual address space since the array could grow significantly. We would need to create a custom implementation of a growable array and manipulate the page tables when deallocating. It would also consume a possibly large number of physical frames as backing storage.\n\nWe will choose another solution with different tradoffs. It's not clearly “better” than the approach above and has significant disadvantages itself. However, it has one big advantage: It does not need any additional physical or virtual memory at all. This makes it less complex since we don't need to manipulate any page tables. The idea is the following:\n\nA freed memory block is not used anymore and no one needs the stored information. It is still mapped to a virtual address and backed by a physical page. So we just store the information about the freed block in the block itself. We keep a pointer to the first block and store a pointer to the next block in each block. Thus, we create a single linked list:\n\nIn the following, we call a freed block a hole. Each hole stores its size and a pointer to the next hole. If a hole is larger than needed, we leave the remaining memory unused. By storing a pointer to the first hole, we are able to traverse the complete list.\n\nWhen the heap is created, all of its memory is unused. Thus, it forms a single large hole:\n\nThe optional pointer to the next hole is set to None .\n\nIn order to allocate a block of memory, we need to find a hole that satisfies the size and alignment requirements. If the found hole is larger than required, we split it into two smaller holes. For example, when we allocate a 24 byte block right after initialization, we split the single hole into a hole of size 24 and a hole with the remaining size:\n\nThen we use the new 24 byte hole to perform the allocation:\n\nTo find a suitable hole, we can use several search strategies:\n\nbest fit : Search the whole list and choose the smallest hole that satisfies the requirements.\n\n: Search the whole list and choose the smallest hole that satisfies the requirements. worst fit : Search the whole list and choose the largest hole that satisfies the requirements.\n\n: Search the whole list and choose the largest hole that satisfies the requirements. first fit: Search the list from the beginning and choose the first hole that satisfies the requirements.\n\nEach strategy has its advantages and disadvantages. Best fit uses the smallest hole possible and leaves larger holes for large allocations. But splitting the smallest hole might create a tiny hole, which is too small for most allocations. In contrast, the worst fit strategy always chooses the largest hole. Thus, it does not create tiny holes, but it consumes the large block, which might be required for large allocations.\n\nFor our use case, the best fit strategy is better than worst fit. The reason is that we have a minimal hole size of 16 bytes, since each hole needs to be able to store a size (8 bytes) and a pointer to the next hole (8 bytes). Thus, even the best fit strategy leads to holes of usable size. Furthermore, we will need to allocate very large blocks occasionally (e.g. for DMA buffers).\n\nHowever, both best fit and worst fit have a significant problem: They need to scan the whole list for each allocation in order to find the optimal block. This leads to long allocation times if the list is long. The first fit strategy does not have this problem, as it returns as soon as it finds a suitable hole. It is fairly fast for small allocations and might only need to scan the whole list for large allocations.\n\nTo deallocate a block of memory, we can just insert its corresponding hole somewhere into the list. However, we need to merge adjacent holes. Otherwise, we are unable to reuse the freed memory for larger allocations. For example:\n\nIn order to use these adjacent holes for a large allocation, we need to merge them to a single large hole first:\n\nThe easiest way to ensure that adjacent holes are always merged, is to keep the hole list sorted by address. Thus, we only need to check the predecessor and the successor in the list when we free a memory block. If they are adjacent to the freed block, we merge the corresponding holes. Else, we insert the freed block as a new hole at the correct position.\n\nThe detailed implementation would go beyond the scope of this post, since it contains several hidden difficulties. For example:\n\nSeveral merge cases: Merge with the previous hole, merge with the next hole, merge with both holes.\n\nWe need to satisfy the alignment requirements, which requires additional splitting logic.\n\nThe minimal hole size of 16 bytes: We must not create smaller holes when splitting a hole.\n\nI created the linked_list_allocator crate to handle all of these cases. It consists of a Heap struct that provides an allocate_first_fit and a deallocate method. It also contains a LockedHeap type that wraps Heap into spinlock so that it's usable as a static system allocator. If you are interested in the implementation details, check out the source code.\n\nWe need to add the extern crate to our Cargo.toml and our lib.rs :\n\n> cargo add linked_list_allocator\n\n// in src/lib.rs extern crate linked_list_allocator;\n\nNow we can change our global allocator:\n\nuse linked_list_allocator::LockedHeap; #[global_allocator] static HEAP_ALLOCATOR : LockedHeap = LockedHeap::empty();\n\nWe can't initialize the linked list allocator statically, since it needs to initialize the first hole (like described above). This can't be done at compile time, so the function can't be a const function. Therefore we can only create an empty heap and initialize it later at runtime. For that, we add the following lines to our rust_main function:\n\n// in src/lib.rs #[no_mangle] pub extern \"C\" fn rust_main(multiboot_information_address: usize ) { […] // set up guard page and map the heap pages memory::init(boot_info); // initialize the heap allocator unsafe { HEAP_ALLOCATOR .lock().init( HEAP_START , HEAP_START + HEAP_SIZE ); } […] }\n\nIt is important that we initialize the heap after mapping the heap pages, since the init function writes to the heap memory (the first hole).\n\nOur kernel uses the new allocator now, so we can deallocate memory without leaking it. The example from above should work now without causing an OOM situation:\n\n// in rust_main in src/lib.rs for i in 0 .. 10000 { format!( \"Some String\" ); }\n\nThe linked list based approach has some performance problems. Each allocation or deallocation might need to scan the complete list of holes in the worst case. However, I think it's good enough for now, since our heap will stay relatively small for the near future. When our allocator becomes a performance problem eventually, we can just replace it with a faster alternative.\n\nNow we're able to use heap storage in our kernel without leaking memory. This allows us to effectively process dynamic data such as user supplied strings in the future. We can also use Rc and Arc to create types with shared ownership. And we have access to various data structures such as Vec or Linked List , which will make our lives much easier. We even have some well tested and optimized binary heap and B-tree implementations!\n\nThis post concludes the section about memory management for now. We will revisit this topic eventually, but now it's time to explore other topics. The upcoming posts will be about CPU exceptions and interrupts. We will catch all page, double, and triple faults and create a driver to read keyboard input. The next post starts by setting up a so-called Interrupt Descriptor Table.",
  "latent_27730": "Parents will get twice as large of a tax credit for each child next year, under a compromise hammered out by the House and Senate Friday — although other changes to the bill mitigate the impact of that tax break.\n\nThe GOP's tax overhaul bill doubles the current child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child under age 17, and allows parents to receive up to $1,400 as a refund, if the credit is larger than their federal income tax liability.\n\nThe refundable part of the credit was increased from $1,100 to $1,400 after Senator Marco Rubio threatened to vote \"no\" on the bill, unless it included a more generous child tax credit.\n\nCurrently, the child tax credit is $1,000 and only partially refundable. Tax filers can only claim refunds on a percentage of what they make over $3,000, which limits benefits for the lowest-wage households.\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank in Washington D.C., calculated that parents of 10 million children would qualify for an additional refund of just $75 or less under the committee's deal. That's the same impact as the Senate's original bill.\n\nRelated: What's in the GOP's final tax plan\n\nThe latest version of bill also makes the child tax credit available to high earners because it raises the income threshold under which filers may claim the full credit to $200,000 for single parents, up from $75,000 today; and to $400,000 for married couples, up from $110,000.\n\nBut when other provisions are taken into account, the tax bill isn't so rosy for many moms and dads.\n\nThe GOP's bill does away with the deduction for personal exemptions, which could offset the benefit of the beefed up child tax credit for some families.\n\nCurrently, filers are able to deduct $4,050 for themselves, their spouses and for each dependent. For a family of four, that means $16,200 is shielded from federal taxation. In addition to the current standard deduction of $6,350, up to $28,900 goes tax-free. The benefit phases out at higher income levels.\n\nThe latest tax bill doubles the standard deduction to $24,000, but wipes out the deduction for personal exemptions, meaning that larger families will get less of a break.\n\n\"The distribution of those benefits are skewed towards higher income families, and really paltry for lower income families,\" says Vicki Shabo, vice president at the National Partnership for Women and Families. \"The overall package is really dismal for working families.\"\n\nRelated: Alimony will now be taxed under GOP bill\n\nShabo says the inclusion of a tax credit for employers who offer paid family leave to their workers may sound nice, but it only subsidizes those who've already decided to adopt such a policy. Since the credit ends in 2019, she says it won't incentivize many more employers to participate.\n\nIn addition, the GOP's latest tax bill contains bad news for undocumented immigrant families.\n\nThe final version keeps a provision that requires filers using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to provide Social Security numbers for each child in order to qualify for the credit. ITINs are mostly issued to undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn 2013, 4.4 million ITIN filers claimed child tax credits worth $6 billion, according to the Government Accountability Office. The latest change will affect about one million undocumented children, CBPP calculates.\n\nThe House version of the tax bill had also tightened eligibility for undocumented immigrants who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit and another credit for higher education expenses, but those provisions didn't make it into the final bill.\n\nThe compromise bill preserves the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and the Adoption Credit, which had been eliminated in earlier versions of the legislation.",
  "latent_27759": "After more than 20 years and nearly 500 episodes, the Simpsons have seen and done just about anything you can think of ( much to the chagrin of the 'South Park' kids).\n\nIn fact, in their ongoing quest to make fun of anything and everything, our favorite Springfield residents have occasionally managed to predict the future . Here are just a few surprising examples.\n\n'The Three Musketeers 3D'\n\nBefore director Paul W.S. Anderson decided to film the adventures of Alexandre Dumas' famous heroes in 3D, 'The Simpsons' imagined ' The Poke of Zorro ,' in which the musketeers end up on the wrong end of the masked bandit's trusty blade.\n\nFarmville\n\nParents, do you struggle to get your kids to mow the lawn, only to watch in exasperation as they devote countless hours to virtual manual labor in online simulator games? Marge Simpson felt your pain in the 1998 episode 'Bart Carny,' when the carnival comes to Springfield -- complete with the very popular Yard Work Simulator attraction.\n\nIt all seemed pretty ridiculous in the '90s, even during the Tamagotchi era, but if there's one thing the last decade has taught us, it's that there's no task too menial for people to enjoy ... as long as they get to sit in front of a screen while they're doing it.\n\nThe 9/11 attacks\n\nBelieve it or not, there really are people who think the Illuminati are sending messages to America through 'The Simpsons.' The most infamous example is this clip from the 'To Surveil with Love' episode, in which a large number nine is shown next to the outlines of the twin towers. Sinister prediction, or simple coincidence? You decide.\n\nOctomom\n\nTen years before Nadya Suleman made headlines for giving birth to a full set of octuplets -- and publicly dealing with all the headaches that eight babies bring -- 'The Simpsons' imagined a similar situation for Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon, the wife of kindly convenience store owner Apu.\n\nIn the episode 'Eight Misbehavin',' Apu and Manjula use fertility drugs to add the pitter-patter of little feet to their home, only to end up with a whole lot more than they bargained for. Adding insult to injury, a couple in nearby Shelbyville soon gives birth to nine babies, bringing an end to the shower of gifts that the Nahasapeemapetilons had been counting on to help pay for their brood.\n\nOf course, the real-life Octomom never agreed to sell her kids to an unscrupulous zoo owner, but the rest of the episode does contain some eerily prescient gags -- and, as a bonus, it ends with Homer being attacked by snakes.\n\nThe Nintendo Wii, Microsoft Kinect and Sony PlayStation Move\n\nWay back in 1995, 'The Simpsons' time-traveled 15 years into the future for 'Lisa's Wedding,' an episode that imagined what life might look like for the grown-up Simpsons kids as Lisa prepares to walk down the aisle. (Who could have guessed that everyone in the family would be exactly the same age in 2010? Ah, the irony.)\n\nThe episode included a long list of predictions , but one of the most interesting was glimpsed in a throwaway bit about Bart playing video games with a friend. Envisioned as a sort of hybrid between current motion-controlled games and '90s \"virtual\" systems like the Nintendo Virtual Boy , the gaming technology dreamed up by 'The Simpsons' writers looked pretty fantastical in the mid '90s. Today, of course, we can hack our Kinects to do things no sci-fi writer would have dared dream -- but this is still pretty impressive.\n\nIt looked like we might lose 'The Simpsons' a few weeks ago , but now that they're sticking around for at least two more years, we should be able to get at least a couple more future predictions out of them. What will they think of next?",
  "latent_28028": "Some of you may wonder why of all the stories out there today I decided to focus on the $525 fine a construction worker in South Carolina received a for refilling his drink without paying. The reason is to highlight the difference between what happens when a peasant breaks the law versus when a banker does it.\n\nIn this case, citizen Christopher Lewis refilled his drink without paying at the VA Medical Center in downtown Charleston. For this horrific offense (a refill costs $0.89), he was hauled into a room by the Federal Police Force and given a ticket for $525. Even worse, he was told not to ever come back to the premises, so he ended up losing his job as well.\n\nSo for this undoubtably minor offense, Mr. Lewis received a fine almost 600x greater than the cost of the crime and lost his ability to support himself. Compare that to the slap on the wrist banks receive when they are caught engaging in criminal behavior that leads to the theft of billions of dollars. At the worst, they pay a fine that is only a fraction of the profits and no one goes to jail, so the law actually incentivizes major financial crime. Meanwhile, if a peasant steps out of line, even for the most minor offense, the full brute force of federal law comes down like a ton of bricks. This is one of the main reasons why the social fabric of society is being torn apart, and unfortunately, there will be a hefty price to pay for it in the future.\n\nThis is a theme I have written about time and time again, most recently in a two part series, which I suggest reading:\n\nFrom WCSC News we learn that:\n\nCHARLESTON COUNTY, SC (WCSC) – A North Charleston man was hit with a federal fine for refilling his drink without paying. The on-site construction worker says he didn’t know refills at the VA Medical Center in downtown Charleston came at a price, and Wednesday, during his lunch hour, he was slapped with federal charges.\n\nThe ticket was issued by the Federal Police Force at the VA Medical Center in downtown Charleston after Christopher Lewis refilled his soda without paying the $0.89. A hospital spokesperson called it a “theft of government property.”\n\n“Every time I look at the ticket, it’s unbelievable to me,” says Lewis, who works construction. “I can’t fathom the fact that I made a $0.89 mistake that cost me $525.”\n\nLewis says he tried to pay the $0.89 right there, but wasn’t allowed to. He says he wasn’t given the chance to pay the cashier either.\n\n“I never had an option to make right what I had done wrong.”\n\nHe says he was taken to a room, given the $525 ticket for shoplifting and told not to return to the property.\n\n“I’m done there, at the VA hospital. I’m not allowed to go on the premises anymore. I asked him can I still work on the job site and just bring my lunch and not got to the cafeteria and he said he wanted me off the premises.”\n\nFreedom.\n\nFull article here.\n\nIn Liberty,\n\nMichael Krieger\n\nDonate bitcoins: Like this post?Donate bitcoins: 3J7D9dqSMo9HnxVeyHou7HJQGihamjYQMN\n\nFollow me on Twitter.",

  "latent_28166": "It can be a frightening sight, walking out towards your chicken coop and seeing feathers scattered everywhere.\n\nMy first thought is usually the worst- has a predator broken into the coop and attacked my chickens?\n\nLuckily, I haven’t ever lost any of my chickens to a predator and their feather loss is normally something much less serious. The most common reason for a chicken losing their feathers is the annual moult; however this isn’t the only reason.\n\nLet’s take a look at the most common reasons why chickens lose their feathers and our three favourite cures:\n\nAnnual Moulting\n\nThe first and most common reason why chickens lose their feathers is the ‘annual moult‘.\n\nA moult is when a chicken sheds its old feathers and replaces them with new feathers. Chickens moult during the end of the egg laying season, in the fall. This is normally closely linked to daylight hours. So, during the fall when there is a drop in the number of daylight hours, you can expect your chickens to start their moult.\n\nYou will noticed when they start to moult they lose feathers around their neck first. This will spread to their back and then move to their breast until finally their tail feathers drop out.\n\nThe typical moult lasts around 6 weeks, however older chickens moult much slower and it can take them up to 10-12 weeks.\n\nIn addition to their feathers dropping out, you will also notice that their comb will lose some of its colour and it won’t be a vibrant red any longer.\n\nFinally, during a moult you will notice that the amount of eggs they lay will greatly reduce and most likely stop all together. This is because chickens need lots of protein to make eggs, but also, their feathers are 80% protein. So your chicken can either moult or lay eggs, it doesn’t have enough protein to do both at the same time.\n\nCan You Stop Their Moult?\n\nWhen people find out their chicken in moulting the first question they ask is can you stop the moult?\n\nWell, not really. But you can help speed it up.\n\nWe mentioned above that when chickens moult they require a lot of protein to make their new feathers.\n\nSo the first thing you can do is stop feeding them layers pellets and give them food which has a higher percentage of protein in it. I like to feed my chickens game bird feed during their moult because it is 20% protein- this is double the amount of protein in layers pellets.\n\nBEST FEED FOR CHICKEN MOLTING Scratch and Peck Feeds – Naturally Free Organic Layer Feed High in protein to help chickens’ grow back their feathers.\n\nThis feed is organic and non-GMO.\n\nThis is by far one of my hens’ favorite layers feed.

Personally I don’t give them any tonics but a commonly used tonic is apple cider vinegar.\n\nYou can mix this in with their water supply to give them a boost of minerals and vitamins.\n\nOne supplement we do give our chickens is ginger powder and we’ve wrote about this extensively here.\n\nYou can mix ginger powder up with their game feed and it helps to boost their circulation and spread vitamins and nutrients throughout their body.\n\nTHE BEST APPLE CIDER VINEGAR Bragg – Apple Cider Vinegar Used to help boost your chickens’ immune system.\n\nEasy to use, just mix it into their water.\n\nCan also be used to help treat against mites Check Latest Price\n\nBroody Chickens\n\nIf only one of your chickens has lost their feathers, it could be that she is just broody.\n\nA broody hen is one that wants to hatch their own chicks and she will lay on top of their eggs all day long. You will easily notice that she is broody because she won’t leave the nesting box and will rarely eat.\n\nWhen they are broody they tend to pluck their own breast feathers out so their skin is in direct contact with the eggs.\n\nThis isn’t healthy for your hen if it continues for a long period of time so make sure you read how to stop a broody hen.\n\nPecking Order and Bullying\n\nChickens can also lose their feathers when they are being bullied.\n\nIf you’ve kept chickens for any length of time you know that they often jostle and compete to move up the ‘pecking order’. The pecking order is the chickens ‘hierarchy of status’ and chickens at the top of it control the rest of the flock.\n\nWhilst this jostling for pecking order is normally harmless, occasionally it can turn into bullying and hens get singled out and targeted.\n\nI’ve found the more aggressive breeds are those that are genetically ‘closer’ to original jungle fowl.\n\nIf a single hen is being targeted, their feathers will get plucked out and their skin may also get broken. Broody hens often get targeted because they have plucked out their own breast feathers and the other chickens will then peck at the red flesh.\n\nThis can be very dangerous because chickens are attracted to blood so they will peck the injured chicken even more.\n\nYou can spread tree pruning sealer onto the cut to help protect the injured chicken. The sealer will dry hard nearly straight away and will give the chicken time to recover. Also, the sealer is black so the chickens won’t be anywhere near as keen to peck at it, and if they do it will rub off on their beak so you know which hens have been bullying. You can then either isolate the culprits or use a blinder for a few days.\n\nI always prefer to isolate the culprit instead.\n\nTo do this I place them in a separate smaller pen for a couple of days. What’s interesting is that when the bully returns to the pen they get knocked down a peg or two by the other girls because the bully is consider ‘new’.\n\nYou will notice when you add new chickens to your existing flock there will also be some jostling for position in the pecking order and as a result some of your chickens will lose their feathers.\n\nThis should settle down in a few days if you introduce the chickens to each other properly. If you find they are still pecking out each other’s feathers you will need to separate the new and old chickens for a few days and then attempt to reintroduce them to each other.\n\nThe final reason chickens will bully each other is because there isn’t enough room in either their coop or run.\n\nChickens need at least 3 square foot each inside the coop and 15 square foot each inside the run. If they have less than this, they will bully each other and peck out each other’s feathers.\n\nParasites and Disease\n\nIn addition to moulting, the only other occasion when feather loss can be flock-wide is when your chickens have a disease or are infected with parasites.\n\nParasites can cause your hens to lose their feathers and also stop laying eggs.\n\nThe most common parasites are lice and red mites. Mites will live in the chicken coop and only appear during the night to suck blood from the chickens. Whereas, lice actually live on the chickens’ body so they are easier to spot.\n\nIn both cases you can use poultry dust from your local hardware store to remove the parasites.\n\nIf you are treating mites you can spread the poultry dust in the coop whereas if you are treating lice you need to apply the poultry dust directly onto your chickens.\n\nTo prevent either of the parasites returning make sure you regularly clean your chicken coop and wash your hands both before and after handling your chickens.\n\nIf your chickens have lost their feathers for over 12 weeks and there is no obvious sign as to why, make sure you visit your vet just to double check they are ok.\n\nRoosters\n\nSurprisingly, roosters can be the cause of chickens losing their feathers as well.\n\nWhen roosters mate with hens, the rooster holds onto the hen’s back with their beak- this is known as treading.\n\nWhen this happens the rooster can quite easily pull the feathers out of the hen’s neck and back. If the rooster only mates with a certain hen then over a period of time the balding can be very obvious!\n\nFortunately if your rooster is placed with several hens then this balding won’t be noticeable.\n\nTHE BEST NATURAL CHICKEN WORMER PELLETS Verm-X Pellets Health Supplement Completely natural pellet that improves general health of your flock.\n\nIt works but targeting the worms inside your chicken’s gut and eliminating them.\n\nMost effective as a proactive measure to prevent worms. Check Latest Price\n\nChange in Diet\n\nA sudden change in a chicken’s diet can inadvertently trigger a moult.\n\nIn fact, this was a common technique used by industrial grade farmers to force their chickens to moult and improve the quality of eggs they laid. Fortunately, this is now illegal in many places.\n\nBy changing their diet if you’re not careful you can reduce the amount of protein your chickens are getting and this can cause them to moult.\n\nI’ve previously wrote about the importance of giving your chickens good quality layers pellets and what happened when we stopped giving our chickens pellets.\n\nIf you want healthy, happy chickens you need to make sure they get access to a high protein diet, and the simplest way to do this is through layers pellets.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that normally when chickens lose their feathers it’s completely harmless. However sometimes it can be a cause for concern, so make sure to give your chickens a thorough inspection if/when they do lose their feathers.\n\nLet us know in the comments below what methods you’ve used to help your chickens during their moults.",

John Cornyn, Senate majority whip, told CNN. \"I think she should reconsider and change her course of conduct because I think she's got into an area that is out of her control.. And that I think will reflect poorly not only on her but on the objectivity that we request and demand out of our federal judiciary.\"\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, the senior member of the Judiciary Committee and longest-serving GOP senator, said: \"Those comments were inappropriate. On the other hand, she's reached a point in her life that she ought to say whatever she wants to.\"\n\nThe 82-year-old Hatch added: \"The older we get the more crusty we can be.\"\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, would not call on Ginsburg to resign.\n\n\"I think that it was the wrong statement, she ought to apologize for it, she ought to withdraw it,\" Grassley said Wednesday when asked about Trump's demand.\n\nEven Texas Sen.

  "latent_28479": "More than 60 years after the founding of Israel precipitated two tides of refugees in the Middle East, the Israeli government has launched a campaign to persuade the world that it’s not just Palestinians who suffered in Israel's early days.\n\nFacing powerful forces that were reshaping the Middle East – including rising anti-Semitism, nascent Arab nationalism, and a strengthening Zionist movement – some 856,000 Jews from Morocco to Iran were compelled to leave their home countries. Most of them settled in Israel.\n\nPartly because of draconian Arab laws issued after Israel declared independence in 1948, these Arab Jews left behind assets estimated at $700 million (about $6 billion today). According to one accounting, that’s roughly double the value of Palestinian assets lost.\n\nNow, Israel is demanding that those losses be acknowledged and recompensed in some way. In doing so, the campaign touches one of Palestinians' most sensitive wounds, harbored since Israel’s founding in 1948: their right to return to lands and homes left in 1948-49, when at least 750,000 either fled or were expelled by Israel.\n\nThough many Palestinians recognize at least some Arab Jews as refugees, they are concerned that Israel is trying to cancel its debt to them by putting the suffering of Arab Jews on the same international ledger.\n\nThe campaign has also met resistance from some Arab Jews in Israel, who have criticized both the logic and the motives behind it. Palestinian and Israeli critics have two main arguments: that these Jews were not refugees but eager participants in a new Zionist state, and that Israel cannot and should not attempt to settle its account with the Palestinians by deducting the lost assets of its own citizens, thereby preventing individuals on both sides from seeking compensation.\n\n“You cannot create some kind of accounting equation in which one cancels out the other,” says Yehuda Shenhav, an Iraqi Jew and author of “The Arab Jews.\" He adds, “You cannot use the Arab Jews that arrived to Israel … as the capital in which you deny the legitimate rights of [Palestinians].”\n\nRefugee status\n\nWhen the United Nations presented its 1947 proposal for partitioning historical Palestine into two states, an Arab delegate warned that doing so could unleash hatred against the roughly 1 million Jews living in the Middle East – an anti-Semitism perhaps worse, even, than seen in Nazi Germany.\n\n“If the United Nations decides to partition Palestine, it might be responsible for the massacre of a large number of Jews,” said Heykal Pasha of Egypt.\n\nDays later, the UN voted in favor of the 1947 partition plan, paving the way for Israel’s declaration of independence in May 1948. As Arab countries joined Palestinian fighters to protest the new state, they also cracked down on Jews in their own countries.\n\nIraq made it illegal to propagate Zionist ideology and froze the assets of its Jewish population – the wealthiest in the Middle East – and allowed them to leave only under condition that they leave behind their property and never return.\n\nThe Syrian government took property from Jewish residents to make room for Palestinians. Egypt passed a law just before the UN decision, in July 1947, requiring Egyptian companies to maintain quotas of Egyptian directors and employees that caused many Jews to lose their jobs, since most were not Egyptian citizens.\n\nEgypt, Algeria, and Jordan all passed laws in the 1950s and early '60s preventing Jews from holding citizenship. And Jews were the target of significant violence, particularly in Libya and Iraq, where hundreds were killed.\n\nZionists, eager to bolster the population of their new state, recruited fellow Jews during these tumultuous times and the Israeli government helped to orchestrate the floods of new immigrants.\n\nTiming\n\nIsrael originally romanticized the exodus of Jews from Arab countries; the transport of 50,000 Jews from Yemen became colloquially known as the “magic carpet” operation, for example. Only more recently has Israel sought to emphasize the suffering endured by such refugees.\n\nIndeed, part of what makes Israel’s campaign controversial now is the timing, which some say is politically motivated.\n\n“You can definitely be a refugee and be fleeing persecution and then end up showing up [in Israel],” says Diana Buttu, an international human rights lawyer and former adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team, adding that that’s not the real issue. “I think what’s driving it is: (1) they want to completely eliminate the issue of the right of return, (2) ... they want to create this idea of homelands and that the only place you can flee to is your homeland.”\n\nThe implication, she says, is that Palestinians in the future could only return to the part of historical Palestine designated as a Palestinian state –and not inside Israel proper, where many of them lived before 1948.\n\nBut Yigal Palmor, spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Ministry, describes the current push as the maturing of long-term political and social processes – including the gradual willingness of Holocaust survivors to discuss their experiences and seek reparations, thereby awakening Arab Jews’ desire to make similar claims, and the growing political clout of Arab Jews over the years.\n\nHe flatly denies that it’s a political ploy.\n\n“It’s not that we’re negotiating Palestinian demands [on refugees] and someone comes up with this idea on how to neutralize Palestinian demands,” he says.\n\nHe also notes that Israel has always been highly critical that the UN created a special agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.\n\nAccording to a 2008 assessment by international economist Sydney Zabludoff, who has spent years working on Jewish reparation issues, UNRWA has spent more than triple the amount the Palestinians originally lost in 1948. To be sure, the Palestinian refugee population has expanded to some 4 million since then as Arab countries have resisted assimilating them and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process remains stalled.\n\nSettling accounts\n\nBut the most controversial aspect to Israel’s campaign is the perceived attempt to equate the suffering of Arab Jews with that of Palestinians and thus cancel out both accounts without individuals on either side receiving compensation.\n\n\"It all sort of comes out in the wash, they [Arab Jews] had a lot of property, they were pretty wealthy … it’s far too complicated, let’s just call it a day,\" says Ms. Buttu, summarizing her view of what the Israelis will say in negotiations.\n\nIn Israel, a group of Iraqi Jews issued a statement recently thanking Israel for recognizing them as refugees but taking issue with the new campaign. They wrote in part, “we will not agree with the option that compensation for our property be offset by compensation for the lost property of others (meaning, Palestinian refugees).”\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nZvi Gabai, a former Israeli ambassador whose family came to Israel from Iraq in 1951 with nothing, says the answer lies in a suggestion he attributes to President Bill Clinton: establishing an international fund to compensate Palestinian refugees as well as Jewish refugees.\n\n“I think this would be the best way to solve the question,” he says. “To compensate both groups of refugees.”",
  "latent_28492": "OTTAWA — The Liberal leadership in the Senate allowed a veteran senator to vote on legislation and spend public dollars for four months after she was diagnosed with dementia and declared legally incompetent.\n\nSen. Joyce Fairbairn regularly attended Senate sittings and voted along party lines before the Upper Chamber rose for the summer at the end of June.\n\nFairbairn was diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type by her geriatric psychiatrist in February, according to a letter sent to Senate officials by her niece, Patricia McCullagh.\n\n[np-related]\n\nIt is unclear when the Liberals knew about the diagnosis, but by April, the top aide to Liberal Senate leader James Cowan had co-signed a declaration that Fairbairn was legally incompetent, according to a letter from McCullagh, obtained by Postmedia News.\n\nMcCullagh, Fairbairn’s closest relative, wrote to the Clerk of the Senate Gary O’Brien in August to warn of the senator’s worsening health, copying the letter to Cowan and Senate Speaker Noel Kinsella.\n\n“As you know, Sen. Fairbairn has dementia of the Alzheimer’s type,” McCullagh wrote.\n\n“She has declined significantly over the past year and is no longer able to look after herself, having had 24-hour, full-time care for the past 18 months.”\n\nThe letter indicates that Cowan’s chief of staff, Len Kuchar, who as “agent” shares legal responsibility for Sen. Fairbairn’s personal care with McCullagh, co-signed the declaration sometime in April.\n\nKuchar could not be reached for comment Monday.\n\nAs the Ottawa Citizen reported last week, the Liberals said Fairbairn will go on an extended sick leave once the Upper Chamber reconvenes in September. When asked about Fairbairn’s condition in the spring, the party insisted she was doing fine.\n\nLiberal Senate whip Jim Munson last week said that he never doubted Fairbairn knew what she was voting on during the session.\n\nIn the months after the declaration of incompetence, Fairbairn voted 12 times in the Senate. She also authorized more than $85,000 in spending, according to the quarterly expense reports her office filed. However, she travelled less between her home and Ottawa, spending less than $4,000 from March until the end of May, rather than the $13,000 in travel spending she averaged over the previous three quarters.\n\nMcCullagh said in her letter she spent part of the summer with Fairbairn at her home in Lethbridge, Alta., and found the senator’s awareness and memory had deteriorated over the previous month.\n\n“Sen. Fairbairn has considerable difficulty carrying out any of her duties as senator and will not return to Ottawa for the foreseeable future.”\n\nConservative Sen. David Tkachuk, who chairs the Senate’s board of internal economy, was also copied on McCullagh’s letter.\n\nTkachuk says he has asked Cowan’s office for more information and documentation to support the sick leave request. The board has also asked for a legal opinion on Fairbairn’s situation before deciding what, if anything, the Senate should do.\n\n“I’m going to do it with as much sympathy for her case as possible. but respecting the fact that this is a Canadian institution as well,” Tkachuk said. “It’s a tragic circumstance,” Tkachuk added, noting that he had seen his father struggle with Alzheimer’s.\n\nUnder Senate rules, a doctor’s note must be produced for a sick leave of more than six days and senators must still attend once every two sessions.\n\nUnder new rules set to be adopted this fall, the Senate as a whole can decide to make a seat vacant, triggering a selection and nomination process, if a senator fails to show up for two sessions.\n\nFairbairn is not scheduled to retire from the Senate until November 2014. It is unclear why she is taking sick leave rather than stepping down, as seriously ill senators have done in the past.\n\nPatients with Alzheimer’s dementia experience memory loss, confusion and impaired cognitive abilities. Although symptoms can come and go, the effects of the disease become progressively more severe over time.\n\nFairbairn, a former journalist, worked as a communications aide to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He named her to the Senate in 1984.\n\nSince then, she has focused much of her work on literacy and disability issues.\n\nFind the National Post on Facebook",
  "latent_28577": "In 1961 Frantz Fanon dictated most of his last book, Les Damnés de la Terre, translated as The Wretched of the Earth, from a mattress on the floor of a flat in Tunis. He was 36 years old and dying of leukaemia. The disease had recently blinded him for some weeks but he managed to complete the book in ten weeks in a race against death.\n\nFanon, who was from Martinique in the Caribbean, had ended up Tunisia after he joined the Algerian national liberation movement in 1954. He had joined the Free French Forces fighting the Nazis as a teenager and, as a result, had been able to study medicine in France after the war. He had specialised in psychiatry and had taken a post in a psychiatric hospital in colonial Algeria.\n\nFanon’s first book, Black Skin, White Masks, was written when he was a student in France and published in 1952. He was 27. It remains an arrestingly original work in which a poetic form of expression and philosophical and literary erudition are woven into a profound and moving examination of the lived experience of racism. From this first book Fanon’s politics were rooted in a radical humanism, with a commitment, in his words, to ‘recognise the open door of every consciousness’. It remains a canonical text in critical race studies and a book that continues to inspire people around the world.\n\nFanon’s second book, A Dying Colonialism, was published in 1959. It deals with what he called the mutations in culture as people become mobilised in an anti-colonial war. Anyone who has been able to participate in a genuine mass mobilisation will immediately recognise the value and accuracy of his description of how social relations can change in struggle.\n\nThe Wretched of the Earth draws on Fanon’s involvement in the Algerian struggle against French colonialism as well as his travels around Africa as an ambassador for the Algerian national liberation movement. It begins with an account of the colonial city, ‘this world divided in two’, and goes on to examine the internalisation of colonial violence among the oppressed, the resulting violence among the oppressed, and the moment when violence is turned back on colonial oppression.\n\nFanon then turns his critical attention towards anti‑colonial resistance, stressing that in the colonial situation Marxism needs to be ‘stretched’ and paying particular attention to the political agency of ordinary people, including peasants and the urban poor. He is committed to forms of struggle that are genuinely mass-based and participatory.\n\nThe book’s third focus is an examination of the pathologies of the regimes that came to power in Africa after colonialism. In Fanon’s estimation they took over rather than undid colonial systems, demobilised the mass movements that had brought them to power and used their own political credibility to entrench authoritarian and predatory regimes. Against this, still committed to a radical humanism, he posed a refusal of technocratic approaches to development and the full involvement of the people in both political and economic life. The final chapter of the book, drawing on Fanon’s case notes from his period as a psychiatrist in Algeria, investigates the damage done to human beings by colonialism and violence.\n\nThe Wretched of the Earth was banned on publication in France and copies were seized from bookshops. But it was heralded in radical black circles in the US and taken up in places such as Iran and Sri Lanka. Fifty years later it remains the key text in radical circles in South Africa, where it is regularly cited by grass-roots militants.\n\nInitial readings of the book often caricatured Fanon’s endorsement of violence against colonial regimes. Fanon’s support for violent struggle was often read outside the context of the extraordinary violence of French colonialism in Algeria and there has been a racist double standard in which Fanon is excoriated for endorsing violent struggle while white intellectuals, such as, say, Jean-Paul Sartre or George Orwell, are not subject to the same condemnation. Although he had been decorated for bravery while serving in the Free French Forces, Fanon had a personal horror of violence and was acutely aware of the damage that it can do to individuals and societies.\n\nMany of the misreadings of The Wretched of the Earth are due to the way the book is developed as an unfolding narrative in which consciousness changes in the vortex of struggle. Statements affirmed with unqualified emphasis at one point are often questioned later on. This means that the book has to be read as a whole to be properly understood and that simply taking isolated quotes or extracts will not give an accurate impression of the author’s intentions.\n\nFanon left this world as The Wretched of the Earth entered it. Fifty years on, his final book retains an extraordinary political charge in countries where it remains necessary to oppose both new forms of colonial or neo-colonial power and new forms of elite accommodation with that power in the name of the nation.",

  "latent_28716": "Vegas shooting: concert workers’ phone-footage wiped clean by FBI\n\nWhat??\n\nby Jon Rappoport\n\nPaul Watson at infowars has the story:\n\n“Workers at the Route 91 festival during which Stephen Paddock unleashed his massacre have reportedly been given back their phones and laptops by the FBI only to discover that all messages and videos from the night of the attack have been wiped clean.”\n\n“According to a Las Vegas resident who posted a status update on Facebook, ‘A bunch of people that worked the Route 91 [concert] said they got their cell phones back today. They all said that all their phones are completely wiped clean! All messages and info from that weekend are completely gone. Anyone else experience this’?”\n\n“’A few different people who were vendors there are all saying the same thing,’ the woman later comments.”\n\n“Later in the thread, a Route 91 worker confirms the story, commenting, ‘Of course. It’s an active federal crime scene. They can wipe it clean. I was the beverage manager for the entire event. My laptop is wiped clean’.”\n\nWhat?\n\nFirst of all, in a recent article, I demonstrated in detail why you can never trust what the FBI says about evidence in any investigation. There is a notorious history of the Bureau cooking and slanting and inventing data to support prosecutions.\n\nSecond, who says the FBI can take people’s phones and laptops, watch and copy the video footage, and then wipe it all away before returning the devices to their owners?\n\nThe FBI literally owns the crime scene AND any record of what happened at that scene? Baloney.\n\nThe obvious reason for wiping out the footage: it contained evidence that contradicts the official scenario. And most likely, that evidence revealed multiple shooters.\n\nAs Vegas cops, the FBI, and the owners of the Mandalay Hotel have changed and massaged the official narrative, one assertion has remained constant: there was only one shooter, and he was Stephen Paddock.\n\nLaw-enforcement pounced on that claim early on, without the slightest justification. Without interviewing multiple witnesses who state they saw other shooters.\n\n“Okay, the mass shooting happened yesterday and we know there was only one shooter. That’s it. Don’t ask us any questions about this. Anyone who disagrees with us is spreading rumors and impeding the investigation.”\n\nAdmitting multiple shooters is admitting there was cooperation, collusion, conspiracy, a plan, and a purpose for that plan beyond “the lone gunman was crazy.” This is the door law-enforcement keeps slamming shut every time it opens.\n\nAnd now we have reports that the FBI has wiped witnesses’ phones and laptops. No more footage of the shooting. No more evidence.\n\nLet’s be clear: the FBI is impeding the investigation.\n\nThere is no Constitutional rule that states private citizens can’t investigate crimes. There never was. There never will be.\n\nLaw enforcement doesn’t OWN investigations.\n\nIf they did, every time a journalist probes beneath the surface of a crime and uncovers important information, the FBI could say, “Well, we just opened an investigation of that very crime, and therefore we want all your notes and we want you to cease and desist your inquiry. Shut up and go cover Sunday picnics.”\n\nIn most cases, law-enforcement doesn’t have to worry about mainstream reporters. Those denizens simply take dictation from local cops and federal cops and their stories appear in papers and TV news broadcasts wiped clean of independent thought.\n\nThat leaves the truth a wide open field.\n\nPrivate citizens and non-mainstream journalists own that field, not through edict, but through default. Don’t blame us. If you were doing your jobs, we wouldn’t have to do them for you.\n\nYour first rule would be: stop lying.\n\nDestruction of evidence is a felony. Those concert workers whose phones and laptops were wiped clean had a felony committed against them. By agents of government who have sworn to uphold and protect the Constitution.\n\nThousands of smart lawyers out there will say, “Come on, there’s no way you could make a charge like that stick.” Well, maybe there would be a way, if enough of you decided there has been enough destruction of the Constitution and it’s time to stand up and be counted, come hell or high water.\n\nMeanwhile, whoever can look past the lies and fabrications and distortions of a criminal investigation can say something because they saw something.\n\nHere is a quick excerpt from my recent piece about the FBI’s stance on crime probes. It should give you a clue about the Bureau’s attitude and reputation:\n\nApril 20, 2015, The Atlantic: “…the Washington Post made clear Saturday in an article that begins with a punch to the gut… ‘Nearly every examiner in an elite FBI forensic unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants over more than a two-decade period before 2000,’ the newspaper reported, adding that ‘the cases include those of 32 defendants sentenced to death’.”\n\nIn the Vegas shooting case, the FBI is saying: Trust us. We’re the pros. We do investigations the right way. Now give us your cell phone so we can look at video footage of the shooting and make a copy and wipe your phone clean and give it back to you.\n\nDon’t worry, be happy. All is well. The centurions are on duty.\n\n*********\n\nOriginal article\n\nTLB recommends other pertinent articles from Jon Rappoport.\n\nAbout Jon Rappoport: He is the author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.

  "latent_29041": "As I've mentioned countless times before, I live in Utah amongst countless Mormons. And hurrah! I, too, am a Mormon. On the other hand, my entire life, I have felt like I wasn't like everybody else. I know the church is true and I do my best to live my morals, but I have a different stance on many opinions and views than a lot of my LDS peers. A friend of mine shared this article on Facebook and I instantly read the entire article to my husband, getting slightly teary-eyed during parts of it, and celebrating in my head. I'm not alone, here. I thought I'd share this article on my blog because it really is one of the best.\n\nI do want to stress that this post is not written by me. The content is not mine. I simply shared this post because it resonated with my soul & I wanted to share it to my readers as well as ponder back on it for my reference.\n\nLiz, the author of this article mentioned some similar hardships that I share with people here in Utah. She said, \"..over the years, I've found a way to carve out my own space in the Church. It's an ongoing process, but I thought I'd share some of my tools - a practical guide to how to carve out your own space of belonging. Some of these tools may work for you, some of them may not. Spirituality is so personal. But if you sometimes sit in sacrament meeting and wonder what the hell you're doing there, know that I've been there, and sometimes I'm still there, but remembering the following things help me to keep perspective.\"\n\n1. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks of you - just what you think of you, and what God thinks of you.\n\nThis is probably the biggest guiding principle in my life. And it's completely impossible to truly remember and live by all the time. But it's really what everything else in this list comes down to, and when you can remember it, it's empowering. So what if the Relief Society President thinks you're immodest? She's not in charge of your eternal salvation. And even if she or other leaders have a hand in your eternal judgement, God's judgement will override any of that.\n\n2. Personal revelation is more important than anything else.\n\nIn our Church, we speak often about the importance of obedience, of faith in the Church, of following the counsel of leaders even when we don't understand it. And there is value in those things...we can grow and learn from doing those things. But there may be times that your own conscience may dictate otherwise. Those are painful moments, and it can be really really difficult to trust that you're doing the right thing in following your own heart. And maybe sometimes it's NOT the right thing to follow your own heart. But your responsibility as a human being is to take everything you are told to the Lord. And if your own personal revelation says something contrary to what leaders of the Church may say, trust it. I'm not talking about things like commandments. Personal revelation will NOT be contrary to the commandments. I'm talking about things like leader's opinions on the Big Bang, or the best way to be a parent, or what legislation should be passed. I honor and sustain the men and women called to lead this Church, but recognize that it is not meet that we are commanded in all things, and that sometimes something that seems like revelation for the entire Church may not be when you seek confirmation of it. Others may judge you for your interpretation by statements by leaders, but those who pass judgement are not in charge of your eternal salvation, so it doesn't matter what they think.\n\n3. You have permission to leave if your pain exceeds your nourishment.\n\nI mean this on a short-term basis, although I think it can apply long-term. But since the point of this post is to help people stay active if they want to, I'm mostly focusing on short-term. It's inevitable that someone will say something in one of your meetings someday that rubs you the wrong way. You may never have a day when you go to Church and 100% agree with everyone around you. Most of the time you can just shift your focus, listen to the Spirit, dig into your scriptures on your own, find some way to help you stay grounded. But sometimes the sheer effort of doing that distracts from the actual nourishment you can be receiving. So if you need to step out for a few minutes, for the rest of the meeting, or for the rest of the day, give yourself permission to do that. Take your worship into your own hands. It's almost always best to stay. But if you're not getting anything out of Church, put yourself in a situation where you ARE being spiritually nourished.",

  "latent_29714": "For people with celiac disease or gluten intolerances, dining out can be stressful. Even trace amounts of the protein — found in wheat, barley, and rye — in a whole plate of food can cause adverse reactions.\n\nNow MIT spinout Nima — co-founded by CEO Shireen Yates MBA ’13 and Chief Product Officer Scott Sundvor ’12 — has developed a portable, highly sensitive gluten sensor that lets diners know if their food is, indeed, safe to eat.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that leads to intestinal damage when gluten is eaten, affects around 1 percent of the U.S. population, or roughly 3 million people. According to the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness, millions more may suffer from nonceliac gluten intolerances.\n\nNima’s sensor, also called Nima, is a 3-inch-tall triangular device with disposable capsules. Diners put a sample of food — about the size of a pea — or liquid into the capsule, screw on the top, and insert the capsule into the device, which mixes the food into a solution that detects gluten. In two to three minutes, a digital display appears on the sensor, indicating if the food sample does or doesn’t contain gluten.\n\nEvery time someone runs a test, the result is automatically sent to an app Nima has developed. The diner can enter information about where and what they ate, and whether the food contained gluten. Any Nima user can log in to see the results.\n\nThe aim is to create “a peace of mind at mealtime,” Sundvor says. By amassing data on food, he adds, the startup hopes to provide people with better information about what they eat. “Right now, we don’t know what’s in our food, whether it is allergens, pesticides, or other harmful chemicals,” he says. “There’s not a good way to get that data. We want to give people the ability to understand their food better and how it affects their health.”\n\nSensitive sensor\n\nNima can sense gluten at 20 parts per million (ppm) or more, the maximum concentration for “gluten-free” foods as determined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nNima’s high sensitivity comes from the immunoassay inside the sensor, developed primarily by MIT chemical engineering alumnus Jingqing Zhang SM ’12, PhD ’13, who is now the lead scientist at Nima. The immunoassay contains custom antibodies that are highly sensitive to gluten molecules. When gluten is present, the antibody bonds to the gluten molecules, causing a color change in the immunoassay, which is captured by an optical reader. If any gluten is detected, the sensor will display an icon with a “gluten found” message. If the sample has less than 20 ppm of gluten, the sensor will display a smiley face.\n\nNima can detect gluten in foods that are labeled as “gluten-free” but may have picked up microscopic amounts of the protein during the production or cooking process. A steak may have been fried on the same grill as gluten-based foods, for example, or a salad dressing may contain trace amounts of wheat flour. The device can even detect if someone touched a piece of bread that contained gluten, before handling the food in question. “It’s the equivalent to finding a breadcrumb in an entire plate of food,” Sundvor says.\n\nMoreover, Sundvor says, the device seamlessly integrates that chemistry with electronics and mechanics. “We’ve created this grinding, mixing, and extracting system, and together it works really well,” he says.\n\nFilling the consumer gap\n\nNima was founded in 2013 as GlutenTech, when Yates, then an MIT Sloan School of Management student, dreamt up an idea for a portable gluten sensor. Seeking an engineer to bring the device to life, she met Sundvor, a recent MIT graduate who had studied mechanical engineering and product design.\n\nTogether, they set up shop at the now-defunct MIT Beehive, a startup incubator on MIT’s campus, with aims of filling “a huge consumer gap” in food-allergen testing, Sundvor says. Conventional at-home tests, he says, require equipment such as test tubes, pipettes, a mortar and pestle, and microscale. “You can’t bring test tubes to a restaurant,” he says.\n\nSundvor began working long hours in an MIT machine shop building a prototype, while Yates brought the idea around to her MIT Sloan classes. Of note was a particular pricing class, where students sketched out pricing and demand models for the product. “The result of that was that I found there’s a real opportunity here: There’s a need and a willingness to pay,” Yates says.\n\nIn spring 2013, GlutenTech entered the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition with a proof-of-concept model, and they earned the Audience Choice Award in the Accelerate contest. That summer, the team entered the Global Founders Skills Accelerator (GFSA), a 12-week startup program held at the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.\n\nParticipating in the $100K forced the team develop a business plan they could pitch to investors, Yates says. “It was a testing period to see, if we position ourselves in a certain way, will it resonate with investors?” she says.\n\n“The GFSA was incredible,” Sundvor adds, “It gave us the opportunity to have a safe space to go full-out on this for three months, have mentors, and have just enough money to squeak by.”\n\nBy the time the GFSA Demo Day rolled around in September, GlutenTech had its first working prototypes — “which were so ugly,” Sundvor says, laughing.\n\nThe 9-inch-long aluminum tubes “looked like lightsaber handles,” Sundvor says. Inside the tubes were chemicals used in conventional food tests, and the system took about 10 minutes to detect gluten. When it did, a bright light flashed and a loud alarm went off. “We got many looks at restaurants,” Sundvor says. “But they worked and got us our first investors.”\n\nThree years ago, GlutenTech moved headquarters from Boston to San Francisco, and changed its name to 6SensorLabs. This year, they renamed the startup as Nima. In three years, the startup has gained more than $14 million in capital venture funding.\n\nNew opportunities\n\nConsumers are the startup’s first market. But as more individuals start using Nima, restaurants will have more data on their food to better serve patrons, Sundvor says. A couple of restaurants in San Francisco, in fact, are working with Nima on validating their gluten-free menu items.\n\nNext year, Nima plans to release two new sensors, one for peanuts and one for dairy, which is “surprisingly sneaky,” Sundvor says. Bread at a restaurant, for instance, could have been fried in a pan with remnants of butter. “A lot of people are getting sick from dairy allergies, so that will be a big market,” Sundvor says.",
  "latent_29735": "President Donald Trump, who loves to win, just suffered the biggest defeat of his still-nascent presidency. The American Health Care Act, the Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, was so unpopular that House Speaker Paul Ryan canceled a vote on the bill at the last minute Friday.\n\nYou might be wondering how Trump would react to a loss that is nearly impossible to spin as a victory. The answer is that, of course, he tried anyway.\n\nTrump was involved with the last stages of the bill’s failure. He wanted congressional Republicans to quit negotiating, which they did late Thursday night. Then, even with serious doubt about whether the bill had enough votes, Trump kept insisting they hold the vote anyway — until Ryan canceled it at the last second.\n\nIn the aftermath, Trump, in a short statement from the Oval Office, shared his take on the process. In sum: All of this is Democrats’ fault, and when Obamacare simultaneously implodes and explodes, they will come begging to him to make a deal. He also gave the American people an idea of what the president learned about lawmaking during the three-week process that he decided was “enough”:\n\n1) How legislating works\n\n“We all learned a lot,” Trump said. “We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process. We learned about some very arcane rules in obviously both the Senate and in the House. So, it's been certainly for me, it's been an interesting experience.”\n\n2) If your bill fails because not enough people in your party will vote for it, it’s the other party’s fault\n\n“We had no votes from the Democrats,” Trump said. “They weren't going to give us a single vote so it's a very difficult thing to do.” The real losers, he said, were House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: “Now they own Obamacare,” Trump said. “They own it. One hundred percent own it.”\n\nJudging by the statement Pelosi and Schumer gave, surrounded by several fellow Democrats, they’re very happy losers indeed:\n\n\"Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan,\" AHCA edition pic.twitter.com/JvVJORozYy — Mike Memoli (@mikememoli) March 24, 2017\n\n3) Obamacare is failing, and when it does, Democrats will be begging for a bipartisan deal\n\n“I've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we can do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode,” said Trump, who never said such a thing until January 2017, according to an archive of his public statements. “It is exploding right now.”\n\n“It's imploding and soon will explode and it's not going to be pretty,” he said later.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office report on the American Health Care Act denied that Obamacare was exploding (or imploding, or going into a death spiral). But Trump said he was convinced that when that happens, it will be an opportunity for an even better, bipartisan health care bill.\n\n“I know some Democrats and they're good people,” Trump said. “I honestly believe the Democrats will come to us and say, look, let's get together and get a great health care bill or plan that's really great for the people of our country.”\n\n4) The Republican Party is complicated\n\nBut everyone likes him, Trump said, which is the really important thing. “He's got a lot of factions,” he said of House Speaker Paul Ryan, “and there's been a long history of liking and disliking even within the Republican Party. Long before I got here. But I've had a great relationship with the Republican Party. It seems that both sides like Trump, and that's good.”\n\n5) He really wanted to do tax reform anyway\n\n“So now we're going to go for tax reform, which I've always liked,” said Trump, who insisted for weeks that Obamacare repeal was required to happen first, before tax reform. (This isn’t true, but it was the preferred strategy of Republicans in Congress.)\n\n6) Anyway, this crushing defeat is actually for the best\n\n“Perhaps the best thing that could happen is exactly what happened today, because we'll end up with a truly great health care bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes,” Trump said. “So, I want to thank everybody for being here. It will go very smoothly.”",

  "latent_29964": "The trend is hard to measure, since subcontracting can take many forms. But it is big. A study last year by Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard and Alan B. Krueger of Princeton, a former chief economic adviser to President Barack Obama, concluded that independent contractors, on-call workers and workers provided by contracting companies or temp agencies accounted altogether for 94 percent of employment growth over the last 10 years.\n\nNonstandard employment arrangements like these account for nearly one in six jobs today. That is 24 million jobs, nine million more than 10 years ago.\n\nMany of these jobs are poorly paid. A 2008 study by Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Ethan Kaplan, then at the Institute for International Economic Studies at Stockholm University, found that outsourcing imposed a wage penalty of up to 7 percent for janitors and up to 24 percent for security guards.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office of Congress concluded that contingent workers in the education field — substitute teachers, adjuncts and the like — earn almost 14 percent less per hour. In retailing they earn 9.4 percent less. Contingent workers across the board are less likely to have health insurance. One-third live in families making less than $20,000 a year. That is three times the share of workers employed in standard full-time jobs.\n\nThe rise of outsourced work adds an important twist to the standard understanding of America’s growing wage inequality, which is based on the notion that technology has left less-educated workers behind — taking over their routine jobs while opening lucrative new possibilities for the better-educated.\n\nThe sorting of workers into different classes of companies will further widen the earnings gap as the rewards of the most profitable among them “increasingly go to a more limited group of highly compensated and more-educated workers and to shareholders,” Professor Katz explained.\n\nManufacturing has gone through this process. General Motors in its heyday employed more than 600,000 workers in the United States, including the engineer, the man sweeping the shop floor and the woman serving coffee. Though the engineer certainly earned much more, the other two could share in G.M.’s success. Norms of fairness, Mr. Weil argues, would limit the wage gap between workers of a single company, giving a boost to those at the bottom.",

  "latent_30071": "A reader asked if I might refer him to a cogent, while pithy, elaboration of the natural historian’s concept of race, an exposition which he might cite in future discussions. One of the most lucid articulations which I have encountered can be found in physical anthropologist Alice Brues’ (1913 –2007) book “People and Races” (1977/1990). Brues studied under Earnest Hooton, whose own concept of race was remarkably well articulated and coherent. In undergrad, she majored in philosophy (and psychology), a fact which might help account for the unusual lucidity of her discussion. In the seven pages of her first chapter, she says most of what needs to be said. And in the remaining chapters she makes the other necessary points. The first chapter is copied below both in PDF form and text. The discussion can be summarized as follows (with my notes added and paragraphs numbered).\n\nChapter 1\n\nP1. A race is a division of a species, the members of which share more ancestry with each other than with members of other divisions; different races differ in the frequency of hereditary traits.\n\n[This captures the early notion of races as genealogy-based classifications.]\n\nP2. Individuals are arranged into divisions and groups are distinguished based on “the total appearance of the individual” and their “normal combination of traits”.\n\n[This reflects the common notion of races as natural biological divisions, ones delineated based on an ensemble of ancestry indexing characters.]\n\nP3. The hereditary nature of race explains why when populations relocate from one part of the world to another descendants resemble their region of origin ancestors.\n\n[This expresses the concept’s original purpose, which was to explain why varieties retained their particular traits even after being relocated to foreign environments.]\n\nP4. Variation between races is generally continuous.\n\n[This restates the popular monogenist position that trait discontinuities evidence species, while trait continuity evidences intraspecific divisions.]\n\nP5. History has been marked by shifting patterns of racial differention and racial admixture. Primarily and pure races exist/existed only in the sense of population-lineages which are/were relatively more isolated and differentiated than secondary or admixed ones.\n\n[Races, as divisions of a species, have always been understood as population-lineages which diverged from a common stock or which represent new lineages forged through the hybridization, and subsequent semi-isolation, of two or more such lineages.]\n\nP6. Races are not national, religious, linguistic, or cultural communities. While communities defined by political, religious, and linguistic affinity, if reproductively isolated for a long enough time, form races, they need not necessarily and often do not.\n\n[This restates the idea that the natural historian’s races are somatically, genealogically, and genomically, not socially, delineated divisions. During the 1800s the term was often applied confusedly. Deniker (1900) was one of the first to clarify the distinction between “races” and “ethnic groups formed by virtue of community of language, religion, social institutions, etc.” Of course, it has since been shown that many such ethnic groups correspond with races. Thus, for example, Paschou et al. (2010) found that with enough ancestrally informative alleles they could assign most individuals to their self-identified HapMap reference “ethnic” group of origin. As the authors note, “subtle population genetic structure can be detected at levels that were previously unimaginable”. Nonetheless, the logical distinction between races as genealogically defined divisions of a species and national, religious, linguistic, and cultural communities as such stands.]\n\nP7. Race is related to cultural and societal differences – to the extent it is – on account of inherited differences in temperament and aptitude which influence how groups think and conduct themselves.\n\n[This clarifies the relation between race and behavioral population genetics; it distinguishes biological understandings from quasi-mystical ones.]\n\nChapter 3\n\nP8. The number of races recognized depends on the classification scheme. The major races recognized were the “white” (Caucasoid), “yellow” (Mongoloid), and “black” (Negroid) races. There are many other races, groups which represent either subraces of the major ones, intermediate populations, or groups which do not neatly fit into any classification scheme.\n\n[This restates the point made so many times since the time of Buffon that one can lump and split races.]\n\nChapter 13\n\nP9. Populations are grouped into races based on genetic affinity resulting from once sharing a common breeding population. This affinity is indexed by similarity in characters. Characters are selected insofar are they are thought to index common ancestry. Traits subject to selection are viewed with caution.\n\n[This reemphasizes the point that races are genealogical based classes, the members of which owe their commonality to their ancestors having once shared a common breeding community. It also clarifies the point made by Darwin that when it comes to assessing affinity, resemblance in traits subject to intense selection should be viewed with skepticism.]\n\nIt probably does not need to be said that there has been some variability across time regarding how biological race was conceptualized. The above understanding, though, represents a, if not the, typical one, one according to which races were said to be descent based divisions of a species, the relationship between which was indexed based on ancestrally informative characters. Now, some object that this concept is radically different from that of Comte de Buffon, the later Blumenbach, Darwin, Deniker, Hooton, and others. I would like to see a demonstration of this, one based on primary sources. Others object that such a concept is radically different from our population geneticists’ and biological anthropologists’ “biogeographical ancestry” group, “population structure”, “genomic clusters” and so on, despite the fact that the latter concepts purport to cut out roughly the same types of groups, that the classes cut out in line with these nominally different concepts are little different, and that many critics of “race-thinking” recognizing the equivalence of the concepts and thus complain:\n\n“It appears that many scientists do not even believe this distinction makes a difference; they have concocted a thinly disguised euphemism for race they hope will not stir up as much controversy. Geographic ancestry has not replaced race — it has modernized it.” (Roberts, 2011) “One might fancy that typological days are safely locked away in the cobwebs of history, but the same typological thinking is still here, all around us (Weiss & Long, 2009). In one of its more rigorous forms it is called “structure” analysis, after the first of several programs that perform it (Pritchard et al., 2000)… It has become a routinely used approach by scientists who would not dream of using words like “race” and have no discriminatory or eugenic intent, but who may not be aware of the history of such concepts.” (Weiss and Lambert, 2011) “Race thinking in science is still with us today, despite a few brief retreats as recently as the year 2000. Increasingly, the use of race in certain geneticists’ circles can be seen as acceptable on several registers. Scientists who organize studies by race, even if they prefer the euphemism “continental genetic ancestry,” now hope to include racial minorities in projects with social justice and real capital effects.” (Fullwiley, 2014) “Thus, though the “population” concept is touted as an advancement in freeing genomics from racial bias, it is merely a terminological mask for “race” in genomics… The language employed to talk about “race” without talking about it overtly then takes the form of racial euphemisms like “population.” (Williams, 2015)\n\nPeoples and Races.\n\nChapter 1.\n\n[1] It is conventional to start with definitions of terms to be used. We will not define a human being because each of our readers knows one of them with special immediacy. Race has been considered a hard word to define, though it is probably no more so than many other commonly used words that refer to collections of events or objects. A race is: a division of a species which differs from other divisions by the frequency with which certain hereditary traits appear among its members. Among these traits are features of external appearance that make it possible to recognize members of different populations by visible inspection with greater or less accuracy. Members of such a division of a species share ancestry with one another to a greater degree than they share it with individuals of other races. Finally races are usually associated with particular geographic areas.\n\n[2] It is important to realize that we can describe races only on the basis of differences between populations. The frequency with which a trait occurs in a population can be evaluated only if we have a statistical sample. A single individual is not a race, and no single individual will match in every respect the average of the population from which he comes; most individuals, in fact, are quite non-average in one way or another. If we try to make fine distinctions in Europe, for instance, we will find that the differences between populations are rather small, and are confusingly overlaid with a great deal of individual variation. In this case, certain individuals could not be identified with any particular area, and we might say of a man, “He could have come from almost anywhere.” However, if we had a sample of a number of individuals from the same area, we would be more confident about deciding where the population came from: and the larger the sample, the greater would be our confidence. We might say, “There couldn’t be so many people who look like this anywhere but in nation X.” If we were to compare two very different population groups, such as Norwegians and Tanzanians, we might find overlap in a single trait, but not in the total appearance of an individual. Out of a thousand of each group, we could easily find a swarthy Norwegian whose skin color was similar to that of an unusually fair Tanzanian. And we could find a Norwegian with a kind of bushy hair that occurred sporadically among Europeans, and comes within the limits of variation of African blacks. But this hair form is not correlated with skin color in European populations, and it would be one-in-a-hundred-thousand chance to find the two variants in the same individual. Still to be taken into account would be many differences in facial features between the two races. In this case we could not probably mistake our aberrant Norwegian for a Tanzanian, though we might reasonably guess that he was from any of a number of places, and confess that he was an anthropological puzzle. Races, then, even quite distinct ones, can not be clearly defined in terms of one or a few characteristics; they must be defined in terms of their normal combination of traits.\n\n[3] The hereditary nature of the traits that are significant for distinguishing races is shown by the fact that when populations move from one part of the world to another, descendants continue to resemble their ancestors. Some Americans look European, and some look African, because their ancestors came from these regions many generations ago. If American born descendants of Japanese are taller and heavier than their parents, we do not say that their racial character has changed; we conclude that height and weight are only partly correlated with race because they are also affected by environment. Obviously there is a correlation between physical appearance and geographical area of residence or ancestry, but if there is a causal relation, it is not so simple or immediate that the children of Old World settlers in the New World grow up to look like American Indians. The nature of the relation between area and race will prove a very interesting one.\n\n[4] The importance of common ancestry in determining racial characters is also shown by intergradation between races wherever populations have been incompletely separated in the past. This effect, combined with individual variation within groups, makes it impossible to set definite boundaries to races, in most cases. In a simpler and more innocent world, before people had moved about we might have made a leisurely trip away from home, in any direction, and observed a changing appearance of the people we saw, that would have given us a realistic view of racial differences. A few hundred miles away we might have noticed that certain variations we knew among the people of our own village – blond, brunet; tall, short; beaky nose or turned-up nose – were commoner or rarer than we were accustomed to. We might have seen a number of individuals who would look rather unusual back home. As we went further, we might begin to see individuals who looked like no one we had ever seen at home; and farther away still, we might find a population in which nobody looked like anybody back home. At what point in these travels could we say we had met a different race? We had observed an increasing racial difference from the population at our starting point, but where would we draw lines between races?\n\n[5] If we recognized as distinct races only populations so different that no individual of one of them could ever be mistaken for a member of the other, most of the people in the world would not belong to any of our races. Only when people whose ancestors originally came from widely separated areas have later been brought into contact with one another by travel or migration, do we have a situation in which clearly different elements in a single community (that is, elements with little or no overlap of physical appearance) can be defined as separate races. This is an abnormal, and largely a recent, phenomenon, that has given rise in some areas to attempts to define race in a legal way. However, if we look at races in their natural habitats, continuity is the rule rather than the exception.\n\nHow then can we define a particular race? The answer is that we cannot. We can try to define the word race itself, but individual races, like many other biological phenomena, can only be described. Some have said that for this reason we should not name races, although we can measure degrees of racial difference between populations. It is quite likely, however, that we will continue to name races in the future, just as we name colors — though colors intergrade infinitely, and people often can not agree on which word to apply to a specific hue. Other sciences has similar problems of terminology. Biologists give names to “biomes” – characteristic plant-animal associations of different areas – which intergrade everywhere at their boundaries. And a geographer speaks of “climates,” although a climate is only a statistical generalization derived from variety of weather events that occur with different frequencies in different areas. Yet it is meaningful to say that the climate of Colorado is colder than that of Florida, even though there are many days in each year when it gets warmer in Denver than it does in Jacksonville.\n\n[6] Some races are grouped into “primary” races, which are unique or extreme in certain respects, and “secondary” races, which appear to be intermediate between neighboring populations. This is a relative matter, because nearly all populations have some distinctive features that cannot be explained in terms of mixture between any of their neighbors. One indirect inference from this kind of classification is generally wrong: the notion that at some time in the past races were “purer,” that is, more distinct from one another and more uniform within themselves, than they are now. This may be true, to a degree, in some cases: for example, in Europe during the last few thousand years. In the Neolithic period, populations were smaller, and regional differences may have been clearer at that time than they are now. But it is not safe to extrapolate this further backwards. Alternating periods of migration and isolation have probably occurred throughout human history, with race formation (that is, acceleration of regional differences) at some times and places, and race mixture at other times and places…\n\n[7] It is important to distinguish certain differences between human groups which, although they may correlate with race, are not the same thing. Sometimes the name of a nation is used as if it were a designation of race, as the “Irish race” or the “German race.” If the boundaries of these nations were quite permanent and well-sealed against immigration, the populations within them might in time come to be genetically meaningful units. However, national boundaries have often shifted in the past, and peoples have crossed boundaries, either in groups as invaders, or individually as immigrants, so there may be more difference, genetically, between different parts of a single nation than between adjacent parts of different nations. In the case of some large modern nations like the United States, extremely divergent races are present under a single flag. It is unwise, therefore, to use terms that confuse nationality with race. Languages do not define races either, though common language is sometimes evidence of common ancestry, and may be a guide to understanding the history of population movements and racial affinities. Language differences also inhibit communication and may thus discourage intermarriage. But languages can be imposed on groups by political means: the “Latin languages” of Europe do not define a “Latin” race; these languages are relicts of the Roman Empire, which, at its greatest extent, included a rather diverse lot of people. And in some areas, languages that are not detectably related may be spoken by peoples whose physical type is quite similar, as among the Plains Indian tribes of North America. Nor does religion define race. Though in some areas there may, for historical reasons, be racial differences between adherents of different religions. And race is not culture, though different racial groups in an area may have cultures that are different to a greater or less degree. Many dubious statements have been made in the past about causal relations between race and culture. If we define race in genetic terms, the only meaningful relation between race and culture would be the one that was the results of inherited differences in temperament and aptitude, which determined to some extent the various modes of thought and actions of various populations.\n\nChapter 3.\n\n[8] Thus, there are more races than most people think there are. In part, of course, the number of races we recognize depends on how we group together, in major classifications, various combinations of local populations that are distinguishable but not radically different. No one, so far, has reduced the number of major races to less than three, however. We will recognize three racial groups that correspond in a general way to the old popular designations of “white, yellow, and black,” and will discuss numerous varieties and subvarieties of these. Blumenbach’s “red” race of the Americas shares many characteristics with the “yellow” of Asia, and the two are generally classed together as a single very widespread, major race. Most of Blumenbach’s “brown” race would be included with them also. In addition, we shall call attention to other human populations, smaller in number, which cannot be honestly fitted into any simple scheme and should be considered races in their own right.\n\nChapter 13.\n\n[9] When we find two populations who are alike in many traits, though not all, and who live in geographically contagious areas, we naturally assume that they have been part of a single breeding unit in the past, and may still be to some degree. We will therefore class these peoples as member of one race, but make a distinction of subrace, in view of their minor differences. This kind of reasoning is less convincing when geographical continuity of residence is interrupted, and when genetic similarity is less conspicuous. In this case, we base our judgement of genetic relatedness on the plausibility, in historical and geographical terms, of former membership in a single breeding population, and on our assessment of the “importance” of traits the populations share as opposed to those they do not share. We can automatically discount, to a proper degree, traits that are known to be subject to immediate environmental effects on living individuals. Any trait is suspect of being subject to strong selection in relation to environmental differences will not be considered very reliable for tracing genetic relatedness far in the past, because strong selection may have produced significant local changes. Another reason for doubting the usefulness of a trait for tracing ancestral relation may be that the conditions are not genetically the same. We do not know, for instance, whether very dark skin that occurs in some widely separated and otherwise different peoples of the world is caused by the same genes at the same loci. We do know that what we call frizzy hair is not all the same when examined closely, and that different types occur in different populations… One solution to the problem of evaluating the importance of different traits in assessing relationship [is] simply to use as many traits as possible and assume that all are equally important, or at least that ratings of similarity or differences made on this basis are approximately correct. This may lead us to underrate relationship, however, where there has been intense selection or exaggerated drift due to small population size.",
  "latent_30108": "Earlier this year, molecular biologists announced that 20 per cent of nonhuman genome databases are contaminated with human DNA, probably from the researchers who sequenced the samples.\n\nNow, the human genome itself has become contaminated. Bill Langdon at University College London and Matthew Arno at Kings College London say they’ve found sequences from mycoplasma bacteria in the human genome database.\n\nThis contamination has far reaching consequences. Biotech companies use the human genome database to create DNA chips that measure levels of human gene expression. Langdon and Arno say they’ve found mycoplasma DNA in two commercially available human DNA chips.\n\nAnybody using these chips to measure human gene expression is also unknowingly measuring mycoplasma gene expression too.\n\nIn some ways, this is hardly a surprise. “It is well known that mycoplasma contamination is rife in molecular biology laboratories,” says Langdon and Arno. With any luck the discovery of this stuff in the human genome database will focus minds on the problem.\n\nA key question is the nature of this kind of information transmission. These mycoplasma genes are clearly successful in reproducing themselves in silico. One possibility is that we’re seeing the beginnings of an entirely new kind of landscape of infection.\n\nHere, genes that can masquerade as human (or indeed as other organisms) can successfully transmit themselves from one database to another. And if we think of this as virtual infection, a sure bet is that we’ll be worrying about virtual evolution in the near future.\n\nBut what to do? The level of contamination and the way in which it is spreading suggests that researchers are losing the battle to eliminate it. “We.. fear current tools will be inadequate to catch genes which have jumped the silicon barrier,” they say.\n\nMost frightening of all is the possibility that Langdon and Arno may have only scratched the surface. “Having found two suspect DNA sequences, it seems likely the published “human genome” sequence contains more,” they say.\n\nIf virtual infection is really as big a problem as Langdon and Arno suggest, we may well need to protect databases with the genomic version of antivirus software, a kind of virtual immune system.\n\nBut this in itself is likely to trigger an evolutionary arms race that selects genes most capable of beating the safeguards.\n\nClearly, this is a nettle that needs to be grasped quickly. That’s if it’s not too late already.\n\nRef: arxiv.org/abs/1106.4192: More Mouldy Data: Virtual Infection of the Human Genome",

  "latent_30294": "Steph Croft never set out to become a whistleblower. But in 2012 the financial analyst and mother of two teenagers began to realise something was going horribly wrong with schools planning. As president of the parents’ association at Willoughby Girls High School, she sent several letters to the NSW Department of Education and Communities about the urgent need for new buildings to replace demountables on the school’s small site. The department kept responding that they had “other regional priorities”. When Croft raised this with parents’ associations from other public schools on Sydney’s North Shore, many said they had sent similar letters. All had received the same dismissive reply.\n\nLed by Croft, these concerned parents began to gather and share information. The overcrowding in local schools was at crisis point. Almost every public school in the area was well over its intended student capacity, many with heavily restricted outdoor areas and no room for further demountables.\n\nSydney’s lower North Shore, it turned out, was experiencing the highest student growth rate in the state. Between 2006 and 2012, many of the schools had enrolment growth rates as high as 40% (one primary school, Lane Cove West, had a phenomenal 86%), far higher than the 10% growth rate for the wider northern Sydney region – itself already one of the highest rates in New South Wales. Willoughby Girls High and Willoughby Public had 1850 students on a combined site that, according to education department guidelines for recommended space per student, should only accommodate 450 students. Cammeray Public had 1000 students on a site designed for 350. Killara High School had 20 demountables on its school oval.\n\nDespite this enormous growth in enrolments, there had been almost no capital investment in lower North Shore schools in more than 20 years, other than the federal government’s “Building the Education Revolution” infrastructure funding for primary schools. And there was an 11-year backlog on minor capital works for local schools.\n\nSteph Croft and her fellow parents began to wonder: if the existing schools were already at or beyond capacity, where would the growing numbers of future students in the area go to school? And why had the department failed to plan for this massive growth in demand?\n\nI never set out to investigate schools planning. I’d initially intended to write a human-interest story about Cammeraygal High School, a new public co-ed school opening on the lower North Shore in 2015 – a feel-good piece about how a new school is created from scratch. I had no inkling of the overcrowding at local schools until I asked someone at North Sydney Council about the decision-making behind the funding of the new school, which was to open on a site that had previously housed Bradfield College, a TAFE senior vocational college.\n\nHe told me about a public meeting he’d attended, where a local parent spoke passionately and eloquently, marshalling facts and figures to make a strong case about the scale of the problem of overcrowding in local schools. He didn’t know much more about Steph Croft, but he believed the creation of the new school might in some way be thanks to her persistence.\n\nThe lower North Shore has long been seen as an area of wealth and privilege, filled with large houses surrounded by even larger leafy gardens. In fact, the area has changed dramatically in recent decades. Widespread construction of blocks of units to provide medium- and high-density housing began in the 1960s, and, since the 1990s, this urban infilling has intensified with major developments of high-density residential apartment buildings along the Pacific Highway corridor. North Sydney is now the second most densely populated local government area in Australia. Eighty-seven per cent of its dwellings are classified as medium- or high-density housing. (The Greater Sydney average is 40%.) Some areas within North Sydney Council’s boundaries have levels of socio-economic disadvantage similar to poorer areas in Sydney’s rapidly gentrifying inner west.\n\nThe public-school population has exploded due to these residential developments and other factors such as the current baby boom, elderly residents being replaced by young families, and high numbers of new immigrants choosing to live in the area.\n\nIt puzzled me that the education department had not anticipated the population boom. After all, the state government has a statutory obligation to ensure that children have local access to public schools with decent infrastructure, facilities and playgrounds. The department’s own 2003 review of school asset maintenance started off, “Australian and international research gives clear evidence that better educational outcomes are achieved when the school environment is well maintained and functionally suited to purpose.” I found several media reports on the overcrowding in local schools, but nobody could adequately explain how the department got its schools planning and enrolment projections so wrong.\n\nUntil I spoke to Steph Croft.\n\nOver lunch in the city, she continued the story she had begun to share with me over the phone. She wore an understated business suit and had her long hair tied back in a ponytail, and she spoke with a quiet sense of urgency and purpose. Earlier in her career, she had worked for many years at the Australian Securities and Investment Commission on compliance and corporate governance issues, and it was clear she had a sophisticated grasp of complex statistical data. I could see why it appealed to her to work methodically through the numbers, slowly building her case. I could also see that she’s a true believer in public education. Her passion for this issue is all-consuming, and her sense of outrage undiminished after working on this campaign full-time for two years as an unpaid volunteer. She seemed relieved, even grateful, that I was prepared to listen as she carefully joined the dots.\n\nOne of the first unsettling facts she came across in 2012 was that the NSW government, in its draft Metropolitan Strategy for Sydney up to the year 2031, had made no provision for necessary education infrastructure. This strategy called for 44,000 new residential dwellings on the lower North Shore and in the nearby Ryde area alone, and 29,000 on the mid-upper North Shore. It considered planning for employment, transport, recreational space and shopping centre facilities in order to support residential growth, but schools were not considered essential infrastructure. (Nor were hospitals.) There was no consideration of existing school capacity or future needs.\n\nCroft’s finding would later be backed up by the NSW Teachers Federation in a submission to the draft Metropolitan Strategy in June 2013 that criticised the strategy for making “little mention of education infrastructure in its plan to support Sydney’s 30% population growth over the next 18 years”. Infrastructure NSW’s State Infrastructure Strategy 2012–2032 also warned that existing schools infrastructure would need “major changes … to meet its current and future demand”.\n\nCroft decided to look more closely at the education department’s overall planning for schools. She discovered that the department was not taking this expected residential growth into account. Worse, the department’s projections for the North Shore did not include immigration into the area, nor the changing demographics of families living in units. In a letter she drafted for the Northern Sydney Regional Council of Parents & Citizens Associations (NSRCPCA), sent in September 2012 to the state MPs for the affected areas (including Barry O’Farrell, then the NSW premier), and signed by 30 member associations, the following outdated assumptions were identified:\n\ncurrent capacity issues were not foreseen or planned for, as it was assumed for school modelling purposes that all women on the North Shore would have all their children by the age of 25, and that families do not live in units.\n\nThe letter also pointed out that schools planning for the North Shore appeared to use the assumption that only 4% of local unit-dwelling households had children, when Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed the number was 29%.\n\nAfter receiving this letter, Croft says, many local MPs (including government ministers Gladys Berejiklian and Jillian Skinner) acknowledged the scale of the problem and provided strong support to the campaign to bring it to the attention of the education department. Several local councils, including Willoughby, North Sydney, Lane Cove and Mosman, passed motions supporting the campaign.\n\nBut in October 2012, at a meeting with state government representatives and department officials, Croft and her parents’ association colleagues were told that the overcrowding in lower North Shore schools was a “bubble” that would go away in five years. This was supposedly part of a 40-year cycle of natural population growth and decline: school numbers in the area were high in the 1970s, then low in the 1990s, were peaking again in the early 2010s, and would soon drop off again.\n\n“This suggestion that enrolment numbers would drop off going forward did not pass the common-sense test, especially given Sydney’s high birth rate and the Metro Strategy,” Croft says. “We became concerned that the government was being given fundamentally flawed information by bureaucrats for planning purposes.”\n\nAt that meeting, Adrian Piccoli, the state education minister, told them that there would be no new capital funding for northern Sydney schools. “They don’t need it. It’s not going to happen,” Croft remembers him saying. The department’s priority growth area, they were told, was south-west Sydney. But Croft had already done the sums: from 2007 to 2012, the number of enrolments on the lower North Shore alone had grown at three times the rate of the whole of south-west Sydney.\n\nCroft says she and the other parents always attended meetings together for moral support, but were often treated like “dummy mummies who didn’t know what we were talking about” by certain bureaucrats at the department. She tried to point out to them that the 40-year cycle approach no longer applies because of the trend towards urban infill and densification.\n\n“Our campaign was never about telling the government how to do its job,” she says. “It was about ensuring they had reliable information to make planning decisions – and it quickly became apparent that they didn’t.”\n\nSoon after the first meeting with the minister, the NSRCPCA organised a public meeting about school overcrowding. At this meeting, Croft pointed out another major suspected flaw in the demographic modelling for schools planning. The education department was using Medicare live birth data for its student number projections, but Croft and others had begun to fear the department was not accounting for as-yet-unborn kids who would start school in more than five years. In 2012, for example, the projections for 2018 were missing kindergarten children, and the projections for 2019 were missing both kindergarten and Year 1 children, and so on into the future.\n\nAlthough department officials never officially acknowledged that Croft and her colleagues were right, there was a marked change in their attitude within 24 hours of that public meeting. “Suddenly they were no longer denying that there was a serious schools capacity issue,” says Croft, “and they finally began to address it.”\n\nEarly in 2013, Croft and her parents’ association colleagues were alarmed to discover that the education department’s flawed planning model was being used once again to justify a recommendation that no new schools be provided to accompany a massive planned development in northern Sydney, the North Ryde Station Urban Activation Precinct.\n\nThis development would add another 2500 units to the area. Existing schools in Ryde were already at or over capacity and heading towards the same kind of acute overcrowding as lower North Shore schools. The worst overcrowding was in an area where a public school, Peter Board High School (itself the product of the 1986 merger of North Ryde High and Ryde High), had been closed in 1998 on the basis of projections that enrolments would continue to fall.\n\nCroft and her colleagues sent a letter to the Department of Planning and Infrastructure in May 2013, challenging the education department’s view that there was sufficient capacity in existing Ryde schools. They pointed out that the only public high school in the area, Ryde Secondary College, was already at twice its official capacity and had no more room for demountables.\n\nThey showed that the education department’s methodology in calculating Ryde school capacity was “simplistic and totally inappropriate”. The capacity of existing schools had been determined by calculating the average number of square metres per student available in all public and private schools in the area. (Private schools are generally more spacious, thus throwing out the average.) Any public schools with more than the average number of square metres per student were deemed to have excess capacity, regardless of the nature or quality of individual sites.\n\nCroft also reiterated the point that the education department’s model underestimated future student numbers by assuming that few occupants of the new units would have school-aged children. In reality, the NSRCPCA letter contended, the “actual rate of units with children in a particular area may be three or four times the standard assumption rate used by the education department”. They reminded the planning department that, according to the government’s own precinct planning parameters, a new development of that size should be accompanied by at least one new primary school and more than half a new high school.\n\nCroft had earlier made an application under the Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 for access to certain relevant documents. One education department document that was released was an asset management spreadsheet that recorded current school enrolments, enrolment forecasts for the next five years, numbers of demountables per school, and the total area of every public school in northern Sydney.\n\nOne of the parents’ association presidents also working on the campaign compared the department’s figures with calculated public school area, and discovered that the social impact assessment and planning documents for the Ryde development were overstating the existing public school area by 12 hectares, or the equivalent of two primary schools and one high school.\n\nA media source later told Croft that the planning department was quick to point out that all schools data had been provided to them by the education department, who in turn blamed a contractor who had used Google Maps to do the calculations. The education department released an amended version of the total public school area, but the figure was still out by 8 hectares.\n\nWere these planning oversights politically motivated, or were they evidence of incompetence on the part of the education department, fuelled by outdated assumptions about demographics and population growth? How far back did the dodgy numbers go? And why did nobody within the government notice that there was a problem until a concerned local mum began to look more closely at the numbers?\n\nMany advocates of public education in Australia have long accused both major political parties of underfunding and closing public schools while in power, and systematically selling the sites to private schools – especially in wealthier postcodes – as a quick fix to fill Treasury coffers and encourage the privatisation of education.\n\nJust over 25 years ago, during the tenure of the Liberal premier Nick Greiner, 11 public schools on the lower North Shore were closed down, and swathes of land at many of the now overcrowded local public schools were sold off as “surplus”, often to private schools.\n\nGreiner and his education minister, Terry Metherell, began their “rationalisation policy” in 1988, targeting 15 schools. The idea was to sell off “under-utilised” or “surplus” assets, supposedly to fund school developments in other high-growth areas of Sydney (at the time considered to be Sydney’s south, west, north-west, and central and north coasts). “Once identified as being surplus to the educational needs of the local community,” Metherell wrote in 1989, “a school … should proceed towards disposal.”\n\nIn spite of Metherell’s claims that this was “responsible economic management”, it was reported last year that these sales of school land had generated less than $30 million, half the $60 million that was predicted back then. Many of the public school sites that were sold off – including Balmoral Beach Infants, Milsons Point Public, Castlecrag Infants – were sold to private schools. Other sites – for example, Marsfield Public, Thornleigh Public, Naremburn Public and parts of St Ives Public – were sold to developers.\n\nThe education department stated at the time that “the key factors in identifying schools for closure are the demography of the given area and the accommodation capacity of schools in the cluster”. But many parents and teachers at the affected schools suspected even then that the department had got its modelling wrong.\n\nJust over ten years ago, under the Labor premier Bob Carr, attempts were made under the “Building the Future” plan to close or merge a further ten public schools across Sydney. At the time, Education Minister John Aquilina stated that the “not negotiable” decision to close these schools was due to falling enrolments – expecting that parents would then take their children out of the targeted schools, which would strengthen the case for closure.\n\nBut the Labor government’s plans were mostly thwarted by strong community campaigns against the closures and by criticism of the department’s planning and enrolment projections. At a public meeting about the proposed closure of Chatswood High, several participants noticed that the department’s demographic “expert” at the meeting was in fact a retired teacher of industrial arts from another local school, who had no formal qualifications as a demographer.\n\nA damning state parliamentary inquiry found widespread evidence that the government had decided to close the schools before properly consulting with parents and teachers. Hunters Hill High, Chatswood High and Marrickville High were saved, as was Erskineville Public, but other schools in the inner city and the east were sold off (Vaucluse High, Redfern Public) or merged (Alexandria Park Community School, for instance, was formed through the amalgamation of four schools). All these areas now face severe overcrowding in their public schools.\n\nDuring the Greiner school closures in the late 1980s, one of the most active anti-closure community groups formed to protest the proposed closure of Castlecrag Infants School. Bruce Wilson, the then president of the Castlecrag parents’ association, and his wife, a statistician, publicly criticised the education department’s enrolment projections at the time.\n\n“The department was relying on old census data instead of up-to-date surveys of catchment areas for the schools targeted for closure,” Wilson told me recently. “A simple survey would have identified that that school’s numbers were rebuilding, and increasing numbers of young families were moving into the catchment area.”\n\nWilson, who worked as a government lawyer for many years, submitted the first request under the NSW Freedom of Information Act 1989 in relation to the proposed closure of Castlecrag. “I had been part of a group of young, idealistic lawyers who suggested the scope and content of the proposed Freedom of Information bill,” he told me. “I didn’t expect that a few years later I would be involved in the first lawsuit under the FOI Act.” In Wilson v. The Department of Education, he accused the Greiner government of hiding land valuations and relevant demographic information during the proposed closure. Wilson’s appeal was successful: the court found that most of the documents in dispute should not be considered exempt from disclosure.\n\nThe Castlecrag community lost its battle when the school was closed in 1990, but the campaign continued. For four years, residents occupied the site and established 24-hour family picketing. When the site was finally sold to the Glenaeon Rudolf Steiner School in 1994, community leaders tried unsuccessfully to raise financial support to buy it back.\n\nPrimary-school children in Castlecrag now have to travel by bus to other schools, including Willoughby Public, where playground time is rostered as there is not enough space for all the students to play outside at the same time.\n\nMilsons Point Public, a small primary school built in 1887, was another school earmarked for closure in 1989. In response, North Sydney Council made a detailed submission to the School Closures Review Committee, challenging the education department’s demographic data. Many of the flaws the council identified in the department’s methods and assumptions are very similar to those Steph Croft uncovered 23 years later.\n\nThe department had claimed that North Sydney’s population was decreasing, but the council’s submission pointed to census data showing that it was in fact increasing. The census data also contradicted the department’s assertion that ageing of the local population would continue, instead showing an increase in the number of families with kids moving into high urban consolidation areas like Milsons Point. The submission stated:\n\nThe asset rationalisation programme of the Education Department is in conflict with the urban consolidation policy of the Department of Planning. Surely a more co-ordinated approach is needed … Threatened closures have turned into self-fulfilling prophecies. Parents do not place their children in schools that may be closed with the resultant declining enrolments justifying the school’s closure.\n\nRobyn Read, then the independent MP for the North Shore, described the proposed closure as “another deplorable example of the minister’s arrogant approach to education”, and accused Metherell and Greiner of deceiving the community. (Both had reportedly made assurances that the school would not be closed.) At the end of 1990, Milsons Point Public was closed and the site sold to the private St Aloysius’ College.\n\nThe nearby Cremorne Girls High community also fought fiercely to save their school from closure in the late 1980s, most memorably with a protest march of hundreds of students across the Sydney Harbour Bridge to the education department’s headquarters. The school, founded in 1926, was nonetheless closed at the end of 1987 (under the Labor premier Barrie Unsworth), and sold to private girls’ school SCECGS Redlands in 1990 (under Greiner).\n\nMargaret Gowanlock attended Cremorne Girls in the 1950s, and is publishing a commemorative history of the school this year. “It ripped the hearts out of the girls and the staff,” she says of the closure. “It was politically expedient for the site to be sold … The worst part was the dishonesty, leading the community to believe our school was safe.”\n\nThe closure of Crows Nest Boys High in 1992 was a slightly different case. The student community was diverse, with a large Armenian and Lebanese contingent. “Crowie”was sandwiched between two selective schools (North Sydney Boys and North Sydney Girls), and the mean joke at the time was that it was “rejective”.\n\n“We were the lost boys,” George Kahkejian, a former student, told me. “A lot of the public bus drivers wouldn’t let Crowie boys on their buses because they thought we were wild. But the teachers were amazing, and never gave up on us. Many of us went on to do some impressive things, thanks to that school.”\n\nNoel Thomsen taught at Crows Nest Boys for 12 years, and was devastated when the school closed. “There was no political will to save our school,” he says. “It was seen as expendable.” Teachers and parents tried to rescue the school by putting forward a plan to transform it into a senior vocational college. They felt blindsided when it was announced that the school would close. The site would be occupied by North Sydney Girls, and a TAFE senior vocational college, Bradfield College, would be set up literally across the road. “We’d done all this work, taken the consultation process seriously, and we lost the school anyway,” Thomsen says.\n\nThese communities lost their battles to save their schools. Now, their belief that those schools were closed wrongfully has been justified, as the government buys new sites at great cost so that schools can be started from scratch to fill a gaping need. For the students, teachers and parents who lost not only their schools’ physical buildings but also the rich community traditions that had thrived in them, it’s a hollow victory.\n\nSoon after Croft and her colleagues sent their May 2013 letter contesting the education department’s schools planning for Ryde, the NSW cabinet overhauled the demographic modelling systems informing the state’s planning. In August 2013, the planning department’s demography unit was revamped and given the job of providing consistent, evidence-based modelling across all government portfolios.\n\nThe major victory for the parents’ associations campaign was the astounding news that the O’Farrell government’s 2013–14 budget was allocating $70 million to new school buildings on the North Shore. In the Baird government’s 2014–15 budget, $400 million has been allocated to schools infrastructure across NSW, to create 256 new permanent classrooms.\n\nCammeraygal High School has just admitted its first cohort of Year 7 students, and is the first new school to open on the lower North Shore in 42 years. It will gradually build up to a Year 7–10 co-ed junior high school, with funding earmarked for a senior school.\n\nTwo further victories for the campaign are the new K–12 comprehensive co-ed school that will be developed on the University of Technology Sydney’s Ku-ring-gai campus, to open in 2017, and the new public primary school for 1000 students that will open in 2016 on the site of the former North Sydney Anzac Memorial Club. The Anzac Club became available as a potential school site thanks to North Sydney Council, which at a public meeting in 2012 passed a motion to “explore long-term leasehold with the NSW Department of Education and Communities”.\n\nExisting public schools in the area will receive upgrades or extra classrooms. A master plan is supposedly being developed to address overcrowding in Manly primary schools, which are currently bursting at the seams. (Manly Vale Public School, already at 214% capacity, is expected to grow by a further 40% in four years, while at Manly Village Public School, 28 classes of children are spread between 22 classrooms. The overcrowding at Manly Village is reportedly so bad that the former principal considered knocking down the wall between her office and the deputy’s office, turning it into a classroom, and moving her desk into the cleaner’s cupboard.)\n\nEducation Minister Adrian Piccoli has signalled that his department will also be “looking into solutions” for public school overcrowding in Sydney’s inner city, inner west and eastern suburbs, now all also at crisis point. Fairfax recently reported that enrolments at public primary schools in the eastern suburbs have grown by as much as 101% between 2010 and 2014; some in the inner city have grown by as much as 200% in the same period. The relocation of the overcrowded Ultimo Public has been funded in the budget (though stalled negotiations on the sale of the proposed site have caused delays), as has the upgrading of Bourke Street Public. An inner-city schools working party has been formed within the department in response to growing calls for a new inner-city public high school to meet rising demand.\n\n“These new schools and classrooms are very welcome,” Croft says, “and they represent a victory on behalf of the concerned parents and community members who would not give up this fight. They solve the immediate problem of overcrowding in some of our schools, but the wider consequences of the education department’s flawed planning and analysis are now having to be addressed across NSW.”\n\nIn March 2014, the NSRCPCA, led by Croft, asked the government to reconsider emerging school-capacity issues in light of the identified flaws in the education department’s modelling for northern Sydney and elsewhere.\n\nWhile schools are now considered “essential infrastructure” in the draft Metropolitan Strategy for Sydney, it has been reported by Fairfax that, by the department’s own estimations, there will be a shortfall of $7 billion in essential public school funding over the next two decades. Infrastructure NSW’s State Infrastructure Strategy 2012–2032 stated that in the next two decades Sydney’s student population will increase by a third, or 250,000 students. Fairfax recently gained access to leaked departmental documents that showed these student numbers would necessitate an additional 220 new government schools, for which the department is unprepared.\n\nMeanwhile, as the Sydney Morning Herald reported in October 2014, the boom in Sydney’s residential developments is set to continue, with the next three years bringing an all-time record in apartment construction.\n\nThe education department was evasive in response to my questions. A spokesperson stated that the department “is constantly monitoring demographic trends and planning ahead for future educational needs, which includes consultation with the Department of Planning and Environment, councils, and developers in Sydney and across NSW”.\n\nBut the education department is vast. Who is responsible for schools planning, specifically? The answer is the Capital Works and the Planning & Demography units within the department’s Asset Management division.\n\nIn the past three years, these units have gone through nine northern Sydney planners, at one stage three in three months. The units were restructured last year and, despite bad press about inaccurate planning, the number of in-house planners and demographers was significantly cut.\n\nA former department planner told me that previously there was one planner assigned to each of the regions within NSW, which allowed planners to engage deeply with local schools and communities. Now individual planners are given responsibility for several regions.\n\nAnother ex-employee says there is a toxic work culture within these units. Verbal abuse and active sabotage of other people’s work are common. “There have been some fantastic planners at the department, who proposed innovative and budget-neutral solutions,” this planner told me. “But most have left – sometimes only a few days after arriving – because of the dysfunctional workplace.” Several local councils have reportedly written letters of complaint about the unacceptably aggressive behaviour of certain department employees.\n\nDespite the announcement of funding for new schools and extra classrooms, several people I spoke to warned that the department’s planning and asset management incompetence is continuing as usual, and that as a result three- or four-storey schools of up to 2000 students on small sites will become the norm.\n\nErrors in the department’s tendering process have resulted in three overcrowded primary schools still not receiving their promised extra classrooms. Planning in St Leonards is apparently once again being done using the old assumption that households in two-bedroom units do not have children. The department is giving extra infrastructure to schools that are overcrowded due to high numbers of out-of-area students, contravening its own policy of only building extra classrooms on sites with high local demand. One primary school that will receive extra classrooms, for example, has 40% of its students coming from out-of-area.\n\nDepartment master plans to alleviate capacity pressure in local schools appear in many cases to have stalled. An opportunity to expand a particular school with major overcrowding issues onto adjoining council land was recently rejected by a department planner. In a council meeting, this planner suggested instead that the capacity issue be solved by putting more demountables on the school oval; the students could play in a council park across the road.\n\nThe department is considering selling off Frenchs Forest Public to the shopping centre next door, then redeveloping from scratch both the primary and high school on the grounds of the high school. Given the high cost of redevelopment of the joint school, the financial gain would be limited.\n\n“These managers are spending millions and millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money, but there is no accountability for bad decisions,” one of the ex-planners said. “In a couple of years, all these students are going to turn up on their first day at school and we will have nowhere to put them. Another Steph Croft is going to have to come along and tell the emperor he has no clothes.”\n\nA few sources now also suspect that Adrian Piccoli is planning a major sell-off of small schools (with fewer than 300 students), and any site not required for five years, after the NSW election in March. Up to 40 schools and currently unused sites across NSW – including at least four in northern Sydney – could end up on the closures and mergers list.\n\nWhether or not this turns out to be the case, what is certain is that the department is shifting to an American model of high-rise schools for the future. The approach increasingly seems to be to try to get a commercial return by selling off bundles of school assets, then intensifying the use of the remaining assets through building multistorey schools with large student populations on small sites with limited playground space. Late last year, for example, planning staff at the department were told by managers to investigate selling off half the Artarmon Public School site and building a four-storey school on the remaining portion, even though the existing site is already very small.\n\nPlanning staff were also told last year to identify any other sites across Sydney that could be sold off, and to look again into the possibility of selling off Hunters Hill High School. Once more, invaluable school sites and infrastructure might be at risk of being sold off because of short-sighted, faulty planning, and with limited consultation with the school communities themselves.\n\nLate last year, I wandered past what is now Cammeraygal High School. The building was unchanged at that point. The Bradfield College signs were still up, and the site looked in good shape if a little desolate: classroom blinds were closed, a potted palm in the courtyard had blown over, and the grassy patch within the quadrangle was overgrown.\n\nThere were two banners tied to the perimeter fence, one saying that Bradfield College would be moving to the TAFE St Leonards campus, and another announcing in capital letters: “NEW HIGH SCHOOL OPENING HERE IN 2015”. Something about the impersonal phrasing struck me as strange, with its suggestion that new schools pop up furtively overnight like mushrooms. Perhaps it was because the school hadn’t yet been named. (Some of the Crowie Old Boys had suggested it be called Crows Nest High School.)\n\nMichelle Calder, whose daughter Lilly is in the first Year 7 cohort starting this term, is pleased that her daughter will be able to spend extra time with her teachers before the other years are added. She says the new principal, Kathy Melky (previously deputy principal across the road at North Sydney Girls), is wonderful. “There is a huge sense of excitement among the children and parents,” she says. “We feel quite special being part of the foundational year for the new school.” In a supportive gesture, students at North Sydney Girls and North Sydney Boys will provide peer support for the students starting at Cammeraygal.\n\nSteph Croft is delighted about the creation of this new school, though she refuses to take personal credit for what has been achieved. “It was inspiring to see so many people coming together to work on the campaign,” she says. But she will admit that “it has been a huge commitment for our family”. Her own children will not benefit from any of the changes or the new schools that will be opening. (Her youngest finishes school this year.)\n\nWhy did she do it? “I care for our community. I want the government to have accurate information, so that proper planning happens,” she says. “And I like getting problems solved. The numbers and facts now speak for themselves.” She hopes that the significant victories of the campaign might bring some peace for the communities that lost their schools in the past. “I know these new schools don’t bring the old schools back, but it’s vindication of a sort, that the communities were right in protesting those closures. Maybe it can help to heal those wounds.”\n\nThe Melbourne situation\n\nCrowded schools are hardly unique to Sydney. The ACT government has closed more than 20 schools in the past decade, and a quarter of Canberra’s public schools may face overcrowding in the next three years. At Brisbane Central State School, where overcrowding has made playground injuries increasingly common, the government is considering selling some of the land earmarked for its expansion to a neighbouring private school. But only Melbourne suffers systemic problems comparable to those that exist in Sydney, and it is for similar reasons.\n\nBeginning in 1989, the Kirner (Labor) and Kennett (Liberal) governments instituted cost-cutting measures that closed some 350 schools across the state by the mid ’90s. Many were older schools in the inner city that had seen enrolments drop as families with young children moved further out. However, gentrification and densification have brought families back, and they find the remaining schools don’t have enough capacity and the sites of the old schools have been sold off.\n\nPort Melbourne Primary, for instance, will this year squeeze more than 700 students onto a site designed for 300. North Melbourne Primary has turned a staffroom and part of its library into classrooms to accommodate rapidly growing enrolments. South Melbourne has no primary school at all, though there are plans to open one in the next few years. In Docklands, the troubled suburb installed west of Melbourne’s CBD in the mid ’90s, people have finally begun to take up residency, only to discover that there is no school and the primary schools all around are overflowing. The state government has acquired a site for a Docklands school, but at present there is no funding to build it.\n\nMuch of Melbourne may face similar problems in the next 15 years or so, according to Peter Goss, an education researcher at the Grattan Institute. Last year, he analysed state government demographic projections that predict the number of school-aged children in the state will increase by 350,000 by 2031. Goss says this means that as many as 550 new schools will be needed, mainly in the inner city and in fast-growing outer suburbs. Martin Dixon, then the education minister in the now-defunct Napthine Liberal government, responded that his estimates put the number required in the next ten years at more like 60, of which his government had plans to build 13 (in public–private partnerships).\n\nThe new Andrews Labor government has announced plans to build an additional 11 schools. James Merlino, the education minister, says he “understands how critical it is to plan for expected growth in our outer suburbs and regions”. How these words will translate into action remains to be seen, but it’s a start.\n\nMichael Lucy",

  "latent_30847": "The Bakken formation in North Dakota and Montana has generated a lot of buzz in the past year. Reserve numbers in the billions of barrels, even tens or hundreds of billions show up in press reports and blogs. Now the USGS has weighed in with a comprehensive assessment of the resource. So just how much will this oil accumulation help the world's largest importer of oil? Is it time to relax or is this just another small blip in the long-term decline of domestic production? We'll examine these questions and others below the fold, using data from the IHS database.\n\nOverview of the Bakken\n\nThe Bakken formation is an oil-bearing strata covering parts of Montana, North Dakota, and Saskatchewan. Oil was first produced from the Bakken more than 50 years ago. Production was mainly from a few vertical wells until the 1980's when horizontal technology became available. Only recently after the intensive application of horizontal wells combined with hydraulic fracturing technology did production really take off.\n\nThe Bakken is one of many hydrocarbon producing formations in the Williston Basin, a sedimentary basin covering parts of three states and two provinces. The total layer of sediments in the basin can be up to 15,000 ft thick, and within that, the Bakken itself reaches a maximum thickness of about 150 ft., but is thinner in most areas. The depth to the top of the Bakken can vary from a few thousand feet in Canada to more than 10,000 feet in the deeper areas in North Dakota. In terms of geologic age, it was deposited during the upper Devonian and Lower Mississippian periods about 360 million years ago. The entire stratigraphic column for the Williston Basin is shown below. Figure 2 indicates 15 primary producing formations in the basin, including the Bakken.\n\nFigure 2 - Williston Basin stratigraphic column from Wikipedia\n\nThe Bakken shale consists of three members, the upper, middle, and lower. The upper and lower members are similar, and can be characterized as a gray or black organic-rich shale. The middle member is more like a conventional reservoir with siltstones, sandstones, dolostones, and limestones. The middle member has been a target for many horizontal wells, but more recently the upper and lower horizons are also being seen as important reservoirs. For a more complete description of the Bakken, see the 2001 USGS study Diagenesis and Fracture Development in the Bakken Formation, Williston Basin: Implications for Reservoir Quality in the Middle Member, by J Pitman, L Price, and J LeFever.\n\nTwo key properties of reservoir rock are porosity and permeability. Porosity is a measure of how much \"empty\" volume the rock has space available to store hydrocarbons, water, or gas. Really good formations can have porosities of 20% to 30% or more. Permeability is a measure of how easily fluid can flow through the rock. The best reservoirs have permeabilities of 1 to 5 darcies or more. (1 Darcy = 1000 millidarcies: better reservoirs are usually measured in darcies, and poorer reservoirs in millidarcies.) These high porosities and permeabilities can be found in many world class prolific oil and gas fields, such as the offshore Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe majority of currently producing reservoirs in the onshore US are by contrast much \"tighter.\" A pretty good reservoir might have porosities of 10% to 15% and permeabilities of 1 to 100 millidarcies (0.001 to 0.1 darcy). Reservoirs with those properties by and large would be considered very desirable reservoir in most of the onshore US and Canada. Moving downward on the scale of reservoir quality, many thousands of wells in the US are now being drilled in so-called \"resource plays.\" These are thick, laterally extensive reservoirs usually covering thousands of square miles, and filled with hydrocarbons, but they are difficult to exploit. The Bakken Shale, along with formations like the Barnett, Fayetteville, and Woodford shales fall into this category. Permeabilities can be in the range of .00001 to .01 millidarcies, with porosities in the range of near zero to maybe 10% or a bit higher.\n\nPorosity and permeability can vary widely and unpredictably over short distances. There are many stories on oil field lore about dry holes drilled next to prolific producing wells, with little explanation geologically about why this might occur. This phenomenon is one of the primary risks that oil producers take when they drill wells, especially in new areas or highly variable reservoirs.\n\nThe Pittman/Price/LeFever study cited above reports a wide range of measured permeabilities and porosities in the Bakken, but the average is low. One part of the report gives the average porosity and permeability for the middle Bakken as being 5% and 0.04 millidarcies.\n\nIn many of these very tight reservoirs, natural fractures play a big role. These are natural cracks which have low porosity but can have permeabilities one to several orders of magnitude greater than the rock fabric or matrix. Most of the better wells in the Bakken have encountered abundant natural fractures.\n\nEven with an extensive natural fracture system, often times additional help is needed to create an economic well. This is where hydraulic fracturing comes in. Fluid, sometimes with sand or other material (\"proppant\") is pumped at high pressure into the formation. The pressure is high enough to create large artificial fractures that can extend hundreds of feet from a wellbore. Proppant holds the fracture open, and creates a permeable channel to allow hydrocarbons to flow to the wellbore. Production in many, or perhaps most, of the producing formations in the US is improved by hydraulic fracturing. When hydraulic fracturing is combined with horizontal wells (and high enough commodity prices), many of the shale or resource plays become economic to produce.\n\nOil in Place and Reserves\n\nTo understand how much oil might be producible from the Bakken, we need to get there in a couple of steps.\n\nThe first step is \"oil in place.\" The Bakken is postulated to be both source rock and reservoir. Over millions of years organic matter is cooked under heat and pressure to produce hydrocarbons. In many areas, the oil created by the source rock slowly migrates to another location where it is trapped and later found as an oil or gas reservoir. In the case of the Bakken, these layers contain source material, but the hydrocarbon was cooked in place and little or none of the created hydrocarbon migrated to other potential reservoir rocks. The Pittman/Price/LeFever study estimates the volume of oil generated at 200 to 400 billion barrels, which we can more or less equate to an estimate of oil in place.\n\nThe next step is to estimate how much oil could be recovered (produced). For a reservoir such as this, the range of recovery can very widely. Good reservoirs with \"water drive\" can have recoveries of more than 30% of oil in place. As reservoir quality decreases, so does recovery factor. In very tight reservoirs, recovery would probably be in the range of less than 1% to around 10%, depending on many factors like porosity, permeability, presence of fractures, well spacing, etc.\n\nIn the good areas of the Bakken, with higher porosity and lots of fracture permeability, the recovery might range as high as 5% to possibly 15%. Typically only a few areas, or \"sweet spots,\" will have recovery this high. Outside the sweet spots, recoveries are likely to be much lower; the reservoir quality will deteriorate, with lower porosity, lower permeability, and fewer fractures, and/or thinner beds of reservoir rock. In these areas, recovery will probably be less than 5% of the oil in place, and in some areas less than 1%. Estimating recovery factor in shale reservoirs is more an art than a science; only after several years of production, and with very good data, can a reliable range of recovery be estimated.\n\nIn the less favorable and thinner areas of the reservoir, even though it might be technically possible to recover 1% or 2% of the oil in place, the risk may be too high to for an operator to be willing to spend $3 to $5 million or more, with no assurance that the well will pay out. In this case the \"technically recoverable\" reserves might be 1% of oil in place, but the economically recoverable reserves are 0% if an operator is not persuaded to risk capital to drill a well.\n\nSome of the recent articles have suggested a Bakken recovery as high as 50%, but that is highly doubtful in my view. Recoveries that high only occur in a few really good world class reservoirs, and, even there, often require secondary or tertiary recovery techniques.\n\nThe USGS 2008 estimate\n\nThe discussion above now gives us a context with which to understand the recently released USGS estimate. So far, only a two-page summary of findings was released. We do not have access yet to the detailed report that backs up the summary, but we can make a number of inferences from the information provided.\n\nThe USGS summary indicates that their estimates are \"undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources of the Bakken Formation in the United States.\" The term \"undiscovered\" suggests that the currently known reserves have been excluded from their totals. \"Technically recoverable\" has not been defined in the USGS summary; we will need to wait for the detailed report to find out their definition. In the mean time, one reasonable definition might be \"the volume of hydrocarbons that theoretically could be produced if enough wells were drilled to drain the entire known area of Bakken oil accumulation\".\n\nWe can contrast \"technically recoverable\" to \"economically recoverable,\" a term which can be taken as the amount of producible reserves that will give a reasonable return on capital invested. The volume of economically recoverable reserves will change as oil price, cost of wells, etc. vary. In reality, some of the areas of poorer reservoir will never be drilled because of poor economics: the cost and risk will not be offset by the expected recovery of oil. It is true that more of these marginal areas will be exploited as the price of oil rises.\n\nTable 1 - Probabalistic estimate of \"undiscovered, technically recoverable oil\", from the 2008 USGS Bakken Assessment (Note: MMBO=Million Barrels of Oil, BCF=Billion Cubic Feet)\n\nThe USGS estimated reserves probabilistically, as indicated by the P95, P50, P5, and mean values on the table above. (P95, for example, indicates that there is a 95 percent chance that the reserves value given will exceed this value.) Using the mean value as a representative number for the distribution, the USGS estimate that there are 3,649 million barrels of technically recoverable oil in the entire US Bakken accumulation. Associated with the oil production are 1,850 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 148 million barrels of NGL's. On an equivalent energy basis, about 90% of the energy value is in the oil, with the remaining percentage in the gas and NGL's.\n\nOk, so now we have an estimate of undiscovered reserves. How does that compare to known or discovered reserves? Our estimate is that the Bakken has produced about 111 million barrels so far in North Dakota and Montana. Although it's a rough guesstimate, we could say that perhaps 3 times to 5 times the produced volume constitutes \"discovered resources.\" This would include the \"proven\" category of remaining production from existing wells, plus the immediate areas around the wells, plus additional area that is more speculative but could yield some production. Let's be clear that the term \"total discovered resource\" is very fuzzy. Who is to say where the discovered technically recoverable reserves stop and the undiscovered resources begin?\n\nUsing the round numbers of 300 to 500 million barrels of oil discovered resources, we can then say that the mean USGS undiscovered resources are 7 to 12 times the size of the already discovered resources. Using the combined undiscovered and discovered resource estimates, we can take a stab at the implied recovery factor. If we choose the value of 500 million barrels for discovered resources, we find that the implied recovery factor (oil produced / oil in place) is 1.0 % = (3,649+500/400,000) to 2.1% = (3,649+500/200,000).\n\nWill Bakken ever produce as much as 4.1 billion barrels (= 3,649+500 million barrels), the amount suggested by the USGS estimate? It seems very unlikely. Production so far has been 111 million barrels. If the industry is able to discover several more prolific areas such as the Elm Coulee field in Montana (43 million barrels, or 38% of the Bakken oil recovered to date), it might be possible to increase this recovery to 500 million barrels, or 4.5 times the current production. Is total production of 500 million barrels likely? It's difficult to say. The USGS estimate is vastly higher than this, so much less likely.\n\nIf 500 million barrels turns out to be the ultimate recovery, the recovery factor would range from 0.13% to 0.25% of estimated oil in place. This very low percentage recovery of the estimated oil in place is not unreasonable if one considers that many of the more marginal areas of the field are likely to be deemed sub-economic and will never be drilled and produced. Technology improvements that will inevitably be made during an era of high energy prices will undoubtedly render some of this more marginal oil recoverable, but the total recovery is still likely to be low.\n\nThe USGS numbers are notable for their apparent certainty of the size of the undiscovered resources. The p5/p95 ratio is one measure of the spread or uncertainty of a probabilistic estimate. The USGS oil numbers show ratios of 1.2 to 1.9, which is quite surprising. These low ratios imply that the USGS is highly confident in their recoverable resource estimates. One would have thought that a 5X or 10X spread in this ratio would be more plausible considering that 85% to 90% of the resources has not yet been discovered. Perhaps when the detailed report is released, the logic behind this narrow range will be revealed. In the mean time, I remain highly skeptical that such a large resource with an unknown variability of fracture density, porosity, and recovery factor, and other factors, can be quantified with such precision.\n\nIf we could actually produce 3.6 billion barrels of undiscovered oil forecast at the P50 level by USGS, how much would this equate to? The US uses about 7.6 billion barrels of oil products a year, according to EIA data. This is equivalent to just under six month's US oil use, spread over a very long period, probably 20 years or more. If total production amounts to only 500 million barrels, as I have suggested, this would equate to about 23 days worth of United States oil usage, spread over many, many years.\n\nLooking at future production another way, the recent peak in production has been 75,000 barrels of oil per day (discussed in more detail below). Even if operators are able to triple this amount, the resulting production of 225,000 barrels a day (which would be a considerable challenge), will amount to only about 1.1% of US oil consumption, assuming the US uses about 20.7 barrels of oil a day, based on EIA data.\n\nIf we can reach 225,000 barrels of oil per day, the history of Bakken suggest this level would be short-lived - the peak production will probably last for a year or less - because as we shall see below, total Bakken production can be expected to decline to 50% or less of its peak rate within a few years, because of the steep decline rate of individual wells.\n\nBakken production history\n\nTo understand historical Bakken production, we utilized a commercially available production database (IHS) that contains monthly production for all Bakken wells in Montana and North Dakota. This database, while not in exact agreement with state data, is accurate enough to discern general trends. A cross check of state records indicates that the total production and well numbers for the individual states indicated by the database are within a few percent of those recorded by the individual states.\n\nFigure 3 - Bakken Montana and North Dakota daily production rates since 1971\n\nThe production history of the Bakken in Montana and North Dakota (Figure 3) can be divided into three phases, a) vertical well production prior to 1985, b) the first wave of horizontal well production up to 2004, and c) the second wave of horizontal production since 2004. Clearly the second wave of horizontal production has had a huge impact, which can be credited to several improvements over the technology of the 1990s. These improvements include, among other things the ability to drill longer horizontal and multilateral wells from a single vertical wellbore, and improved hydraulic fracturing technology. The first wave of horizontal well technology boosted Bakken production to an April 1991 peak of 11,790 barrels of oil per day (BOPD). Constrast that with the most recent peak in October 2007 of 75,000 BOPD.\n\nAs a quantification of the importance of horizontal wells, the proportion of Bakken horizontal wells (including multilateral), as a percentage of total wells, increased from 0% in 1980, to 50% in 1990, 78% in 1995, and 95% today.\n\nFigure 4 - Bakken Montana and North Dakota daily production rates since 1971, with number of producing wells\n\nIf we consider the number of wells being drilled, and how it affected production, a key point arises from Figure 4. There is distinct peak and rapid decline of production in 1991, even though the number of wells increased for two more years after the production peak. This is one of the harsh realities of oil and gas production, especially in tight, fractured reservoirs. The wells may individually reach peak production rates of 500 barrels of oil per day (BOPD), 1,000 BOPD, or more, but the peak is normally very short lived because it is followed by a rapid decline that can be anywhere from 20% to 60% per year for the next couple years. After an initial rapid decline, the well may produce at low rates and less decline for many years afterward, but usually high well rates anywhere close to the original rate can never be achieved. Combining many wells with this high rate / rapid decline characteristics means that it may be possible to achieve a high field production rate, but only for a short time, and drilling additional wells often will not be enough to offset the overall field decline.\n\nProduction of wells in a field is usually log-normally distributed. A few wells produce at high rates, and most of the wells produce at less than average rates. In a typical field the best 20% of wells pay for the other 80%. It's a numbers game - unless one is lucky enough to hit a big well on the first try, one needs to stay in the game long enough to drill enough wells to achieve an acceptable statistical average.\n\nThe field decline during the period of February 1993 to February 1997 is about 25% per year. If many new wells were not being drilled and put into production during this decline period, the overall decline would be considerably steeper. Note that after January 1997, the decline flattens somewhat; this would be the beginning of the long \"tail\" period of production from existing wells, characterized by low producing rates with shallower decline.\n\nFigure 5 - Bakken Montana and North Dakota average daily production per well since 1971, with number of producing wells\n\nIf we consider average production per well (Figure 5), we find that its behavior may be predictive of later field decline. The average production per well is simply the total reported Bakken production for the period, divided by the total number of wells producing during the period. If a well is drilled and goes on production in a certain period, the well count goes up by one, and the well's production gets added to the total. If a well becomes uneconomic during the period, and the operator stops producing the well, the well count goes down by one. In any given month, wells that come on at high rates of say, 1,000 BOPD, are averaged with wells already on production that may be producing 100 or 50 BOPD. If there is a population of wells already producing and on decline, bringing on more wells at temporarily high rates (the 1,000 BOPD may last for one month or two months max in most cases) will only raise the average production slightly.\n\nFor the first wave of horizontal technology, the per-well production peaked in August 1990 at 71 BOPD per well, with 142 wells producing. The per-well production then declined, even though additional wells were brought on production for the next 4 years. In August 1994, the peak well count of 235 wells was reached, but by then the average per well rate was only 22 BOPD. Interestingly and perhaps alarmingly, the 2nd wave of Bakken horizontal well production reached in August 2005 a peak per-well rate 116 BOPD per well, with 433 wells on production. Based on production in the early 90's this may portend a near term decline in Bakken total production. As of October 2007, however, the total Bakken production rate was still rising rapidly.\n\nEven if Bakken production should peak in the next year or two, this doesn't necessarily mean a permanent decline in production. Past history shows that some combination of new technology, new discoveries, and higher prices could lead to another uptick in production.\n\nFigure 6 - Bakken Montana and North Dakota daily production rates since 1971, with average well rate\n\nComparing per well rates and total producing rates in Figure 6, there was an eight-month lag from the peak per well rate in August 1990 to the peak Bakken production rate in April 1991. As was mentioned above the peak in total Bakken rate occurred in spite of the fact that wells continued to be drilled and brought on production during the next four years. We are now 26 months past the August 2005 per-well peak, so that's encouraging. That's 26 months up to October 2007, the last month plotted in this graph.\n\nFigure 7 - Bakken Montana and North Dakota daily production rates vs. cumulative oil produced\n\nLooking at the total Bakken production vs. the cumulative production (Figure 7) will allow us to approximate produced volumes of the two waves of horizontal technology. The first wave production curve indicates that if no new wells were drilled, the ultimate recovery would have been about 41 million barrels. The second wave of horizontal technology did indeed dwarf the first wave, and we can say that so far the second wave has added about 70+ million barrels of production.\n\nThe first wave of horizontal technology peaked at about 20 million barrels, with an ultimate recovery of about double that, or 41 million barrels. Using this analogy, if the industry were able to keep up the current rate of increase for the next two years, and reach a peak production at 150 million barrels cumulative recovery, ultimate recovery could reasonably be estimated as being around 300 million barrels, without additional new waves of development.\n\nWhat's next for the Bakken?\n\nBakken production is trending upward and should continue for some time. The October 2007 production of 75,000 BOPD equates to 27 million barrels per year, a substantial amount by most measures for the US onshore sector. This only amounts to about 0.4% of US consumption (using a base of 20,700 BOBP, based on EIA data), or 0.6% of US imports.\n\nDrilling activity in the Bakken continues at a frenetic pace. It's difficult to predict how long the upward trend in production will continue. Over the long term, economics will play a significant role in determining how much production will be expanded.\n\nConclusions\n\n1. The Bakken shale has produced about 111 million barrels of oil during the last 50+ years in Montana and North Dakota.\n\n2. Total Bakken production is still rising, and producing at the rate of 75,000 BOPD in October 2007.\n\n3. Because of the highly variable nature of shale reservoirs, the characteristics of the historical Bakken production, and the fact that per-well rates seem to have peaked, it seems unlikely that total Bakken production will exceed 2x to 3x current rate of 75,000 BOPD.\n\n4. The latest boom in Bakken production is driven by the application of horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing technology, which has added about 70 million barrels of production in 7 years. Ultimate recovery of the already-drilled wells should be at least double this volume.\n\n5. The USGS estimates the mean volume of technically recoverable hydrocarbons to be 3,649 million barrels of oil. This is roughly 7 to 12 times the size of already known resources.\n\n6. Based on current production and areas likely to be drilled, the USGS estimate of technically recovery resources seems optimistic.\n\n7. The Bakken potential resource, while large by US onshore field standards, will have only a minor effect on US production or imports. Using 2006 US imports and consumption for comparison, the Bakken undiscovered resource of 3,649 million barrels of oil, if subsequently discovered and fully developed, would provide us with the equivalent of six months of oil consumption or 10 months of imports, spread over 20 or more years. In reality, the reserves developed are likely to be many times smaller than this value.\n\n8. The October 2007 production rate of 75,000 BOPD amounts only 0.4% of US oil consumption, or 0.6% of imports.\n\n9. Per-well Bakken production peaked in August 2005 at 116 barrels a day, and was down to 79 barrels a day in October 2007. If the Bakken production history in the 1990s can be used as a guide, the peaking of per-well production may portend a peak in total Bakken production.",

Letting citizens participate in the movement would dangerously undercut the government’s authority.”\n\nThough the crackdown has the look of a purge of Xi’s political opponents, it appears that the Chinese government wants to reassert its power and curb corruption as a means of preserving the political standing of the elite.\n\n“They’re sitting on a powder keg,” Dietz noted. “The government knows it has to take this problem on in a way that doesn’t undercut them, and doesn’t reach up their level.”\n\nTiananmen: The day the world saw China's totalitarianism in action.

  "latent_30996": "First minister, in Brussels to lobby for remaining in EU, finds officials reluctant to enter talks on separate future for Scotland\n\nNicola Sturgeon’s hopes of gaining support for her bid to keep Scotland in the European Union despite the UK’s vote to leave have been dealt a blow after the Spanish prime minister warned: “If the United Kingdom leaves … Scotland leaves.”\n\nSpeaking in Brussels, where the Scottish first minister held a series of meetings to lobby for Scotland, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said that although he would gladly hear Sturgeon’s case, he was not in a position to enter into talks on Scotland’s future separately from the UK.\n\n“Scotland won the right to be heard in Brussels,” said Juncker on Wednesday. “So I will listen carefully to what the first minister will tell me but we don’t have the intention, neither Donald [Tusk, president of the European council,] nor myself, to interfere in the British process. That is not our job.”\n\nThe Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, was even stronger in his dismissal of Scottish hopes of avoiding being forced out in a Brexit.\n\n“I want to be very clear: Scotland does not have the competence to negotiate with the European Union. Spain opposes any negotiation by anyone other than the government of the United Kingdom,” he told a news conference following a summit of European leaders in Brussels.\n\n“I am extremely against it, the treaties are extremely against it and I believe everyone is extremely against it. If the United Kingdom leaves … Scotland leaves,” he added. Madrid has a troubled relationship with the separatist inclinations of Catalonia.\n\nSturgeon said she was not surprised at the Spanish position, adding: “I have a duty as first minister to find a way to give effect to the democratic will of Scotland.”\n\nEarlier, after a meeting with the European parliament president, Martin Schulz, Sturgeon said: “Scotland is determined to stay in the EU. I don’t underestimate the challenges that lie ahead for us in seeking to find a path.”\n\nScottish newspapers warm towards a second independence poll Read more\n\nSchulz said he had “listened and learned”.\n\nDavid McAllister, a Scottish-German MEP and key ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said he thought it was right that Sturgeon had come to Brussels.\n\n“I think it is fair that the Scottish voice should be heard in Brussels,” he told the Guardian, noting that the first minister had been “the most visible British politician on German TV” over the weekend.\n\n“In Germany, there is now a new interest in the Scottish debate and in trying to understand the argument from both sides,” said McAllister, who was once considered one of Merkel’s potential successors and is now one of the key intermediaries between the British and German governments.\n\nBut, despite the sympathy felt by many in Europe for Scotland’s predicament, Sturgeon’s hopes of ensuring the country remains in the bloc look likely to be crushed.\n\nAs made clear by Rajoy, Spain, as well as Belgium and other countries that are worried about separatism, would oppose any plan to continue Scotland’s membership, or allow it special status. Other countries are sympathetic to Scotland’s plight, but don’t see any way to bend the rules.\n\nAn EU diplomat said it was “out of the question” for Scotland to stay in the EU following Brexit, saying: “We are a union of member states.”\n\nIn Edinburgh, senior pro-EU Scottish Conservatives accused Sturgeon of making a tactical error by embarking on what one described as “freelance diplomacy” in Brussels without working first with the UK government.\n\nRuth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, broadly supports Sturgeon’s proposals to win special arrangements for Scotland with the EU but believes they have greater chance of being listened to as part of the official UK Brexit talks, once they start.\n\nProf Adam Tomkin, the Tory constitution spokesman at Holyrood, said: “Simply ploughing her own furrow will not work, and will make for an overall weaker case. Sturgeon has already had several rejections on this solo mission, which is why she should be teaming up with the rest of the UK to get the best deal for Scotland.”\n\nBrussels insiders are also loth to intervene in what they see as a British political problem that the prime minister, David Cameron, did not consider when he called a referendum.\n\nSeveral EU diplomats have said the only way for Scotland to be part of the EU would be to become an independent country and reapply for membership, a process estimated to take five to seven years.\n\nAll EU countries have the right to veto new members.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Scots voted to remain in last week’s EU referendum, but the country looks set to be forced out because a majority of English voted to leave.\n\nThe commission will have a bigger role than the parliament in Brexit talks, but is unlikely to be any more helpful in meeting Sturgeon’s hopes. A source close to the president said he would “be in listening mode”.\n\nTusk declined to meet Sturgeon. A source close to him said: “It’s not the right time.” Tusk, who represents national leaders, is concerned that meeting Sturgeon would lead to an avalanche of requests from other territories and regions. The European council president was also chairing an unprecedented EU summit in Brussels, bringing together 27 EU leaders, for the first time without the UK.\n\nCan Scotland remain in the EU after Brexit? | Sionaidh Douglas-Scott Read more\n\nScotland is not their top priority; the leaders are determined to show the union can survive following the shock of the Brexit vote. “Europeans expect us to do better when it comes to providing security, prosperity and hope for a better future,” states the summit communique.\n\nArriving at the meeting, Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, reflected the tone of the day, saying: “We have more need than ever for a united union rather than a disunited kingdom.”\n\nBut Ireland’s taoiseach, Enda Kenny, tried to help: he delivered Sturgeon’s message, that Scotland hoped to remain an EU member, to leaders on Tuesday, the first day of the summit.\n\nEU leaders reacted frostily to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, but an application to rejoin after Brexit has received more sympathy.\n\nThe SNP politician Alyn Smith has appealed to European colleagues to help Scotland, calling for cool heads and warm hearts. In a fervent address to the European parliament on Tuesday, he said: “Please remember this. Scotland did not let you down. Please I beg you … do not let Scotland down now.”",

When asked for their conditions, Shea said \"they're fine.\" Jersey City spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill said the two girls were not targets of the gunfire.\n\nThe church hall was rented out for a private event that was not sponsored by the ministry group, Fulop said. A witness at the scene this morning told The Jersey Journal she saw a young man run inside the building and shoot the victim at point-blank range.\n\nFulop, who said a loaded gun was found on the victim's body, emphasized that the incident took place at a \"crowded party\" and was not random -- a similar point he has stressed following several fatal shootings recently. Questioned if that was supposed to make residents feel better, the mayor said \"that's where the facts are today.\"\n\nWitness: Fatal shooting victim was shot at point-blank range at church hall According to a source with knowledge of the investigation, the shooting happened at around 11:30 last night during a party at the Pentecostal church on Communipaw Avenue.\n\n\"Whether it makes people feel safer or not safer, the facts don't point to a random act and I'm just conveying the fact that the victim was deceased with a loaded handgun on him and in the past two years we have had several similar charges with this individual,\" he said.\n\nShea said multiple surveillance videos of the incident have been retrieved. He did not confirm if the city's closed circuit televisions on the corner near the shooting were operational.\n\nAdditional information has not yet been made available by the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office.",
  "latent_31246": "Google's Larry Page leaving court in 2011. Yep, it's all been going on for that long. Image: Bloomberg\n\nAnother day, another trip down the swirling spite-tornado that is Oracle v. Google.\n\nLast month, Oracle asked for a new trial, claiming that Google failed to disclose key information prior to the most recent trial. Judge William Alsup has yet to rule on Oracle's request, but meanwhile, Google's lawyers are asking Alsup to find Oracle's lawyers in civil contempt of court. For all of the non-lawyers out there, it's basically just being in huge trouble with a judge, which is legitimately scary because judges can do all kinds of things like hold you in prison indefinitely.\n\nBack in January, the two parties were in front of Magistrate Judge Ryu, hashing out a discovery dispute. While in open court, in what Oracle calls the \"heat of argument,\" Oracle attorney Annette Hurst blurted out two numbers, two numbers so very secret that in the contempt hearing on Thursday, Judge Alsup threatened to clear out the courtroom in order to prevent reporters from hearing Google's confidential information.\n\nPreviously in #Googacle: Why the Very Silly Google V. Oracle Trial Actually Matters\n\nOne number is how much Google paid Apple to put Google search bar on the iPhone. The other number is how much revenue Android generates per year.\n\nThis is top secret information subject to a protective order.\n\nUnfortunately for Google, those two numbers can be readily found via a website known as Google dot com:\n\nIn the hearing, both sides performed a weird, coy dance around all mentions of the \"Google Information\" and \"Apple Information,\" which is still subject to a protective order that binds the attorneys who are in receipt of the confidential information, on pain of sanctions and contempt.\n\nDespite having been turned into what Google calls \"widespread global headline news,\" Google is still very insistent that Oracle redact such information in its briefs:\n\n\"There were articles all over the internet quoting the disclosure and quoting Oracle's counsel,\" said Bruce Baber, attorney for Google, in the contempt hearing. He tapped on his podium repeatedly as he spoke. \"They said, 'We always wanted to know the numbers around this Google/Apple deal. And now we know.'\"\n\nOracle's lawyers tried to explain themselves by providing a timeline of events. The confidential information was blurted out during a hotly contested hearing on January 14, 2016. Google attorney Robert Van Nest objected to the disclosure of the Google/Apple information, but didn't say anything when Hurst mentioned Android revenue numbers.\n\nFour days later, on January 19, Google's attorneys tried to get Oracle to sign onto a letter asking the court to redact those portions of the transcript. Before anyone from Oracle could reply, the magistrate judge denied Google's motion to seal portions of the transcript. Google filed a motion to reconsider on January 20, then due to a mistake, had to refile on January 21.\n\nAround 1 PM that day, Bloomberg broke the news that Android generated $31 billion in revenues, and then a few hours later, that Google was paying Apple $1 billion to use the Google search bar.\n\n\"The transcript vanished without a trace from electronic court records at about 3 PM Pacific standard time with no indication that the court ruled on Google's request to seal it,\" Bloomberg reported at the time. (The request to seal the transcript was officially granted the next day).\n\nIn other words, life comes at you fast, and Oracle made a mistake—but nothing worthy of sanctions, according to Oracle attorney Melinda Haag.\n\nJudge Alsup was extremely skeptical of Haag's position. \"Every good lawyer in this district with her experience knows, you could hand the document to the judge, you could ask to clear the courtroom, you could ask to submit under seal,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's important for you to own up and admit that it's a violation [of the protective order],\" he told Oracle's counsel.\n\n\"Even assuming it's a violation of the protective order...\" Haag began to say, when Alsup interrupted her with an exasperated noise.\n\n\"Your firm is one of the biggest litigators in America,\" said the judge. \"Next time you go into a court somewhere and you ask for confidential documents, I hope someone raises this and says, 'Your firm violated that order, and why should we give your firm access?'\"\n\nAccording to Oracle, because Hurst was not in bad faith, she and her firm, Orrick, should not be subject to contempt and sanctions.\n\n\"She just blurted out the two numbers that mattered. She just blurted it out,\" said Judge Alsup. \"If she had had the recipe for Coca-Cola she could have blurted it out in this court right now.\"\n\nGoogle's Bruce Baber said that it wasn't just about the disclosure. Hurst made an understandable mistake. \"There, but for the grace of God, go I,\" he said. But, \"The answer is not to dispute that there was a problem, to refuse to cooperate, to not take very simple steps to address it.\"\n\nGoogle says that when its lawyers first objected during that January hearing, Hurst \"quibbled and engaged in misdirection about the information\" instead of just agreeing to redact the transcript. Then, when she left the courtroom, she recognized a reporter, but didn't mention it to Google or the judge. (Google thinks she should have told someone, or even stopped the reporter and asked him not to report the story.) And later, when Google raised a fuss, Oracle attorneys kept filing \"no opinion\" replies, instead of doing what Google thinks they should have done—just go ahead and agree with Google, so that the judge would seal it quickly.\n\nIf Google's motion is granted, Oracle and its lawyers will have to pay Google attorney's fees for the various motions that were filed in the aftermath of the leak. In a $9 billion case, that's not really a big deal. The big deal is that an experienced trial attorney and her prestigious law firm might be held in civil contempt. Imagine the most popular girls in your high school having to serve detention, or Robin Thicke being forced to plunge his own toilet. It'll be a big shock if it actually happens.\n\nBut to make things even sadder for Oracle, the timing around the Bloomberg article doesn't suggest that a reporter heard Hurst drop confidential information in court, and then ran back to the office to break the news. The Bloomberg article was published on January 21, a full week after the hearing, and the day after the transcript became available.\n\nMaybe that's just the day that a reporter happened to read through the transcript. But maybe it was Google flailing around on the 20th and 21st, trying to seal the transcript, that actually tipped the press off. (Adam Satariano, who cowrote the article, says he doesn't remember what it was.)\n\nWhatever the case, Google is probably right that sealing the transcript faster would have stopped the news story from ever breaking. But the cat's out of the bag now, and Google's private information is out there for everyone to see, on Google. Maybe it should try using the right to be forgotten?",

Just in suitcases all neatly stacked against pillars, around the room, all stacked up, rifles placed all throughout. All kinds of monitors and electrical equipment he had in there. It just looked like almost a gun store,\" he said.Joshua said he saw shell casings all over the floor where Paddock stayed.\"I could smell the -- gunpowder that -- that had went off in the room. We were trippin' over guns. Trippin' over long guns inside. There was so many,\" he said.At least 23 guns - 12 of which were equipped with bump-stocks, or rapid fire devices - were found inside Paddock's hotel room.US authorities have received more than 1,000 tips, but are still struggling to determine what motivated Paddock, who did not have a criminal record, to carry out the carefully planned attack. No one knows when Paddock committed suicide, but the shooting stopped shortly after hotel security guard Jesus Campos and the first of Sheriff Lombardo's officers arrived on the 32nd floor.",
  "latent_31826": "Over the weekend, Black Lives Matter protests shut down several major highways across the nation and there’s a recurring scene in almost every one — semi trucks unwillingly taken hostage as a prop for protesters.\n\nAs protesters took their cause to march, severe traffic was a concern to all those on the road. But truck drivers faced a more serious problem when demonstrators stampeded their big rigs.\n\nOn Thursday night, in Oakland, California, thousands of people gathered to march downtown. The protesters continued their demonstration onto I-880, which shut down the freeway for several hours. Oakland police stated that around 1,000 people marched down the freeway, while others remained on city streets. Those stuck in traffic had no choice but to wait out the scene.\n\nSemis were used as platforms as protestors climbed on top.\n\nSeven people were arrested during the Oakland protest.\n\nThe demonstrations took a familiar turn in Atlanta, Georgia. According to police, protesters broke through Atlanta police and Georgia State Patrol barricades and blocked the downtown connector late Thursday night. Large vehicles were left with nowhere to turn. Hundreds gathered to protest.\n\nProtestors took over the streets and held a semi truck hostage in Atlanta.\n\nGeorgia State Police stated that anyone on the connector not in a car would be arrested.\n\nThe demonstrations continued throughout the nation. On Sunday, in Memphis, Tennessee, a group marched across the city and traveled onto the I-40 bridge in protest. It began as a peaceful rally of hundreds of people, but similar to the other protests, caused bystanders to be trapped inside their vehicles.\n\nTraffic came to a halt as the bridge was closed for hours.\n\nMore truck drivers were put into danger and demonstrations continued.\n\nWhile no truck drivers were physically harmed during the protests this weekend, the images reminded many drivers of the 1992 beating of truck driver Reginald Denny, who was brutally attacked during the Rodney King riots.\n\nDenny was attacked after stopping for protestors.\n\nSad but true, the men and woman who are supplying the nation with needed goods are becoming unwillingly trapped into these rallies.

  "latent_31849": "With the long-ago leaked information of Neil Gaiman’s Cybermen episode, the new TARDIS interior, some confirmed and unconfirmed episode names, and the questions left by the Christmas Special, there is not better time to talk about what I want out of the second-half of this series.\n\nFirst, let me say that ever since my introduction to the show in April of 2011, it has continued to be my favourite television show. The show incapsulates such a large range of thematic elements and hidden commentary, wrapped within generally clever writing and vision. However, to me, Series Six moved away from the brilliance of the show, and was often ridiculous fan-babble dribbling out of Moffat’s deranged mind. Now, there were certainly brilliant bits: the opening two-parter was good, Gaiman’s “The Doctor’s Wife” was superb, and the “The Girl Who Waited” through “Closing Time” certainly seemed like the Who I wanted. The rest, with the flesh, Hitler, time babies, solar flares, and the ridiculous and awful “question” upset me.\n\nFurther, I truly did enjoy the Christmas Special. The interconnectivity with Sherlock elicited the manliest of squeaks possible. I absolutely loved Jenna-Louise Coleman, and the character of Clara. Ian McKellen as the disembodied voice of villainous snow (The Great Intelligence) was brilliant, and it was wonderful to hear, “bow ties are cool,” once more. That being said, the special left me expecting more out of the latter half of Series Seven than before.\n\nPrimarily, I am obviously expecting a boatload of answers. I am not looking for fixes for the plot holes in “Angels,” (I want to pretend it never happened) but rather the tangled web that Moffat has weaved. Clara’s ability to be in different times, and die in them, is a gimme. The resolution of the Silence, and the stupid fucking question go hand in hand, and are another obvious necessity. On a different note, I would like some sort of explanation or acknowledgment of the fact that the first half was set backwards. The mention of Rory’s phone at King Henry VIII’s before it happened and the strange sense the Doctor’s knows of the Ponds’ oncoming departure in “Asylum” remain unexplained. After the issues I had with Series Six, I am worried, but hope that Moffat will not fail to answer the questions that he has provoked.\n\nSecond, I want me some Captain Jack. There were rumours of a Young Captain Jack on IMDb, and I would hope the adult version would pay a visit as well. Moffat intended to have Jack in “A Good Man Goes to War,” but hit scheduling conflicts with Miracle Day. Hopefully John Barrowman’s smaller role on Arrow does not prevent Captain Jack’s erection…erm, I mean, resurrection.\n\nI simply want to see Neil Gaiman’s take on the Cybermen. I have no doubt in his ability to deliver, and should not even bother providing anything further, as I expect perfection. On the topic of classic Who villans, I would love to see a starring role of a returning baddie that is not the Weeping Angels. The Master is a bit too much to ask for this season, but I could see some Ice Warriors, the Rutans, Zygons, Draconians, or even more Daleks in our future.\n\nAs for things I do not want, if we actually learn the Doctor’s name, I think it would be extraordinarily detremental to the core of the\n\nshow. The Doctor depends on the air of anonymity, mystery, and the vagueness of the Doctor character. Further, unlike some fans, I would not like to see the final date between River and the Doctor quite yet. River Song’s character deserves some interaction with a third Doctor, and a chance to develop beyond the somewhat stunted version Moffat has hitherto created.\n\nGoing into this second half, the optimism and cynicism the Steven Moffat has prompted within me provide a rather neutral tone of expectation. However, a fresh companion and new potential might push me a bit toward the optimistic side. If the show continues the tone and quality of the Christmas Special, we will see some brilliant Doctor Who. I hope that at least some of what I have written about pops up. Now I just have to figure out how to make it to April without new Who.",
  "latent_31894": "It had been two years since Cliven Bundy's Bunkerville, Nev. ranch swarmed with gunmen, many of them clad in tactical gear or cowboy hats - or both - and claiming to protect his constitutional rights against government incursion. Two years since he became a cause celebre for anyone who opposed federal ownership of Western lands, or restrictive environmental regulations, or government overreach, or government, period. Two years since, in the face of that show of armed defiance, federal officials trying to round up Bundy's cattle for illegal grazing opted to back down.\n\nAnd still, there had been no move to arrest Bundy, or to collect the $2 million in unpaid grazing fees the government said he owed.\n\n\"They're leaving me alone,\" the 74-year-old rancher told The Washington Post on an afternoon late last month, as he took a break from rounding up his livestock. He was still grazing his cattle on the scrubby swath of public land that had been at the center of his dispute with BLM officials. \"In this part of Clark County and on Bundy Ranch, we say we're the freest place on Earth.\"\n\nBut when Bundy left his ranch this week, that suddenly changed. The controversial Nevada rancher - whose two sons are already imprisoned for their roles in the armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon - was unexpectedly arrested by the FBI after arriving at Portland International Airport Wednesday night, en route to the refuge himself.\n\nBundy joined his sons Ammon and Ryan at the Multanomah County Jail in Portland.\n\nNo charges were listed in Bundy's jail record, and the FBI in Portland would not confirm the circumstances of his arrest. But the Oregonian reported that Bundy faces the same charge as his sons, conspiracy to impede a federal officer, though his is in relation to his face-off with the BLM two years ago. He is also facing weapons charges.\n\nBundy's arrest came just hours after one of the four occupiers still at the refuge had said in a broadcast phone call that they would surrender to law enforcement Thursday morning.\n\nBundy, who is something of a patriarch for this most recent armed conflict over land use, has been under federal scrutiny for decades. Since the 1990s, the Nevada rancher had been grazing his cattle on BLM lands without holding a permit or paying grazing fees, in defiance of federal law. The bloody sieges at Waco, Tex. and Ruby Ridge, Idaho still fresh, the federal government was leery of doing anything that might ignite a conflict with Bundy. So for a while, it did nothing.\n\nThen the long-simmering dispute came to a head in 2014, when the BLM tried to enforce the law by closing off the land and seizing Bundy's cattle.\n\nA ragtag group of armed anti-government activists came to his defense, and ultimately the BLM backed down. The situation slowly de-escalated and Bundy faded from the headlines, though he still owes the federal government some $2 million in unpaid grazing fees.\n\nBut Bundy surged back into public view when his son Ammon led the armed takeover of the Malheur Refuge in Burns on Jan. 2. The younger Bundy was arrested in late January after a traffic stop that turned violent. Though Ammon Bundy and others surrendered to officials, the group's spokesman LaVoy Finicum was fatally shot by Oregon state troopers after authorities say he reached toward a loaded 9mm semiautomatic handgun inside his jacket.\n\nIn the wake of Finicum's death and his own arrest, Ammon Bundy repeatedly called on his followers to \"stand down\" and said that they would now take their fight to the courts. But Cliven Bundy has been more defiant. In a post to Facebook a few hours before his arrest, the Bundy Ranch page wrote \"HEAD TO BURNS NOW!!! GATHER AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AND GO NOW!!! WE WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED!\"\n\nMike Arnold, an attorney for Ammon Bundy who was helping to negotiate the last four occupiers' surrender, was on his way to the Malheur Refuge when he received word that Cliven Bundy had been arrested.\n\n\"I'm extremely disappointed and quite frankly speechless,\" he told The Washington Post. \"It was a horrible strategic move to arrest Cliven while negotiations were literally happening on the phone. That is not a symbol of good faith.\"\n\nA few hours earlier, the remaining occupiers had said that they would leave the refuge at 8 a.m. Thursday if Nevada assemblywoman Michele Fiore, who is with Arnold, was there as a witness. Despite the news of Bundy's arrest, Arnold said he is optimistic that agreement will hold.",

There were nine brothers and it made you hard.\n\nWhen I was about eight or nine, I started boxing at The Stowe on the Harrow Road.\n\nIt taught me discipline.

They do take the piss.\n\nI watched that Guy Ritchie movie and thought, ‘That’s a lot of shit, that is.’ I mean, it was a good movie but I laughed off the stuff about the travellers. I wasn’t annoyed. Why would you get angry about a film?\n\nSometimes it feels like everyone wants to view our community like that. That’s not how it is in real life. There are all kinds of people – a lot them are wealthy and very clever and live like everyone else. There’s no reason for anyone to look down on them just because they live in trailers.\n\nThat’s what you see when you walk into our community. It’s just caravan after caravan after caravan with loads of kids running about.\n\nWe live in Wembley, about five minutes from the stadium. I’ve been there my whole life and, no matter how much money I make in boxing, I’m always going to stay there.\n\nI was always messing about. Fighting, jumping gates, telling people to piss off, sleeping in class, things like that. It was funny. The teachers didn’t look too kindly on me. ‘Hellraiser’ is an appropriate nickname.\n\nYou can hear the noise from the stadium from our place. It’s quality. It gets very busy on game days, like Tottenham home games and the Champions League matches.\n\nI’m a Newcastle fan. I supported them as a kid and just kept at it. I’m a true fan. I never left. Whether we were relegated, up or down, I’ve stuck with them. One day we’ll win the Premier League. I’ll catch them at Wembley when they play Tottenham in March.\n\nI’ll always live in the trailer. I live in a big one with my missus, Jennifer, and our daughter, Summer. That’s my life and I’m happy.\n\nMy family and my friends are all nearby. You can have as much money as you want, but we are happy and we wouldn’t change that for anything.\n\nMy daughter will stay away from boxing. If we had a little boy, I’d teach him how to box but I don’t know if I would want this life for him. It’s too hard. I know what I go through for boxing, how hard I train and everything that goes with it.\n\nIt will be up to him. He might not have the boxing genes, but he might. He would be a tough boy.\n\nThe world has changed. He would be looked after properly. He’ll play football or whatever sport he wants to do. I will put him through school.\n\nMy missus is very clever. They passed all their GCSEs and a few of them went to university. My kids will be doing the same thing.\n\nBEATING HORN\n\nSanta is going to bring me an early Christmas present this year.\n\nI’ll be taking the title from Jeff Horn and I’ll take it back to the family in Wembley. For Christmas dinner, I’ll have my belt in one chair and I’ll be in the other. We’ll be smiling at each other.\n\nI’ll beat Jeff. I’m looking for a hard 12-rounder.\n\nHe’s fought people a lot older, 40-something men, and lighter.\n\nI’m bigger, younger, fresher and I’ve fought bigger people at bigger weights than Jeff.\n\nJeff is known for using his head when he fights. I’ve been headbutted more times than I can count in my life. If he wants to try that, I’ll bite him. We’ll get on with it. He’s a tough, come-forward fighter like me, so we’ll put on a good show.\n\nJeff is already looking at his next fight. I’m not. Beating him is all I’m focused on. I’ve been in Brisbane preparing for a while now and I am confident I’ll be taking his belt away from him in front of his home crowd.\n\nHe doesn’t know the toughness of where I’m from. He’ll find out.",
  "latent_32021": "In the last month or two some of us got really enthusiastic about the Mibbit service and how it can be a relatively easy way to direct more people to the IRC channels where we can provide quick help. I got so enthusiastic that I wrote a blog post ( What is the last element of an infinite list or how to get started with Perl 6 ? ) trying to direct people interested in Perl 6 to use that service. Adam Kennedy wrote about how we added \"Live support\" to Padre. Two days ago I even added an icon to the Strawberry Perl for Windows distribution that will open a browser to Mibbit to join the #win32 IRC channel. Then yesterday Freenode has shut down the access to its service using the Mibbit web IRC client and offered their own webchat. That's bad. Not only do I have to fix my blog entry - which is easy but disturbing - but it also means all the current users of Padre 0.35 have a broken \"Live Service\" link in their application. Luckily, there are not many such people. So we have to fix the link in Padre and release a new version. that of course is not enough as I would like to avoid another such event so instead of pointing to an external service we are going to point to a web page on our site that will do the redirection automatically. It can even provide us with another chance to explain what is waiting for the un-expecting user. That way if the URLs change or services get shut down we only need to update a page on our web site and the users won't need to know about the change. So I started to build a page in JavaScript that will redirect the users to the relevant web based IRC channel. I added a few channels that were listed on irc.perl.org and a few that were not. I am sure there are lots of other Perl related channels out there that could be added to the list. Especially I am interested in locale specific channels so we will be able to direct the Italian speaking users to the Italian IRC channel. Please check out this page that I now call the Perl IRC Jumper. By looking at the source you can see the list of all the channels we currently have. If you know about other channels that you'd like to see there, either post a response here or drop by the #padre channel and let me know what else to add.",
  "latent_32343": "Throughout their 120-year history, Juventus have had a somewhat uneasy relationship with Brazilian players.\n\nCast your mind back to epic failures such as Diego and Felipe Melo, the pair who Alessio Secco banked on bringing the glory days back to Turin at the end of the ‘00s. The mere mention of Brazilian-born Amauri is enough to send Juve fans into a cold sweat and search for an alcohol-laced drink.\n\nThen you have the lesser-known failures, young players who amounted to next to zero: Athirson and Gladstone, who together made a combined six appearances. Hernanes, Lucio, Neto, Romulo; the list goes on.\n\nOnly Julio Cesar (no not that one), Jose Altafini, Emerson and currently Alex Sandro have acquitted themselves with any real dignity in black and white down the years. Juventus have built numerous teams around the talents of French and Argentine players, and even the odd Irish and Welsh superstar, but samba and The Old Lady haven’t been a great mix, like oil and water.\n\nDouglas Costa became only the 24th Brazilian to pull on the Bianconeri shirt, with the winger signing from Bayern Munich on loan with obligation to buy (since activated).\n\nMany believed Costa would be a natural fit for Max Allegri’s 4-2-3-1 formation. Allegri’s implementation of the system during the latter half of 2016-17 meant Mario Mandzukic having to sacrifice himself as a left-winger for the sake of the collective good.\n\nYet, it also meant there was no-one on the bench to freshen things up during the course of a game; all of Allegri’s ‘five stars” as they were dubbed in the Italian media, were generally on the pitch at the same time. Douglas Costa’s signing was an attempt to alleviate the pressure on Mandzukic and Juan Cuadrado.\n\nIn contrast to the blistering start of his Bayern career, where he laid on 10 assists in his first seven games, Costa’s opening months in Italy were disappointing. As is Allegri’s way with new signings, he slowly integrated the winger into the starting XI, only starting him in four league games up to the end of October. Costa, by the same token, hardly gave Allegri food for thought in those games. He looked remarkably off the pace and showed merely glimpses of what he’s capable of.\n\nThe player himself admitted he was still adapting to the stylistic virtues of Serie A. Whilst one can trot out the worn to shreds ‘Serie A is defensive and extremely difficult for attackers’ card, it is vastly different to the Bundesliga. While the cliché simply doesn’t hold up for teams in the top half of the league (and hasn’t for years), it certainly does for sides in the bottom half. Space is at a premium.\n\nIn recent weeks however, Costa has significantly raised his game. Never known for his willingness to defend in the past, he put in a fantastic shift in the 1-0 victory against Napoli. Indeed, Gonzalo Higuain’s goal came about from a Costa interception and a trademark speed-of-light shift on to his left foot before chipping the ball over Napoli midfielder Allan to Paulo Dybala.\n\nCosta’s surge deep into the Napoli half occupied the thoughts of Raul Albiol and Kalidou Koulibaly, which in turn gave Higuain the space he needed to slot home Dybala’s perfectly weighted ball. Costa’s contribution to what could prove to be a crucial win in the context of the season shouldn’t be overlooked.\n\nAnother solid performance in the Champions League against Olympiacos is further evidence that Costa is finally settling into his new surroundings. With unexpected title challengers Inter and Roma on the horizon for Juventus before the end of the month, this, combined with Dybala going through a particularly rough patch of form, means the champions will need more of the same from the Brazilian.",
  "latent_32717": "OTTAWA — A federal task force on legalized recreational marijuana is recommending storefront and mail-order sales to Canadians 18 years and older, with personal growing limits of four plants per person.\n\nThe framework report, headed by former federal Liberal cabinet minister Anne McLellan, says recreational marijuana should not be sold in the same location as alcohol or tobacco, and that production should be monitored with a “seed-to-sale tracking system” to prevent diversions to the black market.\n\nThe study gives shape to a Liberal promise to the legalize recreational pot consumption and sales, with safeguards in place to restrict youth access and choke off the illicit market that fuels criminal enterprises.\n\n“We have discovered that regulation of cannabis will touch every aspect of our society,” says the 106-page report.\n\n“One of the predominant features of our deliberations has been the diversity of opinions, emotions and expertise expressed by those who came forward.”\n\nThe 106-page framework covers everything from advertising and branding — effectively banned, similar to tobacco — to penalties for illicit production and trafficking, all legislated under a proposed new Cannabis Control Act.\n\n“Our advice includes safeguards that we believe are important to attain the objectives set out by the government to better protect the health and safety of Canadians by regulating access to cannabis,” McLellan told a news conference.\n\n“Our report presents measures to create a viable legal market, which will be essential to meet the government’s objective of displacing the entrenched illicit market that exists in Canada today.”\n\nOn the issue of pot-impaired driving, the task force recommends more study to determine the links between THC levels and traffic crashes while simultaneously developing a national education strategy to stress that cannabis consumption causes impairment.\n\nMcLellan said the report recommends a “public-health approach to minimize harm,” as well as actions “to educate Canadians … to increase awareness and knowledge” about cannabis and its impacts.\n\nThe task force also recommends government support to develop an appropriate roadside drug screening device.\n\nWe believe that Canada is well positioned to undertake the complex task of legalizing and regulating cannabis carefully and safely\n\nIt recommends that higher-potency pot be taxed at a higher rate than weaker strains, while limiting personal possession to no more than 30 grams and allowing for what the report calls “social sharing.”\n\nEdible pot products must not be “appealing to children” and cannot mimic familiar food items or be packaged to look like candy — an oft-cited concern with the fast-growing edibles market in U.S. jurisdictions where legalized recreational cannabis sales are already in place.\n\nUnder the framework proposals, dedicated, alcohol-free cannabis lounges and “tasting rooms” would be allowed, but rules would limit the density of cannabis storefront operations and keep them away from schools, community centres and public parks.\n\nWholesale distribution and retail operations of cannabis should be regulated by provincial and territorial governments, in close collaboration with municipalities, the report says.\n\nThe task force said it is taking a public health approach to marijuana regulation, while stressing that “Canada’s governments will need to move swiftly to increase or create capacity in many areas relating to the production and sales of cannabis….”\n\n“We believe that Canada is well positioned to undertake the complex task of legalizing and regulating cannabis carefully and safely.”"
