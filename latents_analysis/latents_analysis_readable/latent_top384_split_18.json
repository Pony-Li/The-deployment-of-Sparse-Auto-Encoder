Researchers, focusing on the nonmedical effects diabetes has on teens and young adults, found that overall, people with diabetes have a high school dropout rate 6% higher than those who don't have the disease.\n\nData on about 15,000 people were examined from four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The first wave included students in grade seven through 12; they were interviewed again about a year, seven years and 14 years later. The diabetes prevalence rate was 2.6%.\n\nAfter controlling for a number of factors, researchers found that those with diabetes finished about three fewer months of schooling compared with those without the disease. Once they hit the working world, those with diabetes had employment reductions of 8% to 11%, and a decrease in yearly earnings of $1,500 to $6,000. If that discrepancy stayed the same over the years, it could translate into a lifetime earning penalty of $160,000 per person over 40 years.",

Regions owned by players who disconnect during a multiplayer match can now be claimed by others. Additionally, damage status updates for Dreadnoughts, Juggernauts, and the Nexus will always play immediately so that you can respond to an attack right away. Campaign Improvements\n\nChanges in recent updates have caused us to re-evaluate some of our campaigns and how they flow. To ensure a more balanced and intuitive campaign experience, we've made several adjustments, including adding some advanced defenses to certain missions, updating grammar to fit with the voiced dialogue, granting access to certain units, pacing changes, and more. Map Updates\n\nThe call for more strategic diversity in our maps was loud and clear! We have made adjustments on certain playing fields that fix the proportion of Radioactives, which was previously too low. We also fixed some of those pesky spawn points and areas that were unbuildable on some maps.\n\nThe v2.65 update is ready and waiting for you in your Steam client!\n\nwww.ashesofthesingularity.com\n\nv2.65 Changelog:\n\nNew Scenario Splash Art\n\nWe have updated the thumbnails for most of the Scenarios so that each one now has their own unique image, instead of having a few shared among them.\n\nNew Benchmark Screen\n\nWe have improved the layout and appearance of the pre-benchmark screen.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nRegions can now be claimed from players who have disconnected from a multiplayer match\n\nDamage status updates for Dreadnoughts, Juggernauts and the Nexus will always play immediately\n\nBalance\n\nIn 2.5, we reduced the health of the Assembly to make it weaker than the PHC Counterparts to compensate for its versatility. Since it can no longer produce air units, we are restoring some of that health.\n\nIncreased Health of Assembly from 1200 to 1600\n\nOrbital Nullifiers (Structures) will no longer block capturing of regions\n\nCampaign Changes\n\nAvatar and Sapper advanced defences now available in most missions\n\nJuggernauts and Nexus Health upgrade now available on King of the Hill scenario\n\nImminent Crisis\n\nFixed some inconsistent grammar between the audio and text in Deneb\n\nMedic is now available in Deneb\n\nFalcon is now available from the beginning of Calethaon\n\nRemoved Dialog about Smarties in Calethaon as it felt abrupt and out of context.

  "latent_232": "Hello guys! Since I started modification and customization using Balden Arms, I kinda notice the Missile pod that was included in the pack. Initial reaction it was lame with out the front cover.\n\nThen it hit me like a raging truck. why not make physical missile heads into those holes to it would look more awesome. It got me thinking how to do this.\n\nThen one day, I realized that the runners (from any kit) mostly have the same diameter as the wholes inside the missile pods. What's better is that runners (i have a stock pile of it) come in different colors.\n\nBefore starting, here's what you need:\n\nHobby knife\n\nside cutter\n\nfile\n\nsuper glue (cement if you prefer)\n\nSTEP 1: To start off, we'll prepare the missile pods and lay them out and separate the front cover.\n\nSTEP 2: Using the runner/sprue, Cut the sections that match the diameter of the holes in the missile pods. I used red runner for this since it looks nice to see red warheads in a missile pod.\n\nTEST FIT : try fitting the runner into the hole and see how it stays in.\n\nSTEP 3: Once satisfied with its fitting, glue it down. Remember, this is just detailing the missile pods, its up to you if you'd like to create and manufacture the whole missile and fit it inside the hole.\n\nAfter the glue sets in, cut the excess runner.\n\nSTEP 4: Repeat the process for all the holes.\n\nIn case, of uneven lengths of the missile war heads, file them down to match the missile pod.\n\nTEST FIT : try fitting the new missile pod to your Gunpla. See how it gives more realistic feel for the missile pod?\n\nJust repeat the whole process for the other missile pod to complete the package.\n\nACTION POSE:\n\nTa~da! Missile pod now looks and feels like a true missile pod. Your Gunpla will look more menacing with this attachment.\n\nSo until next time :D\n\nFor any questions or other issues you'd like me to address, you may message me thru:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/aro9nes\n\nemail: andrewnaynes@gmail.com",

Grupos de narcomenudistas han aprovechado que los entornos cercanos a los llamados Bigotes –cerca del Metro Universidad– y los frontones –en la zona deportiva– les permiten operar con facilidad para la venta de estupefacientes.\n\nEsta situación ha preocupado desde hace varios meses a la administración del rector Enrique Graue Wiechers, por lo que personal de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) ha trabajado de manera conjunta con funcionarios de la Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) a fin de combatir este delito al interior de los campus universitarios.\n\nDe acuerdo con el Expediente Ministerial Gillette, al que tuvo acceso este diario, entre marzo y mayo de este año han sido detenidos ocho sujetos que son sospechosos de vender drogas en estas dos áreas de CU.\n\nEntre marzo y mayo han sido detenidas ocho personas\n\nLa investigación, de la que La Jornada posee copia, revela las fechas de las aprehensiones y los nombres de los presuntos traficantes, quienes están bajo proceso por su probable responsabilidad en la comisión de delitos contra la salud en su modalidad de narcomenudeo y posesión con fines de comercio.\n\nLa carpeta asienta que el 24 de marzo de este año fueron detenidos Héctor Yrag Chávez Silva, Miguel Mateos Chávez e Isac Rojas Ávila; seis días después, se logró la captura de Édgar David Luis Lara; el 27 de mayo se aprehendió a Leonardo Ismael Malvaez Rosas, y finalmente hace tres días cayeron David Israel Salinas Flores, Raúl Genaro Cervera Domínguez y Rolando Osorio Bermúez.

  "latent_512": "LLVM Weekly - #14, Apr 7th 2014\n\nWelcome to the fourteenth issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by Alex Bradbury. Subscribe to future issues at http://llvmweekly.org and pass it on to anyone else you think may be interested. Please send any tips or feedback to asb@asbradbury.org, or @llvmweekly or @asbradbury on Twitter.\n\nThere seems to have been a flood of LLVM-related news this week, hopefully I've managed to collect it all. If you're in London next week, you might be interested in attending my introductory LLVM talk on Wednesday. Abstract is here.\n\nEuroLLVM is of course taking place on Monday and Tuesday of this week. Sadly I won't be in attendance. If anyone is blogging the event, please do send me links.\n\nNews and articles from around the web\n\nThe LLVM-related news that has made the biggest splash this week is surely the announcement of Pyston, a JIT for Python targeting LLVM. More technical details are available on the Github repo. For many this immediately conjures up memories of the Unladen Swallow project, started by Google engineers with the same aim of JITting Python with LLVM. That project was eventually unsuccessful, but it's unfair to the authors of Pyston to assume it will have the same fate. It's unclear how much developer time Dropbox are contributing to Pyston. They clearly have a lot of work to do, though it's no secret that Apple are also looking to target LLVM from JavaScript which means they're not the only developers working in this area. Kevin Modzelewski shared some more info on the LLVM mailing list which details some of the LLVM work they've implemented so far (including some initial escape analysis for GCed memory).\n\nAn independent, non-profit LLVM Foundation is to be formed. As a vendor neutral organisation it will represent the community interest and aims to be set up by the end of the year.The initial board of directors will be Vikram Adve, Chandler Carruth, Doug Gregor, David Kipping, Anton Korobeynikov, Chris Lattner, Tanya Lattner, and Alex Rosenberg.\n\nRust 0.10 has been released. See also the discussion on Hacker News and Reddit. Rust is a systems programming language from Mozilla which uses LLVM as its code generator backend.\n\nThe Dagger LLVM-based decompilation framework has released its source as well as publishing a series of five articles documenting its implementation approach and documenting the next steps or 'TODOs'.\n\nAn LLVM backend for the Accelerate Array Language has been released. It compiles Accelerate code to LLVM IR and can target multicore CPUs as well as NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nThe PDF slides for a recent talk about the LLVM-based MalDiv diversifying compiler have been published. Such a tool effectively defeats signature-based matching of malware.\n\nOn the mailing lists\n\nLLVM commits\n\nMipsAsmParser and MipsOperand was rewritten. The improvements are documented in the commit message. r205292.\n\nThe ARM backend gained support for segmented stacks. r205430.\n\nWindows on ARM support is now possible with the MachineCode layer. r205459.\n\nTargetLowering gained a hook to control when BUILD_VECTOR might be expanded using shuffles. r205230. Targets might choose to use ExpandBVWithShuffles which was added in a later commit. r205243.\n\nX86TargetTransformInfo gained getUnrollingPreferences, which is used by the generic loop unroller. This helps to optimise use of the micro-op caches on X86. This produced 7.5%-15% speedups in the TSVC benchmark suite. r205348.\n\nARM gained a nice little optimisation pass that removes duplicated DMB instructions. r205409.\n\nAtomic ldrex/strex loops are now expanded in IR rather than at MachineInstr emission time. This cleans up code, but should also make future optimisations easier. r205525.\n\nClang commits\n\nThe clang static analyzer gained double-unlock detection in PthreadLockChecker, as well as a check for using locks after they are destroyed. r205274, r205275.\n\nThe OpenMP 'copyin' clause was implemented. r205164.\n\nThe 'optnone' attribute was added, which suppresses most optimisations on a function. r205255.\n\nThe heuristics for choosing methods to suggest as corrections were improved, to ignore methods that obviously won't work. r205653.\n\nThe 'BitwiseConstraintManager' idea was added to the open projects page. r205666.\n\nOther project commits",

  "latent_967": "At the Apps World North America conference in San Francisco, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak gave WIRED a wide-ranging interview, touching on everything from his preferred iPhone 5s color (he has all three) to the fictional operating system in the movie Her. But his most interesting comment by far was a heretical recommendation for his former company: Apple, he thinks, should release an Android handset.\n\n\"There's nothing that would keep Apple out of the Android market as a secondary phone market,\" said Wozniak–who, it should be noted, is no longer involved in the day-to-day workings of the company. \"We could compete very well. People like the precious looks of stylings and manufacturing that we do in our product compared to the other Android offerings. We could play in two arenas at the same time.\"\n\nSuch an iAndroid device is an unlikely prospect, to say the least, but it's not technically impossible. Android is an open-source operating system software based on the Apache Software License 2.0, and is available for any handset maker to adopt and develop. Apple could even fork Android, as Amazon has, to create a version of the OS more in line with Apple's aesthetic. (Apple would, however, need to separately license Google applications such Maps and Gmail to the device.)\n\nDespite how that suggestion might sound, Wozniak was generally bullish on his former company, rejecting the notion that innovation at Apple has stalled out. When asked about Apple's much-remarked-on failure last year to introduce a new category–such as a smartwatch or TV, both long rumored to be in the works–Woz countered that he believes Apple is waiting for the right time to release the right product.\n\n\"The great products really come from secret development,\" he said. \"You put small teams of great people on them and they aren't bothered by other people commenting on what they're doing while they're doing it. A whole new category of products doesn't happen very often. It might happen once a decade. Sometimes you have to wait for one of those to come about.\"\n\nHe also endorsed Apple's decision not to pour new features into the iPhone, arguing that feature creep is not the same as innovation. \"If you have something really good, don't change it; don't screw it up,\" he said. \"You pick up a Samsung phone and say smile and it takes a picture, but how much innovation is that? That's just throwing in a lot of features.\"\n\n\"People don't really choose their smartphones based on features,\" he added. \"I think Apple is superior at being able to say no.\"\n\nWozniak also addressed the future of the operating system–in particular the one featured in the Spike Jonze movie Her, which tells the story of an OS that not only processes natural language but thinks on its own.\n\n\"A computer can execute a lot of instructions, but it can't solve simple problems unless you give it an approach, and the human comes up with the approach,\" he said, noting that true artificial intelligence would need to overcome that iron law. Previously, he was swayed by Ray Kurzweil's argument that exponential curves in technology–Moore's Law chief among them–would make this leap possible surprisingly soon. But Wozniak worries that such curves can't keep going forever. \"I think Moore's Law is at the end, right now,\" he said. \"We're storing ones and zeros with 8 electrons, and you just can't get much smaller than that.\"\n\nEven with that caveat, though, when an audience member at his keynote address here asked him what he would work on today if he were a young developer, he was quick to reply: AI.",

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nThis is a repost from my blog, DevFromBelow, where I talk about game dev for the little guy.\n\nFor many, this coming week is going to be a busy one. Not only are there a number of significant religious holidays, but for us game developers it is also time for GDC, the Game Developer's Conference. If you are coming into game development from being a fan, this may be an event you've heard of, but not paid much attention to in your yearly wait for E3 - not many things are revealed or announced at GDC. Indeed, the panels that often get the most coverage are post-mortems of popular games or the occasional soundbite from a famous designer. However, one soon learns that, for developers, GDC is possibly the most important event of the year.\n\nSo how should you engage in the GDC bacchanalia? What if you're not there? What if you are there for the first time? What if you're one of the lucky few who got a volunteer position? This post will explore some tactics you can use to get the most out of GDC 2013.\n\nGDC for those at home\n\nLet's face it: GDC is expensive, and airfare isn't getting any cheaper. Many developers cannot make it, and that's okay. There are options for you to still get the most out of GDC.\n\nLive on Gamasutra\n\nI've previously extolled the virtues of Gamasutra as a communication hub for small developers. While many sites - IGN, Kotaku, Polygon, and the like - you will want developer-focused coverage of the event. Gama's staff are there to get as much information as they can from as many talks as they can attend. If you do not already have it set up as such, Gama should be one of your homepages for GDC week. Try to check in every few hours or so to see what new stories have been posted.\n\nIf you have a blog on the site, this may be a good time to post, as there will surely be a lot of foot traffic from folks like you who could not attend in person. You can both send and receive a surprising amount of information using this website during GDC.\n\nIn Vault we trust\n\nFun fact: GDC's organizers film every talk...IT'S TRUE! These videos are posted on a wondiferous website called the GDC Vault. The downside of this site is that a subscription to the member content is $495 a year. For those who cannot afford the fee, there is a plethora of free content available dating as far back as GDC 1996. If you are on the fence about the price of the site, remember that it covers over 15 years of GDC events - San Francisco, China, Europe, and Online - for that fee. Not a bad deal...\n\nChris Crawford's Dragon Speech - not in the vault but still wonderful.\n\nApply for updates on the GDC website\n\nIf you cannot make the conference yourself, it is possible to still get information directly from the event. GDC itself has a newsletter you can subscribe to, detailing upcoming events and other information. These e-mails also contain interviews with developers and other information for you to extend your GDC experience throughout the year. You can even learn about opportunities to have your GDC tickets for next year paid for by being part of the CA program (scroll down for CA info.)\n\nAttending GDC for n00bs\n\nSo you've made it to the big show in San Francisco - congratulations! Now what do you do? Depending on your badge type, you have access to a certain selection of events ranging from full access and summit passes to student admission to the career fair. So how do you get the most out of your first GDC? Here are a few guidelines to follow.\n\nRemember why you are there\n\nNintendo and other big publishers have booths in the GDC Expo hall for people to check out their new products. While it can be tempting to hang around in these areas trying the new games, remember why you are attending GDC and not PAX, E3, or other events: to meet and network with other developers. While it is great to check out new games, also take some time to meet and mingle with those around you or look at new the new dev tools on display. These interactions are much more important than trying new games.\n\nAnother application of this tip is how you react to other developers. For many, meeting their heroes for the first time elicits a few fanboy reactions. This is normal. However, it is important to remember that GDC is a place for developers to meet one another on a more even playing field than other events, so don't be intimidated by exchanging information with others. Maybe you've made a few games. Maybe they did well. Maybe they didn't.\n\nMaybe you didn't realize that everyone had experiences like this.\n\nOnce you realize that you're a person with a cool, creative job there to meet other people with cool, creative jobs, the intimidation factor lessens somewhat.\n\nBusiness cards are your primary weapon...\n\nHopefully, you came packing about 1000 business cards, because you are going to use them. Okay, 1000 may be an overstatement, but it doesn't hurt to have between 300 and 500 business cards on hand for GDC. My first year, I was at the end of an order and had only 25 left in my box. I was done by Tuesday (I made it to Tuesday because I was being conservative.) Give business cards to everyone you meet. Give business cards to those you realize are in San Francisco for GDC while you are not at GDC itself. Give business cards to people from GDC that you meet while you are being randomly selected by airport security for a search (totally didn't happen to me.)\n\n...but you have secondary weapons as well\n\nAlright Business Card Ninja, you're loaded to the gills. Now what?\n\nHow about a pen?\n\nThere are many things you can do with business cards to make them more effective and even have them help you facilitate visits to your website (which I will cover in a future post.) However, one of the biggest things you can add to your business card exchanging experience is bringing a pen. Why? Because this allows you to write down facts about how you met people on the backs of their business cards. At the end of GDC, you are bound to have hundreds of cards. While you will remember a few people, there are bound to be some Monday or Tuesday interactions that escape your memory. No one likes getting a \"It was great meeting you, we should keep in touch\" form e-mail (though you'll send out a million in your career), so try to write notes about each meeting to make post-GDC correspondance more effective.\n\nEat, sleep, take care of yourself\n\nRemember when I called GDC a bacchanalia earlier in the post? Well, there are also parties in the evenings during GDC put on by a variety of companies - true story! While it's tempting to go get your crunk on with your favorite game developers, remember that GDC lasts a whole week, and that each day is full of activities. Party lightly, pace yourself, and make sure you're standing the next day: you want to look not-hung-over if you are there to network or even job search.\n\nLost? Don't worry...\n\nThe Moscone Center, the conference center where GDC is held, is HUGE: it has 2 buildings and can be a huge trek to get across. If you find yourself lost, turn to the friendly Conference Associates (CAs) for help. CAs are volunteers who spend their GDC directing people where they need to be, checking badges, and many other vital functions. They are there to make your GDC experience better so don't be afraid to turn to them when you need help.\n\nHow do you know a CA when you see one? They are usually wearing a specially-colored version of the GDC shirt. They are also one of the first people you see when you walk into the doors of the conference, as they are handing out maps and other handy things.\n\nSpeaking of CAs...\n\nAttending GDC as a CA\n\nBeing a CA is a great way for small developers, students, and anyone who wants to to attend GDC. Typically, applications for CA positions open a few months before GDC. Applicants need to submit information about themselves and an essay on why they would like to be a CA. If you know previous CAs, you can also get recommendations from them.\n\nIf you were selected, first of all: CONGRATULATIONS! Second of all, see you in a few hours.\n\nAttending as a CA has its own set of guidelines that you have and will see in the CA training materials. However, there are also some other steps you can take to maximize your GDC volunteer experience.\n\nComfortable shoes\n\nCA's walk around more than most of the other people at GDC. Attendees typically go from session to session and get to do a lot of sitting. You, however, will do a lot of walking from building to building and job to job. As such, a pair of comfortable shoes are your best friends. I prefer a pair of running shoes, as they are made for long distances. By the end of the week, you will have no doubt put some mileage on them.\n\n\"Look Jenny...I'm all ready for GDC...\"\n\nWhile you may be a sandal or flip flop type of person, or may even just be psyched by the warm San Francisco weather (I know I am), practical shoes are a must as a CA. You'll be the last one standing on Friday.\n\nAll that stuff about taking care of yourself\n\nCAs come from all corners of the country to volunteer, meaning lots of great opportunities to network and find people to help with projects. However, they also brought their crazy mutant germs with them that are different from your crazy mutant germs. Taking care of yourself is of the utmost importance in this situation, as you'll be spending lots of time around a lot of people. You'll also be wearing your body out by constant activity. While you'll probably lose some weight in the process (looking good CAs!) you'll probably also wear yourself down a lot. Vitamin C sources like orange juice and Emergen-C are vital for the week of GDC, so put aside the Monster for now and take care of yourself.\n\nThe same applies for partying. First, follow the rules governing CA behavior outside of GDC - seriously. Secondly, John Q. Attendee can sleep off a bad hangover - YOU CAN'T. You have morning meetings to attend so you better look sharp. If you're running slowly because of your previous night out, you'll also do a much worse job helping attendees find their way around the conference, and that's no fun for anybody.\n\nAbundant networking opportunities\n\nNow to the good stuff. As a CA, you have an instant \"in\" with many at the conference. Not only is the CA program itself a hotbed of people to meet, but you'll be interacting with many of the attendees. While you should not take too long with networking interactions on the job, a quick exchange of business cards is often part of any GDC interaction.\n\nLikewise, the CA program is often a haven for small developers looking to get into interesting projects. If you have one, you should try to see if anyone's interested in helping. Likewise, if you're looking for a project, there are sure to be people with one they'd like help with.\n\nThat should cover most situations you'll encounter at/helping with/watching GDC. Following some of these tips, you're sure to have a great conference, learn a lot, and make lots of new contacts along the way.",

  "latent_1739": "The Belavezha Accords (Russian: Беловежские соглашения, Belarusian: Белавежскае пагадненне, Ukrainian: Біловезькі угоди) are the agreement that declared the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as effectively ceasing to exist and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place as an successor entity. It was signed at the state dacha near Viskuli in Belovezhskaya Pushcha on December 8, 1991, by the leaders of three of the four republics-signatories of the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR – Russian President Boris Yeltsin and First Deputy Prime Minister of RSFSR/Russian Federation Gennady Burbulis, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Prime Minister of Ukraine Vitold Fokin, Belarusian Parliament Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and Prime Minister of Belarus Vyacheslav Kebich. The original accord could not be found as of 2013 (see below).\n\nTranslation [ edit ]\n\nThe name is variously translated as Belavezh Accords, Belovezh Accords, Belovezha Accords, Belavezha Agreement, Belovezhskaya Accord, Belaya Vezha Accord, etc.\n\nLegal basis and ratification [ edit ]\n\nWhile doubts remained over the authority of the leaders of three of the 12 remaining republics (the three Baltic republics had seceded in August) to dissolve the Union, according to Article 72 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, Soviet republics had the right to secede freely from the Union. On December 12, 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR ratified the accords on behalf of Russia and at the same time denounced the 1922 Treaty on the Creation of the Soviet Union. While this is sometimes noted as the moment that the largest republic in the Soviet Union effectively seceded, this is not the case. Rather, the RSFSR appeared to take the line that it was not possible to secede from an entity that no longer existed.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of the failed coup in August 1991, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had been effectively dissolved and the republics were scrambling to pull free of Moscow. By the end of the summer of 1991, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside of the Kremlin. He was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who by the end of the fall had taken over most of the Soviet government.\n\nXerography of Accords\n\nThe preamble of the document stated that \"the USSR, as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality, is ceasing its existence\". It also invited other republics to join the three founding members.\n\nThese attempts to dissolve the Soviet Union were seen as illegal by what remained of the Soviet federal government. Gorbachev himself described the moves thus:\n\nThe fate of the multinational state cannot be determined by the will of the leaders of three republics. The question should be decided only by constitutional means with the participation of all sovereign states and taking into account the will of all their citizens. The statement that Unionwide legal norms would cease to be in effect is also illegal and dangerous; it can only worsen the chaos and anarchy in society. The hastiness with which the document appeared is also of serious concern. It was not discussed by the populations nor by the Supreme Soviets of the republics in whose name it was signed. Even worse, it appeared at the moment when the draft treaty for a Union of Sovereign States, drafted by the USSR State Council, was being discussed by the parliaments of the republics.[1]\n\nThere was some question as to whether the Belavezha Accords were enough in and of themselves to dissolve the Soviet Union, since they were signed by only three republics, albeit three of the five largest and most powerful republics. However, all doubts about whether the Soviet Union still existed were removed on December 21, 1991, when the representatives of 11 of the 12 remaining Soviet republics—all except Georgia—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the extinction of the Soviet Union and restated the establishment of the CIS. Given that 11 of the republics now agreed that the Soviet Union no longer existed, the plurality of member-republics required for its continuance as a federal state was no longer in place. The summit of Alma-Ata also provisionally accepted Gorbachev's resignation as president of the Soviet Union and agreed on several other practical measures consequential to the extinction of the Union. Gorbachev stated that he would resign as soon as he knew the CIS was a reality. Three days later, in a secret meeting with Yeltsin, he accepted the fait accompli of the Soviet Union's dissolution.\n\nHowever, for four more days a rump Soviet federal government continued to exist, and Gorbachev continued to hold control over the Kremlin. This ended in the early hours of December 25, 1991, when Gorbachev resigned and turned control of the Kremlin and the remaining powers of his office over to the office of the president of Russia, Yeltsin.\n\nGorbachev's televised resignation speech and the subsequent lowering of the flag of the Soviet Union and hoisting of the flag of Russia on the flagpole in front of the Kremlin was broadcast around the world. On this day, President of the United States George H. W. Bush, a former head of the CIA, gave a short speech on national TV in the United States to commemorate the ending of the Cold War and to recognize the independence of the former states of the Soviet Union.[2]\n\nAlso on December 25, 1991, the Russian SFSR, now no longer a sub-national entity of the Soviet Union but a sovereign nation in its own right, adopted a law renaming itself the \"Russian Federation\" or \"Russia\" (both being equally official).\n\nGorbachev's speech and the lowering of the Soviet flag marked the end of the Soviet Union in the eyes of the world. However, the final legal step in the dissolution came a day later, when the Soviet of the Republics, the upper house of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, recognized the collapse of the Union and voted both itself and the Union out of existence. The lower house, the Soviet of the Union, had not met since December 12 when Russia recalled its deputies from both chambers, leaving it without a quorum.\n\nThe Summit of Alma-Ata also issued a statement on December 21, 1991 supporting Russia's claim to be recognized as the successor state of the Soviet Union for the purposes of membership of the United Nations. On December 25, 1991, Russian President Yeltsin informed UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar that the Soviet Union had been dissolved and that Russia would, as its successor state, continue the Soviet Union's membership in the United Nations. The document confirmed the credentials of the representatives of the Soviet Union as representatives of Russia, and requested that the name \"Soviet Union\" be changed to \"Russian Federation\" in all records and entries. This was a move designed to allow Russia to retain the Soviet Union's permanent Security Council seat, which would not have been possible if the former republics were all reckoned as equal successors of the Soviet Union, or if the Soviet Union was regarded as having no successor state for the purpose of continuing the same UN membership (see Russia and the United Nations). The Secretary General circulated the request, and there being no objection from any Member State, the Russian Federation took the Soviet Union's UN seat. On January 31, 1992, Russian Federation President Yeltsin personally took part in a Security Council meeting as representative of Russia, the first Security Council meeting in which Russia occupied the permanent Security Council seat originally granted to the Soviet Union by the UN Charter.\n\nAftermath [ edit ]\n\nCurrent location [ edit ]\n\nStanislav Shushkevich, the former leader of Belarus was told by the country's foreign ministry that the original accords have gone missing as of February 7, 2013.

  "latent_1808": "Wow, so, where to start with this week’s Stick and Rudder? I guess I picked the wrong time for a vacation, and shame on me for forgetting the CitizenCon date! In any case, Star Citizen acquitted itself pretty well last weekend by most accounts, and whether we’re talking about Squadron 42’s A-list cast reveal, our first real look inside its single-player campaign, or the kick ass starmap, there was a lot to like at this year’s Con.\n\nLet’s start with the star map, both because it’s awesome and because you can actually play around with it courtesy of the RSI website. As per usual, Cloud Imperium went to a lot of trouble to design the thing with immersion in mind, and alongside the current browser functionality there’s a good bit of lore that explains how the ARK project is a multi-species cooperative created by the brightest human, Xi’An, Banu, and Tevarian minds in order to curate the ever-evolving galactipedia and starmap.\n\nThe latter is a public resource that allows for a god’s-eye look at Star Citizen’s universe, including planetary snapshots, travel routes, economic and crime data, etc. The web tool itself is pretty slick, even though CIG says that it’s currently in an alpha state. It features galaxy view, system view, and celestial object view options that tickle my cartography nerd fancy. You can navigate the three-dimensional star field via your mouse wheel and clicking and dragging, and there’s plenty of contextual object info via right-click. There’s even a routing tool that allows you to enter your departure point and destination, along with a search feature and some fun visuals related to jump points.\n\nThough the web utility is currently limited in terms of gameplay, it’s both fun to mess around with and more importantly it shows just how big Star Citizen’s universe has become. When viewed in context with the recent social module deployment, it makes me think that I may actually be tooling around SC’s persistent universe sooner rather than later.\n\nCloud Imperium isn’t resting on its laurels with the starmap’s alpha version, either. The firm says that real-time data from the game will be a thing, as will additional models for objects in space and possibly even support for orbital mechanics and virtual reality device integration.\n\nAside from the starmap, I was pretty keen on the Squadron 42 footage from this weekend’s CitizenCon. If you’re new to Star Citizen fandom, S42 is basically the (optional) single-player campaign that introduces your player character to the Star Citizen universe via a series of story-driven missions from the perspective of a UEE Navy pilot. S42 was in fact the very first bit of Star Citizen that we glimpsed way back in October of 2012, and I still spool up that original pitch trailer from time to time because everything about it — from the music to the camera angles to the aircraft-carrier-in-space motif — is basically my own personal gaming wet dream.\n\nAt the conclusion of S42’s single-player game, which Chris Roberts has described as a modern take on his classic Wing Commander, your character will join Star Citizen’s MMO-like persistent universe. Alternatively, you can skip the single-player story altogether and jump right into the PU.\n\nI’d recommend against that, though, since CIG is putting a ton of effort into Squadron 42. At the very least, it’ll offer you an opportunity to digest Star Citizen’s dense lore in an interactive manner instead of trying to assimilate all of the stuff that’s been written (and re-written) on the title’s website since 2012. In gameplay terms, Squadron 42 should also serve as a primer for those of you who aren’t too familiar with space sims, or a refresher course for people like me who played the crap out of them in the 1990s but have since become a little rusty.\n\nEither way, CitizenCon gifted us with our first extended look at the cutscenes, the motion-captured NPCs and voiceovers, and the mind-boggling levels of environmental detail on display inside Star Citizen’s spaceships. The recap video below, which clocks in at just under 12 minutes, also shows off the newly redesigned Idris interior, which your character can explore in S42 and later fly in the persistent universe.\n\nFinally, I’ve got to say a word about Squadron 42’s newly announced cast. Actually, let me say two words: holy shit. Normally I couldn’t care less about voice acting or A-list motion capture, particularly as it relates to virtual worlds which exist to facilitate player-driven stories. Since S42 is basically a single-player preview of the main event, though, I’m inclined to let my inner fanboy run wild and just appreciate the fact that CIG has lined up a who’s-who of geek icons.\n\nI thought about just thanking them for realizing teenage Jef’s Agent-Scully-in-space fantasy and ending this article before it gets too awkward, but they didn’t stop with Gillian Anderson! Oh no, they also managed to land one of the greatest actors of this or any other generation (Gary Oldman), as well as peerless character players like John Rhys-Davies (Gimli son of Gloin, Indiana Jones’ best bud) and Andy Serkis (Smeagol). Did I mention that Wing Commander alum, once-and-future Luke Skywalker, and the world’s best Joker is on board, too?\n\nAll in all, CitizenCon 2015 was a smashing success from my vantage point. I’ve written before about my on-again-off-again Star Citizen obsession, which is mainly due to the information overload that often results from Cloud Imperium’s commitment to transparent development. These particular reveals struck all the right notes, though, even the story- and cast-related stuff that normally elicits an eyeroll when it comes to online games.\n\nStar Citizen has certainly taken its lumps in the court of public opinion this year, but despite the silly rhetoric put forth by low-information and instant-gratification types, it remains the most ambitious project in gaming history. And it remains quite far along at three years, especially when compared to various megabudget virtual worlds that delivered fewer features after twice the development time. I didn’t really need anything to reaffirm my fandom, but this year’s CitizenCon gave it to me anyway.",
  "latent_1952": "WASHINGTON—While they acknowledged that getting behind such a plan might take a little convincing, the American populace admitted this week that they could, in all likelihood, be talked into another war.\n\nCitizens across the nation told reporters that, at present, they do not want the country to be involved in a foreign conflict, but given the right combination of reassuring political rhetoric and reasonably conclusive evidence, they could definitely see themselves getting on board with the idea and supporting a large-scale military engagement sometime in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Another war definitely isn’t my first choice, but if the president made a nationally televised address in which he looked directly into the camera and said that swift action against a brutal foreign regime must be taken, then sure, I might go for that,” said Minneapolis resident Elizabeth Compton, who noted that if the nation’s top leaders stated it would be a limited operation and would be led by a coalition of some sort, then she would be willing to hear them out at the very least. “In fact, as long as the president referred to it as a noble cause and mentioned something about protecting American interests or preserving the principles of democracy around the world, I think I could certainly come around to it.”\n\n“And assuming he used a firm tone of voice and had an assured look on his face while talking about the U.S.’s moral obligation to oppressed peoples, then, yeah,” she continued, “I’d say that would probably seal the deal.”\n\nAlthough they agreed it would likely take several days in which they heard various permutations of the sentiment that we have to take the fighting to them before they can take it home to us, the nation’s 317 million citizens said they could definitely picture themselves eventually warming up to a plan that would deploy thousands of servicemen and servicewomen overseas and earmark billions of dollars for a mission with no defined timetable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a nationwide poll, three quarters of Americans acknowledged they could be coaxed into another war provided proponents avoided the word “war” altogether and instead referred to it as a “combat operation” or a “preemptive strike,” while 81 percent said they wouldn’t put up too much of a fuss at all if Pentagon officials stated that the targeted regime might be harboring terrorists, extremists, evildoers, enemies of freedom, or similarly described groups of individuals.\n\nAdditionally, a full 92 percent of Americans claimed that they would by no means be opposed to signing on for a full-scale invasion in the event that such an action were repeatedly cast as a response to events that could be categorized as “atrocities.” These individuals added that officials wouldn’t even have to twist their arms too much so long as their claims were supported by pictures or footage of refugees fleeing their homes with only what possessions they could carry, particularly if they had several frightened young children in tow.\n\n“Look, I’m not just going to buy into something like this because I hear a couple TV personalities droning on about it—I need to see a four-star general appear on Meet The Press and declare that we must act decisively, and then I need to see that clip of him saying those words played again and again on different news shows,” Phoenix resident Christopher Thornton said, noting that he could definitely get behind the plan if proponents offered some sort of grainy photo that looked conceivably like a stronghold or a chemical weapons storage site. “Then I’d need to see some trusted high-ranking official make some sort of point about America’s longstanding leadership role in geopolitical affairs. And supposing he made sure to praise the troops for their selfless sacrifice every step of the way, he’d have me in his corner sooner or later.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Honestly, by the time he said that ‘We didn’t choose this war; this war chose us,’ I’d pretty much be good to go,” Thornton added.\n\nMembers of the U.S. populace also told reporters that another war would be right up their alley if the national news media used words and phrases similar to the ones spoken by politicians and military leaders. Moreover, the American populace said they’d most likely be fine with using ground troops if, after listening to a very short and general description of the operation, they then heard leaders loosely transition to an impassioned commentary about patriotism in which they mentioned that the freedoms we all enjoy have been the result of sacrifice.\n\n“Look, if they want me in on this thing, it would really help everything along if a few op-eds or radio hosts painted the enemy as nothing but a murderous tyrant who must be removed, without once touching on the feasibility of establishing a new government once that adversary is gone,” said Dale Rodgers of Toledo, OH. “Then, by the time I watched a panel of cable pundits agree on the importance of supporting our leaders in times of conflict, I’d be primed for Congress to pass a joint resolution authorizing an open-ended military campaign, especially if it was called ‘Operation Eternal Justice’ or something like that. Yeah, that would do the trick.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“You know, I’m actually getting more and more into the idea just talking about it right now,” he added.",
  "latent_2058": "Economists have traditionally said that the health care sector is \"recession-proof.\"\n\nThey should add another label: Revision-proof.\n\nFor one month last year, a little-noticed Bureau of Labor Statistics revision made it appear that the health care sector had shed jobs—the first time that would have happened since July 2003.\n\nAnd in some ways, that's exactly what economists have been expecting since national health care spending started slowing down several years ago. That the health care sector, traditionally booming, might undergo a few fits and starts as a result.\n\nBut the next BLS jobs report quickly revised the figure again, back to a positive number. Which meant that health care remains on a peerless path of adding jobs—2.85 million of them, to be exact, since the last month that the sector was forced to slightly shrink.\n\nNo other part of the economy can boast anything close.\n\nUpdate: Of course, the morning after this post went live, BLS announced that health care jobs fell in December. We'll see if that estimate holds up or gets revised again.\n\nCompeting trends\n\nBased only on job creation, 2013 will end up being another solid year for the health sector, with more than 200,000 jobs added. We'll get a better picture on Friday, when BLS releases a new report containing preliminary December data.\n\nAnd government officials are bullish that the sector will keep growing—and fast. The Labor Department issued a report last month projecting that health care will represent about one-third of all new U.S. jobs created by 2022, adding 4.5 million new positions to the economy. That's about 250,000 jobs per year, which is in line with health care's annual average.\n\nEconomists have long seized on such consistent growth in health jobs to help explained the nation's consistent growth in health spending, too. When graphed, U.S. health care employment resembles a steady, straight line, going up and up by about 2% per year. And it's plausible that a work force that expands even as other parts of the economy shrink—as health care did during the nation's Great Recession—would be a key driver of the famed health care cost curve.\n\nBut that cost curve isn't going up quite so fast these days: Figures released this week show health care spending has been growing at a historically slow pace since 2009.\n\nHow slow? As Sarah Kliff writes at the Washington Post's \"Wonkblog,\" health care as a share of the economy even ticked down one percentage point last year, for the first time since the late 1990s.\n\nTaken together, the two data sets represent a mystery that's puzzled every economist I've asked: If health spending is dramatically slowing, how can jobs keep growing? Especially at the same rate that health care jobs have always grown?\n\nThere are a handful of theories, of course. That wages are slowing down. (They're not.) That only lower-paying jobs are growing. (It doesn't seem to be the case.) One of the more credible explanations, advanced by Harvard's David Cutler and several others, is that spending has slowed down as pharmaceutical patents expire and more generics hit the market. But it's a stretch to pin the entire slowdown solely on that trend.\n\nWhy the bend in the cost curve may not last\n\nWith health care spending trends back in the news this week, most analysis centered on the Affordable Care Act's role—or lack thereof—in slowing costs. And experts also debated what could potentially drive national spending back up, looking at factors like the ACA helping millions of Americans gain access to health insurance, or the continued growth of health IT.\n\nAlmost no one considered the interplay between jobs and spending. But that's exactly what a recent Brookings Institution paper from Amitabh Chandra, Jonathan Holmes, and Jonathan Skinner did.\n\n\"Is this time different?\" the authors ask. \"Has health care cost growth really moderated?\" And while the authors do conclude—cautiously—that the sector's spending may grow at a lower rate than in years past, they also note that it's tough to expect a permanent slowdown given the \"remarkable stability\" in health care jobs growth.\n\n\"Since 57 percent of overall health care expenditures are labor costs,\" they dryly write, \"it seems unlikely ... to see a permanent bending of the cost curve without a commensurate shift in employment rates.\"\n\nUpdate, Jan. 10, 1:30 p.m.: In a semi-surprise, the BLS announced this morning that the health care sector lost about 6,000 jobs in December. I've written more on the Advisory Board's Daily Briefing blog, but the lessons from a few months ago stand: That number will be revised at least two more times (up or down, we don't know yet), and an isolated dip means little if the broad trend is strong in the other direction.",
  "latent_2082": "With nearly a week-long stay planned for New Orleans, I recently searched out an overnight escape to the “countryside.” For a food-oriented trip, Oxford (MS) was at the top of my list, but I didn’t want to spend so much time driving, so I targeted towns within a three-hour drive of the Crescent City.\n\nI’d heard good things about Lafayette, and with desire to explore a bit of Cajun country, this small city made the most sense for a visit. It’s got a budding food reputation, the music scene is fine, and there are enough activities and attractions to easily fill a weekend. Actually, it’s a destination that deserves more time, which would allow a chance to get out to the real countryside and experience what Cajun country offers, like boudin at gas stations, morning music jams, and small town charm. Still, Lafayette was an ideal overnight getaway with some good food and fun to be had.\n\nDay 1\n\nTo make the most of your time, you’ll want to leave New Orleans after a morning coffee and get to Lafayette in time for lunch. In my case, this meant a two-part lunch to sample a couple of different po-boys. First up was Olde Tyme Grocery, a bustling little shop where you order at the counter, and they’ll find you waiting at a table in the adjoining dining room or outside. My choice here was the half and half po-boy, with the sandwich split between fried oysters and fried shrimp. Both halves were good, though I preferred the side with the snappy shrimp. As with many po-boy shops, you can get your ubiquitous Zapp’s potato chips (try the Spicy Cajun Crawtators) and Barq’s root beer to go with your sandwich. (Beware: Old Tyme is old-time indeed, imposing religious imagery in the dining room and evangelical messaging on your receipt—like it or not.)\n\nNext up was the relatively new Pop’s Poboys (yes, there are several possible spellings of po-boy), which is bit more contemporary in feel. That extends to the food, with more “sophisticated” po-boys. Again, you order at the counter and then wait for your food at a table of your choice. Here I tried the Boudreaux, with buttermilk fried catfish, pickled okra tartar sauce, and blue cheese coleslaw. Another fine po-boy!\n\nA short stroll from Pop’s is Johnson’s Boucaniere. If you happen to leave New Orleans extremely early, a bonus is that Johnson’s is open for breakfast at 7am. Stuffed from the sandwiches, I stopped in for a small nibble, specifically a sampling of the brisket and boudin. Very impressive. The brisket was moist and flavorful, while the boudin had a welcoming amount of spice to it. With more stomach space, I could foresee eating a brisket po-boy or sandwich, perhaps topped with some of their housemade sausage. And more of that boudin, please.\n\nFollowing all of this food, it was time to walk. Downtown Lafayette is on the small side, so your exploration won’t take long. You can also walk to Borden’s Ice Cream Shoppe, the last remaining Borden’s in the world. It’s full of history. Plus, ice cream slides into the empty spaces of the stomach, right?\n\nAfter all the driving and eating, a nap and some rest was in order. My stay (with appreciation for hosting) was at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Lafayette-Airport, LA. The suite was quite comfortable and spacious, as well as convenient for running around town.\n\nDinner that evening would be down the street at Randol’s Seafood Restaurant. I had initially hoped to drive out to a rural restaurant for a crawfish boil, but places like Hawk’s in Rayne had yet to start service for the season. Thankfully, Randol’s providing a small taste of such an experience. I honestly can’t remember the last time I ate at a family restaurant; it was kind of refreshing to see multi-generation families sitting at large tables devouring crawfish and more. Children were running around like crazy, typically charging to the dance floor (strangely glassed in) where a band played toe-tapping Cajun music. The “crawfish boil” was fun to try, providing proof for me that eating them boiled and seasoned is better than getting them fried or sauced up.\n\nTo end the night, I recommend checking out the Blue Moon Saloon. This unique venue is at once a bar, a guesthouse, and a venue for live music. I stopped by for a small peek. It’s a friendly scene where locals (and out-of-towners) flock for evening entertainment.\n\nDay 2\n\nSunday morning meant an early start to get first seating for brunch at The French Press. The name is not a reference to coffee, but instead the restaurant’s setting in the historic Tribune Printing Plant, with some interesting effects in the primary dining room. (I especially liked the hanging typeface drawers and the use of a large cabinet of typeface shelves to serve as the host station.) I passed on praline bacon (one time, at Elizabeth’s in New Orleans, would be enough) but pounced on a boudin slider, quickly realizing why many people ate multiple numbers of them. Delicious, as was my order of grits and grillades with a topping of fried shrimp. This is a pleasant and popular place for brunch, and a great way to start the morning.\n\nFrom there it was on to Vermilionville, a living history museum and folk-life park. As a history major, I’m sometimes skeptical of these attempts to put people in period costume to tell stories, but this place does it well. The workers were enthusiastic in practicing their crafts and conveying the Acadiana lifestyle. The buildings were also interesting, and I was glad to see one plantation building, as I regretted not having enough time to do a plantation tour closer to New Orleans.\n\nWith an activity planned to the east that afternoon, I made my way to Henderson for a quick snack at Crawfish Town USA. Situated in a big ol’ barn, it was a good place to warm up with some gumbo (and catch part of the second half of the Seahawks’ playoff game).\n\nAnd then it was on to McGee’s Landing for an Atchafalaya Basin swamp tour. While waiting for the start of the tour, I enjoyed listening to a Cajun band playing in the restaurant (while watching the shockingly missed field goal that gave the Seahawks the playoff win—yes, I timed my stops well). I knew that it wasn’t really the right season to see alligators or any real wildlife on the tour, but figured it would be fun just to be out on the water. The scenery was worth seeing, but perhaps more interesting was “Pops'” narration, filled less with information about the area and more with jokes about fictional Cajun characters Thibodeaux and Fontaineaux. It was a good glimpse into the local humor (you have to listen hard to understand the accent); just know that you’re getting into a bit of a comedic boat ride.\n\nWith a rental car on the road to New Orleans, it was the perfect opportunity to eat at one “outside the city” restaurant. That might have been Mosca’s for their chicken a la grande, but since they’re closed on Sundays, it made the choice to go to Middendorf’s an easy one. This family restaurant in Akers looks like it must be buzzing during busy seasons, but it was a little slow in early January, so seating was quick and easy. They’re famous for their special fried thin catfish, served with hush puppies, coleslaw, and French fries. The thinness of the catfish is quite impressive (it’s partially frozen), with good breading and overall flavor—sure to be a hit with catfish lovers.\n\nThanks to the Lafayette Convention & Visitors Commission for setting up dinner at Randol’s and brunch at The French Press, as well as assisting with accommodations and attractions.",

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nIran on Monday rejected Israeli and Saudi claims that the Islamic Republic was a destabilizing force in the region, saying that it came as no surprise that Jerusalem and Riyadh share the same views.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi made the comments after both Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman and Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir each said at the Munich Security Conference on Sunday that Iran constitutes a threat to each of their countries, has not moderated its behavior in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal and should face renewed economic pressure from the international community.\n\nWhile the Israeli and Saudi ministers stopped short of saying they would cooperate to thwart Iran, Qassemi said that Jerusalem and Riyadh are already working \"hand in glove\" in the Middle East and their matching assessments given on Sunday came as no surprise.“The parallelism between the positions of the Saudi foreign minister and the Israeli war minister on Iran is not coincidental. Many instances of evidence indicate coordination between the two regimes in regional cases,” Iranian official news agency Press TV quoted Qassemi as saying.Saudi accuses Iran of undermining regional securityThe Iranian official said that Liberman's and Jubeir's claims against Iran reflected their countries' \"painful desperation.\"“Both regimes think they should stir the international atmosphere against Iran as a means of making up for their multitudinous defeats and frustrations in the region,” he charged.Qassemi said that Israel's attempts to enlist a Muslim country in its efforts against Iran were \"pathetic.\"In addition to Liberman and Jubeir, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif also spoke at Sunday's Munich Security Conference. While Liberman called for an alliance with Sunni states, Jubeir did not directly respond when asked if he envisions a coalition with Israel against Tehran.Jubeir, who spoke after Liberman and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlet Cavusoglu, pointedly rejected a new Iranian call for a dialogue with Sunni Arab Gulf states, telling the conference that the Islamic Republic is trying to “upend the order” in the Middle East and seeks the destruction of Saudi Arabia.“The Iranians speak of wanting to turn a new page, wanting to look forward, not backward. This is great, but what about the present?” he asked. “We can’t ignore what they are doing in the region. We can’t ignore their constitution which calls for the export of the revolution.

  "latent_2507": "Illinois delegates elected to represent Donald Trump have voiced fears about chaotic organisation and a lack of leadership in their state as Republicans prepare for what could be the first contested convention in decades.\n\nTed Cruz brands Donald Trump a 'coward' amid feud over their wives Read more\n\nDuring a torturous two-hour conference call on Thursday night, the delegates struggled to figure out how to help the frontrunner at the Republican National Convention in July, wondering how best to contact the campaign in Wisconsin for tips.\n\nAnxiety was mounting throughout the conference call about the lack of organization in the Land of Lincoln for Trump. As one person said “There is no Trump team in Illinois, it’s us”, a statement echoed by pro-Trump activist Doug Ibendahl when he pointed out on the call “we don’t have any leader, it’s just us.”\n\nThe Guardian understands the delegates also tried to deal with the mysterious disappearance of former Trump state chair Kent Gray from the campaign’s operations. Before leaving the campaign, Gray had tried to keep rival campaigns from making the ballot in Illinois but failed because he had not filed the paperwork in a timely manner.\n\nThey also spoke about fears the #nevertrump movement would use “riffraff” to steal delegates and were uncertain about what to do next to help secure the GOP nomination for Trump.\n\nIn the state’s primary election on 15 March, Trump won 39% of the vote and 53 of the state’s 69 delegates to the convention.\n\nThere were a lot of questions about what the infrastructure in Illinois would be in a general election for the real estate mogul in the state and what type of organization was there in the state. As people on the call noted, Bill Graff – the replacement for Gray – was a volunteer who was seemingly dragooned into taking a leadership role by the national Trump campaign. Many of those on the calls were Trump loyalists, including one ready to move to a new country if Trump didn’t win.\n\nCallers also spent time mourning that Pat Brady, former Illinois state GOP chair, won a delegate slot because of anti-Muslim prejudice among Trump voters. What was imagined to be an effort to mount a diverse slate of Trump delegates led to several candidates for Trump delegates with “Muslim-sounding names”. They underperformed in Illinois’ complex primary election because of what one caller described as many “people avoiding the guy with the Muslim-sounding name”. As a result, Brady, a Kasich supporter, “snuck in”.\n\nTrump’s campaign is trying to ensure that the bombastic billionaire gets the 1,237 delegates necessary to win the nomination on the first ballot. In the event of a contested convention, it’s expected that Trump would face major obstacles on a second ballot for the nomination as many pledged delegates for him will not actually support Trump when given a free vote. As the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, the frontrunner has already lost ground in Louisiana, a state that Trump won on primary night.\n\n• This article was amended on 27 March to clarify that Pat Brady is a former state chair for the Illinois Republican party, and not the current one.",
  "latent_2537": "Mr. Money Mustache recently received a request from an up-and-coming Future Early Retiree. His name is Mike, and at the time of writing he wrote a blog called “Mortgage Free by 30”. Here’s what he had to say:\n\n“Basically, I hate my job. The company is great. The job isn’t. I want to work for myself.\n\nAfter reading your blog, it has made me wonder if there is a possibility of “retiring” in the near future. And by retiring, I mean working part-time. If you’d be up for it, I would be willing to send you all of my specific numbers to see what I need to do to be like you.”\n\nFirst of all, I must say this sounds like a very ambitious young man with wisdom far beyond his years. Being like Mr. Money Mustache? There’s a goal I approve of.\n\nMike is pretty new to the world of high-income professional employment, and the associated high savings rate that comes with it if you don’t become a typical martini-swilling car-financing Ultraconsumer. But he’s already got some big dreams – paying off his mortgage before age 30 (March 2015), quitting his real job, and moving to a creative and unbounded life of freelancing and other random ways to earn and save.\n\nHere are some vital stats to get us started:\n\nAnnual Income: $70k\n\nAnnual employer 401K match: $4900\n\nTotal Income: $74,900\n\nIncome taxes, SS, Medicare deductions: $13,000\n\nTotal Annual Spending: = $18310 (further details at the bottom of this article for voyeurs)\n\nTotal annual savings is therefore $74900 – 15,000 taxes – $18,310 living expenses = $43,590.\n\nThis annual chunk of savings gets distributed roughly like this:\n\n401K including employer match: $9100\n\nIRA contributions: $2400\n\nMortgage principal payments: $32,090 (the man is really jonesing to be mortgage-free).\n\nThat covers the income/expenses side, now let’s review the ‘Stash to see how it is looking:\n\nHome Value: $120,000\n\nRemaining Mortgage Balance: $74,000\n\n401K balance: $9,000\n\nRoth IRA balance: $11,000\n\nOther assets: owns a 2010 Honda Civic with no loan\n\nSo what’s the plan for Mike?\n\nThe key to financial success for any person is having expenses lower than income. He’s got it, with living expenses of $18k per year. These expenses currently include $2775 of mortgage interest, which will drop to zero as he gets his mortgage paid off. But once he quits the cushy job, he will want to replace his current employer-paid health insurance with a self-paid policy. At a good outlet like ehealthinsurance.com, this will cost him a similar amount to what he now spends on the mortgage interest.\n\nThe first option is quitting the job immediately and dropping down to a $40k freelance income. Can he afford it? YES.. but it will definitely slow down his mortgage payoff plans. For simplicity, let’s suppose his after-tax income will now be $34,000. If living expenses stay the same at $18k, he will have 16,400 to save each year. If he distributes half of this to long-term savings like an IRA, and the other half to the mortgage, he’ll take about eight years to pay off the mortgage. Even if he goes crazy and devotes all 16,400 to the mortgage, he will take four years or so. Mike might not become mortgage free by 30 with this program, and thus he would lose his prestigious blogger identity! But he’d probably have a lot of fun in the process.\n\nThe second option is keeping the Dilbert-quality job just until the mortgage is paid off. At the current payoff rate of $32k per year, that will be done in just two years. He’ll be 28 years old, and he will also have another $23,000 or so packed into retirement accounts from his 401k/IRA contributions and the employer match. Plus he will save a few thousand in health insurance premiums.\n\nIn the end, either option will work. It all depends how adventurous you feel versus how much you want some financial security. I’ve always been a bit on the conservative side myself – which is why I saved up a lifestyle-sustaining ‘stash before quitting my job, even though I don’t really need it since my lifestyle is cheap enough to sustain on just part-time work. I could have jumped into this lifestyle as early as age 21, but then I wouldn’t be Mr. Money Mustache, just Mr. Simple Living Sideburns or something.\n\nThe other issue is his longer-term savings plans. If he keeps the big corporate job and the frugal lifestyle, his wealth will exponentially rise into the realm of the Rather Rich. The mortgage will be gone in 2 years, and the 46k+ being saved per year, plus a growing amount of compounding gains and possibly even salary raises would place him solidly into the Millionaires Club sometime in his 30s.\n\nAt some point you have to decide how much is Enough. If you have plans to eventually own a bigger house, or raise some kids, you might find it convenient to stick to the high salary for a couple of extra years. Even if the job sucks on paper, you can teach yourself to enjoy it more if you know you are just around the corner from lifetime freedom. If you already had $300k or more in retirement savings, I would be suggesting you bail quickly. But since your Money Mustache is still just stubble at this point, it is wise to consider the fact that a short day at the office may pay as well as two long days of freelancing.\n\nAn Extreme Mortgage Payoff discussion would not be complete without considering the tradeoffs. Mike’s investment in extra mortgage payments amounts to a fixed income stream with a guaranteed 3.75% annual return, since that is his mortgage rate. It’s not too shabby – better than a checking or money market account.. but he could also easily get a smooth 6-7% dividend cashflow just by picking out some nice REIT funds – the topic of another article coming up later this week. The REITs have a bit more risk associated with them, but the higher return is usually worth it to people with decades of investing in front of them.\n\nHowever, with the entire house tying up only $120k in this case, it’s not a big factor in his long-term wealth. In fact, I must again make fun of myself for owning a much more expensive house. It is costing me a lot of money (in the form of foregone investment returns), so the house must continue to deliver a very pleasurable lifestyle to the MMM family to earn its keep. In the long run when the young lad grows up, we’ll probably sell it and downsize.\n\nTo round out the case study, here are a few more details on the expenses as he sent them to me, in case you want to compare them to your own situation. As you’d expect, I have added a few MMM comments of my own to his numbers.\n\n———————-\n\nExpenses:\n\nMonthly\n\nMortgage $625\n\nCondo fees $375 (Temporarily higher, but for the next couple years. Normal is $250-ish)\n\nElectricity $40 – $60\n\nGroceries $150 – $200\n\nGas $100\n\nLaundry $20\n\nInternet $40\n\nDog $30 – $40\n\nIRA $200\n\nRestaurants $100\n\nGym $30 <-MMM: perhaps I can help you here.\n\nHair $20 <-MMM: And Here.\n\nGifts $25\n\n“Other” $100 – $150\n\n** I have no cable TV bill or cell phone bill. I have a cell phone, but I am part of a family talk plan and the policy is not in my name.\n\nSemi-annually\n\nAuto Insurance $440 every 6 months <-MMM: Driving around in a 2010 car is luxurious, but I’d definitely advise trading down if you can handle it, especially once you are done the job and thus not driving around as much. My own car insurance is less than $160 per 6 months because I do low annual miles and don’t need collision/comprehensive insurance. County taxes are much lower on older cars as well. And it’s still pretty new by my standards – a 2005.\n\nDog shots/meds $75 every 6 months\n\nAnnually\n\nProperty taxes $800 – $1,000\n\nHomeowners Insurance $185\n\nCar tax = $250\n\nSome other details for you:My mortgage balance is $73,999, due to my prepayments.

  "latent_2604": "Talking about grief and the Five of Cups with Megan Devine\n\nI’ve had a lot of loss over the years. Most recently, two longtime friends passed away. One from a long, complicated illness and the other from an overdose. I’m still haunted from the latter to this day even though it’s been three years.\n\nBecause you see, grief doesn’t happen in a neat little package with stages. Sometimes you never really “get over it.” You can’t. And guess what: that’s okay.\n\nThis is the topic of a powerful new book by Megan Devine called It’s Okay That You’re Not Okay: Meeting Grief and Loss in a Culture that Doesn’t Understand. This book offers a profound and honest look at the grieving process – and has tips, practices, and stories to help aid in healing after loss. (My favorite chapter is Rallying Your Support Team, which has the most excellent advice for helping a loved one deal with grief.)\n\nMegan sat down with me recently to talk about grieving – and the Five of Cups, tarot’s saddest card in the deck.\n\nQ: What is the biggest misconception about grieving?\n\nMegan: The biggest misconception about grieving is that it’s this unfortunate, temporary thing that you’re supposed to move through quickly and put it all behind you. That single misconception leaves grieving people feeling dismissed or unsupported, and leaves support people feeling frustrated and helpless in the face of grief that “lasts too long.”\n\nQ: Our culture seems to have a fear around discussing grief. How can we get past that?\n\nMegan: We definitely have a fear of discussing grief. There’s great stuff coming out of the Death Positive movement to help us open end of life conversations, but I think we’re actually far more afraid of grief than we are of death. We’re afraid of having to live without the people we love. Afraid of having to say goodbye before we’re ready. Afraid we’ll start crying and never be able to stop. And if we see someone else grieving, we want them to get through it as soon as possible, because we want to believe we’d bounce back quickly if something awful or sad happened to us. So how do we get past that fear? By being brave. By starting to talk about it. By being willing to tell the truth about our own experiences with grief, and being willing to hear other peoples’ truth. Really, it’s the same way we get better at any difficult discussion: bravery, and practice.\n\nQ:When someone is grieving, loved ones often become paralyzed, fearful of saying or doing the wrong thing. What is your advice for a loved one who wants to help but feels awkward?\n\nMegan: Feeling awkward is okay! In fact, feeling awkward about it is a great sign – it means you’re moving into new territory. Grieving people would much rather have you stumble through your love and support than confidently assert that things are not as bad as they seem. The one thing to remember is to not try to fix what is unfixable. Your job as a support person is not to take away the person’s pain – that’s not possible. Your job is to companion them inside their pain. That distinction makes all the difference.\n\nQ:. What is the best, healthiest way to move through the grieving process?\n\nMegan: What’s best and healthiest for one person isn’t what’s best and healthiest for another – and that’s the best way to think about the grieving process. I’ll always direct people back to their own sovereignty, their own capacity to decide what feels right and true to them, what feels like honoring their own pain, and their own process. That said, over-indulging in drugs, alcohol, or activities that put your body and mind at risk aren’t a good choice. Harming other people – also not a good choice. Outside of those things, listening for your own needs as grief shifts and changes (sometimes day to day, sometimes hour to hour) is a great, healthy practice.\n\nQ: Is it possible that there are some losses that you might never get over? If that is the case, is that necessarily a bad or unhealthy thing?\n\nMegan: Some losses you never get over – absolutely. Grief doesn’t have an endpoint. I often say that your grief will last as long as your love does. And that’s not a bad thing. We tend to think of grief as this finite, temporary thing, as though still feeling sad, still missing the person who’s died 3 years later, 10 years later, 29 years later is a weird aberration. We all carry grief. It’s in not tending it, not acknowledging this as a healthy, normal thing that most of us do anyway, that’s unhealthy. Sometimes doctors and other providers ask, “what about someone who has been coming into my office for 15 years, complaining of grief?” Well, I say that’s a person who hasn’t yet felt heard. Grief is just a reality. It’s not good or bad. It’s not healthy or unhealthy. It’s a reality of being alive in a world where those we love die.\n\nQ: The Five of Cups is the traditional tarot card for grieving. What advice would you give the figure in this card?\n\nMegan: I probably have a different response to the Five of Cups than is typical. In a typical reading of this card, the figure is seen as focusing on the spilled cups, not seeing the 2 that remain; in a way, it’s a card of failure – a refusal to focus on the “good that remains,” a failure to appreciate what’s left. I don’t see it that way anymore. That some good still remains does not negate the loss. Spilled cups and full cups can – and do – co-exist. They don’t cancel each other out. Maybe it’s not time to turn away. Maybe it’s not time to take that journey back to castle, back to the wider community. It’s okay. If that’s you, in that card, in your reading, maybe I’d ask how it feels to be there. Maybe I’d ask – what do you want and need for yourself, as you stand here, gazing at what is lost? Again, I circle back to sovereignty, and the strength of your own experience. It’s not wrong to gaze at what is lost. Asking yourself what is most true, most needed, most kind, given what has been lost – that’s the story I’d tell with that card.\n\nMegan’s bio:\n\nMegan Devine is on a mission to help people love each other better.\n\nA Pacific Northwest writer, speaker, and grief advocate, she is the founder of Refuge In Grief, a hub of grief education and outreach, where she leads people through some of the most devastating times of their lives. Together with her team, she facilitates a growing catalog of courses, events, and trainings to help grieving people, and those who wish to support them, learn the skills they need to carry pain that cannot be fixed.\n\nMegan is the author of the new book, It’s OK That You’re Not OK: Meeting Grief & Loss in a Culture that Doesn’t Understand. She has been featured widely in the media, including Huffington Post, Modern Loss, and The Manifest-Station, and in dozens of podcasts and radio appearances\n\nBig thank you to Megan for taking time to visit with me. Her work is so, so important. If you’re grieving or know someone who is, you need to follow her work. Please grab a copy of her book, It’s Okay That You’re Not Okay. You can learn more about Megan and her programs over at Refuge in Grief.\n\nBlessings,\n\nTheresa\n\n© Theresa Reed | The Tarot Lady 2017\n\nimage from Megan Devine",

  "latent_2741": "Originally published Monday, June 22, 2009 at 12:17 PM\n\nComments (0) E-mail article Print Share\n\nROCHESTER, N.Y. —\n\nSorry, Paul Simon, Kodak is taking your Kodachrome away.\n\nThe Eastman Kodak Co. announced Monday it's retiring its oldest film stock because of declining customer demand in an increasingly digital age.\n\nThe world's first commercially successful color film, immortalized in song by Simon, spent 74 years in Kodak's portfolio. It enjoyed its heyday in the 1950s and '60s but in recent years has nudged closer to obscurity: Sales of Kodachrome are now just a fraction of 1 percent of the company's total sales of still-picture films, and only one commercial lab in the world still processes it.\n\nThose numbers and the unique materials needed to make it convinced Kodak to call its most recent manufacturing run the last, said Mary Jane Hellyar, the outgoing president of Kodak's Film, Photofinishing and Entertainment Group.\n\n\"Kodachrome is particularly difficult (to retire) because it really has become kind of an icon,\" Hellyar said.\n\nThe company now gets about 70 percent of its revenue from its digital business, but plans to stay in the film business \"as far into the future as possible,\" Hellyar said. She points to the seven new professional still films and several new motion picture films introduced in the last few years and to a strategy that emphasizes efficiency.\n\n\"Anywhere where we can have common components and common design and common chemistry that let us build multiple films off of those same components, then we're in a much stronger position to be able to continue to meet customers' needs,\" she said.\n\nKodachrome, because of a unique formula, didn't fit in with the philosophy and was made only about once a year.\n\nSimon sang about it in 1973 in the aptly titled \"Kodachrome.\"\n\n\"They give us those nice bright colors. They give us the greens of summers. Makes you think all the world's a sunny day,\" he sang. \"... So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away.\"\n\nIndeed, Kodachrome was favored by still and motion picture photographers for its rich but realistic tones, vibrant colors and durability.\n\nIt was the basis not only for countless family slideshows on carousel projectors over the years but also for world-renowned images, including Abraham Zapruder's 8 mm reel of President John F. Kennedy's assassination on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nPhotojournalist Steve McCurry's widely recognized portrait of an Afghan refugee girl, shot on Kodachrome, appeared on the cover of National Geographic in 1985. At Kodak's request, McCurry will shoot one of the last rolls of Kodachrome film and donate the images to the George Eastman House museum, which honors the company's founder, in Rochester.\n\nFor McCurry, who after 25 years with Kodachrome moved on to digital photography and other films in the last few years, the project will close out an era.\n\n\"I want to take (the last roll) with me and somehow make every frame count ... just as a way to honor the memory and always be able to look back with fond memories at how it capped and ended my shooting Kodachrome,\" McCurry said last week from Singapore, where he has an exhibition at the Asian Civilizations Museum.\n\nAs a tribute to the film, Kodak has compiled on its Web site a gallery of iconic images, including McCurry's Afghan girl and others from photographers Eric Meola and Peter Guttman.\n\nGuttman used Kodachrome for 16 years, until about 1990, before switching to Kodak's more modern Ektachrome film, and he calls it \"the visual crib that I was nurtured in.\" He used it to create a widely published image of a snowman beneath a solar eclipse, shot in the dead of winter in North Dakota.\n\n\"I was pretty much entranced by the incredibly realistic tones and really beautiful color,\" Guttman said, \"but it didn't have that artificial Crayola coloration of some of the other products that were out there.\"\n\nUnlike any other color film, Kodachrome is purely black and white when exposed. The three primary colors that mix to form the spectrum are added in three development steps rather than built into its layers.\n\nBecause of the complexity, only Dwayne's Photo, in Parsons, Kan., still processes Kodachrome film. The lab has agreed to continue through 2010, Kodak said.\n\nGrant Steinle, vice president of operations and head of lab operations at Dwayne's, said the southeast Kansas shop was fielding calls Monday from customers asking whether it would continue to handle Kodachrome, which accounts for 20 percent of the lab's business. Steinle said he understood why Kodak reached its decision, but it was still disappointing.\n\n\"Kodachrome is still an important part of our business,\" he said during a phone interview Monday.\n\nHellyar estimates the retail supply of Kodachrome will run out in the fall, though it could be sooner if devotees stockpile. In the U.S., Kodachrome film is available only through photo specialty dealers. In Europe, some retailers, including the Boots chain, carry it.\n\n---\n\nOn the Net:\n\nKodak: http://www.kodak.com\n\n---\n\nAssociated Press Writer Sheila Ellis contributed to this report from Kansas City, Mo.",
  "latent_2847": "Reports this week suggested that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that the firm Fusion GPS conducted into possible collusion between Donald Trump and the Kremlin during last year's presidential election. Yet, both Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta and former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz claim they had no clue about the payments.\n\nIf it comes to light that they lied to the Senate intelligence committee, they could be in serious trouble.\n\nFormer CIA Director Leon Panetta said those are enough red flags to warrant an investigation.\n\n\"Well, it's obviously something that the intelligence committee is going to have, have to look at,\" Panetta told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Thursday. \"You know, knowing presidential campaigns, their big operations and somehow the left hand may not know what the right hand is doing. And that could be the case here, but I really do think that the committee is going to have to get into this, determine just exactly what happened. Who knew what and when.\"\n\nBlitzer pressed the issue, noting that the Clinton lawyer who retained Fusion GPS, Marc Elias, was sitting right next to Podesta when he spoke with the intelligence committee. Perhaps he should have briefed him?\n\n\"Well, it certainly makes the situation very awkward,\" Panetta nodded. \"If you're testifying and saying you have no knowledge and the attorney sitting next to you is one of those that knew what, what was involved here, I think it does raise an issue that the committee is going to have to look at and determine just exactly who knew what.\"\n\nClinton says she did not know about the dossier until it was published by BuzzFeed News and President Trump has dismissed it as a \"fake.\"\n\nThe president had one more thing to say about the whole mess this morning.",

REUTERS/Rodi Said\n\nERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Western-backed Syrian forces should isolate Islamic State’s de facto capital in Syria “by the spring” before an offensive on the city itself, British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said on Saturday.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces, which includes the powerful Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, launched the campaign on Raqqa in November.\n\nIt announced this month the start of a new phase in the offensive, aiming to complete its encirclement of the city and cut off the road to the militants’ stronghold in Deir al-Zor, southeast of Raqqa.\n\n“I hope that isolation will be completed by the spring and then operations to liberate Raqqa itself can begin thereafter,” Fallon told reporters in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.\n\nIslamic State is fighting hard to preserve its foothold in Syria as it loses ground in Iraq.\n\nU.S.-backed Iraqi and Kurdish forces last month dislodged the militants from the eastern side of Mosul, their last city stronghold in Iraq, and are preparing an offensive on the parts of the city that lie west of the Tigris river.\n\n“Raqqa is a much smaller city than Mosul but will clearly be defended very vigorously by Daesh and that means the operation to liberate Raqqa has to be very carefully prepared, as the operation for Mosul was,” Fallon said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.”Once Raqqa is liberated after Mosul, we will see the beginning of the end of this terrible caliphate,” he said. Islamic State declared the caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014.\n\nBritain is part of the U.S-led coalition supporting forces battling Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria.",
  "latent_3003": "** Winter storm warning Tuesday evening through Wednesday afternoon for Montgomery, Loudoun, Carroll, northern Fauquier counties and points north with freezing rain advisories for most other areas except southern Maryland **\n\nA storm forecast to track into the Ohio Valley threatens to spread freezing rain across portions of the mid-Atlantic.\n\nWhile temperatures are not particularly cold, the pattern is favorable for iciness in parts of the D.C. area, especially west and northwest of I-95 during much of the night, possibly into tomorrow morning.\n\nWith that in mind, the National Weather Service has issued a number of winter storm warnings and advisories for freezing rain throughout much the region.\n\nQuick overview\n\nMidnight temperature forecast from this morning’s hi resolution NAM. (Weatherbell.com)\n\nTemperatures: Upper 20s to near 30 overnight north and west, to around freezing inside the Beltway and most spots southwest. Near or above freezing to the south and east of the city. Temperatures may begin to rise before dawn in spots.\n\nArrival: Precipitation moves into the west and southwest counties during the late evening (8-10 p.m. or so), spreading across the whole region by or a little after midnight.\n\nTransition to rain: Freezing rain risk lasts longest north and west (Loudoun, northern Montgomery, Frederick), perhaps through the hours after sunrise. All rain arrives earlier in the city south and southwest, where we may not see much icing at all. Mostly rain south and east parts of the area.\n\nMain concerns: Possible small limb damage in the north and west suburbs from ice, with some messy untreated roads in those areas as well. Potential for more isolated slick spots into and around the city, especially on untreated roads or sidewalks.\n\nTechnical Discussion\n\nInitially light precipitation is expected to start spreading into the western portions of the area by late this evening (8-10 p.m. or so) with it overspreading the entire region by around midnight. Temperatures are forecast to start off near or a little below freezing in the city and in the upper 20s across areas well to the north, where the more serious icing conditions are possible.\n\nFor areas east and south of the city, this storm is likely to mostly be a wet one. For those in the far northern and western suburbs the icing could cause downed limbs or even a few power outages if a worst-case scenario pans out.\n\nHowever, like most potential winter weather events across the area, this one has some uncertainty concerning how long the cold air might last. Inside of the city there are question whether temperatures will actually fall below freezing. Subtle differences in the model forecasts end up causing larger differences in how long the cold air hangs in across the region as shown below.\n\n(Author adaptation of NOAA/NCEP)\n\nThis morning’s NAM holds onto the cold air longer than the GFS which pretty much erodes it across the area by 4 a.m. Also, the GFS would suggest no real icing problems at all inside the Beltway.\n\nOne possible reason for the difference is that the NAM (top panel above) starts developing a a coastal trough (zone where winds converge) by 1 a.m., and then develops a weak low along it. The coastal trough and secondary low development helps maintain a northerly component at the surface longer than forecast by the GFS. Therefore it holds onto the cold air longer.\n\nI’ve ended up opting slightly towards the NAM model because it has higher vertical and horizontal resolution, so it should theoretically handle cold air damming situations better than the GFS. Also, last night’s European model maintained the cold longer than the GFS. My confidence in how long the cold air might hold in is low. The current air is just not that cold.\n\nThe easiest way to describe the impacts of the storm is to divide the areas into different zones and then describe how the storm might affect each area.\n\nZone 1\n\nPrecipitation, mostly light to start, is expected to be spreading across the zone as early as 8-10 p.m. tonight. The precipitation could start briefly as sleet, but the bulk of it could be freezing rain into Wednesday morning. Icing could lead to a build up of 0.20-0.35 of an inch on trees and wires in the high end scenario — possibly enough to result in some limb damage and even a few power outages. Numerous icy spots could develop, especially on untreated road surfaces and sidewalks.\n\nTemperatures across the region are expected to drop into the upper 20s to around 30 once the precipitation starts. The icing could continue into the morning but should end over most of the area before 10 a.m., when temperatures are expected to rise to above freezing. Precipitation should wind down during the late morning and end by noon.\n\nMy confidence in this area getting some freezing rain is high but my confidence in the ice accumulations being in the ball park is not particularly high. The warmer GFS look has me spooked, and the new European model keeps overnight precipitation relatively light until temperatures start to warm. Focusing on the low end of the ice risk may be the way to go in general here.\n\nZone 2\n\nTemperatures are expected to be in 30 to 33 degree range during the night. Colder areas outside of D.C., especially to the north and west, will probably be cold enough to support ice accreting on trees, bushes and wires, but most road surfaces will probably be fine if treated.\n\nIn the more developed urban areas, streets and sidewalks should be mostly okay as well, but people keep an eye on the thermometer. If you note temperatures falling a few degrees below 32, a few slick spots could develop on walkways and untreated driveways.\n\nBy 8 or 9 a.m., possibly before especially in eastern parts of the zone, temperatures are expected to rise above freezing. Ice accumulations are expected to generally be light, 0.05-0.15 inches or less most spots, with the heaviest icing taking place west of the city and probably only a light coating at best bet for areas to the east. Precipitation is expected to end across the zone by 1 p.m. or so.\n\nThis area could easily end up with little or no ice accumulation if the GFS and newest European solutions are correct, so my confidence in the forecast above is low.\n\nIce forecast from NWS Baltimore/Washington as of this morning. More or less in line with CWG thoughts. (NOAA)\n\nZone 3\n\nPlain old rain is expected across this region.\n\nTemperatures are expected remain above freezing through the event except perhaps in isolated pockets very briefly. No icing problems are expected on road surfaces or walkways. Precipitation should end by early to mid afternoon.\n\nMy confidence in the forecast for this area is higher than for the other two, probably about average.\n\nBriefly, this weekend’s storm threat\n\nNothing much has been resolved concerning this weekend’s potential storm. A storm still appears likely, but whether it will bring us rain, snow or a mix is still a big question mark. All we can say now is the probability of a storm is high sometime this weekend, probably towards Sunday.\n\nBelow I’ve attached the GEFS plume diagram from last night. Remember that ensemble members are just the GFS model run at a coarser resolution, with each run having slightly different initial conditions. The initial conditions are tweaked because we know we cannot accurately measure the atmospheric variables accurately at every point around the globe. The upshot is that when all the members are clustered together with the same precipitation type, storms are easier to forecast.\n\nGEFS plume diagram.\n\nIn the figure above, where the green (rain) and blue (lines) increase in height on the diagram, that’s indicative of when rain or snow is being forecast by a member. The steeper and higher the lines rise, the heavier the precipitation. When the lines are parallel to the x-axis, no precipitation is falling.\n\nIn this case, green, blue lines are intermingled during weekend with the big spikes in precipitation but with different timing of the start of each spike.\n\nA quick glance at the surface pattern associated with the various members indicated some taking the low into the Ohio Valley, or even great lakes, before reforming the storm off the East Coast (rain solutions). Others track the low to our south, suggesting that we would get some snow.\n\nThis morning’s GFS track took the initial low so far to our north and west that we’d see only rain locally.

He also made the bizarre claim that Mrs Clinton is personally responsible for \"setting back women's rights in the Middle East by hundreds of years\" because of her support for the 2003 Iraq war. Assange is currently evading questions over allegations of rape and sexual assault in Sweden by hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy in Knightsbridge.\n\nIn an article for the WikiLeaks website posted today the Australian fugitive, who has been holed up in the embassy for five years, launched a blistering tirade on the character of the US Presidential hopeful. He claimed her was basing his opinion on reading \"thousands of her cables\" which were passed to him by US soldier Bradley Manning. He wrote: \"Hillary didn't just vote for Iraq. She made her own Iraq. Libya is Hillary's Iraq and if she becomes president she will make more. \"I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables.

  "latent_3315": "Q: From what I have researched, the Heat would have the money to sign Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic if Mario Chalmers and Chris Andersen were traded. Udonis Haslem has shown he can still provide in place of Birdman (who can't possibly have that many seasons left) and with our NBA Draft pick we can grab a backup point guard or look for Shabazz Napier and Tyler Johnson to provide what I think they can bring off the bench. Am I crazy or is this realistic? -- Zachary, Parkland.\n\nA: That's not exactly the case. What thinning the rest of the roster would do would be to ease a potential luxury-tax hit for Micky Arison if Dwyane (perhaps on a one-year basis) and Goran are given max or near-max salaries for next season. But, to a greater point, there is a case to be made about thinning out salaries that are above the minimum at positions of duplication. So if Napier and perhaps either Zoran Dragic or Tyler Johnson prove to be enough to round out a backcourt rotation with Goran and Dwyane, then I could see Chalmers possibly being dangled. Ditto with Birdman, should the Heat deem Hassan Whiteside, Chris Bosh, Josh McRoberts and Udonis Haslem to be enough at the top of the power rotation. Basically, the Heat met their loyalty obligation with the type of contracts offered to Chalmers and Birdman last summer. But I do not envision that Heat drafting a backup point guard at No. 10. I see adding a wing as a much more significant need.\n\nQ: Watching the NBA Finals, I’m struck by the fact that the vaunted Western Conference teams really weren't as superior as all of the regular-season hype. Sure, the team records were better than the Eastern Conference, but, as always, the East has more focus on defense, while the Western Conference has a more open style of play. The Spurs-Clippers series showed that those two teams had superior talent, but the other Western Conference playoff teams have deficiencies that make them just as vulnerable as the East in a seven-game series. Looking at the Finals, having LeBron James is certainly a big advantage, but playing tough, solid defense, having a go-to scorer, and the ability to define a strategy over a seven-game series creates a balance. Not taking anything away from the Cavs and LeBron, but a healthy Indiana Pacers team could have wreaked havoc in the Finals against Golden State. Golden State may still win the series, but in a playoff series, I do think the field has been leveled by a team with one superstar and a few tough role players. -- Paul, Fort Lauderdale.\n\nA: No, there was plenty of talent in the West, and I think if you rank the playoff teams based on pedigree, you would probably have the Cavs as well as five or six (or more) West teams in the mix. But that's the very point, that an East team doesn't have to beat all the West teams, just one. It is why the Heat are positioned for resurrection. While this Heat roster might not be good enough to contend at the top of the West, it could shape up as one that could challenge at the top of the East, and then have at least the puncher's chance this undermanned Cavaliers roster is having.",
  "latent_3329": "Cardinal Sean Brady said he was following bishops' orders The Catholic Church in Ireland has released more details about why Cardinal Sean Brady asked child abuse victims to sign secrecy agreements. When he was a priest in 1975 the cardinal was at meetings where children signed vows of silence over complaints against serial abuser Fr Brendan Smyth. The church said two boys were asked to sign oaths \"to avoid potential collusion\" in evidence gathering. It added this would ensure that the complaints could \"withstand challenge.\" The church statement does not explain why either Cardinal Brady or his superiors at the time did not share their information with the police. Critics of the cardinal have accused him of colluding with clerical child sexual abuse and pressuring victims to remain silent. Reports since the weekend suggested the two children in this case were a boy and a girl, but the church has now said it involved two boys. The church statement said that in late March 1975, the then Fr Sean Brady, who was a teacher, was asked by his bishop, Francis McKiernan, to conduct a canonical (church) inquiry into an allegation of abuse which was made by a boy in Dundalk, County Louth concerning Fr Smyth. On 29 March 1975, Fr Brady and two other priests interviewed a 14-year-old boy in Dundalk. Fr Brady's role at that meeting was to take notes. I am advised that the administering of an oath requiring these children not to disclose the abuse to anyone else may also have constituted an offence\n\nRoisin Shortall, Irish Labour party On 4 April 1975, Fr Brady interviewed a second boy, who was 15, in the Parochial House in Ballyjamesduff, County Cavan. On that occasion Fr Brady conducted the interview by himself and took notes, the statement continued. The church said that at the end of both interviews, the boys were \"asked to confirm by oath the truthfulness of their statements and that they would preserve the confidentiality of the interview process.\" The statement said the intention of the confidentiality oath was \"to avoid potential collusion in the gathering of the inquiry's evidence\" and to ensure that the process was \"robust enough to withstand challenge by the perpetrator, Fr Brendan Smyth\". The statement said that a week later Fr Brady passed his findings to Bishop McKiernan and in turn the bishop reported the findings to the local head of Fr Smyth's religious order, the Norbertines. Responsibility The bishop withdrew Smyth's right to practise as a priest and advised psychiatric intervention. The church said at that stage \"the specific responsibility for the supervision of Smyth's activities\" fell to his superiors in the Norbertines. They conspicuously failed to supervise Smyth who went onto to abuse more children. The church statement echoes comments made by Cardinal Brady. He said he believed the victims, and in his limited role, did all he could to make sure Fr Smyth was stopped from working as a priest. He said it was not fair to judge him by the child protection standards of today. 'Untenable' He added that as a relatively junior cleric it was not his responsibility to report Smyth to the police and that he passed all relevant information to his superiors. However, The Rape Crisis Network Ireland (RCNI) said his position had become untenable. \"Cardinal Brady is personally implicated in collusion with clerical child sexual abuse,\" RCNI director Fiona Neary said. \"In recent public statements regarding clerical child abuse he did not make public his role in pressuring and bullying victims to remain silent. He did not make public his own failures to disclosure a known abuser to civil authorities.\" \"Sexual abuse that could have been prevented was not, and Brendan Smyth continued to abuse children.\" The opposition Irish Labour party has added to the pressure on Cardinal Brady calling for the police to investigate his role. The party's spokeswoman on social and family affairs, Roisin Shortall, said the cardinal was \"hopelessly compromised by what had emerged\". \"I believe that there should be a Garda (Irish police) investigation to determine whether or not the failure to report Fr Smyth's crimes to the civil authorities was, itself, a criminal offence,\" she said. \"I am advised that the administering of an oath requiring these children not to disclose the abuse to anyone else may also have constituted an offence.\"\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

Employing a new kind of moviemaking that is much cheaper than celluloid, their weekly five-minute serials condense war into a witty battle of primary colors. Last year's Red vs Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles won Best Picture, Best Independent Picture, and Best Writing at the Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences. They've presented their films on Spike TV and twice at Lincoln Center. But these Austin jokesters, dubbed \"Clerks meets Star Wars\" by The Village Voice, are convinced that most of their fellow Austinites have never heard of them.\n\n\"Well, we did get recognized at a Game Stop once,\" admits Fink. \"It was kind of awkward.\"\n\nMany people haven't jumped on the Red vs Blue bandwidth wagon because Machinima is a relatively new concept: Filmmaking meets 3-D video games. Burns, who uses the popular game Halo for his creations, elaborates: \"We take one of the characters in the game, and we use him as a cameraman, where literally you are looking through his eyes. We take out all of the game information, like the score, ammo, and radar, and then use the existing video game engine as a way to animate our scripts.\"\n\nWith Machinima, anyone with a computer can make films. \"All you would need is the game itself, permission from the people who make the game, a decent mic, and a computer to capture the video and edit it,\" says Burns, who uses a Windows-based system and Adobe Premier. \"You could probably get going for $1,200 to $1,500.\"\n\nMachinima also reduces the time required by traditional filmmaking. \"We made a 90-minute piece of animation in six months, with four people working on it,\" says Burns, who can now make a complete five-minute short in 25 hours. \"Regular filmmaking is really an extended lottery ticket that you're investing in and hoping in the end you're gonna make it. With something like this, it's very low-cost going in.\"\n\nThe second part of the Red vs Blue secret is the Web. \"What's different,\" says Saldaña, \"is that we're using the spirit of the Internet. We're putting it there every week and getting people to come back. Nobody else is doing that.\"\n\nPlus, with Internet-based filmmaking, you don't have to wait for the critics. \"You have to have pretty thick skin,\" says Burns. \"On the Internet, you can tell people whatever you want, and you can ask for whatever you want. ... The audience dictates a lot.\"\n\nThe Web's accessibility allows filmmakers to amplify audiences, too. In virtual box-office numbers, Red vs Blue does quite well. \"We get 50,000 to 100,000 hits a day,\" reports Fink.\n\nBut these guys aren't making money with every hit. \"We sell a ton of DVDs, even though everything we make is on the Internet for free,\" explains Burns. \"Logic would say if you're going to sell a DVD, don't put it online, don't give it away for free. But it works, and it works really well.\"\n\nIf these guys are such a hit all over the country, why do they feel unknown in their hometown of game and film enthusiasts?\n\n\"This is the first interview we've done in Austin,\" Burns frets. \"We've done tons of interviews, including the L.A. Times and The New York Times.\" Fink agrees in jest, describing the turnout at Lincoln Center: \"We had kids drive up from Mississippi and Michigan, and we get shunned by our own damn city?\"\n\nThey are positive that SXSW will change things. But how will they cope with their muted celebrity until then? \"What am I supposed to say?\" asks Saldaña. \"On the Internet, baby, I'm so famous?\"\n\nSXSW Interactive will present Red vs Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles at midnight Monday, March 15, at the Alamo Drafthouse Downtown (409 Colorado).

While I could talk about stuff that is universal to everyone (like all of the completely pointless paperwork) I decided to focus on the skills that I have found to be the most dreadful. I'm going to follow this up eventually with a top five favorite skills but, everyone knows in mursing school NEGATIVITY COMES FIRST\n\n#5. Blood Glucose testing\n\nSo this might cause some confusion. You might be saying to yourself \"Blood glucose testing? What sort of crappy murse are you that's EASY\".\n\n1. You are talking to yourself and probably crazy- blame nursing school and get some counselling.\n\n2. You need to understand my background with blood glucose testing\n\nOne of my first days of clinical I was doing blood glucose testing. Having never done it before and being extremely nervous because I still had no idea what I was doing in the hospital I managed to stick the patient 5 times before I could get the blood glucose monitor to read. I literally used three different machines and entered and exited the room about 4 times over thirty minutes before I could manage to get a good reading. To this day I have a deep innate fear of having to test someones blood glucose. In my mind I can just see myself regressing back to that fateful day and having a complete emotional breakdown, in this hypothetical scenario my inadequacy shakes me so bad I go on too fail the semester, drop out of mursing school and work at a Taco Bell as a \"Nacho Specialist\" for the rest of my life. If I fail mursing school, don't say I didn't warn you in advance.\n\n#4. Bed Bath's\n\nI understand the need for bed bath's but i'm not sure I will ever get to the day where I am like \"DIRTY PATIENT?!?! YES, SCORE!! LET ME GO GET MY WASHCLOTH OF PURITY READY. CAN'T WAIT TO SCRUB HIM/HER DOWN!\" and as a murse you tend to get called in a lot more for bed baths. A floor nurse will be like I need to bath a patient who wants to help and everyone kinda just stares at you like\n\n#3. Inserting a rectal tube\n\nI actually haven't done this one yet. I tend to evaporate when it looks like someone will be called on to insert a rectal tube, I quickly begin asking around if any nurse's need a blood glucose done (knowing this will take me a good 15 minutes) and BOOM, rectal tube averted. I can only imagine though, rectal tubes combine two things I am not too big on: body orifices, and poop.\n\n#2. STD Testing\n\nIf you haven't done this yet you are in for a treat! Nothing makes your day like a good old G&C swab\n\n#1. Inserting Catheter's\n\nI mean if you honestly enjoy cath'ing someone bless you, also please work with me and you can do all of mine for me. But, besides the obvious reasons for not liking this: popping the personal space bubble big time, #awkward, nerve racking when you are being watched by like six people. I also hate this because it's sterile. Sterile procedures are pretty tough for me. Once I get past step one everything is fine but let's talk about the gloves. I have big hands and those hands get sweaty when i'm nervous (like say when i'm trying to put on sterile gloves). Undoubtedly whoever packages the catheter's expects the nurses to be 5-6 years old because those gloves are tiny. This inevitably leads to a scene where I hop around the room struggling to put the gloves on kinda like the guy in this GIF\n\nWhile the patient looks on like this-\n\nand tries to figure out if I am being attacked by invisible wasps or if I enjoy spontaneous dancing. It almost always ends with me ripping the gloves, asking for a larger pair and then crying myself to sleep at night while I have nightmares about blood glucose testing.\n\nWhat's your least favorite clinical skill?\n\nLet me preface this by saying that like most mursing students, clinical rotations are the highlight of school for me and there no other moment that makes you feel more legit than the first time you put an IV in a patient and you walk around the rest of the day like",

  "latent_3796": "The view that geographic factors such as climate, natural resources, disease burden or soil quality directly explain why some countries are poor still has many proponents. But these diehard geographic determinists notwithstanding, most people recognize that such geographic factors cannot explain world inequality today.\n\nThat being said, the dominant explanation about world inequality at the start of the early modern period (around 1500) is all about geography. This explanation, developed and popularized in Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs and Steel, links inter-continental inequality circa 1500 to the historical distribution of domesticable animal and crop species. Where there were a lot of these the Neolithic Revolution — the transition from hunting and gathering to herding and farming — happened earlier and was more productive. In these places population density took off, and this spurred both technological progress and the emergence of complex societies.\n\nA fascinating argument. But it is not an explanation for modern world inequality.\n\nDiamond argues that the Spanish were able to dominate the civilizations of the Americas because of their longer history of farming and consequent superior technology. But then once the Incas, for example, were exposed to all the technologies they had not been able to create themselves, such as modern writing, guns and the heavy plow, and imported European animals and crops, their income levels ought to have started to converge to those of the Spanish. Yet nothing of the sort happened. In the 19th and 20th centuries, a much larger gap in incomes between Spain and Peru emerged. Today the average Spaniard is more than six times richer than the average Peruvian.\n\nOf course, this gap in incomes is closely connected to the uneven dissemination of modern industrial technologies. But this has little to do either with the potential for animal and plant domestication or with intrinsic agricultural productivity differences between Spain and Peru.\n\nWhile Spain, albeit with a lag, adopted the technologies of steam power, railroads, electricity, mechanization, and factory production, Peru did not, or at best did so very slowly and imperfectly. Diamond’s thesis does not tell us why these crucial technologies are not diffusing and equalizing incomes across the world.\n\nMoreover, whatever the drawbacks of the Inca Empire in the early 16th century, it was undoubtedly more prosperous and had developed a more complex society than anywhere in North America. North America became more prosperous subsequently because it enthusiastically adopted the technologies and advances of the Industrial Revolution while Peru, like the rest of South America, did not. This cannot be explained by pointing to differential geographic endowments of North and South America. In fact, according to the logic of Diamond’s theory, which links prosperity and the presence of complex societies to geographic factors, one would have to presume that geography favored South America — but as we’ll argue in the next blog post, there are good reasons to think that even early prosperity is not about geography, so one shouldn’t even presume this.\n\nCould the uneven dissemination and adoption of technologies underpinning modern world inequality be related to the factors emphasized by Diamond? For example, Diamond suggests that the east–west orientation of Eurasia enabled crops, animals, and innovations to spread from the Fertile Crescent into Western Europe, while the north–south orientation of the Americas accounts for why writing systems, which were created in Mexico, did not spread to the Andes or North America.\n\nAnother fascinating argument. But again not much of an explanation for modern world inequality.\n\nConsider Africa. Though the Sahara Desert did present a significant barrier to the movement of goods and ideas from the north to sub-Saharan Africa, this was not insurmountable. The Portuguese, and then other Europeans, sailed around the coast and eliminated differences in knowledge at a time when gaps in incomes were very small compared with what they are today. Since then, Africa has not caught up with Europe. On the contrary, there is now a much larger income gap between most African and European countries.\n\nAnother major problem for Diamond’s argument is that it has little to say about inequality within continents, which is an essential part of modern world inequality. For example, the orientation of the Eurasian landmass might explain how England managed to benefit from the innovations of the Middle East without having to reinvent them. But it doesn’t explain why the Industrial Revolution happened in England rather than in Eastern Europe or in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nMore critically, as Diamond himself also recognizes, China and India benefited greatly from very rich suites of animals and plants, and from the orientation of Eurasia. But most of the poor people of the world today are in those two countries.\n\nIn fact the best way to see the scope of Diamond’s thesis is in terms of his own explanatory variables — the distribution of domesticable plants and animals.\n\nThe next map shows the distribution of sus scrofa, the ancestor of the modern pig, and the Auroch, ancestor to the modern cow. Both species were widely distributed throughout Eurasia and even North Africa.\n\nThe second map below shows the distribution of some of the wild ancestors of modern domesticated crops, such as Oryza sativa, the ancestor of Asian cultivated rice, and the ancestors of modern wheat and barley. It shows that the wild ancestor of rice was distributed widely across south and southeast Asia, while the ancestors of barley and wheat were distributed along a long arc from the Levant, reaching through Iran and into Afghanistan and the cluster of “stans” (Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Krgyzistan).\n\nThough all of these ancestral species are present in Eurasia, their wide distribution suggests that inequality within Eurasia cannot be explained by a theory based on the incidence of these species. In fact, this wide distribution also suggests that any theory that explains the transition to agriculture purely on the basis of geographic factors — as Diamond’s theory as well as the conventional wisdom on this topic do — is at best incomplete.\n\nWe’ll see in the next blog post that there are good reasons to think that this conventional wisdom may be more than incomplete. In fact, it may have the cart before the horse.",

  "latent_4196": "In 1996, Ricky Kidd was wrongfully convicted of the double-homicide of George Bryant and Oscar Bridges in Kansas City, Missouri. Witnesses to the crime testified that three men entered Bryant’s home in the middle of the day. The two victims were found dead, Bridges in the basement and Bryant in the street outside his home. Bryant’s 4-year-old daughter was discovered alive in a closet inside the house.\n\nRicky became the lead suspect in the case after an anonymous tip came in naming him as one of the killers; evidence suggests this phone tip may have been called in by one of the actual perpetrators. Ricky had what should have been an airtight alibi for the crime: he was at the Jackson County Sheriff’s Lake Jacomo Office at the time of the murders, filling out an application for a gun permit.\n\nRicky and co-defendant Marcus Merrill were charged with the crime. Merrill had flown to Kansas City from Atlanta shortly before the murder with two individuals, Gary Goodspeed, Sr., and Gary Goodspeed, Jr. The three of them—Merrill and the Goodspeeds—alibied themselves together at the time of the crime. Although all evidence indicated three perpetrators were involved, the State never charged a third person or attempted to bring a third person to justice.\n\nRicky was tried jointly with Merrill, who later confessed to being a real perpetrator in the crime, along with the Goodspeeds. Unfortunately, Ricky received woefully inadequate counsel. Ricky’s attorney failed to, among other things, investigate Ricky’s solid and verifiable alibi; request a separate trial from Merrill, which would have more accurately presented the lack of evidence against Ricky; and perhaps most damning, failed to object to Merrill’s attorney’s claim that Ricky’s fingerprint was found in the getaway car, when in fact, Ricky’s fingerprint was only found in his own car. Both Ricky Kidd and Marcus Merrill were convicted and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nRicky continued to maintain his innocence, exhausted his state appeals, and moved to the federal district court. Represented by UMKC law professor Sean O’Brien in his federal habeas proceedings, Ricky’s innocence became clear. Investigation revealed that Merrill and the Goodspeeds had committed the crime together, accounting for all three perpetrators—leaving Ricky the odd man out. Merrill’s compelling testimony that it was he and the Goodspeeds alone that committed the crime was presented to a federal judge. Physical and other evidence corroborated Merrill’s testimony. Unfortunately, because of the Eighth’s Circuit legal standard stating that evidence cannot be “new” if it was able to be discovered at the time of trial, Ricky was denied relief.\n\nRicky has spent the last 20 years fighting to prove his innocence from inside prison walls. The Midwest Innocence Project, along with co-counsel Sean O’Brien and Cindy Dodge, now represent Ricky Kidd in his last hopes for freedom. In November 2013, Ricky’s team filed for DNA testing of evidence that could reveal that it was the Goodspeeds, and not Ricky, who were at the crime scene. In his filing, Ricky’s team explained that DNA from either of the Goodspeeds would be enough to prove his innocence—again, at the time of the crime, the Goodspeeds and Merrill alibied themselves together. Indeed, all evidence pointed to their collective guilt. However, because the addition of one Goodspeed meant the addition of both, neither of them have been brought to justice: To charge the Goodspeeds without recognizing Ricky’s innocence would bring the count of perpetrators to four. In February 2016, the court ordered DNA testing. While testing is underway, MIP filed a Rule 91 petition on Ricky’s behalf, outlining his innocence and asking for his immediate release.\n\nThe costs of a wrongful incarceration are not suffered by Ricky alone. Read more about the toll Ricky’s wrongful conviction has taken on his family in remarks from Monica Gray here.\n\nOn December 6, 2016, Kansas City Police Commissioner Alvin Brooks told Governor Nixon that Ricky Kidd is innocent and that we know who really committed the crime. Read Mr. Brooks’s letter here. Governor Nixon did not grant this request.\n\nThe Midwest Innocence Project has filed the documents below on behalf of Ricky.

  "latent_4337": "Everybody feels pain differently, and brain structure may hold the clue to these differences.\n\nIn a study published in the current online issue of the journal Pain, scientists at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center have shown that the brain's structure is related to how intensely people perceive pain.\n\n\"We found that individual differences in the amount of grey matter in certain regions of the brain are related to how sensitive different people are to pain,\" says Robert Coghill, professor of neurobiology and anatomy at Wake Forest Baptist and senior author of the study.\n\nThe brain is made up of both grey and white matter. Grey matter processes information much like a computer, while white matter coordinates communications between the different regions of the brain.\n\nThe research team investigated the relationship between the amount of grey matter and individual differences in pain sensitivity in 116 healthy volunteers. Pain sensitivity was tested by having participants rate the intensity of their pain when a small spot of skin on their arm or leg was heated to 120 F. After pain sensitivity testing, participants underwent MRI scans that recorded images of their brain structure.\n\n\"Subjects with higher pain intensity ratings had less grey matter in brain regions that contribute to internal thoughts and control of attention,\" says Nichole Emerson, a graduate student in the Coghill lab and first author of the study. These regions include the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and areas of the posterior parietal cortex, she says.\n\nThe posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus are part of the default mode network, a set of connected brain regions that are associated with the free-flowing thoughts that people have while they are daydreaming.\n\n\"Default mode activity may compete with brain activity that generates an experience of pain, such that individuals with high default mode activity would have reduced sensitivity to pain,\" Coghill says.\n\nAreas of the posterior parietal cortex play an important role in attention. Individuals who can best keep their attention focused may also be best at keeping pain under control, Coghill says.\n\n\"These kinds of structural differences can provide a foundation for the development of better tools for the diagnosis, classification, treatment and even prevention of pain,\" he says.",
  "latent_4417": "NFL Free Agency is well underway, with the 2017 NFL Draft on the horizon too. The New York Giants have already made some big moves, such as the signing of star receiver Brandon Marshall. With some more roster moves and signings to strengthen further, Big Blue may just turn out to be a legitimate contender next season. However, there are a number of areas and players that will need to step up next season in order to have a run at Super Bowl LII in Minnesota. The Giants will be looking to build on last season’s playoff appearance, and assert their dominance on the NFC. For that to happen, plenty of positions and their players will still need to make the leap.\n\nNew York Giants Players Who Must Step Up in 2017\n\nEli Manning\n\nEli Manning, the Giants iron man at quarterback, is coming off one of his poorest seasons in the league. He wasn’t helped by the weak offensive line, and at times was forced to throw when receivers weren’t fully into their routes. However, it was becoming clear that his arm was weaker and he was under throwing receivers towards the end of the regular season.\n\nWhile the acquisition of a tall, physical receiver in Marshall should help in that regard, Manning will still need to improve himself in his accuracy of passing, his arm strength and overall ability in the pocket. Last season the Ole Miss product threw for 4,027 yards and 26 TD’s on a 63 percent completion rate, whilst also throwing 16 interceptions.\n\nOverall, the 36-year-old two time Super Bowl MVP will want to improve on the 86.0 passer rating he averaged last season. Quarterback is the most important position on the football field. The Giants defense last season could only take them so far. Should Manning bounce back, something he’s definitely capable of doing, Ben McAdoo‘s team will improve greatly. General manager Jerry Reese is surrounding him with talent in to help him make a late run at another Lombardi Trophy before retirement.\n\nEreck Flowers\n\nIn his second season in the NFL, Ereck Flowers struggled greatly at left tackle. Despite a strong start in the first three games, his performances dropped drastically. The 22-year-old drew flags and seemed to be beaten on a high proportion of plays, giving up a league second worst 59 quarterback pressures. Additionally, his struggles also often led to 21 sacks being given up for a total loss of 142 yards. While the right side of the line looked to be making progress with the likes of Bobby Hart and John Jerry, Flowers’ poor performances at left tackle held the Giants back in their progress offensively, both in the passing game and in particular the running game.\n\nBuilding on the offensive line is integral to the Giants progression in 2017. Although it’s still unclear whether the Giants may draft a starting left tackle, the likelihood may be that Flowers regains his place next season on the line. The former ninth overall pick will need to make improvements in his technique. His footwork can be good at times, but it’s working with his hands to block against edge rushers that needs to be worked on. Flowers still has promise, and it will be this upcoming third season in which the 22 year old product out of the University of Miami will need to step up and prove himself.\n\nPaul Perkins and the Running Game\n\nThe hallmarks of successful teams are often having a strong running game. Paul Perkins, coming off his rookie season in the NFL, has the ability to grow further and increase his carriers. 22-year-old Perkins is a back with great speed and agility to break tackles and gain extra yardage. In 2016 he rushed for 112 yards while also catching passes out of the backfield, racking up 456 total yards.\n\nIt’s clear that Perkins is an exciting prospect, with plenty of upside, who has the ability to be the number one back with the right support. The signing of versatile blocker Rhett Ellison in free agency should help with this greatly, contributing both as a full back and as a tight end. So Perkins is a player that can make a leap in 2017 in his young career. Meanwhile, the Giants continue to search in free agency and in a deep running back draft for a power back that can share the carries with Perkins and provide a different element in the backfield.\n\nThe Giants can strengthen and bounce back from what was a poor running game in 2016, in which New York was ranked 30th in the league in drives ending in three-and-outs. With the right support, Perkins can help be a key component in an improved running game.\n\nOther Notables\n\nBrandon Marshall, the Giants marquee free agent signing so far, will look to hit the ground running at Big Blue. At 6’4”, the 32 year old veteran is the tall, physical receiver the Giants were looking for to complement Sterling Shepard and Odell Beckham Jr following the departure of Victor Cruz. Coming off a poorer season with the Jets in which he had 59 receptions for 788 yards and three touchdowns, he will look to be a weapon for Manning in the Giants’ offense and contribute consistently.\n\nSafety Darian Thompson was one of the brighter prospects in the Giants’ 2016 Draft Class. However, he only played two games in 2016 before a foot injury ruled him out for the remainder of the season. In 2017, the 23-year-old will look to form a strong partnership with fellow safety and 2016 NFL First-Team All Pro Landon Collins in what is a strong New York secondary.\n\nMiddle linebackers Keenan Robinson and Kelvin Sheppard are currently free agents, and may not return to the team. If this is the case, then 23-year-old B.J. Goodson may take the next step and challenge for the starting middle linebacker spot. In his 2016 rookie season, Goodson only played 13 snaps, but looked to be a good contributor on special teams. Should the Giants not bring another line-backer, Goodson will need to step up and may contribute as a regular starting line-backer.\n\nSimilarly, defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins is still a free agent, with no guarantees of returning to New York. Should Big Blue not be able to afford him, they may look to bring in a new tackle either in the draft or in free agency. If this isn’t the case, then Jay Bromley may need to step up and gain a starting spot alongside premier run stuffer Damon ‘Snacks’ Harrison, in what was a strong Giants defensive line in 2016. 24-year-old Bromley didn’t play many snaps behind Hankins and Harrison on the depth chart, but when he did play, he ended up making 14 tackles and making one sack.\n\nThe Last Word\n\nThese are some examples of areas where the New York Football Giants can build and strengthen going into the 2017 season. With key offseason moves yet to be made, there’s still a lot that will be subject to change. Overall, however, should New York improve in some of these important areas of the team, there’s clear reason to be optimistic. This team has a high ceiling.",
  "latent_4453": "A man from Pune, working with a prominent private company, recently got a call on his cellphone from a woman offering to pay him for joining a “Gigolo club”. The youth, Pravin (name changed), filed a complaint with cyber cell of the Pune city police.\n\nAdvertising\n\n“I got a call on my cellphone around 10.30 am on July 23, 2016. The caller, a woman, was speaking Marathi. She first told me they had a club named Gigolo club, which offered free massage to people. She then directly told me that if I established physical relationship with some women in the city, they would pay me. I asked the woman her name and Aadhar number and whether making such random calls to public was legal. She said it was. I cut the call in anger after a conversation of just over two minutes,” Pravin (30) told The Indian Express.\n\nHe said this was the first time he had received such a call. “It was not only shocking but also worrying if youngsters fall prey to such rackets. So I wrote down my experience and circulated it on social media to make people aware of such wrong practices,” he said.\n\nAfter discussion with some friends who read his message, Pravin decided to inform the police about the incident. “Last week, I wrote to the cyber cell of police through email about my experience and also shared the mobile number from which I had received the call. I hope the police probe this number to reach the culprits,” he said.\n\nDeputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) Deepak Sakore said they were looking into this matter. Sakore said that while the cyber cell had not received such a complaint in the past where someone got a direct such call, police officers knew about gigolo rackets being active in Pune in the guise of friendship clubs.\n\n“Information about such clubs are spread through advertisements in certain newspapers, websites and social media services. Also, there have been incidents in which men were asked to pay some money as registration fees on assurance of meetings with women. But after the money is paid, there is no further contact. The men who are cheated rarely come forward to lodge complaints,” an officer said, adding that people should come forward with complaints in such cases and that their identities would be kept confidential.\n\nLack of female decoy hampers police probe\n\nA police officer, who has earlier worked with the crime branch of Pune city police, said, “We received information from sources about a possible gigolo racket, where in some agents were supplying males for prostitution. We spoke to legal experts who said it was an offence under sections of the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act (PITA). But we could not bust this racket as we were not able to hire a female decoy for laying the trap.”\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe officer said racketeers tried to lure males by offering money and claiming that male prostitution was legal. “Also, the racketeers make it look like adult males and females are willingly coming together, which is not illegal. So, it becomes difficult for the police to take action,” the officer said.",
  "latent_4490": "This article is about the American rapper. For other uses, see Icet\n\n\"Ice T\" redirects here. For the German train, see ICE T\n\nTracy Lauren Marrow (born February 16, 1958),[1] better known by his stage name Ice-T, is an American musician, rapper, songwriter, actor, record producer, record executive and author. He began his career as an underground rapper in the 1980s and was signed to Sire Records in 1987, when he released his debut album Rhyme Pays; the second hip-hop album to carry an explicit content sticker after Slick Rick's La Di Da Di. The following year, he founded the record label Rhyme $yndicate Records (named after his collective of fellow hip-hop artists called the \"Rhyme $yndicate\") and released another album, Power, which went on to go Platinum. He also released several other albums that went Gold.\n\nHe co-founded the heavy metal band Body Count, which he introduced on his 1991 rap album O.G.: Original Gangster, on the track titled \"Body Count\". The band released their self-titled debut album in 1992. Ice-T encountered controversy over his track \"Cop Killer\", which glamorized killing police officers. Ice-T asked to be released from his contract with Warner Bros. Records, and his next solo album, Home Invasion, was released later in February 1993 through Priority Records. Body Count's next album was released in 1994, and Ice-T released two more albums in the late-1990s. Since 2000, he has portrayed NYPD Detective/Sergeant Odafin Tutuola on the NBC police drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nTracy Lauren Marrow, son of Solomon and Alice Marrow,[6] was born in Newark, New Jersey.[7] Solomon was African-American, and Alice was Creole. For decades, Solomon worked as a conveyor belt mechanic at the Rapistan Conveyor Company. When Marrow was a child, his family moved to upscale Summit, New Jersey. The first time race played a major part in Marrow's life was at the age of seven, when he became aware of the racism leveled by his white friends towards black children, and that he escaped similar treatment because they thought that Marrow was white due to his lighter skin. Relaying this incident to his mother, she told him, \"Honey, people are stupid\"; her advice and this incident taught Marrow to control the way the negativity of others affected him.\n\nHis mother died of a heart attack when he was in third grade. Solomon raised Marrow as a single father for four years, with help from a housekeeper. Marrow's first experience with illicit activity occurred after a bicycle that his father bought him for Christmas was stolen. After Marrow told his father, Solomon shrugged, \"Well, then, you ain't got no bike.\" Marrow stole parts from bicycles and assembled \"three or four weird-looking, brightly-painted bikes\" from the parts; his father either did not notice or never acknowledged this. When Marrow was twelve years old, Solomon died of a heart attack.[8] For many years, AllMusic.com has stated that his parents \"died in an auto accident\",[1] but Ice-T has stated that it was actually he who had been in a car accident, and that it was decades later.\n\nFollowing his father's death, the orphaned Marrow lived with a nearby aunt briefly, then was sent to live with his other aunt and her husband in View Park-Windsor Hills, an upper middle-class Black neighborhood in South Los Angeles. While his cousin Earl was preparing to leave for college, Marrow shared a bedroom with him. Earl was a fan of rock music and listened only to the local rock radio stations; sharing a room with him sparked Marrow's interest in heavy metal music.\n\nHigh school, early criminal activity, military service [ edit ]\n\nMarrow moved to the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles when he was in the eighth grade. He attended Palms Junior High, which was predominantly made up of white students, and included black students who travelled by bus from South Central to attend. He then attended Crenshaw High School, which was almost entirely made up of black students.\n\nMarrow stood out from most of his friends because he did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use drugs. During Marrow's time in high school, gangs became more prevalent in the Los Angeles school system. Students who belonged to the Crips and Bloods gangs attended Crenshaw, and fought in the school's hallways. Marrow, while never an actual gang member, was affiliated with the former. Marrow began reading the novels of Iceberg Slim, which he memorized and recited to his friends, who enjoyed hearing the excerpts and told him, \"Yo, kick some more of that by Ice, T\", giving Marrow his famous nickname. Marrow and other Crips wrote and performed \"Crip Rhymes\".\n\nHis music career started with the band of the singing group The Precious Few of Crenshaw High School. Marrow and his group opened the show, dancing to a live band. The singers were Thomas Barnes, Ronald Robinson and Lapekas Mayfield.\n\nIn 1975, at the age of seventeen, Marrow began receiving Social Security benefits resulting from the death of his father and used the money to rent an apartment for $90 a month. He sold cannabis and stole car stereos to earn extra cash, but he was not making enough to support his pregnant girlfriend. Once his daughter was born, he joined the United States Army in October 1977. Marrow served a two-year and two month tour in the 25th Infantry Division[14] and was associated with a group of soldiers charged with the theft of a rug. While awaiting trial, he received a $2,500 bonus check and went absent without leave, returning a month later, after the rug had been returned. Marrow received a non-judicial punishment as a consequence of his dereliction of duty.\n\nDuring his spell in the Army, Marrow became interested in hip hop music. He heard The Sugar Hill Gang's newly released single \"Rapper's Delight\" (1979), which inspired him to perform his own raps over the instrumentals of this and other early hip-hop records. The music, however, did not fit his lyrics or form of delivery.\n\nWhen he was stationed in Hawaii (where prostitution was not a heavily prosecuted crime) as a squad leader at Schofield Barracks, Marrow met a pimp named Mac. Mac admired that Marrow could quote Iceberg Slim and he taught Marrow how to be a pimp himself. Marrow was also able to purchase stereo equipment cheaply in Hawaii, including two Technics turntables, a mixer, and large speakers. Once equipped, he then began to learn turntablism and rapping.\n\nTowards the end of his tenure in the Army, Marrow learned from his commanding officer that he could receive an honorable discharge because he was a single father, so he was discharged in December 1979.[14]\n\nDuring an episode of The Adam Carolla Podcast that aired on June 6, 2012, Marrow claimed that after being discharged from the Army, he began a career as a bank robber. Marrow claimed he and some associates began conducting take-over bank robberies \"like [in the film] Heat.\" Marrow then elaborated, explaining, \"Only punks go for the drawer, we gotta go for the safe.\" Marrow also stated he was glad the United States justice system has statutes of limitations, which had likely expired when Marrow admitted to his involvement in multiple Class 1 Felonies in the early-to-mid 1980s.\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nEarly career (1980–1981) [ edit ]\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Marrow wanted to stay away from gang life and violence and instead make a name for himself as a disc jockey. As a tribute to Iceberg Slim, Marrow adopted the stage name Ice-T. While performing as a DJ at parties, he received more attention for his rapping, which led Ice-T to pursue a career as a rapper. After breaking up with his girlfriend Caitlin Boyd, he returned to a life of crime and robbed jewelry stores with his high school friends. Ice-T's raps later described how he and his friends pretended to be customers to gain access before smashing the display glass with baby sledgehammers.\n\nIce-T's friends Al P. and Sean E. Sean went to prison. Al P. was caught in 1982 and sent to prison for robbing a high-end jewelry store in Laguna Niguel for $2.5 million in jewelry. Sean was arrested for possession of not only cannabis, which Sean sold, but also material stolen by Ice-T. Sean took the blame and served two years in prison. Ice-T stated that he owed a debt of gratitude to Sean because his prison time allowed him to pursue a career as a rapper. Concurrently, he wound up in a car accident and was hospitalized as a John Doe because he did not carry any form of identification due to his criminal activities. After being discharged from the hospital, he decided to abandon the criminal lifestyle and pursue a professional career rapping. Two weeks after being released from the hospital, he won an open mic competition judged by Kurtis Blow.\n\nProfessional career (1982–present) [ edit ]\n\npictured), before recording gangsta rap music. Ice-T released a string of Electro records, including the 1984 single \"Reckless\" (), before recording gangsta rap music.\n\nIn 1982, Ice-T met producer Willie Strong from Saturn Records. In 1983, Strong recorded Ice-T's first single, \"Cold Wind Madness\", also known as \"The Coldest Rap\", an electro hip-hop record that became an underground success, becoming popular even though radio stations did not play it due to the song's hardcore lyrics. That same year, Ice-T released \"Body Rock\", another electro hip-hop single that found popularity in clubs. Ice-T then was a featured rapper on \"Reckless\", a single by DJ Chris \"The Glove\" Taylor and (co-producer) David Storrs. This song was almost immediately followed up with a sequel entitled \"Reckless Rivalry (Combat)\", which was featured in the Breakin' sequel, Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, however it was never featured on the soundtrack album and, to this day, has never been released. Ice later recorded the songs \"Ya Don't Quit\" and \"Dog'n the Wax (Ya Don't Quit-Part II)\" with Unknown DJ, who provided a Run–D.M.C.-like sound for the songs.\n\nIce-T received further inspiration as an artist from Schoolly D's gangsta rap single \"P.S.K. What Does It Mean?\", which he heard in a club. Ice-T enjoyed the single's sound and delivery, as well as its vague references to gang life, although the real life gang, Park Side Killers, was not named in the song.\n\nIce-T decided to adopt Schoolly D's style, and wrote the lyrics to his first gangsta rap song, \"6 in the Mornin'\", in his Hollywood apartment, and created a minimal beat with a Roland TR-808. He compared the sound of the song, which was recorded as a B-Side on the single \"Dog'n The Wax\", to that of the Beastie Boys. The single was released in 1986, and he learned that \"6 in the Mornin'\" was more popular in clubs than its A-side, leading Ice-T to rap about Los Angeles gang life, which he described more explicitly than any previous rapper. He intentionally did not represent any particular gang, and wore a mixture of red and blue clothing and shoes to avoid antagonizing gang-affiliated listeners, who debated his true affiliation.\n\nIce-T finally landed a deal with a major label Sire Records. When label founder and president Seymour Stein heard his demo, he said, \"He sounds like Bob Dylan.\" Shortly after, he released his debut album Rhyme Pays in 1987 supported by DJ Evil E, DJ Aladdin and producer Afrika Islam, who helped create the mainly party-oriented sound. The record wound up being certified gold by the RIAA. That same year, he recorded the title theme song for Dennis Hopper's Colors, a film about inner-city gang life in Los Angeles. His next album Power was released in 1988, under his own label Rhyme Syndicate, and it was a more assured and impressive record, earning him strong reviews and his second gold record. Released in 1989, The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say established his popularity by matching excellent abrasive music with narrative and commentative lyrics.[1] In the same year, he appeared on Hugh Harris's single \"Alice\".[20]\n\nIn 1991, he released his album O.G. Original Gangster, which is regarded as one of the albums that defined gangsta rap.[citation needed] On OG, he introduced his heavy metal band Body Count in a track of the same name. Ice-T toured with Body Count on the first annual Lollapalooza concert tour in 1991, gaining him appeal among middle-class teenagers and fans of alternative music genres. The album Body Count was released in March 1992.[1] For his appearance on the heavily collaborative track \"Back on the Block\", a composition by jazz musician Quincy Jones that \"attempt[ed] to bring together black musical styles from jazz to soul to funk to rap\", Ice-T won a Grammy Award for the Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, an award shared by others who worked on the track including Jones and fellow jazz musician Ray Charles.[21]\n\nControversy later surrounded Body Count over its song \"Cop Killer\". The rock song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a criminal getting revenge on racist, brutal cops. Ice-T's rock song infuriated government officials, the National Rifle Association and various police advocacy groups.[1][22] Consequently, Time Warner Music refused to release Ice-T's upcoming album Home Invasion because of the controversy surrounding \"Cop Killer\". Ice-T suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction, telling journalist Chuck Philips \"...they've done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers. Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining about that.\" In the same interview, Ice-T suggested to Philips that the misunderstanding of Cop Killer, the misclassification of it as a rap song (not a rock song), and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: \"The Supreme Court says it's OK for a white man to burn a cross in public. But nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer.\" [22]\n\nIce-T split amicably with Sire/Warner Bros. Records after a dispute over the artwork of the album Home Invasion. He then reactivated Rhyme Syndicate and formed a deal with Priority Records for distribution. Priority released Home Invasion in the spring of 1993.[23] The album peaked at #9 on Billboard magazine's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and at #14 on the Billboard 200,[24] spawning several singles including \"Gotta Lotta Love\", \"I Ain't New To This\" and \"99 Problems\" – which would later inspire Jay-Z to record a version with new lyrics in 2003.\n\nIce-T had also collaborated with certain other heavy metal bands during this time period. For the film Judgment Night, he did a duet with Slayer on the track \"Disorder\".[25] In 1995, Ice-T made a guest performance on Forbidden by Black Sabbath.[6] Another album of his, VI – Return of the Real, was released in 1996, followed by The Seventh Deadly Sin in 1999.[26]\n\nHis first rap album since 1999, Gangsta Rap, was released on October 31, 2006. The album's cover, which \"shows [Ice-T] lying on his back in bed with his ravishing wife's ample posterior in full view and one of her legs coyly draped over his private parts\", was considered to be too suggestive for most retailers, many of which were reluctant to stock the album.[27] Some reviews of the album were unenthusiastic, as many had hoped for a return to the political raps of Ice-T's most successful albums.\n\nIce-T with Body Count performing in 2006.\n\nIce-T appears in the film Gift. One of the last scenes includes Ice-T and Body Count playing with Jane's Addiction in a version of the Sly and the Family Stone song \"Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey.\"\n\nBesides fronting his own band and rap projects, Ice-T has also collaborated with other hard rock and metal bands, such as Icepick, Motörhead, Slayer, Pro-Pain, and Six Feet Under. He has also covered songs by hardcore punk bands such as The Exploited, Jello Biafra, and Black Flag. Ice-T made an appearance at Insane Clown Posse's Gathering of the Juggalos (2008 edition).[28] Ice-T was also a judge for the 7th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.[29] His 2012 film Something from Nothing: The Art of Rap features a who's who of underground and mainstream rappers.[30]\n\nIn November 2011, Ice-T announced via Twitter that he was in the process of collecting beats for his next LP which was expected sometime during 2012, but as of October 2014 , the album has not been released. A new Body Count album, Bloodlust, was released in 2017.[31] After the release of the album, responding to an interview question asking if he's \"done with rap\", he answered \"I don't know\" and noted that he's \"really leaning more toward EDM right now\".[32]\n\nActing [ edit ]\n\nTelevision and film [ edit ]\n\nIce-T's first film appearances were in the motion pictures, Breakin' (1984), and its sequel, Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo (1985). These films were released before Ice-T released his first LP, although he appears on the soundtrack to Breakin'. He has since stated he considers the films and his own performance in them to be \"wack\".\n\nIn 1991, he embarked on a serious acting career, portraying police detective Scotty Appleton in Mario Van Peebles' action thriller New Jack City, gang leader Odessa (alongside Denzel Washington and John Lithgow) in Ricochet (1991), gang leader King James in Trespass (1992), followed by a notable lead role performance in Surviving the Game (1994), in addition to many supporting roles, such as J-Bone in Johnny Mnemonic (1995), and the marsupial mutant T-Saint in Tank Girl (1995). He was also interviewed in the Brent Owens documentary Pimps Up, Ho's Down,[34] in which he claims to have had an extensive pimping background before getting into rap. He is quoted as saying \"once you max something out, it ain't no fun no more. I couldn't really get no farther.\" He goes on to explain his pimping experience gave him the ability to get into new businesses. \"I can't act, I really can't act, I ain't no rapper, it's all game. I'm just working these niggas.\" Later he raps at the Players Ball.\n\nIn 1993, Ice-T along with other rappers and the three Yo! MTV Raps hosts Ed Lover, Doctor Dré and Fab 5 Freddy starred in the comedy Who's the Man?, directed by Ted Demme. In the movie, he is a drug dealer who gets really frustrated when someone calls him by his real name, \"Chauncey\", rather than his street name, \"Nighttrain.\"\n\nIn 1995, Ice-T had a recurring role as vengeful drug dealer Danny Cort on the television series New York Undercover, co-created by Dick Wolf. His work on the series earned him the 1996 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. In 1997, he co-created the short-lived series Players, produced by Wolf. This was followed by a role as pimp Seymour \"Kingston\" Stockton in Exiled: A Law & Order Movie (1998). These collaborations led Wolf to add Ice-T to the cast of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Since 2000 he has portrayed Odafin \"Fin\" Tutuola, a former undercover narcotics officer transferred to the Special Victims Unit. In 2002, the NAACP awarded Ice-T with a second Image Award, again for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, for his work on Law & Order: SVU.\n\nAround 1995,[35] Ice-T co-presented a UK-produced magazine television series on black culture, Baadasss TV.[36]\n\nIn 1997, Ice-T had a pay-per-view special titled Ice-T's Extreme Babes which appeared on Action PPV, formerly owned by BET Networks.[37][38]\n\nIn 1999, Ice-T starred in the HBO movie Stealth Fighter as a United States Naval Aviator who fakes his own death, steals a F-117 stealth fighter, and threatens to destroy United States military bases. He also acted in the movie Sonic Impact, released the same year.\n\nIce-T made an appearance on the comedy television series Chappelle's Show as himself presenting the award for \"Player Hater of the Year\" at the \"Player-Haters Ball\", a parody of his own appearance at the Players Ball. He was dubbed the \"Original Player Hater.\"\n\nBeyond Tough, a 2002 documentary series, aired on Discovery Channel about the world's most dangerous and intense professions, such as alligator wrestlers and Indy 500 pit crews, was hosted by Ice-T.[39]\n\nIn 2007, Ice-T appeared as a celebrity guest star on the MTV sketch comedy show Short Circuitz. Also in late 2007, he appeared in the short-music film Hands of Hatred, which can be found online.\n\nBurning Down the House Ice-T at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival for the premiere of\n\nIce-T was interviewed for the Cannibal Corpse retrospective documentary Centuries of Torment, as well as appearing in Chris Rock's 2009 documentary Good Hair, in which he reminisced about going to school in hair curlers.[40]\n\nA 2016 advertisement for GEICO features Ice-T behind a lemonade stand run by children. When people ask if it's Ice-T, the actor yells back, \"No, it's lemonade!\"[41]\n\nVoice acting [ edit ]\n\nIce-T voiced Madd Dogg in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, as well as Agent Cain in Sanity: Aiken's Artifact. He also appears as himself in Def Jam: Fight for NY and UFC: Tapout fighting video games.\n\nHe also voiced the character Aaron Griffin in the video game Gears of War 3.[42]\n\nHe was the voice of Jackie A in Tommy and the Cool Mule.[43]\n\nHe voiced over the \"LawBreakers\" announcement trailer.[44]\n\nOther ventures [ edit ]\n\nPodcasting [ edit ]\n\nOn December 27, 2013, Ice-T announced that he was entering podcasting in a deal with the Paragon Collective. Ice-T co-hosts the Ice-T: Final Level podcast[45] with his longtime friend, Mick Benzo (known as Zulu Beatz on Sirius XM). They discuss relevant issues, movies, video games, and do a behind the scenes of Law Order: SVU segment with featured guests from the entertainment world. The show will release new episodes bi-weekly. Guests have included Jim Norton.[46] Ice-T released his first episode on January 7 to many accolades.[47]\n\nReality television [ edit ]\n\nOn October 20, 2006, Ice-T's Rap School aired and was a reality television show on VH1. It was a spin-off of the British reality show Gene Simmons' Rock School, which also aired on VH1. In Rap School, rapper/actor Ice-T teaches eight teens from York Preparatory School in New York called the \"York Prep Crew\" (\"Y.P. Crew\" for short). Each week, Ice-T gives them assignments and they compete for an imitation gold chain with a microphone on it. On the season finale on November 17, 2006, the group performed as an opening act for Public Enemy.\n\nOn June 12, 2011, E! reality show Ice Loves Coco debuted. The show is mostly about his relationship with his wife of ten years, Nicole \"Coco\" Austin.[48][49]\n\nStyle and influence [ edit ]\n\nIce-T cites writer Iceberg Slim and rapper Schoolly D as influences, with Iceberg Slim's novels guiding his skills as a lyricist. His favorite heavy rock acts are Edgar Winter, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. His hip hop albums helped shape the gangsta rap style, with music journalists tracing works of artists such as Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G., Eminem and N.W.A to \"6 in the Mornin'\".\n\nHis love of rock music led Ice-T to use electric guitar in the instrumentation of his hip hop albums in order to provide his songs with edge and power, and to make his raps harder; he used the fusion of rock and hip hop of Rick Rubin-produced acts like Beastie Boys, Run-DMC and LL Cool J, which featured rock samples in their songs. His work with Body Count, whose 1992 debut album Ice-T described as a \"rock album with a rap mentality\", is described as paving the way for the success of rap rock fusions by bands like Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit; however, Ice-T states that the band's style does not fuse the two genres, and is solely a rock band.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nIn 1976, Marrow's girlfriend Adrienne gave birth to their daughter LeTesha (born March 20, 1976) and they attended high school while raising her. While filming Breakin' in 1984, he met his second girlfriend Darlene Ortiz, who was at the club where the film was shot. They began a relationship and Ortiz was featured on the covers of Rhyme Pays and Power. Ice-T and Ortiz had son Ice Tracy Marrow in 1992.\n\nIce-T married swimsuit model Nicole \"Coco Marie\" Austin[49] in January 2002.[51] In celebration of their impending 9th wedding anniversary, the couple renewed their wedding vows on June 4, 2011.[48] As of 2006 they owned a penthouse apartment in North Bergen, New Jersey.[52] In 2012 they were building a five-bedroom house in Edgewater, New Jersey, that was expected to be completed by the end of the year.[53] On November 28, 2015, the couple announced their child Chanel Nicole Marrow had been born, without specifying the exact date.[54][55]\n\nActivism [ edit ]\n\nDuring the popularity of Public Enemy, Ice-T was closely associated with the band and his recordings of the time showed a similar political viewpoint. He was referred to as \"The Soldier of the Highest Degree\" in the booklet for Fear of a Black Planet and mentioned on the track \"Leave This Off Your F***in' Charts\". He also collaborated with fellow anti-censorship campaigner Jello Biafra on his album The Iceberg/Freedom Of Speech... Just Watch What You Say!.\n\nOn June 5, 2008, Ice-T joked that he would be voting for John McCain in the 2008 American elections, speculating that his past affiliation with Body Count could hurt Barack Obama's chances if he endorsed him, so he would choose instead to ruin John McCain's campaign by saying he supported him.[56][57]\n\nPersonal disputes [ edit ]\n\nLL Cool J [ edit ]\n\nIce-T had a feud with LL Cool J in the late 1980s, and early 1990s. Apparently, this was instigated by LL's claim to be \"the baddest rapper in the history of rap itself\".[58] Ice-T recorded disses against LL on his 1988 album Power. On the album was the track, \"I'm Your Pusher\", in which a rap music addict declines to buy an LL Cool J record. The album also contains the posse rap track, \"The Syndicate\", which took aim at LL's lyrical ability, claiming that rapping about oneself so frequently was a \"first grade topic\".[59] The song also mocked the song's hook \"I'm Bad\", which identified it as an LL diss specifically. In the book Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies, Ice-T said that the song \"Girls L.G.B.N.A.F.\" was also intended as a diss to LL Cool J, by making a crude song to contrast with the love songs that LL was making at the time.\n\nOn LL's response, \"To da Break of Dawn\" in 1990, he dissed Kool Moe Dee (whose feud with LL was far more publicized) as well as MC Hammer. He then devoted the third verse of the song to dissing Ice-T, mocking his rap ability (\"take your rhymes around the corner to rap rehab\"), his background (\"before you rapped, you was a downtown car thief\"), and his style (\"a brother with a perm deserves to get burned\"). He also suggested that the success of Power was due to the appearance of Ice-T's girlfriend Darlene on the album cover. Ice-T appeared to have ignored the insults and he had also defended LL Cool J after his arrest in the song \"Freedom of Speech\".[61]\n\nIn August 2012, Ice-T said that the rivalry was \"never serious\" and that he needed a nemesis to create \"an exciting dispute\".[62]\n\nSoulja Boy Tell 'Em [ edit ]\n\nIn June 2008, on DJ Cisco's Urban Legend mixtape, Ice-T criticized DeAndre Cortez \"Soulja Boy Tell 'Em\" Way for \"killing hip hop\" and his song \"Crank That\" for being \"garbage\" compared to the works of other hip-hop artists such as Rakim, Das EFX, Big Daddy Kane and Ice Cube. One of the comments in the exchange was when Ice-T told Way to \"eat a dick\".[63] The two then traded numerous videos back and forth over the Internet. These videos included a cartoon and video of Ice-T dancing on Way's behalf and an apology, but reiteration of his feelings that Way's music \"sucks\", on Ice-T's behalf.[64] Rapper Kanye West defended Way saying \"He came from the 'hood, made his own beats, made up a new saying, new sound and a new dance with one song.\"[65]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nVideos [ edit ]\n\nVideo games [ edit ]\n\nAs a producer [ edit ]\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]\n\nGrammy Awards\n\nYear Nominated work Award Result 1991 Back on the Block Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group Won 1992 \"New Jack Hustler (Nino's Theme)\" Best Rap Solo Performance Nominated 2018 \"Black Hoodie\" Best Metal Performance Nominated\n\nMTV Video Music Awards\n\nMTV Movie Awards\n\nImage Awards\n\nAdult Video News Awards\n\nNews & Documentary Emmy Award\n\nYear Nominated work Award Result 2012 \"Planet Rock: The Story of Hip-Hop and the Crack Generation\" Outstanding Arts & Culture Programming Nominated\n\nAll Def Movie Awards\n\nYear Nominated work Award Result 2016 Surviving the Game Best Black Survivor in a Movie Nominated\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nThe Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck? , with Heidi Siegmund (1994) [8]\n\n, with Heidi Siegmund (1994) Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood (2011) [69]\n\n(2011) Kings of Vice (2011) [70]\n\n(2011) Mirror Image (2013)[71]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nCitations [ edit ]",

The multiplier was 2X.\n\nWith Wednesday night's Powerball drawing reaching a record-high jackpot, players were going the extra mile in pursuit of the princely payout.\n\nRetiree William Burke drove 45 minutes from his Nevada home to the California border, then spent three hours on line at a lottery vendor to scoop up 10 tickets for $20.\n\n\"I thought maybe I'd be part of history,\" Burke told The Associated Press.\n\nLottery officials had said earlier Wednesday that if no one matches the six winning numbers, the next drawing — set for Saturday — would likely feature a jackpot ballooning to an unprecedented $2 billion.\n\nSince Nov. 7, when the Powerball was reset to its minimum $40 million, there have been no winners — ensuring a growing frenzy for folks dreaming of the ultra-luxe life.\n\nDespite the impossible odds of winning — one in 292.2 million — the temptation of the big payoff remains. A winner would have the option of choosing an annuity payment option over 29 years or a lump-sum cash prize of about $930 million.\n\nRelated: Powerball Would Hit $2 Billion If No One Wins Latest Drawing\n\nEven after Uncle Sam gets his 40 percent cut, the final take home would still be a staggering $560 million for a single winner.\n\nPowerball is played in 44 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.\n\nFor those who live in the other six states where it isn't available, lottery sellers in border towns were reporting a surge in ticket sales, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association, which runs Powerball.\n\nEven Canadians were joining in on the billion-dollar hoopla — crossing the U.S. border to buy tickets in droves and lining up outside one Toronto bakery where tickets were being given away.\n\n\"There are a lot of them coming over, a lot of them in the lineup,\" Jim Murphy, an employee at the Wedge Discount Liquor Store in Niagara Falls, New York, told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nRelated:Eight Winners Whose Luck Ran Out\n\nIt is legal for tourists and non-U.S. residents to play the U.S. lottery.\n\nA Canadian winner who does not live in the United States, however, would be subject to a 30 percent U.S. withholding tax, plus possible state taxes. They would not face additional Canadian taxes.\n\nWhile gaming competition concerns prevent the lottery in Nevada, religious beliefs have posed a barrier in Alabama, Mississippi and Utah.\n\nAlaska has been more concerned that a lottery wouldn't pay off in such a sparsely populated state. In Hawaii, lawmakers have proposed lottery measures, but the idea always fails.\n\n\"I'm sure they're watching those dollars flow out of their state,\" said Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery.\n\nIn Alabama, people have been talking about instituting a lottery for years, in part because of sales in border states. Faced with tight state budgets and demands from voters, Republicans and Democrats on Tuesday introduced rival lottery bills for the legislative session that begins in February.\n\nMississippi state Rep. Alyce Clarke, a Democrat from Jackson, has repeatedly sponsored a lottery bill, but she said religious opposition always kills the idea. That could change this year because of Powerball, she explained, enabling the state to raise money to subsidize colleges or fix roads and bridges.\n\nLottery vendors in Georgia, which borders Alabama, are eager to see new customers.\n\nRelated: Powerball Jackpot Hits Staggering $1.5 Billion\n\nAugusta, Georgia, couple Bill and Sandra Evans told NBC affiliate WAGT that they're confident they're holding the top ticket.\n\n\"This is her first time buying a ticket and she thinks somehow because it’s her first time, she’s gonna win.

  "latent_4558": "Gotham City Impostors is a first-person shooter multiplayer-only video game set in the universe of DC Comics' Batman. Developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, the downloadable game is played from the perspective of two teams each trying to kill the other: one with people dressed like Batman and the other with people dressed like his archenemy, the Joker.[3][4][5]\n\nUnlike other Batman games, Gotham City Impostors was not physically released. It was released on Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network and Microsoft Windows via Games for Windows – Live in February 2012.[4][6] The game was re-released on Microsoft Windows as a free-to-play title in August 30, 2012 via Steam using Steamworks.[2] The game is a six versus six first person shooter multiplayer game featuring customizable characters. Players take on the role of either amateur vigilantes (the Bats) or criminals (the Jokerz). The game features a range of both traditional and imagined weapons.\n\nGameplay [ edit ]\n\nGotham City Impostors there is a heavy emphasis on allowing players to customize their character. Weapons, clothing, and even the size of the character can be modified. Inthere is a heavy emphasis on allowing players to customize their character. Weapons, clothing, and even the size of the character can be modified.\n\nGotham City Impostors is playable by at most twelve players simultaneously.[3] Players can customize their costume, gadgets and other aspects of the game.[5] It features a colorful and over-the-top visual style, including such settings as an amusement park. In addition to guns and knives, the players are able to use other gadgets such as grappling hooks, glider wings, roller skates and explosives.[4] The game includes both conventional guns and outlandish weapons, including a grenade fashioned like a jack-in-the-box and a rocket launcher made of PVC piping.\n\nThe game has four different modes: Psych Warfare, Fumigation, Bounty Hunter, and Team Deathmatch. Psych Warfare involves the two teams trying to bring a battery back to their base and defend it long enough for it to allow a machine to brainwash the other team. Fumigation sends players to capture and hold three gasblasters, a type of command post, to get their gas level to 100%. Players are treated to the sight of the enemy being swarmed by bats (if the Bats win), or suffocated by a poison cloud (if the Jokerz win). In Bounty Hunter you win the match by collecting coins enemy players drop when they die, you can also pick up your teammates' dropped coins to deny the other team points. In Team Deathmatch the goal is to kill enemy players as fast as possible. There are also Challenges; these are played alone, and are used to master gadgets and earn extra experience. Lastly, there is a training mode called Initiation, where the Bats' leader instructs the player on how to use weapons and gadgets.[5]\n\nDevelopment and marketing [ edit ]\n\nBatman: Impostors, a storyline that ran through Detective Comics #867-870, was inspired by Gotham City Impostors.[7] The premise for the storyline is that the impostors are created by Winslow Heath, a man who was a victim of Joker toxin early in Batman's career; as a result of narcotics that he had ingested before he was exposed to the toxin, Heath survived the attack, but was left paralyzed while fully conscious for years, his features twisted into a permanent duplicate of the Joker's own visage. When he regains full mobility, he discovers that his girlfriend, Beth – who was exposed to the Joker toxin under the same circumstances, as the two took the same drugs - was left to die in their apartment as Batman was so caught up in trying to catch the Joker that he never looked back after 'rescuing' Heath, with the result that Beth was left to get eaten alive by crows. Driven insane by the torment he endured in the hospital, Heath created a unique 'Joker juice' named Formula 5 that would turn those who used it into temporary duplicates of the Joker with a significant high in the process, simultaneously posing as an impostor Batman to rally others against the impostor Jokers and trigger a gang war. Although Batman deduces the truth and captures Heath, he is left troubled at the implication that Heath is correct in his statement that Batman creates his own villains.\n\nThe preview for Cartoon Network's upcoming animation block DC Nation Shorts in 2012 included animation of Gotham City Impostors.

It controls great, looks fantastic, and with all of the options, I can say that I was quite impressed.\"[5] The game scored a 65/100 on Metacritic.[8]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",
  "latent_4585": "The Toronto Maple Leafs have hired Jacques Lemaire as a special assignment coach, the team announced Friday.\n\nLemaire has coached 1,262 games (617-458-124-63) in his career split between the Montreal Canadiens, New Jersey Devils and Minnesota Wild. The 69-year-old has spent the last six seasons in the Devils organization, most recently as a special assignment coach, where he worked with new Maple Leafs general manager Lou Lamoriello. He has some experience coaching beside Maple Leafs head coach Mike Babcock.\n\n“Obviously Jacques Lemaire has a wealth of experience,” Babcock said in a press release. “We had a great relationship from the 2010 Olympics and I’ve asked him to join our staff to help me and the rest of our coaches within the entire organization be the best they can be.”\n\nLemaire, a two-time Jack Adams Award winner and Hockey Hall of Famer, won eight Stanley Cups as a player with the Canadiens and coached the Devils to a championship in 1995.\n\nReports first surfaced that Lemaire could possibly join the Maple Leafs earlier this week. Devils beat writer Tom Gulitti asked Lemaire Thursday if it might be bizarre working for the Maple Leafs since he has such a storied history with the Canadiens.\n\n“I’ve been away so long that the only guy that is still involved there that I know well is [Canadiens head coach] Mike Therrien and [assistant coach] J.J. Daigneault, who I coached,” Lemaire told Gulitti. “But, besides that. [Canadiens GM] Marc [Bergevin] looks like a real nice guy, but I never really knew him before. I knew him because he was involved with Chicago and as a player, but not personally.”\n\nLemaire is the newest member of a totally revamped Maple Leafs coaching staff. In June, the team named Jim Hiller, D.J. Smith and Andrew Brewer as assistant coaches.",
  "latent_4643": "It was hardly a secret, but Mississauga councillor Bonnie Crombie made it official Tuesday morning: She will try to fill the sizeable void being left by legendary Mayor Hazel McCallion. Crombie registered for the mayoral race at Mississauga City Hall, promising three key things. “My platform is: how we move; grow responsibly; and how we thrive.”\n\nMississauga Councillor Bonnie Crombie ends months of speculation Tuesday morning as she registers to run in the city's mayoral race. ( Keith Beaty / Toronto Star )\n\nCrombie, a former one term MP for Mississauga, joined council in 2011 after winning a by-election following her defeat in the federal election. Her main challenger in the race is former city councillor, MPP and MP Steve Mahoney. After Mahoney registered last week, Crombie, long rumoured to covet the mayor's seat, said he did not represent the “Mississauga of today.”\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nMahoney countered with his own shot, suggesting Crombie spends all her time promoting herself instead of formulating a true vision for Mississauga. Crombie said a full platform is being developed and will be rolled out in coming weeks. Meanwhile, Mississauga voters now have two established candidates faced with a significant task. Part of McCallion’s legacy is a $1.5 billion infrastructuredeficit, after more than a decade of near-zero per cent tax increases prior to the current term. Chipping away at that deficit in recent years has meant average increases of more than 5 per cent on the Mississauga portion of the property bill. Meanwhile, dozens of projects in the once-flush city have gone unfunded because slowing growth has reduced revenues. Crombie said she’s the right person to turn things around.\n\n“Economic development will be a focus. It’s all about the innovation and knowledge economy, and harnessing the diverse skills of our residents.” Crombie said she will focus on how to bring revenues into the city by growing the economy.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nAs for keeping Mississauga at the table with business leaders, the province and Ottawa, Crombie said she will use what she’s learned from McCallion. “I’'ve been privileged to work with her. But this is a new time for Mississauga. I have the experience. I’m vibrant.” Both Crombie and Mahoney have said McCallion has pledged to remain neutral throughout the campaign. After 36 years on the job, the 93-year-old McCallion has said this will be her last term.\n\nRead more about:",

  "latent_4679": "Sixteen years after Robin Hanson published a seminal paper on using prediction markets to inform governance decisions, his ideas have found a home in the Ethereum community.\n\nThe associate professor of economics at George Mason University and researcher at Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute first coined the term “Futarchy” to describe a new form of governance that uses data from prediction markets to provide input.\n\nSince the article’s original publication, Hanson has traveled the world teaching classes, pitching businesses and making appearances at conferences about Futarchy. But until now, no one has ever implemented the idea in the real world.\n\nRecent moves in the Ethereum community have provided an avenue for these concepts to move closer to implementation. In interview, Hanson offered why he believes his simple idea finally found a fit in a distributed, autonomous world.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“The slogan is vote on values, bet on beliefs. What you need are discreet decisions and then you need an outcome that you care about.”\n\nIn the Futarchy model, market participants, or voters, are allowed to buy stock in an idea that may or may not take place over a certain period of time.\n\nTo follow Hanson’s frequently cited example, a public company could hold its chief executive accountable to achieving a particular stock price over a given period of time.\n\nThose who believe in the CEO can invest in a “yes” token, thereby supporting the future success of the company and positioning themselves to get paid out if they are correct. Participants who don’t believe in this outcome can invest in a “no” token, and receive a reward if they are correct.\n\nEffectively, authority holders set the terms by which their success or failure would be determined, and market speculators use their money to indicate the outcomes they believe to be the most likely – thereby setting an agenda of sorts within that governance structure.\n\nWhen applied to a blockchain-based corporate structure, also known as a distributed autonomous organization (DAO), the prediction market concept could empower stakeholders to vote their outcome beliefs.\n\nSome community members want to see this implemented in the near term, as the DAO concept begins to move past the drawing board.\n\nLast week, Ethereum-based prediction market Gnosis published a private version of a proposal to augment The DAO – an organization aimed at funding Ethereum projects that has collected more than $150m worth of the cryptocurrency ether since its launch earlier this month – with a Futarchy-based prediction market used to vote on the pitches it receives.\n\nMaking contact\n\nHanson was first introduced to the Ethereum community back in 2014, when he says Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin reached out to him with questions about Futarchy.\n\nBy the end of that year, Buterin had published a piece called “Introduction to Futarchy” that included a detailed description of how the concept functions, an account of Hanson’s CEO example, as well as five arguments against Futarchy.\n\nPerhaps most notably, one argument included in the piece posited that wealthy entities could shape prediction outcomes by purchasing an outsized amount of “yes” tokens.\n\nThis initial contact with elements of the Ethereum community would go further, as Matt Liston, co-founder of Ethereum-based prediction market platform Augur, sought to bring in Hanson as a project advisor in late 2014. The arrangement was formalized in August 2015, after Liston’s departure from the company.\n\nImproving DAO governance\n\nA distributed organization built on a blockchain like Ethereum is governed primarily through the function of smart contracts. But in order for the smart contract to function, it first needs a form of input or data from the outside world – and that data is only as valuable as it is trustworthy.\n\nTraditionally, information is provided to prediction markets like casinos in the form of a trusted third party. But in the decentralized world of DAOs that information could come from what is called an “oracle”, a source of information that relies on the “wisdom of the crowd” to formulate its answers.\n\n“An oracle is an external actor which can provide information from the real world into the blockchain,” said Stefan George of Gnosis, whose company is building both a prediction market to help DAOs make decisions and and an oracle to help generate the data. “The blockchain itself doesn’t know anything.”\n\nUsers of Gnosis, for example, will be able to “sign” data which can then be used to help resolve events pertinent to other users’ desired decisions. For example, the data provided would give insight into whether a sports team actually won a game, of it a CEO actually delivered on the promises they made.\n\nFinding the right product fit\n\nAt issues is the fact that The DAO, in particular, already has a method of governance.\n\nBuilt from open-source code written by Ethereum-based startup Slock.it, The DAO has raised millions worth of of ETH based on a business model of allowing those who buy voters rights tokens to cast a vote on funding proposals they want to support.\n\nBut according to Martin Köppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis, the principles of Futarchy may offer a better route.\n\nKöppelmann explained that the concept as its built into his company’s software provides a more accurate way for stakeholders to express confidence in outcomes, using a prediction market that rewards them proportionately.\n\nInstead of casting a single vote for every DAO token they own, experts are empowered to vote relative to their confidence that they are correct. A virtual reality expert might have particularly strong feelings about a new immersive system build into Ethereum and with Futarchy would be able to express that confidence.\n\nKöppelmann explained:\n\n“In Futarchy, if someone has a very strong opinion and he would be very sure that he’s right then he could just use more money and therefore have a higher influence.”\n\nWhile the system may seem easy to game by faking expertise, the long-term reputation of a voter can be damaged and lost resources would accumulate.\n\nIn theory, the risk of reputation loss amongst participants incentivizes honest behavior. But using rewards to dissuade corruption is a long way from actually preventing it.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation Futarchy grant\n\nOn 25th April, Liston and Köppelmann won a $15k grant from the Ethereum Foundation to conduct three separate experiments on Futarchy using the Gnosis technology. The funds will be disbursed over a three-month period, with the project encompassing three experiments.\n\nAccording to Liston and Köppelmann, the first two experiments are designed to test the impact of the Gnosis prediction market in a “scalar” setting, where market manipulators are incentivized to manipulate the value of a smart contract that is expected to pay out on a particular date.\n\nThe third experiment “gets a little closer to Futarchy” as Liston put it, testing what is known as the “should we hire this CEO” theory.\n\nIn this particular experiment, the vested interests of a CEO and his associates will be tested over time relative to the expected return. The hope, according to the two, is to figure out a way to prevent the system from being rigged.\n\nUltimately, Gnosis intends to seek to do business with distributed organizations, including The DAO, as it seeks to bring these governance concepts to fruition.\n\nAsking the right questions\n\nHanson says that, in the 16 years since he first published his paper on Futarchy, the concept has seen mixed results on the implementation front.\n\n“Often people get excited about the abstract but they don’t get the details right,” he told CoinDesk. “Getting the details right matters especially in these blockchain-based technologies where after it goes live you can’t just change them.”\n\nWith an eye to this degree of confusion, Hanson later published advice on how to navigate the trickier aspects of his concept. In conversation, Hanson suggested that special attention ought to be paid to precisely how predictive questions are phrased before they are put to the market for feedback.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n“The key thing is you want to ask the question that you actually want the answer to, and you want to ask people who might actually be able to answer.”\n\nImage via George Mason University",

  "latent_4801": "As arguments rage over how to clean up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, an examination of toxicity tests reveals flaws in the data used to determine the safety of dispersants.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency and BP have locked horns over the toxicity of the dispersants being used to break up the oil spewing from the Deepwater Horizon well. Now, New Scientist has learned that huge variability in the safety test results submitted by different manufacturers makes it very difficult to judge which of the available dispersant chemicals poses the least threat to marine life.\n\n“It screams to me that I can’t make a judgement on any of these data,” says Carys Mitchelmore, a toxicologist at the University of Maryland’s Chesapeake Biology Laboratory in Solomons, and co-author of a 2005 National Research Council report on the use of oil dispersants.\n\nThe EPA commissioned a new round of tests in late May, but it remains unclear when these will be completed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of 14 June, more than 3.34 million litres of dispersant had been sprayed onto oil on the sea surface. At least a further 1.52 million litres had been pumped into the oil gushing from the stricken well some 1500 metres below sea level. The use of such large volumes at depth is unprecedented, and marine biologists are concerned about possible toxicity to organisms, including shrimp and fish larvae.\n\nBP vs EPA\n\nSo far BP has used a dispersant called Corexit EC9500A made by Nalco Energy Services of Sugar Land, Texas. But on 20 May, the EPA ordered BP to find a less toxic alternative.\n\nThe company quickly responded, stating that only five dispersants met the EPA’s requirements. Only one, called Sea Brat #4, made by Alabaster of Pasadena, Texas, was stockpiled by BP. This contained a chemical that would degrade into nonylphenol; this is a hormone disrupter likely to harm the reproductive systems of marine organisms. “BP continues to believe that Corexit EC9500A remains the best alternative,” the company concluded.\n\nSince then, there has been an uneasy stand-off, with the EPA telling BP on 26 May to stop surface spraying, and limit its subsea use of dispersant to a maximum of some 57,000 litres on any given day.\n\nToxicity tests\n\nHowever, a close examination of the EPA’s website reveals that the agency’s assumptions about dispersant toxicity are based on unreliable data.\n\nWhen it demanded that BP find less toxic dispersants, the EPA referred to a table summarising experiments in which a fish called Menidia beryllina and Mysidopsis bahia shrimp were exposed to a mixture of dispersant and diesel fuel oil in a ratio of 1:10.\n\nThese are standard experiments that must be submitted for inclusion on the EPA’s National Contingency Plan Product Schedule, which lists products authorised for use on an oil spill. They determine the concentrations in parts per million (ppm) required to kill half of the animals in a given time.\n\nBut they are only part of a series of tests that are required by the EPA: the dispersant must also be tested alone, the fuel oil must be tested alone, and finally the lab must run controls testing a “reference toxicant” known as dodecyl sodium sulphate (DSS).\n\nLooking across all the listed dispersants, test results for the fuel oil alone are highly variable, with the concentrations required to kill half of the fish varying from 5.95 to 201.8 ppm. This could indicate that some of the tested oil samples had lost their most toxic volatile components.\n\nThis is a major problem. The tests reveal varying toxicity for the different dispersant-oil mixes. But given the significant differences between results for samples of oil alone, it becomes very difficult to compare the results for the mixes. “It’s absurd,” says Joannie Docter, president of GlobeMark Resources in Atlanta, Georgia, which makes a dispersant called JD-2000.\n\nIncomplete data\n\nThe DSS control experiments pose even bigger problems, says Mitchelmore. The concentrations of DSS required to kill half of the fish, for example, vary from 1.14 ppm for the tests submitted for Sea Brat #4, to 159.6 ppm for the controls submitted for Nokomis 3-F4, made by Mar-Len Supply of Hayward, California.\n\nPresumably, this huge variation reflects inconsistencies in the testing procedures used by the labs hired by manufacturers to run the tests. If so, it throws the EPA’s conclusions about the products’ relative toxicities into serious doubt.\n\nDocter has complained to the EPA about its reliance on “incomplete and misleading” data; Nalco has similarly drawn the agency’s attention to the huge variability in the results supplied by different dispersant manufacturers. “They acknowledged that there are some shortcomings,” says David Horsup, vice-president for research and development with Nalco Energy Services.\n\nMitchelmore argues that the EPA should also run tests on the growth and reproduction of shrimp and fish, to judge the dispersants’ longer-term effects. Those tests are not yet being run.\n\nThe EPA says it has commissioned a single laboratory to retest all the authorised dispersants, running the standard tests but using Louisiana crude rather than fuel oil. Establishing uniform conditions and ensuring the animals are all of the same age takes time, the agency told New Scientist. “These tests take more than a few days to run.”",
  "latent_4931": "We knew everything.\n\nIn a press conference, President Obama said that our failure to stop the terrorist incident was \"not the fault of a single individual or organization.\" But that's not true. The minute Abdulmutallab's father walked into a U.S. Embassy with news that his son was a potential terrorist, the official in charge was duty-bound to see this through. Every scrap of paper and every byte of data on the suspect should have been called up and frozen. That's why we have embassies. When the information was passed to the first special agent at the CIA, he or she was duty bound to see it through. When the information was passed to the first administrator at the National Counterterrorism Center, he or she, too, was duty bound to see it to the end.\n\nEveryone who read the name \"Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab\" prior to December 25, 2009 should be reprimanded and fired.\n\nThe White House findings state that, \"Mr. Abdulmutallab possessed a U.S. visa, but this fact was not correlated with the concerns of Mr. Abdulmutallab's father about Mr. Abdulmutallab's potential radicalization.\" It's an embarrassing sentence of bureaucratese in its own right, but more so when considered in context. The State Department didn't revoke Abdulmutallab's visa because an office clerk misspelled his name in a database.\n\nHas no one in the intelligence community ever used Google? When \"Abdulmutalab\" was typed in, did the computer not ask, \"Did you mean 'Abdulmutallab'?\"\n\nAnother admission that crosses the threshold of bewildering into the realm of criminally negligent: the National Counterterrorism Center has a database of all known and suspected international terrorists. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was added to that database.\n\nBut that database does not feed directly into the TSA No-Fly List.\n\nWho more than known terrorists belong on the No-Fly List? There should be no human involvement required here. One line of SQL database code could have averted disaster.\n\nAccording to the White House, when the CIA and NCTC got the name of a radicalized militant from the militant's own father, and a warning that he was planning an attack, they did not search \"all available databases to uncover additional derogatory information.\" How many databases are there? And how many terrorist databases must one appear in before he or she is considered a threat to U.S. national security?\n\nThis wasn't a ticking time bomb situation involving a lone wolf under the radar. Such a terrorist will succeed, and there's nothing we can do about it, aside from remaining vigilant. But the United States already knew about Abdulmutallab, and learned of his intentions on November 18th -- a month before he struck.\n\nMost grating in the White House report is the repeated notion that Abdulmutallab's plot failed. It didn't. Nine years after 9/11, and after billions of spent dollars in needless security, confiscated fingernail clippers, and dumped breast milk, he succeeded in smuggling explosives onto an airliner destined for American soil. He succeeded in igniting the explosive. If not for dumb luck involving bad chemistry and a brave Dutch film director, there might today be a smoldering crater in Detroit.",
  "latent_4940": "Romulus & Remus\n\n“Monkey boys,” “wolf girls,” “gazelle boys,” and even an “ostrich boy;” they are all part of the lore of the feral children. Also known as “wild children,” these are children who have grown up with little or no human contact, and they are therefore unaware of human social behavior or language. Some are thought to have been raised by animals, some have reportedly fended for themselves in the wild, and others are victims of abuse, having grown up in the forced isolation of cages or basements.\n\nBeing skeptical by nature, I usually find such claims too incredible to be true, but there is a considerable amount of evidence and history available about feral children. While many of the historical cases are unreliable or completely fictitious, other records of feral children defy a simple explanation and are hard to ignore.\n\nFrom 1724 there are records describing a naked, brownish, black-haired boy who was found running up and down in the fields of the German town of Hamelin. The “creature” was enticed into town, and once there immediately became a subject of great interest. He behaved like a trapped wild animal, eating birds and vegetables raw, and when threatened, he sat on his haunches or on all fours looking for opportunities to escape. The boy was given the name “Peter” and was soon made the possession of King George I of England, where he lived the rest of his life. During his life Peter never learned to talk, showed a complete indifference to money or sex, and was never seen laughing. However he loved music, and he was able to learn a number of menial tasks before he died in 1785.\n\nAnother example is a boy named Victor who was discovered foraging for roots and acorns in the woods near Aveyron, France in 1799. He appeared to be about eleven or twelve years old, but he didn’t speak. He was taken to Paris, where he resembled a human only in appearance. Victor behaved like an animal, he ate rotten food with pleasure, he was incapable of distinguishing hot from cold, and he spent much of his time rocking back and forth like a caged animal. He was taken into the care of the brilliant scientist Dr Jean-Marc-Gaspard Itard, who dedicated himself to the education of the boy. Victor proved to be a very difficult subject. Over the years, he only learned two terms, “lait,” and “oh dieu.” His sense of touch seemed to be far more important than his sense of sight, and he did not demonstrate an ability to distinguish right from wrong. Like Peter before him, he was indifferent to sex, and he did learn some menial tasks, such as setting a table. Victor lived the rest of his life in the care of his housekeeper, and died in 1828 at the age of forty.\n\nKaspar Hauser\n\nOne of the more mysterious cases is that of Kaspar Hauser, who was discovered in Nuremberg, Germany in 1828. He was unsteady on his feet, held a letter for a man he had never met, and only spoke the phrase “I want to be a horseman like my father is.” The letter was addressed to the captain of the 4th squadron of the 6th cavalry regiment:\n\nHonored Captain,\n\nI send you a lad who wishes to serve his king in the Army. He was brought to me on October 7th, 1812. I am but a poor laborer with children of my own to rear. His mother asked me to bring up the boy, and so I thought I would rear him as my own son. Since then, I have never let him go one step outside the house, so no one knows where he was reared. He, himself, does not know the name of the place or where it is.You may question him, Honoured Captain, but he will not be able to tell you where I live. I brought him out at night. He cannot find his way back. He has not a penny, for I have nothing myself. If you do not keep him, you must strike him dead or hang him.\n\nKaspar was about sixteen years old, but he behaved like a small child. At first, when a mirror was handed to him he would look behind it trying to find the person behind the mirror, and he burned his hand while touching a candle’s flame in curiosity. Kaspar had excellent night vision and a keen sense of smell. He detested meat and alcohol, and was offended by the smell of flowers. Unlike many of the other cases described here, Kaspar did learn much over time, eventually learning to speak enough to describe the small cage in which he had been raised, and the mysterious keeper who finally released him outside of town. But about five years after appearing from nowhere, Kaspar was assassinated. The reason for his murder might be because some believed he was the missing heir to the throne of Baden. His assassin lured him away under the pretense that they would reveal who his parents were, and stabbed him fatally in the chest. The mystery of his early life and violent death has never been satisfactorily answered.\n\nSome feral children have been discovered in more recent history. In a modern version of the Romulus and Remus legend, two young girls were said to have been discovered under the care of a she-wolf in Godamuri, India in 1920. The girls were taken to an orphanage in Midnapore (now part of Orissa). The children, Kamala, aged eight and Amala, aged eighteen months, behaved exactly like small wild animals. They slept during the day and woke by night. They remained on all fours, enjoyed raw meat, and were given to biting and attacking other children if provoked. They could smell raw meat from a distance, and they had an acute sense of sight and hearing. The youngest child, Amala, died one year later, but Kamala lived for nine years in the orphanage until she died of illness at the age of seventeen Kamala did eventually acquire a small vocabulary, but she remained very different from other children until the time of her death.\n\nPerhaps the saddest example of a feral child is a girl named Genie. On November 4, 1970 she was brought into a welfare office in California by her mother, who claimed that she and her daughter were victims of abuse from the woman’s husband. Genie appeared to be about six of seven years old, but when the social worker learned that Genie was actually thirteen years old, she contacted the police. It was soon revealed that Genie had been locked away in a room alone for over ten years. She had been tied to a potty-chair and left to sit alone day after day. At night, she was tied into a sleeping bag which restrained her arms, and placed in an over-sized crib with a cover made of metal screening. Often she was forgotten, and had to spend the night tied to the potty chair.\n\nGenie immediately after rescue\n\nAt first, people could hardly believe that Genie was thirteen years old; she weighed only 59 pounds and was 54 inches tall. While she seemed to understand a few words, the only words she could say were “stop it” and “no more.” She had a strange bunny-like walk, possibly due to malformed limbs. She held her hands up in front of her like paws and moved in a halting way. She could not chew solid food and could hardly swallow. She spat and sniffed constantly. She was not toilet-trained and could not focus her eyes beyond 12 feet.\n\nA team of scientists known as “the Genie Team” began began working with Genie in a controversial multi-year research project. Some people felt that the experiments took away any chance for Genie to have a normal life, but the researchers made efforts to give Genie positive social contact by making her part of the head researcher’s family, taking her on outings, and letting her see the world. Because Genie proved incapable of learning language beyond very simple sentences, scientists at first thought she might be mentally handicapped; but she proved to be quite intelligent, scoring perfectly on an adult-level test that measured spatial abilities, and scoring the highest recorded results ever on tests that measure a person’s ability to make sense out of chaos and to see patterns. Research stopped after the scientists lost their funding, and Genie was moved to a series of foster homes. Today she lives anonymously in an assisted living facility somewhere in Southern California.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the study of children like Genie, such research has led to breakthroughs in the education of people with learning disabilities and alternative language skills like sign language and Braille. Feral child research has also helped in developing theories about the evolution of language. Feral children also create many insights about who we are as human beings. They bring us closer to knowing what aspects of human behavior are genetic and what parts are learned. Feral children show us the importance of both our nature and the nurturing influence of other humans. These children and their struggles bring us the fragmented and haunting story that we are viewing the savage image of ourselves.",
  "latent_5161": "After The New York Times began asking about the policy on withholding reports, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the governor’s office would review the change.\n\nThe fatality reports were intended to permit public scrutiny of the performance of child welfare authorities while protecting the privacy of those involved. The reports do not identify deceased children, their caseworkers or anyone else by name. But they do list every complaint of abuse or neglect involving the child, the child welfare agency’s response to the complaints, and an assessment of whether the response was adequate.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe state issues about 250 fatality reports each year. And in 2010, for example, two-thirds of the reports issued in New York City involved homes with multiple children, meaning that under its new policy, officials could withhold information about their deaths.\n\n“The whole point of this was to insist we were going to have accountability,” said Martin Guggenheim, a professor of law at New York University and an expert in child welfare law. “What we’re now stuck with is delegating to the commissioner the discretion to refuse to disclose a report because of her conclusion that it wouldn’t be in a child’s best interest.”\n\nThe state agency says it changed the rule out of concern for the privacy of surviving children. Elisa’s Law included a provision allowing the office to withhold reports if someone requested to see a particular child’s case. But state officials said anyone could get around that provision by simply asking to see all the reports in a given year.\n\n“Our primary focus is protecting the interests of surviving siblings and family members,” said Gladys Carrión, the commissioner of the Office of Children and Family Services.\n\nMs. Carrión said she could not provide an example of a child’s being harmed as a result of the release of a fatality report, but she said: “It is not far-fetched that releasing the information of a particular child would have an adverse impact on surviving siblings.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore her death, Elisa’s life seemed full of promise. She lived with her devoted father. Teachers described her as radiant. And a benefactor had agreed to pay for her education.\n\nAll of that changed when her father died of cancer and her mother, Awilda Lopez, was awarded custody. Ms. Lopez, whom acquaintances described as crazed by crack cocaine, said she saw the devil when she looked into her daughter’s face.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Lopez beat the girl, abused her sexually and subjected her to a barrage of hurt and humiliation. Finally, she smashed the girl’s head against concrete and left her lying slack-jawed and unconscious for two days until she died. Elisa was buried in Cypress Hills Cemetery in Queens, where the epitaph carved into her tombstone pleads, “World Please Watch Over the Children.”\n\nRelatives, teachers and others who had seen evidence of Elisa’s abuse had complained to child welfare authorities at least seven times.\n\nOne major change after Elisa’s death was the creation by New York City of the Administration for Children’s Services, a separate agency devoted to child welfare and protection. Another was Elisa’s Law, which arose out of lawmakers’ frustration when city authorities, citing confidentiality, refused to answer questions about their role in the death.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The most recent was introduced in the Assembly in the current legislative session and in January was referred to committee.\n\nThe bill would require the state to release its recommendations for administrative or policy changes resulting from a child’s death. But in cases where there are surviving siblings or other children in the home, the bill would permit the state to withhold the details of the family’s case history and how the local child welfare agency responded if releasing those details was deemed to be against the other children’s “best interest.” The local agency, which in New York City is the Administration for Children’s Services, would have a say in the decision, even though that agency might have been responsible for any missteps.\n\nThe Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the Assembly version of Elisa’s Law, would not comment on the changes to public disclosure proposed by the Office of Children and Family Services. But a spokeswoman said on his behalf that any bill to amend Elisa’s Law would be vetted to determine whether the process protects “to the greatest extent possible” New York’s children and their families.\n\nMarcia Robinson Lowry, a lawyer and the director of Children’s Rights Inc., a national watchdog group dedicated to reforming government child welfare services, said limiting access to reports would hurt efforts to make the system more responsive to children in dangerous homes.\n\n“They are something a public advocacy group or a think tank or a responsible party can have available to understand the systemic failures that have led to these children’s deaths,” she said. “They are critically important.”",

  "latent_5229": "ATLANTA - Atlanta had just scored a touchdown to take a 10-point lead with less than seven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, deflating a Vikings team that had fought to make a budding blowout competitive.\n\nPercy Harvin approached Leslie Frazier on the sideline. \"We had talked during the week about him returning kicks,\" Frazier said. \"He came up to me and said, 'OK, Coach, is this the one you want me to take?'\"\n\nThe answer to that question should always be, \"Yes.\"\n\nHarvin took the kick 7 yards deep in the end zone. He burst to the right and shot past the last Falcons defender near midfield. \"I knew once I got to the 50, it was going to be a long run,\" Harvin said. \"I was fatigued.\"\n\nNo wonder. With Adrian Peterson injured and the overmatched Vikings facing a probable playoff team in the Georgia Dome, Harvin was asked to become the Vikings' top deep receiver, slot receiver, specialty back and kick returner.\n\nPeterson's nickname is \"AD,\" for \"All Day.\" Harvin's should be \"BAO,\" for \"By Appointment Only.\"\n\nIf Peterson is a leading man, Harvin specializes in cameos.\n\nSunday, Christian Ponder threw eight passes toward Harvin. Harvin caught all eight, for 95 yards.\n\nHarvin set up the Vikings' first touchdown, in the third quarter, with a tough catch between two defenders good for 20 yards on third-and-10, landing just shy of the goal line. Toby Gerhart scored on the next play to cut the Atlanta lead to 17-7.\n\nEarly in the fourth, the Vikings faced fourth-and-13. The Falcons allowed Harvin to run free down the middle, and Ponder hit him for a 39-yard touchdown pass that made it 17-14.\n\nWhen Atlanta scored about six minutes later, the Vikings were in danger of losing for the ninth time in 11 games. That was when Harvin found Frazier on the sideline, then sliced through Atlanta's kick coverage and saw Falcons cornerback Chris Owens bearing down on him.\n\n\"He's a fast guy, so we both tried to stretch it out at the end,\" Harvin said.\n\nAs Harvin passed the 20, then the 10, he looked over his left shoulder. \"I was looking for him to maybe dive and clip my heel, and I was going to stiff-arm him,\" Harvin said. \"But that didn't happen. He made a good play.\"\n\nOwen caught Harvin and pulled him down at the 3. Harvin had just completed a 104-yard return, the longest in NFL history that did not result in a touchdown, and yet Owens' tackle kept him from a pivotal score, a play emblematic of the Vikings', and Harvin's, afternoon.\n\nOn first-and-goal, Ponder sprinted right and the only receiver in sight, Devin Aromashodu, abandoned his route and tried to block, leaving Ponder with no options other than taking a sack.\n\nOn second-and-goal from the 5, Harvin, a fat-free 184-pounder, slammed into the line for 3 yards. \"He's unbelievable,\" Ponder said. \"He's so tough. Everyone knows he's battling injuries and he's hurting a little bit, but he's out there every day, not only working hard in practice but playing extremely well in games.\"\n\nOn third down, Harvin, more skeleton key than battering ram, slammed into the line again. \"I felt I scored,\" he said. \"I was under the pile. I don't know if the referee got a good look at it. They discussed it and said it was no touchdown, so I moved on to the next play.\"\n\nInstead of scoring on a 107-yard kickoff return, or finishing the drive with a rushing touchdown, Harvin's day was done. The Falcons overwhelmed Gerhart on a fourth-down carry, then ran out the clock, and Harvin was left to remember a spectacular day and an all-too-routine loss.\n\n\"My major thing coming into the game was, I knew AP was out, and I knew a lot of people didn't give us a chance even with AP,\" Harvin said. \"With him being gone, probably a lot of people didn't even watch the game.\n\n\"So, me being a playmaker, I was kind of looking for the team to jump on my back.\"\n\nInstead, it was Chris Owens who climbed aboard near the end of Harvin's longest run.\n\nJim Souhan can be heard Sundays from 10 a.m. to noon and weekdays at 2 p.m. on 1500ESPN.

  "latent_5613": "\"When there is a club, he wants to have the feeling it is my club, not the club of Qatar or Abu Dhabi.\"– Hans- Joachim Watzke\n\nGermany has really made its blotch on Europe over the last few seasons and some football enthusiasts have focused their attention, which has resulted in them learning that the German Bundesliga seems to do things in the right manner. Germany dominated in the UEFA Champions League last season with their top two clubs gaining access to the Final at Wembley at the end of May 2013. Borussia Dortmund are currently known for their fast fluid game but a nut that can be cracked, whereas Bayern München crippled teams including the mighty FC Barcelona on their UEFA Champions League glory trail. It appears that the German football dominance is on its way back into European football as German shores have struggled in Europe in the past, as the last winner’s of the UEFA Champions League from Germany were Bayern München after beating Valencia of Spain on penalties back in 2001.\n\nOver the last year, ‘Deutschland’ has been the chief subject of dialogue in a number of discussions and the ultimate conclusion is that they come top in every category. There has been request for modification to mainly the English Premier league for their extravagance and yielding players high wages. There has also been debate of ticket expenses with Arsenal charging their own supporters £94 in the game against Bayern München last season in the UEFA Champions League. Football attendances in the English Premier League cannot be compared to Germany’s and above all the German leagues create unique atmospheres that cannot be matched. This account it going to explore those areas in which supporters think are the main ingredients to making their game special and what changes could be made to progress certain leagues around Europe.\n\nLet us start with ticket charges, as this has been a discussion that has never been concluded and somewhat upset devotees of clubs around the United Kingdom because it appears that the famous English game has lost its ‘identity’. There has been a recent protest by Crystal Palace supporters presenting a banner in their home game saying, ‘£55 for Chelsea away, 9 hours minimum wage. Is this the working mans game?’ There is obvious annoyance with many of the English supporters. In comparison, a season ticket standing on the famous ‘Yellow Wall’ of Borussia Dortmund costs an adherent around £154 for seventeen league games with an extra £33 on top for three UEFA Champions League group games. This is alien to numerous supporters around Europe, especially in the English Premier League as the cheapest seat at Old Trafford for UEFA Champions League game costs an adult £40 for one game.\n\nWhen focussing on the league games it costs an average Mainz 05 supporter €13 to stand to look their team each game and this seems relatively cheap. To add insult to injury, when a supporter pays for a permit for Bundesliga league game, they are entitled to costless public transport to the stadium from a respected distance, something again that would not happen in countless other countries. It will cost a Chelsea supporter £59 for a Premier League game and this is just humbly entry to Stamford Bridge. This is one area that the German Bundesliga cannot be beaten on; they look after their supporters because their supporters are the club.\n\nThis flows nicely onto attendances at matches and the Bundesliga has the highest average attendance that was just over 45,000 last season making it the best-attended league in world football. Let alone Borussia Dortmund’s ‘Signal Iduna Park’ holding 80,000 supporters and Bayern München and FC Schalke 04 holding 60,000. In the English Premier League the average attendance was just over 34,000, which is quite low when you hear many English football supporters claiming that it is the greatest league in the world. However, it appears that this has become a bit of a myth due to poor home and away attendances by English supporters in many Premier League grounds.\n\nIt has often been noticed on many occasions that there seems to be more empty seats than actual away supporters. Borussia Mönchengladbach reportedly took 10,000 supporters to their away leg in Lazio last season which is astonishing seeing at this was a midweek game. Borussia Dortmund are well known as well for transporting many supporters when they play away and it again was reported that they brought double their allocation to Madrid for their UEFA Champions League second leg last season. This season they took 15,000 supporters to their away game against 1860 München, which is truly tremendous. Some German sustenance cannot be rivalled around the world as the noise and positive atmosphere they accumulate is dumbfounding.\n\nAs attendances at matches have been discussed it now only feels right to move onto the stadium advancements in Germany. Many arenas in Germany are very impressive with sites such as the Veltins Arena, Allianz Arena, Signal Iduna Park and the Commerzbank Arena are only a few to mention. Germany has seen ten new stadiums built since the millennium all with safe standing areas that mainly create the unique atmosphere many football fans witness. However it could be argued that this is only because Germany hosted the World Cup in 2006 and the majority of supporters would probably be correct. But many stadiums in Germany have also seen their stadiums be renovated and most famously SC Freiburg’s ground being completely solar powered.\n\nThe question asked by many is why have Germany got such good stadiums? The main answer to this is that numerous stadiums are built on the outskirts of the cities in Germany, allowing the football clubs to expand their grounds due to the amount of land they possess. Another reason is that army and aerial forcers throughout the war, which has allowed Germany to build their ground intelligently, will have flattened a lot of the land that was in Germany.\n\nSeveral English associations have been knocked back when trying to get stadium approval or not able to get the appropriate funding to support them. Everton most notably have been rejected twice when trying to build a new stadium, once for their design at the site at Kings Dock and also their attempts in Kirkby. Liverpool have also not succeeded when trying to get a new stadium and it seems that they have accepted defeat claiming they will try an renovate Anfield. Chelsea is another club that is struggling to get land to build their new stadium as they were recently rejected for site in London.\n\nWhen looking to finances, it has been seen with many associations around the world and mainly in the English Premier League going into administration due to the overspending on certain players and their wages. Portsmouth is the club that is always on the end of fans lips when overspending is mentioned and there have been very few success stories when a ‘consortium’ has taken over a football club. Blackburn Rovers who were relegated from the Premier League last season have now nearly been relegated again from the Championship but poor organisation and spending extravagantly has cost them dearly. Liverpool is a famous club worldwide but nearly fell into the black hole of administration a few years ago due to their attraction of trying to get to the next level and compete with the likes of Manchester United and Manchester City. QPR could be the next club that could turn out like Portsmouth with the majority of their average players being on high wages.\n\nWhen moving the attention slightly and focussing on Germany, there are certain rules and regulations that football clubs in the Bundesliga need to follow. In Germany, the '50+1' rule means that its members must own a minimum of fifty-one per cent of a German football club, which means their own supporters. This means that followers associations have a straight say in the organisation of their club, while private business is still able to invest.\n\nWhen the German Bundesliga became a league in 1963, they put in place a ‘licensing system’ that was intended to remain clubs financially solvent. This means that the German football league look at every Bundesliga clubs finances before each league season. Failure to 'stay fit' could result in the club not having their license renewed and relegation. A recent Bundesliga report released earlier this year, demonstrated that fourteen out of the eighteen Bundesliga teams reported profits. The league reported a turnover of €26 billion for the first time in its fifty year history.\n\nMany leagues around the world and mainly the English Premier League could learn a few things from the German Bundesliga and this account has not even covered the category of foreign players. But that is for another day.",

But the Orleans Public Defenders Office turned her down because, as it had announced on Jan. 11, it could no longer afford to take on serious new felony cases, including some involving murder, rape and armed robbery.\n\nCurrently, the office’s lawyers handle an average of 350 felony cases each year, more than twice the American Bar Association’s guideline of 150. It is impossible for them to provide an ethical or constitutionally adequate defense for their existing clients under these conditions, let alone to take on even more. The situation is only getting worse, and the office imposed a hiring freeze because of a $1 million budget shortfall.\n\nSince the office represents about 85 percent of criminal defendants in New Orleans and nearly all defendants who are found to be indigent, the impact of the decision to decline new cases has been immediate. Already 15 defendants facing violent felony charges have been turned down. Until the state or the city comes up with money to pay for lawyers whom the Constitution requires the government to provide, these people, including Ms. Kennedy, are locked up in jail without lawyers to challenge their arrests, request reduced bail or file motions to preserve evidence.",

Two days after the start of the protest, it doesn’t seem to have caught on, but it may just be early days.

  "latent_6352": "Attack the Block is a 2011 British science fiction comedy horror film written and directed by Joe Cornish and starring John Boyega, Jodie Whittaker, and Nick Frost. It was the film debut of Cornish, Boyega, and composer Steven Price.\n\nThe film centres on a teenage street gang who have to defend themselves from predatory alien invaders on a council estate in South London on Guy Fawkes Night. Released on 11 May 2011, it underperformed at the box office yet received fairly positive critical reviews (specifically for Cornish's direction and Boyega's performance) and accolades internationally.[4]\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nWalking home on Bonfire Night, Samantha Adams (Jodie Whittaker), a 25-year-old trainee nurse, is mugged by a small gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest (Alex Esmail); Dennis (Franz Drameh); Jerome (Leeon Jones); Biggz (Simon Howard); and leader Moses (John Boyega). The attack is interrupted when a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, giving Samantha the chance to escape. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a pale, hairless, eyeless dog-sized creature; the object which fell from the sky was its cocoon. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the corpse to their acquaintance, cannabis dealer Ron (Nick Frost), to get advice on what to do. He lives at the top of their tower block, Wyndham Tower.\n\nMoses asks Ron and his boss, Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter), to keep the creature in their fortified \"weed room\" while he decides how to proceed. More objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. However, they find these aliens are much larger, with spiky fur which is so black it reflects no light, huge claws and rows of glowing fangs. The aliens kill their dog too. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by two policemen and Moses is arrested, identified as the mugger by Samantha. The aliens, following Moses, maul the unarmed officers to death and attack their van, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives the police van away, only to crash into a surprised Hi-Hatz's car. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz and his henchman\n\nEnraged by the damage to his car, Hi-Hatz threatens them with a gun, refusing to believe their story of aliens, until his henchman is attacked by one, allowing the gang to escape. The gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower but are again followed and attacked en route by the aliens, where Biggz is forced to hide in a recycling bin and Pest is severely bitten in the leg. They find that Samantha lives in their building, force their way into her flat, and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An alien bursts in and Moses kills it with a samurai sword through the head. Understanding that the group was not lying about the creatures being extraterrestrial, Samantha reasons that it is safer to stay with the gang than on her own and joins them. The gang moves upstairs to the flat owned by Tia (Danielle Vitalis), Dimples (Paige Meade), Dionna (Gina Antwi), and Gloria (Natasha Jonas), believing that their security gate will keep them safe. The aliens instead attack from outside, climbing up the side of the tower block and smashing through the windows, one of whom decapitates Dennis.\n\nAfter Samantha saves Moses' life from one of the aliens, the girls believe them to be the focus of the creatures and kick them out of the flat. In the hall, the gang are attacked by Hi-Hatz and more henchmen. The gang escapes while an alien chases Hi-Hatz and a couple of henchmen into a lift. Hi-Hatz kills the alien, although his henchmen are killed, and continues his search for Moses. Making their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang runs into more aliens, but using fireworks as a distraction, they manage to get through. Jerome, however, becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat they find that Hi-Hatz is already there and has been waiting for them. Hi-Hatz prepares to shoot Moses but hordes of aliens smash through the window and kill him. Now joined by Brewis (Luke Treadaway), one of Ron's customers, Moses, Pest and Samantha retreat into the weed room, while Ron hides in the flat.\n\nBiggz, still trapped in the bin by a lurking alien, is saved by two unruly children, Probs (Sammy Williams) and Mayhem (Michael Ajao), using a water-gun filled with petrol and a flame to torch the creature from a safe distance. In the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent stain on Moses' jacket under the ultraviolet light. As a zoology student, Brewis theorises that the aliens are like spores, drifting through space on solar winds until they chance on a suitable planet. After landing in an area with enough food, the female lets off a strong pheromone which will attract the male creatures to it so that they can mate and propagate their species in their new world. Brewis suggests that the smaller, hairless alien which Moses killed in the beginning was such a female, and it had left a mating scent on Moses that the larger male aliens have been tracking throughout the evening. The gang form a plan for Samantha, who has not been stained with the pheromone, to go to Moses's flat and turn on the gas oven.\n\nMoses forces Pest to return the ring they stole from her, feeling guilty for having mugged her. Samantha successfully avoids the aliens, turns on the gas, and leaves the block. Moses, with the dead female alien strapped to his back, rushes out of the weed room and into his flat, while the males converge on the scent and chase Moses through the block. Inside his flat he throws the female into the kitchen and the males follow. Using fireworks, Moses ignites the gas-filled room and leaps out of the window. The explosion engulfs the flat and the aliens, but Moses survives, clinging to a Union Jack hanging from the side of the building. In the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis, and Ron are arrested and held responsible for the deaths around the block, including the two officers who had earlier arrested Moses. Samantha, however, comes to their defence. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the block cheering for Moses.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nRepresentative of the film's plot and location, most of the cast were young, relative unknowns, and local to the area. According to the DVD's making-of featurette, the teenagers were selected from drama classes of London council estate schools, and then had to go through eight auditions before being offered a part.[5][citation needed] John Boyega found out about this film from an ad placed on the internet. The cast includes:\n\nJohn Boyega as Moses, a quiet and loyal teenage gang leader and orphan looking for respect around the block.\n\nJodie Whittaker as Samantha Adams, a trainee nurse and new resident of Wyndham Tower.\n\nAlex Esmail as Pest, a teenage jokester and second in command of Moses's gang.\n\nFranz Drameh as Dennis, a hotheaded pizza delivery boy and the enforcer of the gang.\n\nLeeon Jones as Jerome, a schoolboy and the most level headed member of the gang.\n\nSimon Howard as Biggz, the youngest member of the gang. Throughout most of the film, Biggz is trapped in a dumpster after he's cornered by the aliens.\n\nNick Frost as Ron, the local drug dealer who lives in the penthouse of Wyndham Tower and knows everyone.\n\nLuke Treadaway as Brewis, a student stoner who's one of Ron's customers.\n\nJumayn Hunter as Hi-Hatz, the local psychopathic gangster who's Ron's feared boss.\n\nDanielle Vitalis as Tia, a girl living in Wyndham Tower who's Moses's love interest and friend to the gang.\n\nPaige Meade as Dimples, Tia's quick tempered roommate who is also a friend to the gang.\n\nSammy Williams as Probs, a little kid who wishes to join Moses's gang.\n\nMichael Ajao as Mayhem, Probs's best friend who shares his goal of joining Moses's gang.\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nBig Talk Pictures, known for films including Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, produced the film alongside Film4, The UK Film Council, and StudioCanal.[2]\n\nThe plot was inspired by an event where the director was mugged himself, and after adding the science fiction angle into the plot, Joe Cornish interviewed various kids in youth groups in order to find out what kind of weapons they would use if a real alien invasion occurred. Cornish also based the character of the stoner Brewis on himself in his twenties.\n\nFilming [ edit ]\n\nAttack the Block is set in a fictional neighbourhood said in-film to be located in the London district of Brixton. It is actually a composite of various council estates across London. Director Cornish explains:\n\nWe wanted to stamp a clear layout on the audience's minds early, and since we couldn't afford to show an aerial shot of the estate as it doesn't exist, the way to show it was by showing this top shot of the map at the very beginning of the film.[6]\n\nThe name Wyndham Estates appears on the left of the entrance to the fictional block, referencing the English science-fiction writer John Wyndham. The science fiction writer J. G. Ballard is also referenced by one of the street names; Ballard wrote a number of novels set in large urban blocks. The film was shot across London from March to May 2010, with six weeks of night shoots[7] on the Heygate Estate in Elephant and Castle; Myatts Field, Brixton; Oval Underground station and the Bemerton Estate in Islington. Interior scenes were filmed at Three Mills Studios in Newham, part of the East End of London.[8]\n\nCreature effects [ edit ]\n\nThe creatures began with two men in gorilla-like suits with animatronic jaws; post-production added the unearthly qualities such as the spiky fur which doesn't reflect any light, the claws, the rows of bioluminescent jaws, and even some of their movement. In total the film features over 100 effects shots, which were completed over the course of 4 months by Swedish effects house, Fido.[9] The creatures have no eyes, and hunt and find mates using an extremely evolved sense of smell; their movement is enabled mainly through echolocation. According to the DVD commentary, the echolocation noises made by the creatures were a combination of dolphin sonar mixed digitally with the grunts and snarls of dozens of other animals, and even a woman screaming.[10] Some puppets were used, such as the smaller, hairless female alien which terrified the young cast.\n\nRelease [ edit ]\n\nTheatrical [ edit ]\n\nStudioCanal's British distribution company Optimum Releasing released the film in the United Kingdom on 11 May 2011. Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions acquired this film's United States distribution rights,[11] and the group opened this film in limited theatrical release in the United States on 29 July 2011 through Screen Gems.[12] US distributors were concerned that American audiences might not understand the strong South London accents, and may have even used subtitles if it were to be released in the United States.[13] Cornish acknowledged this during the SXSW Q and A. When he asked the audience, \"Can I ask you guys something? American distributors are nervous about language, the slang\" the audience said they could understand it.[14]\n\nHome media [ edit ]\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2011 and in the United States on 25 October 2011. Play.com have an exclusive Blu-ray and DVD double play edition, with a glow-in-the-dark sleeve, featuring the bio-luminescent jaws of one of the creatures.[15]\n\nSoundtrack [ edit ]\n\nThe soundtrack for the film was an original score composed by British electronic music group Basement Jaxx, and Steven Price except for a few songs featured in the film but not on the soundtrack (such as the 1993 rap track \"Sound of da Police\" by KRS-One, and the 2006 reggae track \"Youths Dem Cold\" by Richie Spice, played during the end credits).\n\nDuring Evan Sawdey's interview with the duo for PopMatters, he mentioned the album as an \"obscure soundtrack placement that only hardcore aficionados found out about.\"[16]\n\nIn 2018 I Am Shark reissued the soundtrack on a 2xLP vinyl pressing featuring exclusive written commentaries from Joe Cornish and Steven Price. The album packaging represents the monsters with glow in the dark teeth on the labels and glow colored vinyl.[17]\n\nThe original Attack the Block soundtrack by Basement Jaxx and Steven Price features the following tracks:\n\n\"The Block\" \"Sam is Mugged\" \"Round Two Bruv\" \"It’s Raining Gollums\" \"Tooling Up\" \"Moses is Arrested\" \"Tell Me I’m Dreaming\" \"Throat Ripper\" \"Rooftops\" \"Moses – Ninja\" \"Just Another Day\" \"They Want Moses\" \"Actions Have Consequences\" \"Eat My Hat\" \"They Fell Out of the Sky\" \"I Need to Finish What I Started\" \"Turn the Gas Up\" \"Moses vs. The Monsters\" \"Moses the Hero\" \"The Ends\"[18]\n\nA rap song called \"Get That Snitch\", original to the film and rapped by the character Hi-Hatz, is featured at various times in the film. The full song was featured on the DVD special features.\n\nThe score and soundtrack album was mixed by Gareth Cousins.\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nBox office [ edit ]\n\nOn its opening theatrical weekend in the United Kingdom in May 2011, Attack the Block garnered £1,133,859, putting it in third place only slightly behind American blockbusters Thor and Fast Five; also in the opening weekend Attack the Block had the highest cinema site average by almost twice of the other films.[19] On a screen-by-screen basis, Attack the Block was the week's strongest performer.[20] The North American theatrical run began in July 2011 and was only a limited release, yet despite being shown for less than two months and in only 66 cinemas at its peak, the film grossed $1,024,175 (£659,040) on its American theatrical run.[3]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nAttack the Block received acclaim from critics. Review aggregation Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 90% based on 172 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Effortlessly mixing scares, laughs, and social commentary, Attack the Block is a thrilling, brisky-paced sci-fi yarn with a distinctly British flavor.\"[21] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[22]\n\nThe website Slash film lists Attack the Block as a \"true cult classic\" deserving of its own action figures.[23] In his review, Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert praised the film's use of character development and the performance given by Boyega.[24] Scott Wampler of The Examiner rated it A+ and said it was officially the best film of the 2011 film festival season and likened it to other debuts such as Neill Blomkamp's District 9 and Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs.[25] Matt Patches writing for Cinemablend said \"Attack the Block, even on its small scale, may wind up as one of the best action movies of the year\".[26] Christ Tilly at IGN gave it four stars saying \"Cornish directs with the confidence of a seasoned pro\" and calling the film \"a blast from start-to-finish.\"[27] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy awarded the movie four stars, saying that it is \"exactly the kind of distinctly homegrown product that the British film industry should be making\".[28] Mark Kermode gave a mixed review saying he did not dislike the film, but \"wanted it to be funnier\" and \"needed it to be scarier\".[29]\n\nAttack the Block was revisited by critics following the casting of its two lead actors as stars of flagship science fiction franchises – Boyega as Finn in Star Wars and Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor in Doctor Who. In a 2017 retrospective, Tom Philip writing for GQ described the film as \"one of the most confidently-delivered debut feature films in recent memory\" and said it \"still stands out as one of the best genre-mashup films of the decade\",[30] while Nathan Rabin for Rotten Tomatoes said that the film deserved cult status and called it \"a star-making vehicle in the truest sense\".[31]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]",

I thought it was too late to buy it.”\n\nLater when bitcoin price increased to 600 yuan, Yang realized that it’s never too late to buy bitcoins and he bought 25 bitcoins.\n\nIn 2013, bitcoin price increased from 85 yuan in January to 8500 yuan in November which led to a media hype. More bitcoin newbies who were in high hopes of getting rich stepped into the world of bitcoin. But the price dropped dramatically in December from 8000 yuan to 3100 yuan.\n\n“I was really lucky,” Yang said,” before the market crashed, I sold my bitcoins to buy a house. I made some money at that time, but I never thought the price would go this high in 2017.”\n\nSince 2014, bitcoin certainly has confronted moments of darkness. Over the years, Yang bought 30-odd bitcoins with his salary at an average price of 3000 yuan.\n\nNow the price of per bitcoin can be 20,000 yuan when you went to bed and 16,000 yuan when you wake up. But Yang says it is just the way it meant to be.\n\n“The more you care about the price, the easier you get scared. It’s all about whether you have the faith in the technology.”\n\nThe blockchain technology is as indispensable to bitcoin as water to fish. It enables bitcoin to be accepted as a legal currency.\n\nAs of today, Germany, Japan, Canada and Korea have recognized bitcoin as a legal currency. Particularly in Japan, over 5000 stores accept bitcoin as a means of payment, including BicCamera and Peach Airlines.\n\nIn 2015, on bitcoin pizza day, Yang exchanged 0.0522 bitcoins worth of 80 yuan for a pizza.\n\n“It’s definitely not easy to convince pizza stores of accepting bitcoin as payment. After a lot of talking, finally a guy nodded his head yes. It’s the best pizza I ever had. Later when bitcoin price reached 8000 yuan, I persuaded the guy to sell them for cash and he was happy to earn some money. But I didn’t expect the price would go so high…”\n\nApart from bitcoin, Yang also invest in altcoins. He bought 2000 litecoins when the price was around 4 dollars. He never sells one for cash wondering litecoin price will keep surprising him just like bitcoin.\n\n“Bitcoin is a value investment and altcoins are more speculative than bitcoin,” noted Yang, “From the perspective of public acceptance and technical maturity, altcoins are way too risky than bitcoin.”\n\nAt present, over 800 altcoins are listed on CoinMarketCap.\n\n“Altcoins are more vulnerable to a 51% attack which is not a real threat to bitcoin,” complained Cheng who calls himself a victim of altcoins.\n\nAs early as in 2010, the Beijing-based bitcoiner already heard a lot about bitcoin.\n\n“Back then, I thought it was a scam. But the more I learned about it, the more I realized how significant it is.”\n\nHe then bought several bitcoins in October 2013, but due to its price stagnancy he later switched to altcoins, such as dogecoin and feathercoin.\n\nIn early 2014, Cheng started to mine Auroracoin and got 7 or 8 coins per day. The price kept going up and he invested more in it until a sudden price crash.\n\n“I was so regretful! I didn’t exchange them for fiat money, and I didn’t exchange them for bitcoin. Big mistake!”\n\nAt the end of 2013, Cheng built a small bitcoin exchange after two months of working. Unfortunately, the exchanged suffered a 51% attack.\n\n“Clients’ altcoins just disappeared. Transaction history showed assets are still in the exchange, but somehow they are gone.”\n\nCheng shut down the exchange shortly after the attack.\n\n“It’s so hard. People kept calling you every day to check if their assets are safe. They trust big exchanges.”\n\nBut the same thing could also happen to big exchanges. In 2016, Bitfinex was hacked and lost 119,756 bitcoins. The exchange told customers they would share over 36% of the loss of the assets but would be compensated for these losses with tokens of credit.\n\n“As the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a bull market, we have forgot the incident.”\n\nOn the whole, Cheng has great faith on bitcoin. He is now developing two algorithms to predict trend of bitcoin price.",

SECP further cautioned against such practices as well.\n\nBackground\n\nA few days ago, SECP’s Head of Market Surveillance, Supervision and Law enforcement, Yasi Manzoor, said that some people are acting as stock market gurus and are making suggestions to the public, which is illegal. This form of manipulation is called Inducement and is a crime under the Securities Act 2015.\n\nOn 8th May 2017, SECP released info on a gang operating through social media which made millions by scamming young investors. However, no one was named at the time and the alleged had not shared his side of the story.\n\nSECP’s Allegation\n\nAccording to the authority, Mir Muhammad Ali Khan (commonly known as Mir MAK), was caught red handed while trying to influence the market and make money off the stock exchange.\n\nHe, allegedly, used a pump and dump strategy, where he would buy a large number of shares of a company and inform his Facebook followers that a certain company’s financial prospects are improving rapidly. When those social media followers followed their gurus advice, buying shares of the recommended company, he would sell his own holdings and make huge sums of money.\n\nSECP claims that Mir MAK made an illegal profit of about Rs. 58 million within a period of just six months and that they had been onto such social media activity for the past 6 to 9 months. He was, according to the SECP, leading a gang in order to avoid any suspicions. The commission has asked the alleged person’s name to be put in ECL and has fielded a case against him.

  "latent_6698": "I got pulled over by a policeman on the side of the road the other week.\n\nHe took my breath. He thought I was drunk.\n\nOne of the reasons he thought I was drunk, was because I was nude.\n\nAs he approached my car window I covered my penis with my towel.\n\nThe conversation went something like:\n\nPoliceman: “Why are you naked mate?”\n\nMy reply: “I love being nude.” (I reveled in my honesty and pride.)\n\nPoliceman: (In expression of shock and unreasonableness) “Did you know that trucks and SUVs of a sufficient height with children in it can see you nude?\n\nMy thoughts: Why would children care?\n\nPoliceman: “What if you suddenly had an accident and had to get out of the car to help someone on the road?”\n\nMy thoughts: If someone’s life needs saving I’m pretty sure nudity is the last thing people are going to be concerned about.\n\nMy reply: “I’d put my shorts back on.”\n\nThen there was some more back and forth, about how, from my point of view, I didn’t believe I was doing anything illegal under the law of ‘willful exposure’ in the jurisdiction I was driving in – even quoting a case that had tested the law that ended up being thrown out of court.\n\nPoliceman: “Any reasonable person would find your nudity offensive.”\n\nMy thoughts: Not this reasonable person.\n\nMy reply: “Well I’ve got a lot of thoughts on everything you’ve just said and I’m not sure if you want to hear-“\n\nPoliceman: “No I’m not interested in hearing what you have to say.”\n\nMy thoughts: Gee, thanks policeman. So you think you are the law and I’m not? I thought the law was interpreted in court – by judges – not you or me.\n\nPoliceman: “I’m going to be looking into this. Expect a possible summons in the mail about the nudity.”\n\nMy thoughts: Excellent, a chance to finally test this in court!\n\nThe letter never came.\n\nOf course it didn’t. He had no proof I was driving naked.\n\nSo I expressed my appreciation at him looking into the matter, and wondered what he would find. I and my lawyer know what exactly he would have found.\n\nIn reflecting on this, I understand how this man felt. He felt a sense of duty. A duty to do the right thing. By the law.\n\nWell I feel a sense of duty too. A duty to do the right thing. For humanity.\n\nAnd in that light, I don’t want to prod the law before society is really ready to support it. It’ll hurt the chances of non-sexual public nudity having its beautiful light of day again. It’s been a long night since the open nudity days of Sparta – or men and boys bathing nude in public everywhere until just 100 years ago.\n\nWe have to promote nudity strategically – in show of numbers, in special events, in protests, through seeding trends, by capturing zeitgeists – and doing it in major, media-grabbing ways. This is exactly what Nude Movement plans to do.\n\nAnd in hindsight, I can empathize with the policeman’s non-legal take on the matter as well. Maybe he is right – most people are still ‘offended’ at seeing an unclothed person in public.\n\nBut is it really true? In this era of 2016 – when people enjoy Game of Thrones as entertainment, send snapchat dick pics and watch pornography openly as a cultural norm, with sex increasingly liberal and free – is this assumption from that policeman all that accurate?\n\nI wonder what the stats would be if a worldwide poll was done.\n\nWhy not ask your friends and coworkers – people whose view you didn’t already know – would they be ‘offended’, shocked, appalled, morally outraged – to the degree of ringing the police to have a naked person locked up, fined, or put on the sex offender register?\n\nIs the law out of date? Does nudity offend you?\n\n(Image courtesy of Aleta Rodriguez used under Creative Commons licence https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/)",
  "latent_6717": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks to guests at the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner Saturday in Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa — Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., went on the offensive at the Iowa Democratic Party’s annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner, where he delivered a speech that highlighted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s shifting positions. His performance earned headlines dubbing him “fiery” and “bare-knuckle.” However, his campaign insists the remarks aren’t the beginning of an all-out attack on Clinton in their race for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nSanders’ press secretary, Symone Sanders, told Yahoo News on Sunday that she was surprised by some of the coverage of his speech.\n\n“I saw some reports saying, you know, ‘Oh, the senator like smacked Hillary, slapped Hillary, attacked her.’ Those were not slaps, attacks and smacks, but they were differentiating on the issues,” Symone said. “The senator has a really strong record to stand on, so he’s going to stand on it.”\n\nClinton is the frontrunner in the Democratic primary, but state and national polls show Sanders is her top rival.\n\nSanders’ speech included lines that alluded to Clinton’s vote for the Iraq War when she was in the Senate, her long pauses before announcing opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline and Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act during the administration of her husband, President Bill Clinton. Symone pointed out that Sanders began an effort to “differentiate” his record from his opponent’s heading into the Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13. While she acknowledged he may have sharpened his approach, Symone vowed Sanders will not “directly attack” Clinton.\n\n“I think what folks saw last night, you know, was Bernie came out and was being a little more pointed in his record, if you will. … Prior to last night, he had not drawn as stark a contrast of where he stands as opposed to the other candidates. I think that is definitely true,” Symone explained. “Folks that have said, ‘Bernie came out of the gate and said where he stands.’ Yes, he did, so I don’t think you haven’t seen that, but you won’t see him directly attack.”\n\nIn an interview on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” on Sunday, the day after the dinner, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta suggested Sanders broke prior vows not to “go negative” with his speech.\n\n“I think Bernie Sanders seemed to have a course correction in the JJ dinner from one in which he said he wasn’t going to go negative to obviously focusing his … fire on her,” said Podesta.\n\nHowever, Symone specifically said Sanders will not go “negative” and begin criticizing Clinton by name.\n\n“He has never done a negative attack ad in his life, and he has never gone on a negative campaign,” Symone said. “Bernie’s not going to start doing these interviews talking about how, ‘Secretary Clinton’s bad on blah blah blah.’ You know, you’ll never probably hear those words come out of his mouth. And what you will hear is him saying, you know, ‘I believe climate change is the greatest threat to our national security, so it didn’t take me four years to get a position on Keystone.’”\n\nSymone framed Sanders’ Jefferson-Jackson dinner speech as an effort to “highlight his record.”\n\n“I think that’s important to voters to know, especially for people that don’t know the senator, to know … where he stands on these trade agreements,” said Symone. “Not just the Trans-Pacific partnership but, you know, NAFTA, CAFTA and the permanent normal trade agreement with China.”\n\nAccording to Symone, it would be wrong to view Sanders’ comments on Keystone, various trade agreements, the Iraq War and DOMA as “Hillary zingers.”\n\n“These were just the facts,” she said.\n\nSymone also pointed to the moment in the Democratic debate where Sanders famously declared the American people had had “enough” of hearing about the scandal over Clinton’s emails. Clinton thanked Sanders onstage, and her campaign later told Yahoo News it felt like the moment was “an assist” from Sanders.\n\n“He calls it like he sees it,” Symone said. “So he can go ahead and defend her and say, ‘Look, Americans are tired of these damn emails, they want to talk about the issues.’ Secretary’s, like, ‘Yeah.’ He’s like, ‘OK, but also, Americans are tired of these disastrous trade policies.’ And that might make some people uncomfortable, but you know what? Bernie was speaking truth to power. That’s what makes him so real and authentic.”",

  "latent_6973": "Did you know that 4,000 world leaders from 130 different countries gathered in Dubai this week for the World Government Summit? It was held from February 12th to February 14th, and it featured more than 100 internationally-known speakers including UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Christine Lagarde and Elon Musk. If you would like to know more about this shadowy group, you can visit the official website right here . The first World Government Summit was held back in 2013, and that one was actually attended by Barack Obama. Unfortunately the mainstream media in the United States was almost entirely silent about this summit, so most of us in the western world didn’t even hear about it.\n\nTo honor the spirit of this summit, a reconstructed version of Palmyra’s Arch Of Triumph (also known as the Monumental Arch) was erected in Dubai. Previously it had been put up in London and New York City for brief periods of time, and so this marked only the third time that it has been displayed. The following comes from Breaking Israel News…\n\nA replica of a Roman arch that once stood in front of the pagan Temple of Ba’al was erected for the World Government Summit in Dubai this week, creating a scene that one rabbi claims symbolizes the dangerous fusion of Ishmael and Edom against Israel. The original Roman Victory Arch stood for 1,800 years in Palmyra, Syria, until it was destroyed by ISIS in October 2015. A full-size 28-meter tall replica of the arch was created last year by the Institute for Digital Archeology, a joint project of Oxford and Harvard universities, and has been displayed twice before. The replica was erected for the opening of the World Government Summit that opened on Sunday in Dubai.\n\nIn ancient Palmyra, the Arch of Triumph connected the main street of the Colonnade with the Temple of Bel. If ordinary people of the time wanted to visit the Temple of Bel, they would pass through this arch. And once they were done, the would pass through this arch again on their way out.\n\nAnd of course “Bel” and “Baal” are synonymous, and both titles can be traced all the way back to ancient Babylon and a very evil ruler named Nimrod. The following is an extended excerpt from one of my previous articles…\n\n—–\n\nIn a previous article, I included a quote from Wikipedia that discusses how “Bel” is an ancient Babylonian term for “Lord” or “Master”, and that “Baal” comes from that original root word…\n\nBel (/ˈbeɪl/; from Akkadian bēlu), signifying “lord” or “master”, is a title rather than a genuine name, applied to various gods in the Mesopotamian religion of Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia. The feminine form is Belit ‘Lady, Mistress’. Bel is represented in Greek as Belos and in Latin as Belus. Linguistically Bel is an East Semitic form cognate with Northwest Semitic Baal with the same meaning.\n\nThe title of “Bel” or “Baal” seems to have originally been used primarily for the Babylonian god Marduk. Here is more from Wikipedia…\n\nBel became especially used of the Babylonian god Marduk and when found in Assyrian and neo-Babylonian personal names or mentioned in inscriptions in a Mesopotamian context it can usually be taken as referring to Marduk and no other god. Similarly Belit without some disambiguation mostly refers to Bel Marduk’s spouse Sarpanit. However Marduk’s mother, the Sumerian goddess called Ninhursag, Damkina, Ninmah and other names in Sumerian, was often known as Belit-ili ‘Lady of the Gods’ in Akkadian.\n\nSo where did “Marduk” come from?\n\nWell, many scholars have traced the worship of Marduk all the way back to the historical figure of Nimrod…\n\nTraditionally the Tower of Babel event has been associated with Nimrod, and Jewish commentaries as well as the Jewish historian Josephus both seem very emphatic on this point. Regarding the Sumerian name Enmer-kar, the suffix “kar” means “hunter,” and so “Enmer-kar” is in fact “Enmer the Hunter,” just as Nimrod is referred to as the “Mighty Hunter” in Genesis 10. Furthermore, Enmerkar is named on the Sumerian King List as “the one who built Uruk,” just as Nimrod is described in Genesis 10:10 as having a kingdom that began in “Babel (Eridu) and Erech (Uruk)… in the land of Shinar.” After Enmerkar’s death he became honored in Sumerian myth as the semi-divine hero Ninurta, and eventually this cult evolved into the great cult of Marduk, which became the state religion of Babylon after the conquests and religious innovations of Hammurabi.\n\nAre you starting to see how everything fits together?\n\n—–\n\nAnd Nimrod was the great king of the very first “world government” in the post-flood world. The following is what Genesis 10:8-12 says in the Modern English Version…\n\n8 Cush was the father of Nimrod. He became a mighty one on the earth. 9 He was a mighty hunter before the Lord. Therefore it is said, “Even like Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.” 10 The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Uruk, Akkad, and Kalneh in the land of Shinar. 11 From that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, the city Rehoboth Ir, and Calah, 12 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (that is the principal city).\n\nSo it seems more than a little bit strange that an arch with links to Nimrod has been erected to honor a summit devoted to the promotion of “world government” in our day.\n\nIt has been said that if we do not understand history we are doomed to repeat it. Nimrod’s world government in ancient times attempted to push God out of the picture, and the same thing is true with the globalists of today.\n\nThe globalists dream of a utopia where humanity has been united under a one world government, a one world economy and a one world religion. Donald Trump stands opposed to this twisted dream, and that is why the globalists hate him so much.\n\nAnd the globalists understand the power of symbols very well. The erecting of this arch in Dubai at the exact same time the “World Government Summit” was being held sends a very powerful message.\n\nEven though Donald Trump is now the president of the United States, the globalists are far from defeated, and if they have their way all of humanity will soon be within their ruthless grip.",

His team is in desperate need of goalie help after years of disappointment in the crease, and two months of exclusive negotiating rights with Darling certainly makes it seem like a safe bet for the two sides to iron a deal out and move into the 2017-18 season with a lot of optimism.\n\nThe question now: what should we expect from a guy who hasn’t spent a full season as a starter in the NHL?\n\nThe numbers are certainly in his favor, both when compared to the Canes’ tandem of Cam Ward and Eddie Lack, as well as previous examples of goalies who made the jump from backup roles to starter roles.\n\nLast season, Darling’s numbers stacked up well to both of Carolina’s goalies.\n\n2016-17 Season Stats Statistic Cam Ward Eddie Lack Scott Darling Statistic Cam Ward Eddie Lack Scott Darling Appearances 61 19 32 ES Save Pctg 0.913 0.922 0.937 Overall Save Pctg 0.905 0.902 0.924 GAA 2.69 2.64 2.38 Low-danger sv% 0.983 0.988 0.973 Medium-danger sv% 0.914 0.929 0.947 High-danger sv% 0.776 0.806 0.865\n\nDarling had roughly half the appearances of Ward, who started most of the season for Carolina.\n\nThe only category where Darling was outplayed by Ward is his low damage save percentage, which has been an area of concern for Darling in the past. He posted a .960 LDSv% the season prior.\n\nThe struggles of both Ward and Lack have been well documented over the past two seasons, and the former backup’s numbers have been spectacular in Chicago. That’s why he’s in this situation to begin with.\n\nA more fair comparison of what to expect from Darling is found elsewhere.\n\nCam Talbot, Martin Jones, and Cory Schneider are three recent examples of backups-turned-starters panning out very well for the teams that took chances on them.\n\nFinal Backup Season Statistic Cory Schneider Martin Jones Cam Talbot Scott Darling Statistic Cory Schneider Martin Jones Cam Talbot Scott Darling Season 2012-13 2014-15 2014-15 2016-17 Appearances 30 15 36 32 ES Save Pctg 0.925 0.916 0.930 0.937 Overall Save Pctg 0.927 0.906 0.926 0.924 GAA 2.11 2.25 2.21 2.38 Low-danger sv% 0.985 0.972 0.984 0.973 Medium-danger sv% 0.906 0.940 0.922 0.947 High-danger sv% 0.867 0.776 0.845 0.865\n\nThe chart above shows each goalie in their final year in backup duty.\n\nCory Schneider is a special case for two reasons: this was during the 2012-13 season, which was shortened by the lockout and was more prone to flukes, and he was less of a backup and more of a dual starter with Roberto Luongo.\n\nMartin Jones didn’t put up spectacular numbers in his final backup year, but he stood out in the 2013-14 campaign.\n\nOutside of Jones, there’s a common thread with all of these goalies - they were all very good in their final backup seasons. The different danger situations all brought different numbers, in which different goalies excelled in different areas, but as a whole, they all performed well.\n\nThe transition from one team to another can be daunting, especially for goalies. The move from one system to another with a brand new group of defensemen can be a tall task, but all three made a solid transition.\n\nFirst Starting Season Statistic Cory Schneider Martin Jones Cam Talbot Statistic Cory Schneider Martin Jones Cam Talbot Season 2013-14 2015-16 2015-16 Appearances 45 65 56 ES Save Pctg 0.924 0.925 0.920 Overall Save Pctg 0.921 0.918 0.917 GAA 1.97 2.27 2.55 Low-danger sv% 0.983 0.981 0.972 Medium-danger sv% 0.940 0.910 0.935 High-danger sv% 0.790 0.836 0.780\n\nThis chart shows each of the three goalie’s first season as a starter and while all of them took a hit to their save percentages, they are all within reason.\n\nIt’s important to have tempered expectations with goalies as they go from playing 20-30 games to 55-65 games. The playing time increases significantly, in some cases even tripling, so the variation also increases. With more ice time comes more chances for defensive breakdowns.\n\nSchneider’s first season in New Jersey was spectacular, though broken up due to injury.\n\nJones and Talbot weren’t far off at all from Schneider’s level of play. Jones went into a very good team in San Jose and played well, but Talbot went into an absolute dumpster fire of an Oilers team and still put up impressive numbers for a first-year starter.\n\nI think the best you can ask of a first-year guy is what New Jersey got from Schneider and a more reasonable expectation is Jones’ performance. While Talbot’s performance was similar, Jones was playing behind a much more experienced lineup.\n\nThe last thing we are going to look at is each goalie’s second full season as a starter.\n\nSecond Starting Season Statistic Cory Schneider Martin Jones Cam Talbot Statistic Cory Schneider Martin Jones Cam Talbot Season 2014-15 2016-17 2016-17 Appearances 69 65 73 ES Save Pctg 0.934 0.916 0.928 Overall Save Pctg 0.925 0.912 0.919 GAA 2.26 2.40 2.39 Low-danger sv% 0.971 0.979 0.982 Medium-danger sv% 0.943 0.912 0.953 High-danger sv% 0.848 0.819 0.810\n\nThe common thread here is that each goalie’s appearances went up, so the team liked what they saw and put more trust in them.\n\nSchneider and Talbot both played better than they did the season before, while Jones’ numbers faltered a bit.\n\nAdding Patrick Maroon, Milan Lucic, and Adam Larsson among others to the Oilers helped Talbot, but this past season he proved that he is a legitimate number-one NHL goaltender. He was very good and he’ll be Edmonton’s goalie for a while.\n\nJones struggled at times as a second-year starter, but he still performed at an above average level and led his team to a playoff berth.\n\nThe best comparable for Darling is probably Talbot. Darling and Talbot both put up several years of high-level backup play on a good, if not great, team. All of their numbers in their final year of backup duty are very similar and they played behind high-level goalies, Crawford and Henrik Lundqvist.\n\nTalbot has been the middle ground between Schneider and Jones in regards to his numbers since they turned into starters. Schneider has risen to be an elite goalie, Jones is an average, if not slightly above average goalie, and Talbot is an above average NHL goalie.\n\nIf the Hurricanes get a performance like any of the goalies outlined above, they should be happy. All they need is average NHL goaltending in order to be a playoff team, so if history repeats itself here, they will be in a very good situation with Scott Darling in the crease.",
  "latent_7084": "Image copyright PA\n\nTwenty-four European banks have failed \"stress tests\" of their finances, the European Banking Authority (EBA) has announced.\n\nThe banks now have nine months to shore up their finances or risk being shut down. No UK banks are included.\n\nThe review was based on the banks' financial health at the end of 2013.\n\nTen of them have taken measures to bolster their balance sheets in the meantime. All the remaining 14 banks are in the eurozone.\n\nThe health check was carried out on 123 EU banks by the EBA to determine whether they could withstand another financial crisis.\n\nThe list of 14 includes four Italian banks, two Greek banks, two Belgian banks and two Slovenian banks.\n\nThe worst affected was Italian bank Monte dei Paschi, which had a capital shortfall of €2.1bn (£1.65bn, $2.6bn).\n\nAnalysis: Kamal Ahmed, Business editor, BBC News\n\nWith the European Union economies back in the headlines for not altogether comfortable reasons, today's testing of the European banking sector provides a useful litmus test of how healthy the plumbing of those economies is.\n\nBanks provide economies with funds to support growth. And it is worth saying that the more funds they keep on their balance sheet, the less they may be willing to provide to businesses.\n\nToday's \"stress tests\" suggest that banks are in better financial shape than they were in 2011, the last time they were undertaken.\n\nMany analysts are sceptical about how these stress tests work. It has been regularly pointed out that previous tests managed to miss the subsequent collapses in the Irish banking sector and of Dexia, the Belgian bank.\n\nThe scenarios now, though, are different. The profits that banks are allowed to make through a future financial crisis are capped. Net income is slashed by 20% and there is greater transparency around how the data is used, giving more certainty to investors.\n\nAnother major change has been the Asset Quality Review, looking at banks' loans and exposure to the debt of national governments. At least with these tests, we can have more confidence than in the past that they paint a reasonably comprehensive picture.\n\nBBC World Service economic correspondent Andrew Walker says concerns about banks were a central element in the eurozone financial crisis and in some countries, their weakness remains a factor holding back economic growth.\n\n'Robust' exercise\n\nFour UK banks were subjected to the EBA test: Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The ECB's Vitor Constancio says the vast majority of banks proved resilient\n\nNone of them failed the test, but Lloyds passed narrowly, with capital under adverse scenarios of 6.2%, not far from the 5.5% benchmark.\n\n\"We welcome the EBA's confirmation that Lloyds Banking Group meets all the capital benchmarks set out for the purpose of the stress test, and that the group is not required to take any action as a result of the test,\" a Lloyds spokesperson said.\n\n\"This strong position reflects the steps taken by the group's management over the last three years to return its balance sheet to a robust position, and we will continue to use this strong basis to help Britain prosper.\"\n\nStill troubled: The 14 banks that still need to raise capital\n\nAustria: Oesterreichische Volksbanken\n\nBelgium: AXA Bank Europe, Dexia\n\nCyprus: Hellenic Bank Public Company\n\nGreece: Eurobank Ergasias, National Bank of Greece\n\nRepublic of Ireland: Permanent TSB\n\nItaly: Banca Carige, Monte dei Paschi, Banca Popolare di Milano, Banca Popolare di Vicenza\n\nPortugal: Banco Comercial Portugues\n\nSlovenia: Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor, Nova Ljubljanska Banka\n\nAt the same time, the European Central Bank (ECB) carried out an overlapping survey of 130 eurozone banks.\n\nThe ECB said 25 banks had failed its test, but 12 of those had already taken remedial action.\n\nThe ECB's total is higher than the EBA's because of Spain's Liberbank, which passed the stress test but failed the ECB's Asset Quality Review.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Lloyds was one of four UK banks subjected to the EBA's stress tests\n\nThe European Commission welcomed the results of the EBA and ECB assessments.\n\nIt said they had been \"robust exercises, unprecedented in scale and among the most stringent worldwide\".\n\nIt added that they represented an important step towards an operational Single Supervisory Mechanism, which is a key component of the EU's planned banking union.\n\n\"Yet there is no room for complacency,\" the Commission said in a statement.\n\n\"Rigorous and timely follow-up actions to the results of the exercises will be absolutely crucial,\" it added.\n\nAnalysts said the results of the tests were much as expected. \"The first impression is that there are few surprises,\" said Max Anderl of UBS Global Asset Management.\n\n\"The document refers to many of the 'usual suspects', mainly in Greece, Portugal and Italy,\" he added.",
  "latent_7104": "You can change the conversation. Chip in to rabble's donation drive today!\n\nIn a little-noticed news release from the North Pole, a jolly senior citizen has asked that his image not be co-opted this holiday season by the Canadian War Department and NORAD. In addition, the gentleman, who identified himself as Santa Claus, also refused the militarized escort that NORAD said would be tracking his annual flight around the world.\n\n\"I don't want war planes on my tail, and I don't want children to think I am in any way associated with the type of organization that plans for things like nuclear war and space warfare,\" Claus said in an exclusive telephone interview with rabble.ca. \"Your War Department misrepresents me the same way the sales of war toys misrepresent me. I don't make machine guns and toy tanks, and I certainly do NOT want a warplane escort or to be tracked by an organization which is working to militarize the heavens.\"\n\nClaus was particularly concerned that NORAD uses this annual opportunity to glorify warplanes and drones which are used to drop bombs on and mutilate children in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq, noting that last week, dozens of people in a Yemeni wedding party were massacred by a drone-fired Hellfire missile.\n\nSanta says he is disturbed to again find himself the focus of the annual military public affairs operation, designed to normalize for children the idea that the military -- as well as military alliances which plan and constantly threaten life on the planet with nuclear warfare, pre-emptive invasions and environmental destruction -- is a benign outfit.\n\n\"I also don't need to be tracked,\" Claus says. \"This is the era where we are learning that CSEC in Ottawa and the NSA are watching every move everybody makes, and it's getting ridiculous. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer has gotten ulcers out of concern that every time he sneaks into the bushes to do his business, it winds up on some database somewhere and could be used to embarrass him in front of his fellow creatures.\"\n\nNORAD deception about Claus\n\nThe NORAD Tracks Santa website is a paean to militarism, inviting young children to play at war and offering videos that are recruitment vehicles featuring martial music more akin to a 1980s Tom Cruise bomb-em-up flick than a period of peace and good will to all. Indeed, one four-minute video making the rounds of community newspaper websites around the globe opens with an image not of Santa but of bomber planes.\n\n\"One of the videos says I did a test flight in cooperation with NORAD, which is a total lie,\" Claus said, bemoaning the fact that the tracking site features numerous tributes to an organization that has the power, along with its other \"northern command\" partners, to commit the ultimate act of nuclear terrorism and obliterate the globe.\n\nOne video features a small child (perhaps the son of U.S. military personnel) stationed in Djibouti, one of over 700 U.S. bases occupying the globe and also the site of a command centre from which drones are launched in countries like Yemen and Somalia. (Djibouti troops do not, notably, maintain a military base protecting their own interests in Florida or Manitoba). While the child talks of going to the beach and riding his bike, the video does not mention that one month ago, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights heard evidence on Djibouti's role in the U.S.-led (and Canadian-supported) rendition to torture and secret detention program.\n\nThe NORAD tracking site also features holiday songs performed by -- who else -- the Air Force Academy Band.\n\n\"In the same way the militaries of the world try to convince us that humanitarian aid cannot be delivered without sniper rifles or bombing the heck out of a village first, now they are trying to show that Christmas cannot happen without all of their firepower, and that Christmas carols cannot be sung unless by people who've been trained to kill,\" Claus said. \"Well, I have news for them. The trillions spent on war are what deprive most children of happy holidays, regardless of when they celebrate them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a heavily redacted Access to Information request appears to reveal why NORAD is tracking Santa, and early indicators are it has nothing to do with his protection nor his mission of delivering joy.\n\nCSIS names Santa security threat\n\nAccording to the highly classified document from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), \"The Service has reasonable grounds to believe that [name blacked out, but clearly a reference to Claus] is a member of an inadmissible class of persons to Canada based on a variety of associations, travel patterns and other indicators which constitute a threat to the security of Canada.\"\n\nAmong those highly suspect findings, CSIS notes, is Santa's long beard (\"worn in the traditional Muslim fashion that could inspire some radicalized youth to follow bearded individuals such as Osama bin Laden\"), his visitation to countries throughout the Middle East and refusal to demonize anyone (\"a disturbing inclination towards supporting the human rights of Palestinians,\"), his large donations of gifts (\"he may be transporting illicit materials that could place him on the United Nations 1267 list, thereby barring him from travelling with goods that could fall into the wrong hands\"), past associations (\"[subject] did attend at Robben Island prison compound and provide material aid to Nelson Mandela and other members of African National Congress, which Service maintains was, is, or could be a terrorist organization\"), has signed petitions urging the release of immigration detainees (including children detained in refugee jails across Canada) and in support of environmental protections (\"Service notes subject supports same causes as eco-terrorists trying to block oil sands development\"), and his failure to carry a passport.\n\n\"Service also notes that Mr. Claus uses several aliases possibly as a means of avoiding detection, including Jolly St. Nick, Kris Kringle, and, in a special code with woman alleged to be Mrs. Claus, 'tubby old sock,' origin for which is still a mystery to Service but further investigation will reveal.\" Claus also appears to be under surveillance for carrying of \"suspicious\" sacks, studious avoidance of customs, and his \"religious head gear,\" the last of particular concern to Quebec security services attempting to pre-emptively enforce their so-called Charter of Values.\n\nIs Prancer a closet Muslim?\n\nCSIS also notes with grave concern that at least two of Santa's reindeer (Prancer and Vixen) have been reading the Koran and allegedly discussed conversion to Islam.\n\nIt is not surprising that Claus would be the subject of concern to \"security services,\" whose main goals tend toward monitoring outbreaks of democracy and free-thinking inquiry while harassing specific targeted communities using the same vague profiling against, for example, members of this country's Arab Muslim communities. Santa certainly does have a record of being involved in the same social justice causes that everyone from CSIS and the RCMP to the FBI and CIA have deemed threats to national security. For example, Santa was recently arrested with Walmart workers seeking a decent wage, while the busiest resident of the North Pole also managed to take an anti-drones message of Peace to the Australian military. Santa also performed a tripod action for 9 hours in Glasgow this week to protest immigration raids that break down doors and arrest and detain children simply because they are refugees.\n\nWhile Santa is proud of involving himself in social justice activities, he does get weary of his image being used to glorify war, especially given that he annually views the painful reality that is a result of relying on military might to enforce injustice and resolve conflicts. \"We see all the children of the world, the ones who have lost legs and arms and eyes to landmines and cluster bombs, the ones who have watched parents murdered with Canadian bullets and machine guns in Iraq and Afghanistan, the ones whose only wish for Christmas is peace on Earth, or the return of a parent or sibling killed by an aerial bombardment.\"\n\nClaus has joined Homes not Bombs members on many occasions through the years as an ambassador of peace through justice and goodwill. As such, he has been arrested by Loblaws for helping distribute food he took from their shelves (to help pay back the tens of millions of dollars in unpaid taxes owed by Loblaws), protesting sanctions against the people of Iraq which killed over one million Iraqis (this with the aid of the Canadian military whose warplanes are set to tail Santa), the use of secret trial security certificates, the production of war toys, L-3 Wescam's production of drone technology in Burlington, Ont., the Hamilton War Show, and many others.\n\n\"There are so many causes for me to support, and I want to support them all, but half the time I'm busy trying to correct the false information about me and what I stand for that's presented by the military and the media,\" Claus said. \"I barely have time to speak with you, much less all the other media outlets who request interviews.\"\n\nChrist continues to be detained by CBSA\n\nrabble.ca's interview with Claus was cut off when he received a call from one of Canada's top immigration lawyers, Barb Jackman, to discuss his travel options given the increasingly tight Canadian borders for refugees and the possibility that he may be on Canada's no-fly list. Indeed, it is unclear whether agents of the Canadian Border Services Agency -- a federal department with absolutely no independent oversight -- will allow Claus to enter Canada, and there are still many unresolved questions regarding its recent rejection of Jesus Christ, who was deemed a failed refugee claimant and a threat to national security.\n\nLawyers at the time had asked for information about CSIS interviews with Christ, but because CSIS does not record interviews nor make verbatim notes, there was little to go on. \"The Service noted that Christ appeared unusually calm when pressed about his possible association with prostitutes, beggars and lepers,\" read a short half-page of notes which were eventually declassified. \"Christ also seemed hesitant when asked whether an individual named Joseph was his father, a sign that he was withholding the true nature of his character.\" Christ's anti-government activities also raised a red flag for Canadian border officials.\n\nChrist was also deemed to be a security threat because he allegedly uses a number of aliases, including Prince of Peace, Jesus of Nazareth and the Son of God. He had travelled to Canada, like most refugees, on a false passport, because if he had used his real name on travel documents, Roman authorities may have picked him up before he could have fled the country. Christ was also deemed inadmissible to Canada because of his criminal record; he, like all refugees coming to this country, are considered not worthy of being accepted even if those convictions have occurred in countries where there is no due process or internationally recognized legal system. Worse, refugees who have been convicted of minor offences which would be deemed \"summary\" (or lesser) offences if convicted here in Canada have their record interpreted as indictable (or more severe) upon their arrival here, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nIn another mark against Christ, CBSA points out one particular incident in which the refugee applicant was \"particularly violent, overturning a table used by moneychangers in a temple frequented by Canadian money speculators.\" Canada's Criminal Code notes that a terrorist is anyone who \"damages property outside of Canada because a person or entity with an interest in the property or occupying the property has a relationship with Canada or a province or is doing business with or on behalf of the Government of Canada or a province.\"\n\nWhile Christ remains in detention with hundreds of never-charged immigration detainees in Lindsay (many of whom are again on hunger strike), Santa will no doubt be writing the phone number of his lawyer on his arm in the event he needs to make that call. If there's nothing under your tree December 25, you may want to consider posting bail for the latest in a long line of wrongly imprisoned migrants and travellers caught up in the nightmare of Canada's immigration regime.\n\nLike this article?

  "latent_7185": "SINGAPORE — It seems obvious, but household chores can be challenging for people who have one arm.\n\nLoren Lim, an industrial design student at the National University of Singapore, has come up with a set of kitchen attachments that are aimed at helping people accomplish tasks such as washing the dishes and chopping vegetables.\n\nHe calls it the Oneware, and it's a set of attachments that you can lay over the sink or at the prep area in the kitchen.\n\nThe largest attachment is for washing dishes. It's mainly a perforated silicone layer that grips dishes so users can apply pressure while scrubbing one surface. The rubbery surface flexes to accommodate rounder surfaces when you flip the dish over too.\n\nImage: victoria ho/mashable\n\nAnother attachment features two sets of teeth that hold onto veggies so you can chop them safely with one hand.\n\nImage: victoria ho/mashable\n\nLim told Mashable it took about a year to research and develop his product, dubbed the Oneware. The prototypes were quite different to the final version, he said.\n\nAn earlier version of the dish-washing segment looked more like a half-filled balloon, he said. It worked well to accommodate a dish sitting on it, but ended up becoming slippery when wet.\n\nAnd before the chopping board's design was finalised, an earlier version featured a row of nails to pierce fruit and vegetables. It would've held onto the food, but posed a safety risk in the kitchen, he explained.\n\nImage: loren lim\n\nThe Oneware isn't ready for stores yet, but it's already won Lim a bunch of top awards from global companies.\n\nDyson gave him the James Dyson Award in Singapore this year, offering him the chance to represent the country against 22 other winners across the world.\n\nHe said the £2,000 ($2,590) he got from that award will go towards his efforts in making Oneware a commercial reality eventually.\n\nYou might be able to buy it in Ikea soon\n\nLim is also getting a leg up from another big retailer. Since he won Ikea's Young Designer Award for Singapore this year, he's bagged a trip to HQ in Sweden to chat about his product.\n\nAs it is, the Oneware already looks like it's come straight out of an Ikea catalogue, with its clean lines and unassuming grey and white coloured design.\n\nWith some luck, perhaps you'll see the Oneware in a store sooner than you think.",

  "latent_7310": "Image by Ashley Goodall\n\nThis article was originally published on VICE New Zealand.\n\nIn the lead up to WEED WEEK on VICELAND (April 17-23, from 6PM) we're running a series of stories on New Zealand's most widely-used illegal drug.\n\nPot. Grass. Broccoli. Weed. Cannabis. Whatever you call it, chances are it will be the first drug you managed to get your greasy pubescent hands on. The real question is, can you blame that half a joint you smoked with your cousin behind the back of the gym for the fact that you now can't seem to go out and enjoy yourself without snorting a line of eccies?\n\nRoss Bell, the executive of the New Zealand Drug Foundation, says probably not. Ross told VICE, \"The idea that there's something in cannabis that then leads you to try other substances has been debunked by science.\" The gateway element could be, however, the kick youth get from taking risks and the door that opens once you have contact with any kind of drug dealer. For this reason, Bell suggests: \"Maybe if cannabis was not illegal, was regulated and kept separate from more serious substances, that would remove the gateway element and be a good thing.\"\n\nWe had a chat to young Kiwis at varying levels on the scale of drug use to finally put the question to bed. Is weed a gateway drug? Or are some people just born with their gate wide open?\n\nRhett, 25\n\nWhat was the first drug you tried?\n\nIt's going to have to be marijuana.\n\nDo you think weed led you to trying other substances?\n\nNo, I would say that partying led to that. Going out drinking to music gigs, festivals and all that sort of stuff. I have so many friends that were really sheltered and when they got freedom they just got out of control. My parents and siblings were always really open with me which is much better than just letting people go out and figure it out themselves.\n\nIn your opinion, is weed a gateway drug then?\n\nNo, not really. I don't know, it's a hard one but I don't think it's the worst one anyway. I feel like alcohol is probably more of a gateway drug than anything else. Just in terms of the situations I've been in anyway. I also know a lot of people that smoke weed but wouldn't touch anything else but that. I know more people like that then I do people who do every kind of drug under the sun.\n\nShayna, 19\n\nFirstly, what was the first drug you ever tried?\n\nSince watching That Sugar Film I've come to realise how much sugar was a drug addiction for me as a child. But in terms of illegal drug use, apart from some underage drinking, then weed would have been my first. I honestly find it pretty jarring smoking a joint outside a venue and seeing my drunk peers yelling, fighting, vomiting, crying or passed out on the footpath, yet the law deems what I'm doing to be immoral.\n\nSo do you think weed lead you to smoking any other drugs?\n\nSince I first smoked weed I have taken MDMA or LSD or something a few times a year, but I imagine I would have experimented with these regardless.\n\nWhat do you think was your gateway into those substances then?\n\nSince weed is pretty easy to get and is seen to be relatively low risk, then it tends to be the first illicit drug people experiment with, so it could be considered a \"gateway drug\" in the sense that someone might try harder drugs afterwards. But I think most of that would also come down to how if someone doesn't turn into a wake'n bake dropout stoner right away, then they might start to question everything else they were told in the \"just say no to drugs\" style health curriculum in school. Like I did.\n\nMimi, 19\n\nWas weed the first drug you experimented with?\n\nNo. I know this is really weird but I've actually never tried weed by itself. I've only ever had it once on a night with a mixture of all sorts.\n\nDo you think you'll try weed by itself one day?\n\nI don't really plan to because I'd rather do a pinger on the weekend to be honest. It's way more fun. It keeps me up all night and lets me party. I go to the club till like 4.30am and I'm just like thriving. Then I go to Pandora and get Croissants and wait for the comedown.\n\nIf weed wasn't your gateway drug, do you think anything else was?\n\nI have always been a pretty curious person and so that's always gotten me into some pretty weird situations. It's not so much that anything was my gateway, more that I've never been very concerned with it all anyway. I think I'll worry a lot more about my drug use when I'm older but for now it's not like it's very often or a big deal at all really.\n\nRob, 21\n\nWhat was the first drug you ever tried?\n\nWeed. I was at a park with the worst type of friends.\n\nAnd do you think it led you to taking any other drugs?\n\nNo definitely not, it just made me really lazy. I know for sure it didn't make me try anything else because I only went into other drugs after I quit weed for a while.\n\nWhat would you consider a gateway drug then?\n\nProbably like MDMA or something. You kind of just keep on wanting more of that. Meth and Oxycon too, those are big ones I think. But I think if you're into meth you are well and truely through the gate to be honest. And if you're doing it often then you don't really have a gate anymore.\n\nHarry, 20\n\nWas weed the first drug you ever tried?\n\nYeah, I first tried it with a few friends at my friend's parents house. It was pretty chill.\n\nDid trying weed lead you to trying anything else?\n\nNo, not directly. Though I think the attitude in general for me that first led me to it could be more linked to having a compulsive nature. You are told from the age of 0 to 13 from your parents and your uncle and whoever else that weed is bad and makes you dumb. So it is an act of rebellion, it's an impulsive thing. You feel like you're doing something wrong. So I think that act could correlate to similar attitudes towards other drugs.\n\nWhy do you think people think weed is a gateway?\n\nI think people don't think realise that THC isn't the problem, it's more of an attitude thing and the culture around it. Even the fact that I'm going to put my first name in this article, I think it just has this strange stigma attached to it and that's why it's so exciting for kids. The less it's considered safe the more cool it probably is. So it's less about the drugs, more about the people who use them.\n\nBella, 22\n\nWas weed the first drug you tried?\n\nYes but I wouldn't say I'm a stoner or anything. I've only ever done it a handful of times and never bought it for myself.\n\nDo you think weed is a gateway drug?\n\nI think maybe. But I'm not really sure. It definitely didn't make me feel inspired to try anything else really and I've only really tried very low key prescription pills like codeine on a night out. I've never tried MDMA or anything but if I did I don't think it would be because I've done weed before. It would just be because I feel like trying it once.\n\nWhy do you think weed smokers go onto other more serious drugs then?\n\nTo me weed is completely separate to drugs like MDMA. For me someone who smokes weed every day would be a real chilled out person who likes to relax and wears hemp and shit. On the other hand someone who's into more hard-core stuff is out in the clubs every weekend and just looking for a good time until like 5 AM. These are two very different people and while I know these are major stereotypes, people seem to usually end up picking a side.\n\nFollow Laura on Twitter.",

  "latent_7507": "More tests, more results! Follow The Food Lab on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nGet the Recipe The Ultimate Patty Melt\n\nI like the Traveling Wilburys. Composed of an all-star cast of characters hailing from much-beloved and well-known acts, nobody would argue that together they form something that's better than any of the bands they started with. But that doesn't mean they aren't worth a good listening-to now and again.\n\nSo it is with patty melts. Take the meat from a good burger, the caramelized onions off a slider, the buttery toast from a grilled cheese made with the rye bread from a good deli sandwich, and top it all with the melted Swiss from a Reuben, and you've got yourself one hell of a sandwich.\n\nI know that without a bun, it's tough to claim that the patty melt even qualifies as a hamburger, but The Burger Lab's never been one to value nomenclature before good taste. A great patty melt should have all of its part in a state of psychedelic trance, each one subjugating its sense of self to become part of the cosmic whole. Unlike a burger, with its distinct patty and bun, a patty melt has no boundaries. The transition from buttery crust to melted onions to gooey cheese to juicy beef should be organic and inseparable, both in texture and in flavor.\n\nSo how does one build the ultimate patty melt?\n\nLet's start from the outside, handle with care, work our way to the center, and take the whole thing to the end of the line, shall we?\n\nThe Bread\n\nRye bread is the classic choice, and I saw no reason to stray from it. It may just be the New Yorker in me talking, but the combination of good rye bread and Swiss cheese is amongst the greatest flavors known to man.\n\nDark ryes like Pumpernickel or black bread are both too robust tasting and don't have the necessary structure to hold in a sandwich of such magnitude. I went with standard delicatessen white rye, a bread made from white flour flavored with rye, and the standard choice for grilled deli sandwiches, offering both flavor, and good chewy structure.\n\nSince the bread and cheese element of the sandwich are essentially the same as a grilled cheese, why not use the standard grilled cheese method? Well there's a problem with it. It lies in the fact that because of the massive amount of air space in a slice of bread, it makes a really good insulator. That means that it takes a long time for the cheese to melt; if you're not careful, you can burn the outside of the sandwich before the center's even had the chill taken off of it. How do you solve this problem?\n\nI learned a little trick from Adam: toast the inner-facing side of each slice of bread in butter before you construct the sandwich. Not only does this warm the bread, giving the cheese a jumpstart on melting and ensuring that the two fuse firmly, but it also gives you an opportunity to incorporate more butter to the melt (ain't it great that writing about bread and butter is my, well, bread and butter?)\n\nThe Cheese\n\nI've got three beefs with patty melts, and only one of them is with the beef. The first is with the cheese. The problem is, it just ain't gooey enough for me. A young Swiss cheese like they serve at the deli counter has decent flavor and relatively good meltability, but it doesn't compare to the oozy quality of a good American.\n\nObviously, I had to up my game. For my first attempt, I tried two slices, one Swiss, one American. Better, but the general consensus was that it still wasn't quite oozy enough. Upping it to two full slices of each torn into pieces and arranged on the bread slices for maximum coverage brought the melt up to Take My Breath Away on prom night levels of cheesiness. Wir fahren nach Berlin!*\n\nMight I suggest a permanent alliance between the Americans and the Swiss in the name of good taste?\n\n*extra points if you call out that obscure reference in the comments.\n\nThe Patty\n\nNormally, I'm a fresh-ground beef kinda guy. But in this case, I was willing to reconsider my stance. As Ed rightfully pointed out, \"even in a place that serves a bad burger, you're safe ordering a patty melt.\" And he's right. A burger is all about the beef. But a patty melt? It's about the integration of all the parts. The beef is there, and it offers some flavor, but honestly, if all the other elements are in place, even regular old ground chuck should serve the purpose nicely. Only tasting could tell the truth.\n\nStore-ground chuck it would be. Rather than going for the standard round patty, I found that by forming the meat into the exact shape of the bread before cooking, it shrunk just enough that when placed on the sandwich, it left a 1/4-inch space all around the edges—the perfect size to ensure that the every bite had meat in it, without the patty hanging out over the sides, creating a neater, tastier package.\n\nNoticing the tasty looking browned bits left behind by the patty (the fond), I started thinking: in a regular griddled burger, you press the patty down onto the skillet to maximize charring, then you lift it and place it on the bun. Signed, sealed, delivered, and push those browned bits out of your mind.\n\nA patty melt, on the other hand, involves several different cooked elements. Is there a way that I could incorporate the tasty browned bits into the sandwich to maximize flavor? Indeed, there is—which takes me to...\n\nThe Onions\n\nJust as the sweet, meltingly soft caramelized onions form the backbone of a good slider, a patty melt relies on them to balance out the richness of the butter, meat, and cheese. By adding thinly sliced onions directly to the skillet I just cooked my burger in, the onions released enough moisture to deglaze all those browned bits, instantly upping their flavor. Normally, it takes a good 10 minutes of slow cooking to even start browning. With the help of the fond, the onions were well on their way within 30 seconds.\n\nTo further speed up the process, I used a technique I often employ when making French Onion Soup under pressure: adding water.\n\nAfter a few minutes of cooking, after the juice from the onions has almost evaporated over a relatively high heat, a thin film of caramelized juices forms a patina on the bottom of the skillet. By adding a bit of water, scraping that patina up, then repeating the process—fry, brown, deglaze—several times, you can develop deep color and flavor in about a quarter of the time that it takes if you were to slow-cook them the traditional way.\n\nLooking over at the plate where my burger was resting and seeing the small pool of exuded juices it was sitting in, I thought to myself, why use just water when I have all this flavorful liquid sitting right here?\n\nOnions, you're not alone any more. Deglazing the pan with the meat juices ensured that every ounce of flavor went straight back into the sandwich instead of down the drain.\n\nThe Assembly\n\nAssembling the patty melt was easy. I divided the deeply caramelized onions evenly on top of both halves (after cooking, I could fit a full cup of raw onions onto each sandwich!), placed the patty on top, closed the sandwich, and got ready to fry it in more butter.\n\nThrough a long personal history with grilled cheeses, I've come to realize that—just like with bacon—sandwiches should be grilled slowly. Get impatient and turn the heat up too high, and your butter starts to burn long before your bread can develop the even, golden-brown that's the hallmark of a good patty melt. Don't believe me? Take a look at the photo above.\n\nBut even after the bread was crisp and golden brown and the cheese was as gooey as one could hope for, there was still something missing—a certain childhood grilled-cheese-like taste memory that it lacked. I realized what it was.\n\nWhen I was a kid, salted butter ruled the household fridge. We used it for everything from toast to frying. As I grew older and let my professional training soften me, I gradually switched over to unsalted butter, the choice of cooks, since it allows you more control over the final salt level of the dish.\n\nThis is a dish that should be decidedly salty. By sprinkling a bit of kosher salt over the melted butter in the skillet before adding the sandwich, it developed a crust that popped in my mouth with a delicious, salty kick.\n\nAnd there I had it: about as good an expression of a classic burger-derived sandwich as I could hope for.\n\nCongratulations, I finally did succeed.\n\nFor a full photo-documented breakdown of the process, check out the slideshow and recipe above.\n\nGet the Recipe The Ultimate Patty Melt View Recipe »\n\nThis post may contain links to Amazon or other partners; your purchases via these links can benefit Serious Eats.

It sued Safe Tire again in 2008.\n\nState environmental investigators say at least 1 million tires remain, according to the filing. Eclipse Renewables purchased the 36-acre property in 2009.\n\nLittle information is available about Eclipse. The company’s only listed officer is no longer involved, according to Eclipse’s attorney Brian Bro of Houston. Bro declined to comment on Monday.\n\nDuring yearly inspections of the property, mostly recently in April, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality investigators found “overgrown vegetation, ponding water and swarms of mosquitos present at the facility.”\n\nCiting fire hazards and storage of tires without a permit, the AG’s office asked that Eclipse be required to stop transporting any tires except those it removes from the site, cut the grass, remove the brush near the tires and do something to control the mosquitoes. It asked that all tires be removed within 180 days except for 500 on the ground or 2,000 in locked containers.\n\nState law would allow a judge to issue a penalty of least $129,850, though the maximum would be nearly $65 million, according to the filing.\n\nState Rep.

  "latent_7930": "This article has been co-authored by Shanmukh, Saswati Sarkar, Dikgaj and Aparna\n\nAssam has seen rapid change in religious demography, since the beginning of the twentieth century. From 14% minorities in 1901, the state has seen a rapid rise in the number of minorities and a corresponding fall in the fraction of Hindus in recent years. The influx of Bangladeshis, once a source of labour for the landlords (of various Hindu ethnicities in Assam, eg, Asomiya, Bengali, Marwaris, and even the British), has led to persecution and flight of Hindu residents (of all ethnicities) from their homes, agitations against the Indian state and serious strife in the region, as communities have turned against each other, leading to fragmentation of both the polity and the society. Militias of various groups have roamed the land, leading to attacks against each other too.\n\nConsequently, we seek to predict and analyse the evolution of religious demographics of Assam in the next fifty years using established statistical tools.\n\nIn the first part of the article, we present our conclusions of the various techniques, along with tables of the projected growths and the dates by which the various districts of Assam will turn Hindu minority, along with maps illustrating the same. In the latter part of the article, we analyse Assam as a whole and predict the demographics of the entire state. In the last part, we present our analysis on what the consequences of legalising the illegal immigrants via visas, as has been suggested by influential members of various political persuasions including the right wing and BJP support base.\n\nIn all our calculations, we have considered Hindus to comprise of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Animists. All the different categories other than Hindus are <1% in all the districts we have included in our analysis. Consequently, we have included them in the Hindu category. However, Christians have been modelled separately wherever they are in significant numbers. Further, in no place have Christians been included in either Muslim or Hindu category, even where they have not been modeled as in those where they constitute <1% as in Kamrup, Nagaon and Cachar.\n\nHistorically, Assam consisted of eight districts, namely, Goalpara, Kamrup, Nagaon, Darrang, Lakhimpur, Sibsagar, Cachar Hills and Cachar. Of the eight districts, Lakhimpur is comprised of the districts of Tinsukhia, Dibrugarh, Dhemaji and Lakhimpur, while Sibsagar comprises the districts of Sibsagar, Jorhat and Golaghat. Both Sibsagar and Lakhimpur have >85% Hindus and have shown little change since 1951, we have therefore not investigated changes in religious demography in these. The other six have been showing a rapid fall of Hindus and have been investigated. For reasons of historical consistency, we have grouped these 6 districts as they historically existed (as large parts of census data in the past exist only for the districts as they existed then).\n\nThus, in all our models: Goalpara comprises of Goalpara, Dhubri, Kokrajhar, Bongaigaon and Chirang; Kamrup consists of Barpeta, Baksa, Kamrup, Kamrup Metropolitan, and Nalbari; Darrang comprises of Darrang, Udalguri, and Sonitpur; Nagaon comprises of Nagaon and Morigaon; Cachar (also known as Barak valley) comprises of Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts; and Cachar Hills comprise of Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong districts.\n\nIn this article, we have aggregated the various districts in each historical district together to determine the future religious demographics.\n\nTake home message 1:\n\nDistrict Actual Percentages Projected Percentages (in 2061) 1951 2011 Constant Growth Polynomial Logistic Goalpara 54.24 38.30 17.61 22.26 24.16 Kamrup 70.42 61.41 46.27 44.55 50.03 Nagaon 59.23 44.89 26.54 30.12 35.06 Darrang 78.98 64.56 43.92 50.68 51.68 Cachar Hills 93.22 78.93 63.72 66.34 75.93 Cachar 61.19 50.96 37.60 42.23 43.70\n\nTable 1: The table shows the actual percentages of the Hindus in 1951 and 2011 and the likely percentages of the Hindus in 2061 by the three methods used to predict the future demographics\n\nIt becomes clear that by 2061, Hindus will fall below 50% of the total population in five of the above six areas modelled according to both constant growth model and polynomial models. Currently, 22 million of the total 31 million, i.e., about 75% of the total population of Assam, lives in these 5 districts. Next, Goalpara, and Nagaon (Nagaon is the most heavily populated of the current districts of Assam) will have Hindus at 25% or so in 2061, a huge collapse from being a Hindu majority region in 1951. These regions are already a Hindu minority, while they used to be Hindu majority only two decades back. And Kamrup, housing nearly a fifth of the total population of Assam will also be a Hindu minority in 2061. Last, but not the least, Cachar, the Bengali speaking region of Assam, will also have become a Hindu minority. Already, it is tottering on the brink of becoming Muslim. Thus, in short, Hindu demography in Assam is collapsing across all major Hindu groups, including ethnic Assamese and ethnic Bengalis.\n\nIn contrast, the Muslim population has risen from 43% in 1951 in Goalpara to 56% in 2011, and is projected to rise to more than 70% in 2061 (in all models). In Kamrup, it increased from 29% in 1951 to 39% in 2011 and is predicted to rise to ~50% in 2061 in the various models. Similarly, in Darrang, it increased from 17% in 1951 to 29% in 2011 and is predicted to rise to more than 45% in 2061. In Nagaon, the Muslim percentage increased from 40% in 1951 to 55% in 2011 and is predicted to rise to more than 70% in 2061, and in Cachar, it increased from 38% in 1951 to 49% in 2011 and is predicted to rise to more than 60% in 2061. Similarly, the Christian population in Darrang has risen from 4% in 1951 to 7% in 2011 and is projected to rise to 8% in 2061; in Goalpara from 3% in 1951 to 5.5% in 2011 and is projected to rise to 8% in 2061; and in Cachar Hills from 7% in 1951 to 19% in 2011 and is projected to rise to 33% in 2061.\n\nWe now present on a map of Assam the year by which Hindus in different districts will fall below the 50% mark as per the three statistical growth models, as also the year by which Muslims will become majority in the same. We have coloured in deep green the districts that are already Hindu minority, in red those districts that may be Hindu minority by 2061 (we have indicated, in the table below the map, the years in which the districts shown in red will turn Hindu Minority and Muslim majority respectively, according to various models), and in yellow those that will remain Hindu majority in the next fifty years in all the models..\n\nIn the case of the sixth district, Cachar Hills, experience has shown that once a Christian percentage reaches a certain point in a tribal district, it tends to shoot up (this will be shown clearly in our models in the northeast states). Similarly, it may well turn out that this district too may become non-Hindu majority, while mathematical models do not indicate that just yet. Further, Cachar Hills looks large geographically, but it is very sparsely populated.\n\nConsequently, of the eight districts of Assam, five will be definitely non-Hindu majority or nearly at par. The remaining two will have Hindus above the 80% mark, assuming no migration to change the demographics of the last two regions.\n\nIn terms of the current districts, Dhubri, Goalpara, Barpeta, Bongaigaon, Nagaon, Morigaon, Darrang, Karimganj and Hailakandi are Hindu minority, while Nalbari, Kokrajhar, Kamrup and Cachar are also Hindu minority in the 0-4 age group, already. A total of 9 existing districts are already Hindu minority with at least five more set to join the list of Hindu minority districts in the coming years.\n\nTake home message 2:\n\nA point of particular concern is the negative growth of Hindus in many areas that are heavily Muslim dominated. In the table below, we have presented the data of tehsils, where the Hindu growth has been negative in the 2001-2011 decade. As may be observed, all the tehsils are Muslim dominated.\n\nTehsil District Hindu growth 01-11 Muslim growth 01-11 Muslim % in 2011 Chapar Dhubri -12.29% 22.99% 68.9% Kalgaicha Barpeta -17.3% 32.71% 99.1% Bagbhar Barpeta -2.39% 17.57% 96.4%\n\nTable 2: Listed above are a few tehsils that have shown negative growth rate for Hindus in 2001-2011 decade. We have also shown the corresponding Muslim percentages in the districts.\n\nThe negative growth of the Hindus in these tehsils, when their neighbouring tehsils show a healthy Hindu growth imply that large scale emigration of the Hindus is ongoing. In several tehsils like Mankachar, Jaleswar, South Salmara, Laharighat, Dalgaon, etc. (especially the rural areas), Hindus have been practically wiped out, making growth (positive or negative) a matter of irrelevance. The situation is approaching similar levels on the other side, especially in the Badarpur and Hailakandi tehsils. Consequently, the actual growth rates do not matter in many tehsils, where the Hindu percentage is below 10%.\n\nTake home message 3:\n\nThe religious demography of Assam as a whole will evolve as follows:\n\nDistricts Actual Percentages Projected Percentages 1951 2011 Constant Growth Polynomial Logistic Assam 73.32 61.99 44.95 43.88 48.03\n\nTable 3: The actual percentages of Hindus in 1951 and 2011 and the projected percentages of Hindus in 2061 using the three techniques used to predict future demographics\n\nIt may be observed that all the three models show a clear Hindu minority situation in 2061. Indeed, both the polynomial and constant growth models show a Hindu minority well before 2051. We believe that these models are more realistic than the logistic model for Assam. Further, the Hindu population is projected by the polynomial model to actually begin shrinking from 2051-2061 decade. Assam’s Hindu population will fall from 21.8 million to 21.2 million and will shrink further. Assam’s Hindu population also has a very low fertility rate. Assam’s population grew only by about 11.6% in 2001-2011, whereas the Muslim population grew by 26.2%, with Muslims in many border districts growing by as high as 31%.\n\nThe point to note is that Hindu demographics of Assam has also benefited vastly by the ingress of many Hindu Bangladeshis, Nepalis, and Biharis. However, despite this immigration, Hindu demographics of the area is consistently falling, as it has been overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of Muslims immigrating from Bangladesh. Had the Hindu immigrants not arrived, Assam would have been in a worse state demographically, from the Hindu perspective.\n\nTake home message 4:\n\nThe principal cause for the collapse of Hindu demography in Assam has been Hindu mercantile greed over the last hundred years, amplified lately by middle-class avarice for access to cheap household help. For example, Eastern Goalpara, Kamrup, and Nagaon were 4-6% Muslim in 1901. Today, all three have Muslim populations ranging from 35 to 50%. Barpeta district (part of the undivided Kamrup) had 0.1% Muslims in 1901 and the Muslim population has risen to 65% today. From 1911, the influx of cheap Muslim labour from Bogra and Mymensingh in (today’s) Bangladesh to grow rice and tea on land seized from the Rabha, Bodo and Tiwa tribals by Indian and British landowners, transformed the demographics of this region in less than 30 years.\n\nThe Bangladeshi immigrants were, initially, mostly landless peasants and were settled on otherwise `unproductive land’ to benefit landowners. However, since then, they have seized vast amounts of land belonging to tribal communities, who have since been marginalised in Assam. Since then, they have continued to appropriate every kind of land – including Sattra lands – for agriculture. The illegals also provide a source of cheap labour for the tea industry (in some areas) and construction industry in other areas. Logging also employs these Bangladeshi infiltrators.\n\nThe concern about the influx of illegal infiltrators from Bangladesh needs to be viewed in the context that the growth of Hindus in many Muslim dominated districts is turning out to be negative. It is important to note that this phenomenon is being reported only in the regions of high Muslim presence. Thus, the Hindus are fleeing, or rather being compelled to flee, such regions. Hindu flight from Muslim dominated regions of Assam is a reality and is reflected in Table 2. This trend is likely to accelerate. Dhubri, Kokrajhar, Bongaigaon and Chirang districts saw a growth rate of 4.1% for Hindus (average growth rate of Hindus in Assam is 11.4%), while Muslims grew by more than 20% in the same districts. All the districts have a high Muslim population and have shown a very rapid rise in the number of Muslims in recent years.\n\nThe flight of the Hindus is unsurprising considering the assaults to which the Hindus have been subjected to in recent years by the illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. In Barpeta, Hindu temples have been desecrated [7]. In Darrang and Dalgaon, Bodos have been expelled from their homes. [8]. In Dalgaon, Durga Puja idols of the Bodos were attacked by the illegal Bangladeshis. [9]. In Dhubri, anti-India slogans were raised by the Bangladeshis, thus threatening the territorial integrity of the country [10]. Given these rampant attacks on the Hindus, the Hindus are leaving the region in droves.\n\nIt has been conservatively estimated [3] that the total number of illegals in Assam is between 1.5 and 2.5 million, or nearly one in every four Muslim inhabitants of Assam. It is likely that the actual number is much higher. These illegals have swamped the districts of lower Assam and Cachar, and have changed the demographics of the districts. The census numbers include the illegals and has thereby contributed in no small measure to our prediction of alteration of the religious demography of Assam.\n\nThere is large scale alarm about alteration of religious demography among the Hindu residents of Assam. The newly elected BJP government has in fact won by promising that it would solve the problem of illegal immigrants. It is of concern that there has been a persistent suggestion in influential sections of the support base of BJP that the problem is best solved by giving the illegal immigrant visas and legalising them [1]. Further, a call for free immigration from Bangladesh is being made. Economic development has been the pretext presented for both [1], [5], [6]. In fact, the call for naturalisaton of the illegals, who have `lived long’ is also being made in [5] and [6]. The legalisation of the illegal immigrants will lead to their eventual naturalisation as citizens. Even if the illegal immigrants are denied citizenship, their children will become citizens. Thus, not only will legalisation of illegals, not redress the demographic collapse of Hindus in Assam, it will exacerbate the same.\n\nIt is worth noting that Assam, sharing a border with three countries (Bhutan, Bangladesh and China) is key to holding the entire north east and, in the event of a war, all the roads leading to the northeast are currently dominated by areas filled to the brim with illegals. Secondly, it is the rural areas that are being lost to illegals. Urban Dhubri is 57% Hindu, while rural Dhubri is 15% Hindu. With the rural areas overrun by illegals, the big cities are becoming islands in a sea of illegals and are becoming cut off from each other. Already, Gauripur and Dhubri towns are cut off from the rest of India by the huge numbers of illegals, who dominate the countryside. In 20-30 years, the same fate will befall Gauhati, Darrang, and Nagaon too. Rural Kamrup, Darrang, and Nagaon also show a similar trend. This can result in a situation fraught with serious security implications for India. During the 1962 war between India and China, the illegal (then) East Pakistanis tried to welcome the Chinese invaders with Pakistani and green flags p. 107, [2]. There is no reason to believe that the new set of illegal immigrants are more loyal than their predecessors were in 1962. Similarly, a constant refrain of the Bangladeshis has been, `শিলহট্ট নিলাম গণভোটে কাছাড় নেবো লাঠির জোরে’ (We have taken Sylhet by the ballot, we will take Cachar by kicking you out).\n\nEconomic development is welcome, but not at the expense of national security or collapse of Hindu demography. If Hindus are forced to flee regions of heavy Muslim dominance, as they are currently, clearly the economic development that the legalisation of illegal immigrants might bring in, will not in any way further the interests of local Hindu commoners, regardless of the impact on the GDP. The suggestion to trade legalisation of illegal immigrants for greater investment opportunities in Bangladesh [5], [6] is a horrifying one, since it will inevitably come at the cost of the indigenous communities of Assam and the North East, as they are forced to flee the region due to the pressure by the illegal immigrants. It is imperative, therefore, that infiltrators be expelled, not legalized. On this count, a distinction must be made based on religion, as religion determines the principal cause of immigration from neighboring Bangladesh. Hindus from Bangladesh are seeking refuge in different parts of India including Assam due to religious persecution in Bangladesh. Muslims are not subjected to any religious persecution, their illegal migration into India is therefore for economic or other reasons. So, illegal Muslim migrants need to be expelled as infiltrators, while Hindu migrants need to be offered the status of refugees and subsequently naturalized – otherwise Assam is lost for good.\n\nStatistical projections of religious demography – models and results\n\nThe statistical projections have been made for all the communities using the methods mentioned; namely, constant growth models, polynomial curve fitting, and logistic curve fitting models. In all the graphs, the 1981 census is blank as no census was held in Assam in 1981, due to political turmoil and strife.\n\nThe constant growth model takes the average growth of the previous two decades and extrapolates them for the coming decades. Given that Hindu, and Muslim (but not Christian, as Christian growth rates often depend on conversions) growth rates are slowing down, the population (but NOT population percentages) of Hindus and Muslims obtained using this technique can be viewed as the upper limit of the populations that are likely to be present in 2061. The logistic curve assumes that all populations tend towards stability (neither increase, nor decrease) over time, and tries to ‘flatten’ the growth rates and thus stabilise populations in the long run. This can be viewed as the ‘stable’ population that is likely to be attained, assuming that stability does occur. The polynomial tries to realistically model the changes that have occurred in the past and project them into the future. This is the only model that can capture population fall in the future (due to low fertility rates) populations and tries to be the most realistic model, given the current data.\n\nDistricts:\n\nConstant Growth:\n\nIn the constant growth model, we model the percentages of the various groups, assuming the average population growth of the various communities between 1991 and 2011 to hold in the future. The following percentages are inferred using this model.\n\nAs may be seen in this model, five of the six areas considered, turn Hindu minority by 2061, with the Hindu population falling below the 25% mark in two districts. Goalpara (which became Hindu minority in 1991) and Nagaon (which became Hindu minority in 2001) are two of the most heavily populated districts in Assam. Kamrup (Hindu minority in 2051), Darrang (Hindu minority in 2051) and Cachar (Hindu minority in 2021) are the other districts, which will become a Hindu minority in this model, before 2061. Further, all these districts will become Muslim majority by 2061, too, despite a significant Christian population in both Goalpara and Darrang.\n\nPolynomial Model:\n\nIn this model, we try to fit third degree curves to the data points and try to predict the future populations. In the case of Goalpara and Darrang, owing to the rapid rise of Muslim population after minor changes in direction of growth in earlier decades, the third degree curve gives a large error. Consequently, we have chosen second degree curves to model these populations and predict future religious demographics.\n\nIn this model, too, five of the six districts become a Hindu minority (even Darrang has a Hindu population of 48% in 2061; it is just not Muslim majority due to the presence of a 7.5% Christian population in the district). The Hindu population of Goalpara falls below the 25% mark in this model too. Hindu population of Cachar falls below the 50% mark in 2021, Kamrup in 2051, and Darrang in 2061.\n\nLogistic Model:\n\nIn this model, we try to fit logistic curves to the data points and predict future populations and percentages from them. The curves are shown below.\n\nIn the logistic model, the Hindu population is below the 50% mark in three of the six districts, with the Hindus and Muslims at par in Kamrup (50.06% Hindus and the rest Muslims). Only in Darrang, do the Hindus show slightly greater than 50% population (Hindus are 51.6% in Darrang in this model). Hindus are set to fall below the 50% mark in 2031 in Cachar according to this model.\n\nThe state as a whole:\n\nWe also project the population of entire Assam using the same three models. From the above figures, it can be seen that by 2061 Hindus will fall below the 50% mark in all three models, with the best case shown in the logistic being a 48.03% Hindu figure in 2061. Muslims are at par in the logistic model with 48.31% of the population share. The share of Hindus is 44.95% in the constant growth model and 43.89% in the polynomial model in 2061. In both these cases (51.8% in polynomial and 50.9% in the constant growth model), Muslims form the majority by 2061. Hindus become the minority in 2051 in both the constant growth and polynomial models.\n\nIn conclusion, we can say that Assam is perched on a precipice with extremely serious security implications for the country. It is not too much to say that the future territorial integrity of India is at stake and how the Indian state expels the illegals will determine the course she takes as a nation. Low Hindu fertility rate, stubbornly high Muslim fertility rate, and illegal infiltration, often encouraged by the propertied classes that wanted cheap labour, are likely to contribute to turning a state that was barely 14% Muslim in 1901 to a Muslim majority state in 2061.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] – Jagannathan, “Capitalism’s crisis will end when they free immigration”, 19/08/2011 https://rjagannathan.in/2011/08/19/capitalisms-crisis-will-end-once-they-free-immigration/\n\n[2] – Braja Bihari Kumara, “Illegal Immigration from Bangladesh”.\n\n[3] – AP Joshi, MD Srinivas, and JK Bajaj, “Religious Demographics of India”\n\n[4] – JK Bajaj, “Demographic decline of the locals, infiltration and Congress vote politics create turmoil in Assam” Organiser, 27/08/2012, http://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2012/8/27/-b-Demographic-decline-of-the-locals,-infiltration-and-Congress-vote-politics-create-turmoil-in-Assam–b-.aspx?NB=&lang=4&m1=&m2=&p1=&p2=&p3=&p4=&PageType=N\n\n[5] – Jagannathan, `”Assam Violence shows we need to open up legal migration”, http://www.firstpost.com/india/assam-violence-shows-we-need-to-open-up-legal-migration-390094.html\n\n[6] – Jagannathan, `”Why PM Modi should offer Sheikh Hasina a win-win deal on Illegal Immigrants”, http://www.firstpost.com/india/why-pm-modi-should-offer-sheikh-hasina-a-win-win-deal-on-illegal-immigrants-2281332.html\n\n[7] Temple desecrated in Barpeta http://www.newstimesassam.webcomipl.net/newsupdates/index.php?aID=4947&highlight=Barpeta#.V1D3qR3xNLb\n\n[8] On the offensive http://www.thesundayindian.com/en/story/on-the-offensive/7/6749/\n\n[9] BJP condemns infiltrators attacking Bodos in Assam http://www.oneindia.com/2008/10/05/bjp-condemns-infiltrators-attacking-bodos-in-assam-1223218970.html\n\n[10] Anti India Slogans raised in Dhubri, http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=apr1015/at052\n\nAll the relevant demographic data has been taken from [3] and the corresponding census of India books.

  "latent_8180": "For months now, several central bank officials have espoused the threats associated with digital currencies like bitcoin. Although the statements have listed the risks that are posed by bitcoins and other virtual currencies, a lot of officials mention the possibility of cryptocurrencies taking down fiat money, financial institutions and the sovereignty of states.\n\nCase in point is Gareth Murphy, senior Central Bank of Ireland official, who delivered a speech Thursday at a digital money conference in Dublin called BitFin 2014, a conference that gathers experts in money, economics and technology and incites debate without reprisal. He touched upon matters relating to consumer protection, exchange rate policy and payment systems.\n\nMurphy made allusions to the fact that the more consumers use digital currencies for transactions then the likelier it’ll be more governments to receive less revenue through conventional transactions. Also, he noted that the virtual currency industry could diminish a bank’s ability to influence the overall economy’s price of credit.\n\n“At the outset, I think that it is important for me to state my belief that developments in mobile and information technology are very likely to change the landscape of financial services in the coming years. (And indeed, there have been a number of reports written on this subject recently),” stated Murphy.\n\nMost of the regulatory reform agenda in financial services of the last six years has been a response to the crisis of 2008. This has taught us that we all have a stake in ensuring that severe financial crises ‒ wherever they might come from ‒ are less likely in the future. Technology-driven innovations in payments, savings and distribution typify some of the new challenges that financial authorities are likely to face in the coming years.\n\nThe Irish central bank doesn’t recognize bitcoin as a legitimate currency, which means that consumers will not be protected in the event of a loss in digital holdings, theft or the shutdown of an exchange website. Murphy believes that once more consumers start wanting to transact different goods and services then anti-money laundering schemes will be brought to the test.\n\n“In effect, economic activity is the aggregate of domestic transactions in the ‘euro-denominated economy’ and the ‘virtual currency economy,” added Murphy. “This is likely to have a profound operational impact on these firms and their regulatory risk profile.”\n\nMoving forward, central banks will have a lot of variables to consider as “two worlds collide”: a euro economy and a virtual currency economy, which will have a considerable effect on exchange rates, monetary policy and the rate of credit, elements that have been controlled by central banks for decades.\n\n“The existence of a ‘euro-denominated economy’ and a ‘virtual currency economy’ raises the prospect of an internal balance of payments between two sub-economies where suppliers may prefer one currency over another as a means of payment (for different goods and services).”\n\nAt the end of it all, according to Murphy, bitcoin and other virtual currencies will become a bank’s worst enemy.",

Without going into details here, lets fast forward that to 2013.In 2013, the Parliament term ended and, as we all know, the parliament renewed its own mandate twice already denying the Lebanese people the only right they had left to chose their representatives.In 2014, Michel Sleiman's term ended and also the unconstitutional and illegitimate self-mandated parliament could not elect a new president. An important role in the decision making has been lost here. For the ones who dont know, each major decision must be accepted by the 3 main constituencies in the country (the Christians represented by the President, the Sunnis represented by the PM and the Shias represented by the Parliament Speaker).as we like to call it, and Lebanese governments have been respecting this \"3eref\" since Independence and anytime someone tried not to abide by it, it caused major unrest and even wars.In order to keep the country \"on its feet\" and not paralyze the whole process, all political parties in the government agreed to some terms, so what lead to this FPM movement ?Here are some facts explaining these terms and some major events leading to this FPM movement:1., and in the absence of the President,(especially the Christians ones who are representing the Christians vote here instead of the President)2. Many times before,(e.g. Boutros Harb and others) objected to them for no compelling reason other than to deny FPM credit for good projects or decisions.3.Salam (prodded by FM) refused and insisted that he alone controls the agenda in every cabinet session thus adding to his own vast powers as PM those of the President and becoming practically a sole decision maker in the executive branch... almost a dictator.4.(and other parties like Kataeb)(again at the insistence and prodding of FM).5.(a position reserved for Sunnis).They both agreed and took their proposal to all other concerned parties and no one objected and they all (yes Junblat and Berri included) gave tacit approval.6.They used their usual deceiving ways arguing that there is still plenty of time (until September) to appoint an Army Chief but they needed to appoint the ISF Chief now as the acting Chief's term is about to expire. Needless to say, FPM ministers objected and insisted that all security and armed forces be appointed at the same time in one package.7.It was meant to set a precedent to having the Defense Minister extending the term of Kahwagi the Army Chief for the second time. By this they want to sneakily accomplish a double blow to FPM:- Removing General Roukoz from the picture who has to retire in October unless appointed as Army Chief- Keeping Kahwagi as a continued threat to Aoun in the presidential race.8. FPM, recognizing the childish conspiracy and silly FM's ways of deception (pun intended), struck back by declaring thatunless the security appointments are dealt with first.9. Since, FM and Salam changed their mind about how decisions inside the Cabinet should or can be taken.To set a precedent that they can proceed this way they chose one single small issue that can make FPM look bad (the subsidies to the truckers to export agricultural and other products) and passed it by a simple majority over FPM's objections. And now they can point at FPM (as exhibited here in the forum by some FMers and F14 supporters) as wanting to paralyze the country thinking that they can embarrass FPM into submission and capitulation. This is just a dry test run to later pass anything they want (including armed forces appointments) by a simple majority... basically running the country as a. dictatorship as they always did since their collaboration with the Syrian occupiers.10.to stop this slippery course and show them that if they want to try to force things down our throats another time like they got used to doing, especially that they think FPM's allies are now either consumed by other concerns or not willing to stand by it, FPM can also go down that slippery and dangerous road all by itself.I will just list some news/headlines here and leave the rest to time:1. Yesterday between the measured demos and the confrontation of the ministers they accomplished the first goal. Forcing Salam and FM to back down and agree not to try to pass decrees without unanimous consent.3. Sleiman Frangieh: \"We are with you,\" the Marada leader said, addressing Aoun, \"but you have to coordinate stances with us... We only disagree on the manner, not the stances.\"FPM is in a confrontation mode to accomplish specific things and not trying to score political points by being principled. Remaining in government provides FPM with additional tools in their confrontation as proven yesterday by the confrontation inside the cabinet.For the demos, FPM started the day before at night for two reasons. First not to prevent people to get to their work and do their business and deny its opponents the opportunity to turn people against FPM and its movement. Second, not to make FPMers leave their work to participate and create problems for them with their employers. This is why FPM said \"measured moves\" enough to accomplish the immediate goal. But FPM is ready to and can escalate much much more if need be.",

More pressing are the cuts coming in this parliament – cuts being pushed through for the purpose of creating an unnecessary budget surplus by the next General Election.\n\nWhatever ‘tough decisions’ you think any government would have to make on spending, do you oppose the level of the Conservative cuts about to come?\n\nDoes the Labour party accept the principle of the free movement of labour?\n\nA great deal of hot air is expounded on immigration by politicians who repeatedly talk about Labour must ‘addressing voters’ concerns about immigration’. This is too ambiguous, for surely there are a broad range of concerns – some perfectly reasonable and others frankly unpalatable.\n\nA good starting point would be to know whether the potential leadership candidates accept the principle of free movement within the European Union. If yes, then we should be honest about the fact and move on to dealing with some of the local impacts of migration.\n\nIn many ways honesty about free movement is the prerequisite for trust on issues around integration and the welfare state. Otherwise we end up mired in discussions about net migration, something which (if you accept free movement within the EU) is largely beyond the control of politicians.\n\nIf you don’t accept the principle of free movement, how are you planning to negotiate British withdrawal from that covenant at European level? And what if Europe says no? Would that mean leaving the EU?\n\nWhat’s the best way to tackle Britain’s poor level of social mobility?\n\n“In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power…are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class.”\n\nThose weren’t the words of the late Tony Benn or Dennis Skinner, but of former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major, that well known scourge of capitalism and tribune of the working class.\n\nElitism in Britain is now so pronounced that the coalition government’s own social mobility commission has compared it to “social engineering” in favour of the rich. Just 7 per cent of Britons are privately educated yet, according to a government report published in August, 33 per cent of MPs, 71 per cent of senior judges and 44 per cent of people on the Sunday Times Rich List went to fee-paying schools. Of the rich countries listed by the OECD, the three in which men’s earnings are most likely to resemble their fathers’ are the UK, Italy and the US – in that order.\n\nWhat’s the first step in righting this wrong and stopping Britain throwing away so much working class talent?\n\nWhat will you offer to working class voters who have abandoned Labour?\n\nIt isn’t only middle class families who ‘aspire’ for something better; working class households do too. Increasingly Labour is failing to connect with this section of the electorate, no doubt in part because it previously took it for granted. The question now is how to reconnect and win it back.\n\nOne of the big issues working class communities face is insecurity – be that economic insecurity or cultural insecurity around the sheer pace of change immigration brings with it.\n\nThat raises two questions: What sort of pro-worker policies should Labour embrace to reconnect with the aspirational working class? And how can free movement of labour benefit communities who currently only see it through the prism of cheap unskilled labour and neighbours who don’t speak English?\n\nMigration is good for British GDP; how then can we ensure that neglected communities see more of the financial and cultural benefits of immigration?\n\nAre property taxes such as the mansion tax really ‘anti-aspirational’?\n\nSince the devastating General Election defeat just over a week ago, there has been a surge of people trying to distance themselves from policies which until recently they appeared to endorse. Listening to most pundits today, Ed Miliband got everything wrong.\n\nA great deal of the criticism levelled at the former Labour leader is that his policies were ‘anti-aspiration’. Labour leadership contenders Tristram Hunt and Andy Burnham have already slammed Miliband’s proposed mansion tax, with the latter calling it – yes, you guessed it – ‘anti-aspiration’.\n\nBut is this really true? House prices in London increased by almost 20 per cent last year. If the value of assets is increasing more rapidly than the value of wages, it’s better to tax the assets, is it not? Those fortunate enough to be beneficiaries of Britain’s crazy house price inflation ought surely to pay their fair share, no?\n\nOn the left we mustn’t be pushed into a corner where we say that the only way to raise revenue is to make bigger and bigger spending cuts. A property millionaire is now created in Britain every seven minutes, mainly in London. A small tax on properties worth over £2 million pounds is a reasonable ask – or better, a rebanding of the council tax rates to make sure those with the most are paying more than their middle class counterparts. Wouldn’t you agree?\n\nJames Bloodworth is the editor of Left Foot Forward.

  "latent_8671": "Beliefs in all-knowing gods that punish wrongdoers helped enable the rise of modern civilizations, a new cross-cultural study suggests.\n\nCooperation among throngs of strangers in expanding societies required a common faith in moralistic gods, say sociocultural anthropologist Benjamin Purzycki of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and his colleagues. To believers, these gods were concerned about good and bad behavior, knew what everyone thought and did, and punished selfish transgressors in a big way.\n\nShared beliefs in punitive gods paved the way for vast trade networks, market economies and institutions of social control, including governments and courts, the scientists propose online February 10 in Nature.\n\n“A large part of the success of human civilizations may have lain in the hands of the gods, whether or not they are real,” writes evolutionary biologist and",
  "latent_8680": "Pictured is Diploscapter pachys (D. pachys), a newly sequenced roundworm that is approximately one-third of a millimeter long and one of a very few known animals that have only a single chromosome. Image courtesy of Karin Kiontke and David Fitch. For the first time, a team of researchers has sequenced a tiny, exclusively asexual species of worm that originated around 18 million years ago.\n\nThis work confirms that this species is among the oldest known living lineages of asexual animals. The research also explains how this worm has evaded the dead end that asexual organisms usually see thanks to the forces of evolution.\n\n\"Scientists have been trying to understand how some animals can survive for millions of years without sex because such strict, long-term abstinence is very rare in the animal world,\" New York University Biology Professor and co-author David Fitch said in a press release.\n\n\"This phenomenon is a significant one in understanding evolutionary genetics because it runs counter to the widely accepted view: that sexual reproduction is required to eliminate deleterious mutations and for adaptation to a changing environment.\"\n\nInheriting copies of both parents' genes is usually a good insurance policy for animals; it prevents the accumulation of mutations that might prove harmful, a process known as complementation.\n\n\"In the long term, producing offspring via intercourse allows for adaptation to changing conditions over time because it produces variation through genetic shuffling, or recombination,\" Fitch explained in the release. \"However, because such shuffling does not occur within asexual species, they tend to go extinct rapidly. So, it has been a longstanding mystery in biology how some asexual animals have survived for so many generations.\"\n\nDiploscapter pachys, the newly sequenced worm, is a small, transparent, asexual, free-living roundworm (also known as a nematode). It is closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, a sexual organism commonly used for biomedical research. The team derived the genealogy of D. pachys using DNA to reveal that it originated approximately 18 million years ago among a group of exclusively asexual species.\n\nShutterstock/18percentgrey\n\nClones built to survive\n\nAs the team investigated how D. pachys reproduces more closely, they discovered that the germ cell-making process had been altered to prevent recombination — something common in many other asexual organisms. \"Basically, the animals were cloning themselves,\" Fitch stated in the release.\n\nFurthermore, the scientists were surprised to learn that D. pachys clones contained only a single pair of chromosomes. Single-chromosome pairs like this one are exceedingly rare in higher organisms; in fact, there are only two other known animal species with a single-chromosome pair. Even very similar species, such as C. elegans, have 5 to 7 chromosomes.\n\nNext, the team sequenced the genome of D. pachys. They aimed to test the structure of the single chromosome, to see whether it arose as other chromosomes were lost, or whether it was actually multiple ancestral chromosomes fused together. They found that D. pachys skips meiosis—the process by which sexual organisms halve their chromosomes and produce gametes—as well as recombination. Instead, the worm fuses the six chromosomes of its ancestor into a single chromosome, maintaining high genetic diversity asexually.\n\n\"Thus, the mystery of its longevity seems largely resolved: D. pachys overcomes the disadvantages of asexual reproduction by maintaining genetic variation, and with it, complementation,\" Fitch explained. \"Ironically, this is accomplished by making sure there is no recombination between the gene copies. If there were, the differences between the gene copies might be lost. In fact, D. pachys has gotten rid of several of the genes required to make the recombination machinery that exists in sexual organisms.\"\n\nStudying these results could help scientists develop a deeper understanding of asexual reproduction, and could have implications on human reproduction in the future. This work may provide insight into how humans could someday create clones that survive for generations, avoiding death and extinction at the species level.",
  "latent_8800": "From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.\n\nThe subject of this article has no official name.\n\nThe name currently in use is a fan designator; see below for more information.\n\nThe fourth generation (Japanese: 第四世代 fourth generation) of Pokémon games is the fourth set of Pokémon games released.\n\nLike Generation II followed from Generation I, Generation IV follows from Generation III, although it is unlike Generation II in that it is not a direct sequel (Hoenn is inaccessible in all Generation IV games). Like previous generations, Generation IV focuses on one main region across three games, the Sinnoh region featured in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum on the Nintendo DS, released in 2006 and 2008 (and 2007 and 2009 outside Japan). Also like Generation II, the Generation IV games retain much compatibility with their Generation III counterparts, though in a different manner, and introduce many new Pokémon which are related to those of the previous three generations.\n\nMuch like Generation III remade the Generation I games, the Generation II games also received much anticipated remakes in the form of HeartGold and SoulSilver, and through details revealed in the five main games, Generation IV is thus known to be contemporaneous with Generation II, occurring three years after Generation I and Generation III. Like all generations, the handheld games are joined by home console games; Pokémon Battle Revolution and My Pokémon Ranch were released for the Wii during this generation.\n\nAdvances in gameplay\n\nMuch like how Generation II enhanced Generation I mostly by building on its features, Generation IV builds on the features introduced in Generation III. The advancements introduced in Generation IV include:\n\nAlterations from Generation III\n\nFurther additions in Platinum\n\nAnother new Battle Frontier, with several different facilities from the one in Hoenn.\n\nThe ability to record battles in the Battle Frontier and with other players and share them over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, through the Vs. Recorder.\n\nThe expansion of the Sinnoh Pokédex, from 151 entries (in Diamond and Pearl) to 210 entries (in Platinum).\n\nFurther additions in HeartGold and SoulSilver\n\nThe re-introduction of the seven Poké Balls made from Apricorns, unavailable since Generation II.\n\nThe first Pokémon in the party can now follow the player outside of battle almost anywhere in the overworld.\n\nInstead of Contests, the Pokéathlon games are used.\n\nAbility to register two key items instead of just one.\n\nThe Pokédex can now show the different forms of Castform and Cherrim, whereas in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, it could not.\n\nThe introduction of Flat Battles, a type of battle in which all Pokémon that are above level 50 temporarily become level 50, regardless of their current level.\n\nA dynamic camera in the overworld, which can be seen when entering some buildings, or going to certain locations. This went on to be greatly expanded in Generation V.\n\nThe stats affected by any given Nature are highlighted on each Pokémon's summary screens, with the increased stat being shown in red text and the decreased stat being shown in blue text.\n\nA redesign of the interface that displays the items in the Bag, to facilitate access to items.\n\nThe menu now appears constantly on the bottom screen. A button is added to the menu allowing players to run without holding the B button.\n\nRegions\n\nSinnoh\n\nSinnoh\n\nMain article: Sinnoh\n\nLike Generation III, Generation IV introduces a new region disconnected from all previous ones, the Sinnoh region, found far north of Kanto and Johto. Since it is so far north, snow can be found on its northern tip, as well as in the mountainous center of the region. Despite the region's northern location a part of Sinnoh has a tropical climate, and overall the climate varies greatly throughout the region. Much of the western half of the region is rural, while its east is comparatively urban. The southern area of Sinnoh is lush and green with big cities and small towns.\n\nSinnoh is said to be the first region to be created in the Pokémon world, and is home to several locations that have certain mythology or history associated with them, both natural and human influenced sites.\n\nStarter Pokémon\n\nThough it was initially rumored that the Grass/Fire/Water setup that had been the norm for the past three generations would be replaced with a Dark/Psychic/Fighting trio, these rumors were later proven false. At the beginning of the journey, players must choose from the Grass-type Turtwig, the Fire-type Chimchar, and the Water-type Piplup to defend themselves from a wild Starly in Diamond and Pearl, or be given one of the three by Professor Rowan directly in Platinum.\n\nGym Leaders\n\nLike most other regions, Sinnoh has its own set of eight Gym Leaders. This set specializes in the same types as Gym Leaders from other regions, though not in the same order. Like always, Badges and TMs are given away once Gym Leaders are defeated.\n\nJohto\n\nJohto\n\nMain article: Johto\n\nMuch like Generation I's version of Kanto was featured a second time in Generation III, Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver caused Johto to be featured a second time in Generation IV.\n\nStarter Pokémon\n\nMuch as Kanto's Generation III starters were the same as in Generation I, Johto's starters have not changed. Professor Elm offers Chikorita, Cyndaquil, or Totodile to the player as protection on an errand to Mr. Pokémon's house on Route 30.\n\nGym Leaders\n\nAs would be expected, Johto's Gym Leaders are the same as before, but many give out different TMs than they gave out in Generation II.\n\nKanto\n\nMain article: Kanto\n\nIn its fourth consecutive appearance, Kanto returns in HeartGold and SoulSilver much in the same way as it did in Generation II (as a post-League area).\n\nGym Leaders\n\nKanto's Gym Leaders are the same as in the original Gold and Silver, changing slightly from the group who were there in Generation I and Generation III. All Kanto Gym Leaders give TMs, unlike in Generation II.\n\nOther Generation IV games\n\nPokémon Battle Revolution features a Pokémon Stadium-like arena for battle, allowing Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver to link to it through wireless communications between the Nintendo DS and Wii, much like previous generations' games would link to Colosseum, XD, Stadium, and Stadium 2. Battle Revolution also features online battles with players around the world via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.\n\nMy Pokémon Ranch lets players of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl deposit their Pokémon, via wireless communication, to a ranch owned by Hayley, who will also bring Pokémon to the ranch. Players can interact with up to 1,000 of their deposited Pokémon. An update for this game enables support for Platinum, as well as allowing storage for 500 more Pokémon, however, it was not released to players outside Japan, while players of HeartGold and SoulSilver cannot connect with the game at all.\n\nGeneration IV also included 3 new Mystery Dungeon games available worldwide and 3 exclusively available in Japan. Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky were available worldwide. The Mystery Dungeon games exclusive to Japan were Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Keep Going! Blazing Adventure Squad!, Let's Go! Stormy Adventure Squad!, and Go For It! Light Adventure Squad!.\n\nPokemon Rumble was introduced in Generation IV.\n\nDiscussion of Generation IV\n\nThe Physical-Special split introduced in Generation IV as well as the introduction of powerful items such as the Choice Scarf, Choice Specs, and Life Orb made competitive battling far more advanced and popular. This was also increased due to the GTS increasing the chance of finding a Pokémon with Pokérus and EV-enhancing items for a specific stat being introduced also made it far easier to EV train a Pokémon, which added another dimension to competitive battling as EV training is no longer as painstaking as it was before. Due to these additions this generation is widely praised by competitive battlers. The GTS also paved the way for the Masuda method through the transaction of foreign Pokémon, and this in addition to the Poké Radar made it far easier to acquire Shiny Pokémon.\n\nAfter Diamond and Pearl, Platinum continued improving the series, adding a new Battle Frontier, as well as introducing many new additions to the games (such as VS sprites and animated battle sprites for certain important NPCs, such as Gym Leaders and Rival). Platinum is also an important part of the series' continuity, as the storyline of the game is referenced in Pokémon Black and White, showing where Generation V is placed on the timeline. The overall generation introduced many characters, some of whom have played notable roles during the following generations. HeartGold and SoulSilver brought older and newer players back to the Johto region with improved graphics and sound and other additions to the storyline and characters.\n\nSinnoh thematic motif\n\nThe theme of this generation is history of the universe, and myths and legends. The three starters' evolutions have references to myths and legends in themselves—for example, Torterra is based on the legend of world turtle, Empoleon has references to the god Poseidon, and Infernape is based on Sun Wukong. This also reflects on its legendary Pokémon, as Arceus is the literal creator of the universe and created the rulers of time, space and anti-matter, who are Dialga, Palkia and Giratina, respectively. All three of them are involved in Sinnoh myths, as are Uxie, Azelf and Mesprit: the embodiments of knowledge, willpower and emotions.\n\nSome standard Pokémon are also connected to myths and legends, such as Drifloon and Drifblim that in folklore are said to take children and people to the Underworld and Spiritomb who is said to be made up of 108 spirits.\n\nSome towns still preserve their history and myths. Celestic Town is said to be present since the beginning of Sinnoh, and has a shrine that dates back to ancient times, as well as a cave painting. Some other examples are the Solaceon Ruins, which contain Unown and is said to be as old as the ruins of Johto; the Snowpoint Temple, which was created long ago to contain Regigigas; Eterna City, which contains a statue of Dialga/Palkia; Floaroma Town, which was said to be a wasteland long ago, but then was transformed into a beautiful landscape by Shaymin; Mt. Coronet; and the Spear Pillar. Canalave City houses the first Pokémon library, which transcribes many of the legends of the region. Sinnoh was meant to establish the origin of the Pokémon universe and be more mysterious and historic than other regions.\n\nEnglish title screens\n\nJapanese title screens\n\nTrivia\n\nEvery player character in all Generation IV games has a Wii in their room, referencing its status as the current Nintendo console during the generation.\n\nGeneration IV is the only generation in which: Two core series game names have the same first initial in English (Pearl and Platinum); other languages, however, have had the same initial in their game names, with Spanish Azul and Amarillo for Blue and Yellow, and German Saphir and Smaragd for Sapphire and Emerald. All three starter Pokémon are able to learn Stealth Rock. All its games were released in the spring in North America, and in the fall in Japan. The final evolution of each starter Pokémon is owned by one Gym Leader or Elite Four member. Gardenia has a Torterra, Flint has an Infernape, and Jasmine in HeartGold and SoulSilver has an Empoleon. None of the TMs from the previous generation had their move changed.\n\nGeneration IV is also the only generation that did not introduce: A Dragon-type specialist.\n\nGeneration IV is the first generation to include: Level 1 Pokémon legitimately obtainable in the core series. Compatibility with both the generation preceding and following it.\n\nGeneration IV is the longest Pokémon generation in Japan, falling only 10 days short of being four years long.\n\nGeneration IV introduced the largest number of evolutions for Pokémon of previous generations, at 29.\n\nGeneration IV features the largest number of playable core series regions, with three.\n\nGeneration IV is the first generation officially released in South Korea by Nintendo's local subsidiary there. Even though the Generation II games Pokémon Gold and Silver were released in South Korea on April 24, 2002, they were a result of Nintendo partnering with Daewon as Nintendo of Korea would not be established until July 7, 2006. [1]\n\nAt 716 days, the time between Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions and Pokémon Platinum Version is the longest gap in-between two main series games in the same generation.\n\nGeneration IV was the last generation to introduce a new HM move.\n\nReferences",
  "latent_9065": "Ever since Megyn Kelly’s departure from Fox News, Tucker Carlson has enjoyed the limelight. His new show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, boasts fantastic ratings. To me, as a philosopher, it’s not surprising to see. Tucker Carlson learned the lesson of history, and he’s following in the footsteps of Socrates.\n\nIn times gone by, it was not journalism students who took on politicians and corruption, but philosophers. Everyone remembers when Ben Rhodes bragged about how easily he lied to these so-called journalists, but it’s laughable to think that he could pull anything over on philosophers. After all, just look at the amount of arrogant people who laugh the same, until they met the philosophers.\n\nWhen you read through the Socratic dialogues you find a recurring theme. An arrogant greek stakes a claim, and Socrates takes aim at their position. Socrates doesn’t take a position beyond agnosticism. He takes the position of the skeptic, and it doesn’t take long watching Tucker Carlson Tonight to see that he is following suit.\n\nTucker Carlson, Lisa Boothe, and a few others seem to be fair, which gives me hope of a true journalism rising from the ashes of the broken media. But this can only happen if more journalists learn from the lessons of history.\n\nIn a world where journalists are willing to sacrifice their integrity to defend a view, I would direct them to look at Bertrand Russell. Russell was asked if he was willing to die for his beliefs. He responded, “Of course not. After all, I may be wrong.”\n\nIt’s easier to remain objective when you do not take a hard position. Journalists who seek to do their job, and report the news ought not to take a strong position. You can hold your own beliefs, as we all do, but you do not need to defend them – Tucker doesn’t.\n\nAs a philosopher, I watch Tucker Carlson for amusement’s sake. I see the same method being applied to the guests. Someone comes on to make a grandiose claim. For Bill Nye it was that climate deniers are psychologically unhinged. With the Washington Post’s Erik Wemple it was Media Bias, and the claims he made in an editorial.\n\nFollowing the lead of the philosophers has made him successful. His success should be a sign to young journalists. Take note, follow the philosophers.\n\nJournalism has become polluted, and many journalists are political operatives, not skeptics questioning everyone, and everything.\n\nJournalists need to learn not to take a position that won’t paint them into a corner. If they don’t take a position, they can’t be proved wrong, only convinced. There is no reason keep taking stands to protect your pride. Their journalistic integrity is preserved. If you bring the same healthy skepticism to all matters, all people, no matter affiliation, you will be a respected journalist. Not only by the left. Not only by the right.\n\nThe politicization of the media is killing America. Journalists have failed, and philosophers have taken notice. I, for one, have paid attention because of the broken political system. I see a ship floating about without an anchor. A baseless statue teetering in the wind. Journalists just parrot the statements of their favorite politicians, there is no accountability. Objective analysis is no longer even hinted at in the reporting. People are becoming politicized and going to the outlet that parrots their desired news.\n\nIf they follow the lead of Tucker Carlson, they will leave the burden of proof on those who make the claims, the politicians. By not taking a position, Carlson makes sure that the focus isn’t on his beliefs, but on the beliefs in question. He can hold everyone accountable for their words.\n\nCarlson followed the philosophers. He followed Socrates. And while he is no Socrates, he is a fantastic model for young students looking to shine in journalism.",
  "latent_9144": "If I were an environmental activist, I would be despairing right around now about ever getting meaningful action on global warming. Over the last eight years, eco-warriors had managed to convince themselves that the main obstacle to their grand designs to recalibrate the Earth's thermostat was a stupid and callow U.S. president unwilling to lead the rest of the world.\n\nBut with Barack Obama in office they no longer have that problem. In fact, they have a charismatic and savvy spokesman who combines a deep commitment to their cause with considerable powers of persuasion. Yet his call to action at last week's G-8 summit in Italy yielded little more than polite applause, and that only when he issued a mea culpa. \"I know that in the past, the United States has sometimes fallen short of meeting our responsibilities,\" he said amid cheers. \"So let me be clear: Those days are over.\"\n\nWhat did this brave self-flagellation yield? To be sure, he got the attendees to collectively declare that they would never ever let the Earth's temperature rise two degrees centigrade from pre-industrial levels. This is supposedly a prelude to the real horse-trading over emissions cuts that will begin in a Copenhagen, Denmark, meeting this December.\n\nBut the depressing thing for climate warriors was that Obama could not get developing countries, without whose cooperation there is simply no way to avert climate change, to accept--even just in theory--the idea of binding emissions cuts. India's prime minister took the occasion to position his country as a major victim of a problem not of its making. \"What we are witnessing today is the consequence [of] over two centuries of industrial activity and high-consumption lifestyles in the developed world,\" he lectured. \"They have to bear this historical responsibility.\" And even before the summit began, China declared the West had \"no right\" to ask it to limit its economic growth.\n\nRather than engage with the issues, eco-pundits are grasping for all kinds of fanciful pseudo-scientific theories to explain why Obama's sweet-talking ways are leaving the rest of the world cold. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, for instance, recently blamed the lack of progress on the faulty circuitry evolution has wired into the human brain. According to Kristof, evolution has programmed us to be alert to immediate threats, such as snakes, or enemies with clubs, but not for vastly greater but less imminent dangers that require forethought. If this sounds like a warmed-over, 21st-century version of the Calvinistic crooked-timber view of human nature, that's because it is.\n\nNot to be outdone, Kristof's Nobel Prize-winning colleague at the Times, Paul Krugman, pulled out the folk story about the frog and the boiling pot in his latest column to explain our collective torpor over climate change. Just as the proverbial frog wasn't able to feel the gradually rising temperature before he boiled to death, so too, in Krugman's telling, human beings are not equipped to comprehend the dangers of an overheating planet before they fry to death.\n\nBut this psychologizing only exposes the inability of climate activists to take seriously the rational case for inaction. In fact, there is a perfectly good reason developing countries are unwilling to act on climate change: What they are being asked to do is more awful than climate change's implications--even if one accepts all the alarmist predictions.\n\nConsider what would be necessary to slash global greenhouse-gas emissions just 50% below 2000 levels by 2050--a far less aggressive goal than what the enviros say is necessary to avert climate catastrophe. According to U.S. Chamber of Commerce calculations, even if the West reduced its emissions by 80% below 2000 levels, developing countries would still have to return their emissions to 2000 levels to meet the 50% target. However, Indians currently consume roughly 15 times less energy per capita than Americans--and Chinese consume seven times less. Asking them, along with the rest of the developing world, to go back to 2000 emission levels with a 2050 population would mean putting them on a very drastic energy diet.\n\nThe human toll of this is unfathomable: It would require these countries to abandon plans to ever conquer poverty, of course. But beyond that it would require a major scaling back of living standards under which their middle classes--for whom three square meals, cars and air-conditioning are only now beginning to come within reach--would have to go back to subsistence living, and the hundreds of millions who are at subsistence would have to accept starvation.\n\nIn short, the choice for developing countries is between mass death due to the consequences of an overheated planet sometime in the distant future, and mass suicide due to imposed instant starvation right now. Is it any surprise that they are reluctant to jump on the global-warming bandwagon?\n\nThe Waxman-Markey climate change bill that just passed the U.S. House of Representatives wants to force developing countries to accept this fate by resorting to the old and tired method of protectionism. Should this monstrosity become law, starting in 2020 the United States will impose carbon tariffs on goods from any country that does not accept binding reductions. But this is a path to mutually assured economic destruction--not to combating climate change.\n\nFor starters, by 2020, when these tariffs go into effect, India and China--with GDPs projected to grow anywhere from 6% to 10% annually--will have much bigger economies with huge domestic markets that they are increasingly opening to each other. Thus they might well be better off forgoing access to the U.S. market than accepting crippling restrictions on their growth.\n\nAlso, by then they will also have more economic clout on the world stage to enforce their own ideas of who ought to take moral responsibility for climate change. The West's case for restricting Indian and Chinese exports rests on the claim that these countries' total emissions will exceed those from the West within the next few decades. (China's emissions are already at par with those of the U.S., the biggest emitter).\n\nBut these countries have, and will continue to have, far lower emissions on a per-capita basis, given that China's are now around one-fifth those of the United States and India's one-twentieth. Thus they would have an equally valid case for imposing countervailing restrictions on American exports based on per-capita emissions. The West might well be the bigger loser in this economic warfare if it is barred from accessing new, growing markets.\n\nObama obviously understands this--which is why he has condemned the House's turn down the protectionist path. So what should climate warriors do? Right now the only certain way to save lives is by calling off this misguided war on climate change. If and when climate change promises to claim more casualties than poverty and starvation, the world will begin heeding their calls. If, however, these climate-change casualties don't materialize, there would have been no need to act in the first place.

In that appearance, he reportedly developed memory problems and was suddenly unable to recall how involved the White House was in crafting his statement.\n\nIn his testimony, Trump Jr. offered another explanation for why he was trawling around Russian operatives, claiming now that he wanted to learn about Clinton’s “fitness” for the presidency.\n\nHis prepared statement also acknowledged that he intended to speak to his lawyers after the meeting to figure out how he could have used the information he was being promised by the Russians.\n\nAs The New York Times noted, the concession “suggests that he knew, or at least suspected, that accepting potentially damaging information about a rival campaign from a foreign country raised thorny legal issues.”\n\nThe special counsel investigation has now reached the highest level of the government, with incriminating evidence about Trump’s behavior and that of his inner circle continuing to mount.",

The meeting was called by Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori in an effort to force urbanisation onto the national agenda via the so-called « C21 » group, gathering the mayors of Finland’s largest 21 cities for a working dinner on Thursday.\n\n« The government is making the biggest reforms in history, in which the biggest cities’ viewpoint is not visible at all, » Vapaavuori said on Tuesday.\n\nEvery city with over 50,000 inhabitants on hand\n\nVapaavuori says that city-level growth is a megatrend in the world, and accuses the Centre Party-led government of refusing to understand the significance of urban growth as the primary motor of regional development.\n\nThe C21 statement says that the planned regional governments should operate under a « subsidiary principle » that keeps decision-making as close to the voter as possible. Specifically, the cities are demanding that they be allowed to maintain control over local employment and business development services, referred to as « growth services » in the legal reform.\n\nThe Mayor of the northwestern coastal city of Oulu, Päivi Laajala says each of the 21 cities represented at the meeting was on board.\n\n« When this many cities reach a unanimous decision, the significance of what is being said is enormous, » she says. « We are of the collective opinion that the Ministry of Employment and the Economy’s draft should be changed so cities can keep their mandate to arrange growth services to the cities. »\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nResisting more government oversight\n\nSouthwest Turku’s Mayor Aleksi Randell agrees.\n\n« These services are the heart of growth and competitiveness. We wouldn’t have called attention to it unless we felt that things were heading in the wrong direction, » he says..\n\nPäivi Laajala says the Ministry needs to slow down and stop trying to rush the reform through. She says the disputed growth services statute was not sent round for a comprehensive comment round before it was announced, for example.\n\nTampere’s Mayor Lauri Lyly said fact that all 21 of Finland’s largest cities agreed that the draft was wrong surprised him.\n\n« Cities want to keep the administration of factors that influence economic growth in their own hands. Tonight’s consensus makes it clear that we find the idea of a regional ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution unacceptable, » Lyly says.\n\nThis story is posted on Independent Barents Observer as part of Eye on the Arctic, a collaborative partnership between public and private circumpolar media organizations.",

Four of his other brothers were but escaped unharmed.\n\nAhmad Wali Karzai, a controversial but key figure in Nato's battle against the Taliban, was killed by his bodyguard.\n\nPresident Karzai flew into Kandahar for his brother's funeral on Wednesday, but left the city before Thursday's service.\n\nNo group has so far admitted carrying out the mosque attack.\n\nThe governor of Kandahar province, Toryalai Wesa, said 15 people were injured.\n\nAnother explosion later hit the Herat Bazaar in the centre of Kandahar, killing one person and injuring several others, said the city's police chief.\n\nChaos and panic\n\nThe explosion in the Red Mosque took place just after noon (0730 GMT) in the southern Afghan city, as the service for Ahmad Wali Karzai was coming to an end.\n\nAt the scene Herat Bazaar is in the heart of Kandahar. Several shopkeepers said as soon as the bomb there went off, they closed their shops. Attacks in recent weeks have affected business, they said. One trader said he used to export a great deal of dried fruit but the Pakistani and Indian buyers were no longer visiting. As soon it gets dark, shops close and people go home. Locals say property prices have plummeted in Kandahar. One merchant said a plot in the upscale township of Ayno Meena cost $300,000 (£186,000) not long ago, but was now available for $250,000. The township, which is home to senior government officials, merchants and wealthy Afghans, has seen several explosions recently. Some residents suggested that criminals, rival gangs and private feuds were behind the violence, not the Taliban. The security situation remains fragile in Kandahar city.\n\nOfficials say the attacker was stopped at the mosque's entrance, where he blew himself up.\n\nWitnesses, including President Karzai's spokesman Waheed Omer, said he had hidden the explosives in his turban. Provincial intelligence chief Gen Mohammad Naeem Momin told the Associated Press that early investigations supported the reports.\n\nThe BBC's Bilal Sarwary in Kandahar said that security was not as tight as it could have been around the mosque.\n\nTradition dictates that mourners are not searched when attending memorials, says our correspondent, and several tribal elders told him they had not been searched.\n\nThe interior ministry and medical sources said four people and the bomber had been killed.\n\nAmong those killed was Hikmatullah Hikmat, the head of Kandahar's Ulema Council, said the ministry. The council is an influential body of clerics in charge of regulating religious issues in the province.\n\nThe ministry said a child was also among the dead.\n\n\"There was a prayer going on and after that prayer, the man came close to the director of the religious council and exploded,\" said Kandahar Governor Wesa.\n\nOfficials say the casualty figures could have been much higher had the attacker been able to get inside the mosque itself, says our correspondent.\n\nFour of President Karzai's brothers, several other Karzai family members and Mr Wesa were in the mosque at the time. None were believed to have been hurt.\n\nAppeal to Taliban\n\nAhmad Wali Karzai was shot twice by his family friend and long-time head of security, Sardar Mohammad, on Tuesday. The bodyguard was himself killed almost immediately.\n\nThe Taliban said the attack was one of their top achievements in 10 years of war. However, correspondents say the bodyguard's motives remain unclear and it seems unlikely that someone so close to the Karzai family was working for the insurgents.\n\nAhmad Wali Karzai was seen by many as a key anti-Taliban figure, someone who stood up to them, using his private army and vast network to fight the insurgents, our correspondent says.\n\nBut he adds that his critics accused him of undermining the central government in Kabul.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Security was tight during Wednesday's funeral\n\nOn Wednesday, President Karzai wept at the graveside, and kissed his dead half-brother's face as senior politicians looked on.\n\nThe president then appealed to the militants to stop the bloodshed.\n\n\"My message for the Taliban is, my countryman, my brother, stop killing your own people,\" said Mr Karzai. \"It's easy to kill and everyone can do it, but the real man is the one who can save people's lives.\"\n\nTuesday's killing was the latest and most high-profile in a series of assassinations of senior politicians and security commanders across the country.",

AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, on Thursday repeatedly dodged questions about President Donald Trump's threat to shut down the government over funding for his proposed wall along the US-Mexico border.\n\nThough Trump often promised during the campaign that Mexico would pay for a wall, he has since turned his attention to the Republican-controlled Congress to fund the project, which Senate Democrats contend would cost $70 billion to build and $150 million a year to maintain.\n\nAt a rally in Arizona on Tuesday, Trump said, \"If we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.\"\n\nDuring her first press conference in three weeks, Sanders refused to answer four questions about whether Trump would refuse to sign a bill funding the federal government if money for a border wall were not included.\n\n\"The president promised over and over again during the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall,\" ABC News' Jon Karl said. \"Why is he now threatening a government shutdown if Congress won't pay for it?\"\n\nSanders was unclear in her response.\n\n\"The president is committed to making sure this gets done,\" she said. \"We know that the wall and other security measures at the border work, we've seen that take place over the last decade, and we're committed to making sure the American people are protected.\"\n\nSanders praised job-creation statistics when American Urban Radio Networks' April Ryan asked how the administration felt about the possibility that federal workers would go without paychecks if the government shut down. Sanders dodged another question when pressed on the subject again.\n\n\"How is that not a concession from this White House that Mexico isn't actually going to pay for this wall and American taxpayers will?\" ABC News' Cecilia Vega asked minutes later.\n\nSanders responded: \"This is something the president's committed to — he's committed to protecting American lives, and doing that through the border wall is something that's important. It's a priority, and we're moving forward with it.\"\n\n\"But he's not saying that Mexico is going to pay for it,\" Vega said.\n\n\"He hasn't said they're not either,\" Sanders replied.

I think we've had enough outbursts in the past.\"\n\nWhen Congress reconvenes in September, it must pass a funding bill by the end of the month to avoid a shutdown. Many Republican leaders, like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said that avoiding a government shutdown is a top priority.\n\nA bill to continue to fund the government would require 60 votes in the Senate to pass; Republicans hold 52 seats, and Democrats have said they would universally oppose a bill with funding for Trump's proposed wall.",

  "latent_10016": "This content was published on September 28, 2016 12:01 AM\n\n3D printing at FabLab, a Lucerne-based innovation hub (Gaetan bally / KEYSTONE)\n\nSwitzerland has been judged as the most competitive economy on the planet for the eighth year in a row by World Economic Forum (WEF) researchers. However, the alpine country might find its pole position tested if it introduces strict immigration quotas, the annual report concludes.\n\nSwitzerland achieved its highest score of 5.8 out of 7 in the WEF Global Competitivenessexternal link Report 2016/2017. It achieved top marks in four of the 11 criteria: labour market efficiency, business sophistication, innovation and technological readiness.\n\nIts weaknesses are perceived to be deepening deflation, low levels of women participating in the workforce and the amount of red tape holding back the creation of new companies.\n\n“Switzerland arguably possesses one of the world’s most fertile innovation ecosystems,” the report states. It adds that Swiss companies have “an unmatched capacity to attract the best talent and large multinationals”.\n\nIt is in this area that WEF rings alarm bells for the future. Early next year Swiss legislators must decide how to implement a 2014 people’s initiative that calls for curbs on immigration. The political debate has already soured Swiss-European Union relations and could damage its competitiveness if not handled correctly, the report warns.\n\n“If Switzerland adopts strict quotas then this could be very bad for its competitiveness,” one of the report’s authors, Thierry Geiger, told swissinfo.ch.\n\nThe political hot potato “may well have a bearing on [Switzerland’s] ability to attract and retain talent”, it states. WEF founder Klaus Schwab is also concerned about a global trend towards protectionism. “Declining openness in the global economy is harming competitiveness,” he said.\n\nMichael Hengartner, the rector of the University of Zurich who is also the head of the umbrella organisation swissuniversities, said the immigration issue is harming Swiss scientific research.\n\nThe number of Swiss researchers involved in the Horizon 2020 European research programme had dropped by half since the 2014 initiative vote, he told the Schweiz am Sonntag newspaper.\n\n“We are taking on ten times fewer leadership positions in European research programmes than before,” Hengartner added. “Good researchers are not coming to Switzerland because they can’t be guaranteed enough security for their project financing and don't know what the future holds.”\n\nIn addition, Swiss policy makers are grappling with the details of a new corporate tax code with the dual aim of ending harmful tax practices while retaining multinational firms in Switzerland.\n\n“Some companies may already be thinking twice about locating to Switzerland. This is worrying when you think about long term investment prospects,” said Geiger.\n\nBut for the moment at least, Switzerland continues to attract high marks in economic competitiveness. Earlier this year, it climbed two places to second in the IMD business school’s annual survey.\n\n“Switzerland’s consistency in performance is quite remarkable,” Geiger added. “The country’s capacity for innovation permeates different areas, such as education and the regulatory environment. Each pillar reinforces the other.” A recent Reuters rankingexternal link stated that Switzerland had the most top 100 innovative universities per capita.\n\nIn the WEF report, Switzerland holds top spot, ahead of Singapore and the United States.

  "latent_10187": "By Christy Strawser\n\nDETROIT (CBS Detroit) Jim Caldwell blamed the media for negativity after another abysmal start to the season led to numerous editorials and public comments calling for the Lions to be sold away from the Ford family.\n\nIt’s so bad that conflicted fans filled message boards on trade deadline day yesterday, begging the team to let go of Calvin Johnson so Megratron can get what he deserves on a team capable of achieving it — a Super Bowl ring.\n\nPiling on, some fans are so frustrated there are a couple of go fund me accounts from folks trying to raise money to buy the team.\n\nThe Ford family, which has owned the team since William Clay Ford Sr. bought controlling interest in 1963, is taking a rash of blame for decades of crushing fans with lackluster seasons.\n\nCurrent owner Martha Ford is 90 years old and the family has given no indication of their plans of succession. Is any family member interested in keeping the Lions? Who would rise to the management forefront? Or will they sell?\n\nWWJ’s Jeff Lesson, who grew up with flashy Detroit billionaire and Midtown reviver Dan Gilbert, thinks he has the answer. If the family ever decided to sell, they should sell it to Gilbert.\n\n“It has been his lifelong dream to own the struggling franchise and turn it around,” Lesson said live on WWJ Wednesday morning, adding “There could not be a better choice.”\n\nHe said he knows “for a fact” Gilbert really wants to own the Lions.\n\nIf true, and if the Lions ever came on the market, he would have to make some serious decisions. The NFL has stringent owner requirements, disallowing owners from having a major stake in any other team, even in another sport. NFL owner rules are fairly complicated and say an owner can own teams in other sports only if those teams are in the same city as the NFL franchise they own or in a city where there is no NFL team.\n\nNotably, Gilbert made headlines last week for his Cavaliers’ payroll, spending enormous sums to lock up top players. Per ESPN, since the end of last season, the Cavs have spent nearly $300 million in new contracts, including $113 million to Kevin Love, $82 million to Tristan Thompson and $47 million to LeBron James.\n\nGilbert’s payroll is $175.6 million this season, the second-highest in league history.\n\n“We’re committed; we’re all-in … When you invest in something like a sports franchise and you’re in for so much … if you at the margins start pulling back, I think that may be foolish on a lot of fronts,” Gilbert said to ESPN before the Cavs beat the Miami Heat 102-92. “We’re investing for the future as well as the current.”\n\nWhat would spending like that do the Lions? Fans can only guess.\n\nMany estimate if the Lions ever went on the market, they would sell for more than $1 billion. The most recent major sports team to change owners was the Clippers, which went for $2 billion in a sale to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.\n\nDetroit booster Gilbert’s net worth is estimated at $4.5 billion.",
  "latent_10189": "Ever wonder how your Jeep's axles rank against the rest of the axlehousing world? Wonder no more. Here's how we rank 'em from the geeky weaklings to the all-star axle jocks. Of course, you'll find a few axles missing from the list. Many axles don't make good swaps, are not readily available, or they just have no aftermarket support to speak of.\n\nWhen compiling the list, we took the strength of the entire axle assembly in stock form into consideration. This included the gears, housings, axleshafts, and so on. Of course, there are multiple versions of many of these axles. Some are significantly weaker than their newer counterparts, and we've made notes where we could. We also threw in some tips on what to watch out for and keep in mind, whether you're looking to make a swap to something bigger or keep what ya got. To identify what axle came in your Jeep, check out \"Axle Axtravaganza\" in the May '07 issue.\n\nFront Axles (weakest to strongest)\n\n19. Dana 25\n\nIt shares similar closed-knuckle parts with the Dana 27 and 44. It has several weak points when overtired and overpowered, including axletubes, differential gears, shafts, and steering joints.\n\n18. Dana 27\n\nSee Dana 25-also has a marginally larger ring gear.\n\n16. Low-pinion Dana 30\n\nThe shafts and small 260-sized U-joints are its weakest parts. Also has weak axletubes. However, it has lots of aftermarket support.\n\n17. Closed-Knuckle Dana 44 (FSJ)\n\nSee Dana 25-same smallish, coarse spline outer shafts and dinky U-joints like the 25 and 27. The '71-and-later inner shafts are large 30-spline parts. The '71-and-earlier axles have weaker 19-spline shafts.\n\n15. Toyota 8-inch\n\nA stout axle for its compact size. Aftermarket Birfields can beef it up. It can actually make for an OK Jeep swap, but it's often frowned upon for being an import axle.\n\n14. High-Pinion Dana 30\n\nIt's one of our favorites when found without the axle-disconnect system. Early versions can be converted to larger U-joints with factory and aftermarket parts. Air time will bend the tubes. This axle has lots of aftermarket support.\n\n13. '06-and-earlier Rubicon Dana 44\n\nSame outer ends, steering U-joints, and axletubes as Wrangler Dana 30. The only real gain in strength is in the gears and inner axleshafts (larger diameter and more splines). It has lots of aftermarket support but limited available ratios if you're using the stock Rubicon differentials.\n\n12. Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nThey're getting harder to find, but they're still usable for a Jeep (albeit an expensive oddball possibility). It's not a popular swap or one that makes sense unless you have the axles already. Even then, you may be better off selling them.\n\n11. Chevy 10-bolt\n\nIt's marginally weaker than a GM or FSJ open-knuckle Dana 44. They have slightly smaller 28-spline shafts and thinner axletubes. However, almost all the 10-bolt knuckle components and stub shafts interchange with the open-knuckle Dana 44. It's a usable full-width axle, but we'd prefer a Dana 44.\n\n10. Low-pinion Dana 44 (FSJ, GM, Ford, and Dodge)\n\nPerhaps the most swapped-in axle in history. Both left- and right-side pinion versions are common and lots of parts interchange between different 4x4s that used some version of the Dana 44. It has a good cost-to-strength ratio and can be easily upgraded in many areas because it has plenty of aftermarket support.\n\n9. High-pinion Dana 44\n\nOnly found in some Ford 4x4s. It's a little rare, but the ring-and-pinion are slightly stronger than the low-pinion 44 gears when used in a front application. There are fewer ratios available than what can be had for a low-pinion version. It's a decent swap for a full-width axle with a driver-side pinion.\n\n8. '07-and-later high-pinion Rubicon Dana 44\n\nIt features stronger tubes than the 44 axles in the previous model TJ Wrangler. It's sure to see plenty of aftermarket support, including complete assemblies available from Mopar.\n\n7. Low-pinion Dana 60 (M-715)\n\nIt has weak stub shafts and weak axletubes. Also has huge, nearly unusable brake drums. It's not a popular or a particularly good swap.\n\n6. Low-pinion Dana 70 (International and Dodge)\n\nRare. Not all that desirable.\n\n5. Dana 50\n\nFord Super Duty full-width ball-joint style solid axle. Kind of an underdog. It's possibly a good swap for Jeeps that need a driver-side differential. It has a decent amount of aftermarket support.\n\n4. Low-pinion Dana 60\n\nIt's a kingpin-style, full-width axle commonly found in GM and early Dodge 1-tons. They're normally way overpriced in today's used axle market. However, the 60 has unbelievable aftermarket support. You can build a complete axle using all aftermarket components. There is also a newer ball-joint Dodge version, which is slightly weaker.\n\n3. High-Pinion Dana 60\n\nIt can only be found in Fords in two versions. There is an older kingpin design and the newer Ford Super Duty ball-joint version. The kingpin style is typically considered stronger and more desirable. It's also more difficult to find and more expensive. Like the low-pinion version, this 60 has unbelievable aftermarket support. You can build a complete axle using all aftermarket components.\n\n2. Rockwell 2 1/2-ton\n\nThe later-model axles with Spicer-style U-joint shafts are most desirable. The 2 1/2-ton has unbelievable gear, steering joint, and housing strength. The coarse spline shafts, particularly the stub shafts, are weak when compared with the rest of the assembly. There is lots of aftermarket support to adapt and strengthen this axle, but only one gear ratio: 6.72:1. The large and heavy drum brakes are not all that usable for a Jeep, especially if mud and water are in the plans. Due to overall size, gearing, width, and weight, it's not a good axle for tires less than 44 inches tall.\n\n1. High-pinion Dana 70 (new GM version)\n\nIt's still a little rare, but can be found on newer GM medium-duty 4x4 trucks. Very few ratios are available, and there are virtually no aftermarket parts for it even though it's likely the strongest usable front axle for a Jeep swap with tires up to and more than 44 inches in diameter.\n\nFord 9-inch\n\nRear Axles (weakest to strongest)\n\n27. Dana 25\n\nIt has several weak points when overtired and overpowered, including the axletubes, differential gears, and two-piece axleshafts.\n\n26. Dana 35\n\nIt has a very weak and flexible housing that causes C-clip axle and differential problems. Unfortunately, it has unbelievable aftermarket support despite its weakness. However, consider any upgrades to this axle a Band-Aid for the real problem. If you're running it hard (especially with a locker) and it hasn't spit out its insides and it's not bleeding gear oil out of the pressed-in tubes and plug welds, it soon will be.\n\n25. Low-pinion Dana 30(Mexico CJ)\n\nIt's a rare pile, but it's out there. It has weak tubes, a smallish ring gear, and two-piece axleshafts.\n\n24. AMC 20 (CJ)\n\nThe AMC 20 is marginal in a stock application. It has a very weak and flexible housing that can lead to other problems. The two-piece axleshafts are notoriously fail-prone. Much like the Dana 35, this axle is best swapped out if you are planning to spend money on it or run larger-than-stock tires.\n\n23. Chevy 10-bolt\n\nMuch like the Dana 35, it has a very weak and flexible housing that can lead to other problems. An abused Gov-loc is a death warrant for the 10-bolt rearend. It's not a swap-worthy, full-width axle for Jeeps.\n\n22. '06-and-earlier Wrangler Dana 44\n\nThe smallish axletubes (same as Dana 35) can flex and cause carrier bearing and other failures if abused. It has lots of aftermarket support but limited available ratios if you are using the stock Rubicon differential.\n\n21. GM 12-bolt\n\nSimilar to the GM 10-bolt. It has a flexible housing and weak tubes for a full-width axle. It's not really a good 4x4 axle worth swapping into a Jeep.\n\n20. Toyota 8-inch\n\nOverall, it's a stout axle for its compact size. It actually makes an OK Jeep swap, but is often frowned upon for being an import part. The Toyota 8-inch has lots of aftermarket support.\n\n19. Alum Dana 44 (ZJ)\n\nIt's a decent, relatively durable axle, but there isn't much aftermarket support because it's fairly uncommon.\n\n18. Chrysler 8.25\n\nIt's a decent axle when mated with moderate-sized tires, however, few gear ratios are available. It doesn't have much aftermarket support.\n\n17. Ford 8.8 (Ranger and Explorer)\n\nSome versions have weaker 28-spline shafts. The '91-'01 Explorer 31-spline version is preferred ('95-and-later have disc brakes). There's a lot of aftermarket support for the 8.8, but the C-clip shafts are a notable weakness. Commonly swapped into Wranglers in place of the Dana 35, although the marginal gain in strength hardly seems worth the effort.\n\n16. Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nThey're getting harder to find, but they're still usable for a Jeep in need of an offset rearend, albeit an expensive oddball possibility with C-clips. An offset Dana 44 from a Quadra-Trac FSJ would be a better option.\n\n15. Ford 8.8 (fullsize version)\n\nAll have 31-spline shafts and undesirable C-clips retaining the axles. Not a particularly good full-width axle for a Jeep swap.\n\n14. Dana 44 (non-Wrangler)\n\nMuch like the Dana 44 front axle, the 44 rearend enjoys a lot of aftermarket support in the form of optional ratios, floater kits, and aftermarket differentials for more traction. Some early models are plagued with small bend-prone axletubes, weak coarse-spline shafts (as well as two-piece shafts), and coarse-spline pinions. Early '70-and-later Dana 44 rears are much more desirable. Look for 2 3/4-inch axletubes and 30-spline, one-piece shafts.\n\n13. AMC 20 (FSJ)\n\nThe FSJ AMC 20 is stronger than the CJ version and perhaps about equal to the strength of a newer Dana 44. However, it doesn't enjoy as much aftermarket support as the Dana. Fewer gear ratios and lockers are available.\n\n12. '07-and-later Wrangler (Rubicon only) Dana 44\n\nIt features stronger tubes than the axles in the previous model Wrangler and 32-spline shafts. It's sure to see plenty of aftermarket support, including complete assemblies available from Mopar.\n\n11. Chrysler 9.25\n\nIt's only found in Dodge trucks and vans. Even though it's relatively strong, it's not all that great of a swap for a full-width axle. Very few ratios and aftermarket differentials are available for the 9.25. It's also a C-clip axle.\n\n10. Ford 9-inch\n\nIt's the king of aftermarket components. The 9-inch came in Ford cars and trucks and can be found in many configurations, lug patterns, and widths; junkyard versions are becoming more difficult to find. Look for the stronger 31-spline versions over the weaker 28-spline. Most axles can be converted to stronger 31-, 33-, 35-, and even 40-spline shafts with bolt-on parts. Plenty of differentials are available and gear ratios ranging from 2.80:1 to 6.50:1 are easy to find. Complete aftermarket housings and entire assemblies are available.\n\n9. Full-floating, 30-spline Dana 60\n\nThese are extremely common and can be easily found in junkyards under Dodges, Fords, GMs, and Jeeps alike. They are most often found under 3/4-ton vans and pickups, but a few came under Mopar musclecars. There is a lot of aftermarket support for the Dana 60.\n\n8. Semifloating Dana 60\n\nIt's a little rare, but it can be found under early F-150s and early-'70s FSJ pickups. It features desirable 35-spline shafts and uses common Dana 60 gears and carriers, so a lot of aftermarket ratios and differentials are available.\n\n7. Full-floating Ford 10.25\n\nThe ring gear is huge, but aftermarket support is not. The gear ratios and differential selection is limited. Heavy use will also cause the axletubes to break free and rotate inside the centersection. Not a great full-width swap.\n\n6. Full-floating 35-spline Dana 60\n\nThey enjoy plenty of aftermarket support because they use common Dana 60 gears and carriers. However, they're very uncommon, and you're not likely to find one in a wrecking yard. Many 35-spline 60 rear axles have been converted from 30-spline housings.\n\n5. Rockwell 2 1/2-ton\n\nRockwell rear axles are often two to three times less expensive than their frontend counterparts. The housing, gears, carrier, and bearings are extremely durable. The 16-spline axleshafts are not. Aftermarket shafts are available to bring it above Dana 80 strength. Only one gear ratio and few lockers are available. Due to size, 6.72:1 gearing, and weight, it's not a good axle for tires less than 44 inches tall.\n\n4. Full-Floating GM 14-bolt\n\nThe 14-bolt is the king of cheap beef when running tires up to and more than 44 inches tall. You can't deny the strength of the 10 1/2-inch ring gear, huge 30-spline pinion, and 1 1/2-inch, 30-spline axleshafts. It also enjoys a decent number of aftermarket gear ratios and differentials. The fact that it has a removable pinion support and spanner adjustable backlash makes 14-bolt gear and differential swaps relatively easy. It can be found in GM 3/4- and 1-ton trucks and vans in a few different widths. It's often found in wrecking yards for less than $200 because it's so common. Perhaps its only real weakness is the thin tinfoil-like diff cover.\n\n3. Full-floating Dana 70\n\nThe Dana 70 is another member of the cheap beef squad. However, there are several versions making them more difficult to identify. Look for the Dana 70U or 70HD. These feature desirable 1 1/2-inch, 35-spline shafts. There are also plenty of ratios and a good number of aftermarket differentials available for these versions of the 70 as well. They are often found in 1-ton Dodge, Ford, and GM trucks, vans, and even some tractors and heavy equipment.\n\n2. Full-floating Dana 80\n\nThis is the step into medium-duty truck axles. The Dana 80 is more axle than most people will ever need. There are plenty of ratios available that range from 3.31:1 to 5.38:1 and a good number of aftermarket differentials.\n\n1. Full-floating Dana 135\n\nThe Dana 135 is found in some Ford F-550 medium-duty trucks and motorhomes. It features a removable third member like a Toyota or Ford 9-inch. However, its size is more on par with an 18-wheeler rear axle. The massive size and heavy-duty design make it undesirable for all but the biggest-tired Jeep swaps.\n\nWhat is your Jeep's designation?\n\nCJ: '46-'86\n\nDJ: '56-and-up Postals\n\nFC: '56-'65 Forward Control\n\nKJ: '01-and-up Liberty\n\nLJ: Wrangler Unlimited\n\nMJ: '86-'92 Comanche\n\nSJ: FSJs, or fullsize Jeeps, like Wagoneer, Gladiator, and M-715\n\nTJ: '97-and-up Wranglers\n\nVJ: '48-'50 Jeepster\n\nWJ: '99-'04 Grand Cherokee\n\nWK: '05 Grand Cherokee\n\nXJ: '84-'01 Cherokee\n\nYJ: '87-'96 Wrangler\n\nZJ: '93-'98 Grand Cherokee",
  "latent_10317": "In 2014, the federal government confiscated some $4.5 billion from Americans through civil asset forfeiture, according to a recent report from the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law and research organization.\n\nThat’s a figure which has been growing rapidly in recent years—as recently as 2008 it was “just” $1.5 billion, and there’s compelling evidence that law enforcement agencies use this license to bolster their budgets in lean years.\n\nIn the words of one officer, civil asset forfeiture funds are “kind of like pennies from heaven. It gets you a toy or something that you need is the way that we typically look at it to be perfectly honest.”\n\nThat $4.5 billion figure is shocking on its own.\n\nBut it’s even more shocking when you put it in this perspective: in that same year, FBI records show burglars took only $3.9 billion from Americans.\n\nSo in 2014, the federal government took more money and stuff from Americans than actual burglars did.\n\nOur government is “getting really good at separating the citizen from their property — not just really good, criminally good.”\n\nThis comparison is even more appalling when you consider that many people whose money or stuff is taken through civil asset forfeiture are never charged or convicted with any crime.\n\nThat’s because it essentially allows a police officer who finds you “suspicious” to just take your stuff.\n\nOnce your property has been confiscated, the burden of proof is on you, not the police, to show that you didn’t get it from any criminal activity. Even if you personally are cleared of all charges, that may not matter. As the Philadelphia City Paper reports, “Technically, it’s the property—not its owner—that’s being accused of criminality, which means the property can be subject to forfeiture whether or not its owner is ever convicted of a crime.”\n\nIn other words, they don’t have to charge you. They don’t have to present any evidence of illegal activity. In fact, you have no right to a lawyer and won’t get a day in court. In some jurisdictions, you actually have to pay thousands of dollars just to be able to contest the seizure.\n\nAnd guess what? The police conveniently happen to consider large amounts of cash very suspicious indeed—but not too suspicious to dump it right into their own department coffers.\n\nRead more about civil asset forfeiture here, and click here to learn how it functions in your state.",
  "latent_10338": "If you follow the NFL's unofficial explanation, Wes Welker wasn't a defenseless receiver during the key fourth quarter interception that saw Welker receive a brutal, blindside hit by Seahawks safety Earl Thomas. But he wasn't NOT a defenseless receiver, either.\n\nVia PFT -\n\nPer a league source, it was the right interpretation of the current rules. Because Welker had not just made a catch, he did not fall within the \"defenseless player\" definition. Likewise, because the interception had not clearly been completed, Welker did not enjoy the protections against a blind-side block. The league nevertheless will study this specific situation in the offseason for a potential tweak to the rules that would give a receiver in that circumstance protection against the hit he absorbed in that specific situation. For now, the hit landed in a gray area that allowed Thomas to avoid a flag and a fine. In the future, that could change.\n\nTo me, this doesn't make sense. The second explanation refutes and contradicts the first.\n\nIf, as the league source says, the \"interception had not clearly been completed,\" then that is still a live pass, and possession has not yet been determined. That makes Welker still a player \"attempting\" to complete a pass, which falls under the qualifying characteristics of a \"defenseless\" player, per the league rules.\n\nIndeed, the above GIF clearly displays these two necessary criteria for a defenseless player personal foul:\n\nKam Chancellor had not yet established possession at the time of the Welker hit (only one foot on the ground). Welker is struck in the head by Thomas.\n\nFurthermore, since the foul occurred before Chancellor completed the interception, the Broncos should have retained the ball following a 15-yard penalty.\n\nThat's my interpretation, anyway. Yours may differ.\n\nWe have emailed the Broncos and the NFL for comment. The Broncos declined; the NFL responded to our initial email but has not yet provided comment. We'll see what they say, but I think the above GIF shows the most clear picture yet that the Broncos deserved to keep possession.\n\nDoes that mean the Broncos deserved to win? Maybe. Probably not. In my opinion, the Seahawks played better. But it amplifies my excitement for a potential re-rematch in February.",
  "latent_10365": "May 28, 2004 Highway 12 Nebraska Supercell\n\nSPC archive data for this day: http://www.spc.ncep.noaa.gov/exper/archive/event.php?date=20040528\n\nWhat a storm this turned into! Steve Peterson and I chased this storm from initiation near Spencer NE to Sioux City. I almost did not chase this day as it didn't look like a real great setup. There was nice directional shear but it wasn't very strong. Moisture was also not very deep. I must thank Steve for encouraging me to chase this day.\n\nThe following images are what one would miss, sitting out a close to home chase day because it didn't look worth the drive.\n\nAfter some work it started to crank...and boy did it crank. It now had raging inflow. My eyes were quickly full of dirt. It had 40mph sustained inflow winds at this point. Steve had moved east a bit and phones me asking if I had done so yet, to see the structure. I said no I was still close to it. He suggests I move east and take a look at it. I moved east, saw this and got a whole lot more excited about the day's prospects. That is one of the coolest scenes I've seen chasing. I was about to see a lot more.\n\nThe storm was now sucking inflow very hard and going into simply crazy structures. I've never seen anything like this. Look how smooth the cloud base is away from the center. The speed of the inflow into that base had to be incredible. The powerlines were screaming overhead during this(from the wind through them).\n\nCheck out the downdraft of rain! Look how sharp that cutoff is, on the south side. You could almost jump in and out of the core. I don't get how anyone could drive under this and not feel the need to pull over and watch.\n\nSince it was obviously a structure only storm(no real chance at tornadoing) we made sure to keep some distance east for the best viewing. This band/arm swings on around and feeds back west into the storm. The storm is now a big coil and managing a sculpted lowering. I thought it might briefly have a chance to produce as that lowering was wrapping way back in there.\n\nIndependence Day II, here we come.\n\nWe jump east yet again. I forget where we are right here.\n\nI think we move again and stop here. The winds were even stronger now, ripping west into the storm.\n\nLooking west as the sun gets lower under the supercell.\n\nWe are now getting closer to Sioux City and it keeps changing into something even more crazier than it was before.\n\nThis was a permanent look to the thing, a huge donut. This is one of my favorite shots.\n\nI wonder what the folks in Sioux City were thinking at this point. The sirens were blaring and this guy in a truck pulls up and says, \"You better seek shelter.\" I replied, \"It'll be ok.\" I should have driven west into it real quick to see what was happening with the wind and hail.\n\nI jump ahead of it here and head down I-29 for home as it got increasingly linear and weaker. What a chase day.",
  "latent_10433": "Although Amazon's Kindle e-reader has become the first major hit in its category – and the best-selling product in Amazon's entire store this year – it does have its drawbacks. One of the biggest is that its wireless connection to the Kindle store works only in the U.S.\n\nThat changes on October 19, when Amazon begins shipping a new version of the Kindle that can be used to purchase and download books in over 100 countries. The new version, with the snappy name of \"Kindle with US and International Wireless,\" will sell for $280 and can be pre-ordered now.\n\nThe current version will still be for sale, and Amazon is dropping the price from $300 to $260. The bigger Kindle DX is unchanged.\n\nAs Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos explains it in a phone interview with Wired, \"The two Kindles are identical, except for the radio.\" The new device does not sync with Sprint, which was previously the exclusive supplier for Amazon's Whispernet technology. Instead, it works with AT&T's wireless network, which has the global reach that Amazon needs for its international plans.\n\nThis seems to push Sprint out of the long-term Kindle picture. Won't everybody want to spend 20 bucks more on the AT&T version that that works all around the world, even if a cross-border trip isn't on the immediate horizon? \"I would!\" says Bezos. Indeed, having a Kindle that downloads from overseas means you can get your favorite newspapers and magazines delivered instantly, at the same cost you pay at home.\n\nIt makes the Kindle a travel guide, too: If you want the lowdown on a Kyoto temple, or are wondering where to get the best fries in Amsterdam, you can download a relevant guide on the spot. And for the first time, the Lonely Planet series will be sold on Kindle, along with the previously available travel books from Frommer, Rick Steves and Michelin. No wonder the Amazon press release has an ecstatic quote from AT&T's CEO Randall Stephenson and not a word from Sprint honcho (and vanity TV pitchman) Dan Hesse.\n\nOther unhappy people may include owners of current Kindles who travel internationally: Their gadgets can't be switched to AT&T versions. Bezos suggests that they give away or resell their Kindles (first-gen Kindles are currently going for around $190) and buy new ones. Those who bought a Kindle in the last 30 days can exchange them for the international version. Maybe the biggest gripes will come from those who bought the most expensive Kindle, the supersized DX. Imagine sitting in a Paris bistro with your US-download-only $490 DX and watching some tourist with a puny $280 Kindle filling up with newspapers, Michelin guides and the latest Michael Connelly thriller.\n\nThe international Kindle is not just for Americans traveling abroad. Bezos says that Amazon's sales patterns show a sizable demand for English language books in countries that speak other languages. Until now, readers in those countries have found such books to be expensive and hard to find, not to mention slow to arrive after being ordered. The global Kindle will make the process cheap and instant.\n\nAmazon staved off copyright problems by negotiating an arrangement with English language publishers that pays royalties depending on the territory of purchase. (If you buy a copy of The Perfect Thing in London, for instance, the UK publisher Ebury press gets the sale, instead of US publisher Simon & Schuster.) Still, the rights clearances aren't yet comprehensive; of the 350,000 books in the Kindle store, only around 200,000 will be available in some countries.\n\nWhile I had Bezos on the phone, I asked him about some other e-book issues. He wouldn't comment on Amazon's filing against the the Google Books settlement. Nor would he respond to Google's comment that Amazon was being hypocritical in its objection. He also had nothing to add to the apology he gave to Kindle users for the company's abrupt and scary retraction of copies of a Orwell's 1984.\n\nBut he did have a response to a recent strategy employed by publishers of books expected to be mega-sellers, like Teddy Kennedy's True Compass and Sarah Palin's upcoming memoir, Going Rogue. The respective publishers think that withholding lower-cost Kindle versions for a few months will boost hardcover sales. Bezos believes this is short-sighted, and that offering a book on Kindle increases the total sales. He notes that when an author comes out with a new book, he or she will do publicity or get reviews. \"When you're on NPR and someone goes on their Kindle to look for the book, it's your chance to make that sale,\" he said. \"They won't remember in a month or two.\"\n\nAs proof of the way that the Kindle has changed reader habits, Bezos brings up an amazing statistic. Earlier this year, he startled people by revealing that of books available on both Kindle and paper versions, 35 percent of copies sold by Amazon were Kindle versions. Now, he says, the number is up to 48 percent. This means that a lot of people have bought Kindles (Amazon won't reveal the figures) and that Kindle owners buy a lot of books.\n\nBezos hasn't missed the buzz about upcoming digital tablets. He says that Amazon is hard at work making software apps (like the one already available for the iPhone) that will extend the Kindle system to other devices. He's also still open \"in principle\" to rival e-reader manufacturers who wish to use the Kindle store to provide content. But he feels that while people may read on phones and web-surfing tablets, the dedicated e-reading device will keep improving.\n\n\"We want Kindle to be the best way to read,\" Bezos says. And now, people can read books that they download outside the US.\n\nPhoto: Jonathan Snyder/Wired.com",
  "latent_10463": "Joshua Van Alstine at a traditional meal after sundown during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. (Courtesy of Joshua Van Alstine)\n\nSay the name Joshua Van Alstine in Saudi Arabia and the likely response is a blank stare.\n\nBut mention his Web-born persona, Abu Muteb, and chances are good that you will get a knowing nod or a wry smile for the baby-faced American military brat. He slings Saudi­accented Arabic, wears traditional Arabian robes, mixes comedy and commentary, and may be one of the Arab world’s most improbable celebrities.\n\nThe Internet age is awash with tales of head-scratching stardom and viral oddities. Yet amid this modern mash-up, Van Alstine is a niche within a niche. He rode a wave of YouTube videos that were not even a blip at the college he attended near Dallas, but were monster hits in Saudi Arabia and eventually caught the attention of the kingdom’s rulers.\n\nAn email arrived in May 2013 from the Saudi leadership asking whether he would consider moving to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital. He accepted.\n\n“This whole thing has been wild. Really crazy,” said Van Alstine, whose videos — some with more than 1 million views — also landed him on one of the Middle East’s most widely watched television channels.\n\nJoshua Van Alstine, who's become famous under his Web persona Abu Muteb, performs a sketch about nonverbal communication in Saudi Arabia in this comedic video. (YouTube/Americanbadu)\n\nLast week, he was recruited by Qatar state television to help cover the country’s National Day celebrations.\n\n“Hang on a sec,” he apologized during a phone interview from Qatar’s capital, Doha.\n\n“Okay, I’m back. I had to take some photos with fans. Like I was saying, it’s nuts, dude. It’s sometimes hard to take it all in.”\n\nTo get the full measure of Van Alstine’s journey, it is important to know what the 25-year-old is not.\n\nHe is not a native speaker of Arabic. He is not of Arab descent. He had never set foot in an Arab country until he was in his early 20s.\n\nBut he is Muslim, raised in the religion of his Turkish-born mother as the family bounced between Turkey and the United States with the deployments of his father, an Air Force enlisted airman who rose to the rank of chief master sergeant.\n\nOne stop was in San Antonio shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, when he was in grade school.\n\nJoshua Van Alstine during a charity event in Riyadh. (Courtesy of Joshua Van Alstine)\n\n“For the first time, I felt I wasn’t accepted,” he said. “Here I was, a white Muslim in America. Many Americans rejected me because I was Muslim. The Muslims in America — Arabs, Pakistanis and others — rejected me because they saw me as just American. I felt really isolated.”\n\nThat was, until he fell into a clique of Saudi students at the University of North Texas. He started picking up Arabic and the distinctive Saudi dialect. One day in late 2011, from his parents’ basement, he decided to make a video challenging Westerners to seek a better understanding of Islam. He posted it on YouTube.\n\nThen he made another one, with a lighter touch, about hanging out with the Saudis. And another.\n\nNo one noticed on campus except the Saudi students. They tweeted it. Back in the kingdom, the posts went into the meme­osphere in one of the region’s most vibrant social media landscapes. Here was something entirely new: a blond American winging it in Arabic with a Saudi flavor. Americans are well used to foreigners expropriating U.S. culture and slang. But for Saudis, it was a hoot.\n\n“I was like, ‘You gotta be kidding, right?’ ” he said. “I was anonymous at home and like some kind of star in Saudi.”\n\nIn early 2012, someone from the Saudi royal court tracked down Van Alstine on Facebook and invited him to visit. Van Alstine arrived just after the death of the No. 2 to the throne, Crown Prince Nayef, in June 2012. Because he was on a royal-sponsored visit, Van Alstine was added to the mourning events.\n\nHe joined the royal delegation to pray in Mecca and was part of a gathering with senior princes and others at a palace in Jiddah. Among them was the future Saudi king, Salman. Van Alstine kissed him on the forehead, a traditional display of respect by younger men for elders in Arab states of the Persian Gulf.\n\nVan Alstine also paid homage to his sponsors by taking the nom-de-Web Abu Muteb, a nickname of then Saudi King Abdullah, who died nearly a year ago and was succeeded by Salman.\n\nVan Alstine returned to the United States and kept cranking out videos for his YouTube channel, Americanbadu, or the American Bedouin. One video — a reply to a woman who professed to be fan of the Saudi soccer club al-Ittihad — has more than 1 million views.\n\nIn May 2013, the Saudi Ministry of Education emailed him a job offer to help develop a new TV channel. He packed his bags.\n\n[How Saudi Arabia’s 79-year-old King Salman is shaking up the Middle East]\n\nTo be sure, Van Alstine keeps it tame. The Saudi social media space is packed, but not with anyone who crosses red lines such as criticism of Saudi rulers or policies. Offenders are quickly silenced and sometimes jailed.\n\nHis comedy keeps to the safe ground of mild observations: the pidgin Arabic of many South Asian shopkeepers or the bewildering array of Saudi hand gestures. He can also get preachy and more than a shade of propagandist. In several posts — with a Saudi flag in the background — he has railed against Muslim-bashers in the West or defended Saudi Arabia against criticism of rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent.\n\n“I don’t feel conflicted at all,” he said, insisting that he does not try to overlay Western values on local standards. This bit of self-preservation has earned him some detractors.\n\nHis father, Brian Van Alstine, said he was always aware of Joshua’s affinity for the spotlight. “But I’ve also tried to temper his enthusiasm with the reality that not everyone will understand or tolerate his point of view the same way,” he added.\n\nVan Alstine’s sweet spot, however, is his natural state: a semi-goofy American with a toothy smile who favors traditional Saudi robes and headgear and models himself as a Bedouin soul mate.\n\n“He’s weird, but in a likable way,” said Ibraheem Alkhirallah, creative director at the Riyadh-based video production company Telfaz, which featured Van Alstine in one of its most popular Web shows, “Temsahly,” which features a sock-puppet crocodile who interviews Arab celebrities or has adventures around the region.\n\nThe centerpiece of the awards wall at Telfaz is a YouTube plaque for the first 1 million subscribers to “Temsahly” — among the show’s more than 100 million views. The Van Alstine episode has been watched more than 1.8 million times.\n\nIt is another glimpse into one of the Middle East’s fastest-evolving online cultures. Saudi Arabia ranks among the world’s leaders in per capita usage of sites such as Twitter and the WhatsApp chat network. Millions follow YouTube comedy shows such as “Temsahly” and the satirical “La Yekthar Show.”\n\n“Saudi society can be a lonely place,” said Fahad Albutairi, the popular comedian who created “La Yekthar,” or “put a lid on it” in rough translation. “Liberals and conservatives, men and women, wealthy and struggling — all had really no way to really connect. With social media, we can tear off the masks and tear up the stereotypes.”\n\nThe same wave carried Van Alstine. But his image really took off when he appeared in 2013 on a 15-episode series on Middle East Broadcasting, the major regional television network, during the super prime-time viewing season of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month. In the show, Van Alstine is living with a traditional Saudi family.\n\n“I arrived as a dopey American and then out-Arabized the Arabs,” he said.\n\nAfter his short-term TV gig, Van Alstine is setting up shop in Doha. He plans to resume his studies and seek new outlets in Qatar, which is among the region’s media hubs as the base for the Al Jazeera network.\n\n“They say that life is unpredictable,” he said. “If anyone disagrees, I have the perfect answer. Take a look at me.”\n\nRead more\n\nSaudi officials once jailed this woman for driving. But she found her way back on the ballot.\n\nIf you keep saying Saudi Arabia is like ISIS, you might get sued",
  "latent_10484": "Walking the hallways at Woodson High School, it might be difficult to pick out some of the teachers from the swarms of students dressed in hoodies and sweatpants.\n\nInstead of oxford shirts paired with neckties or blouses on top of dress slacks, about half of the Woodson faculty have been “dressing down” as part of a demonstration for better pay. The campaign, which members of the Fairfax County school’s English department helped organize, is gaining momentum as teachers at other schools are taking notice.\n\nDrew Marvin, 41, has been sporting T-shirts in his English classes since last Monday. Katherine Sebunia, 34, now wears jeans and comfortable sneakers as she instructs her Woodson students.\n\n“We want to help Fairfax understand what makes Fairfax such a great place to live, because it’s not mountain vistas or beachfront access. It’s world-class schools,” Marvin said. “And while the county Board of Supervisors says it’s world-class, our own teachers have to struggle to pay mortgages.”\n\nKaren Garza, the county’s new schools superintendent, has said that teacher compensation is one of her top priorities, and her proposed budget for next year includes $41 million in salary increases. But it is unclear whether the county board will approve Garza’s budget or whether the raises are realistic as Fairfax faces a budget crunch.\n\n“This campaign has been initiated by teachers and is not formally endorsed by FCPS,” schools spokesman John Torre said. “With that said, increasing compensation is a priority and the FY 2015 advertised budget includes a step increase for employees.”\n\nThe dress-down campaign is one of several tactics Fairfax teachers have adopted in their quest for raises after years of stagnant compensation. An online petition sponsored by Fairfax teacher groups and the county council of PTAs has more than 1,700 signatures. The Fairfax County Federation of Teachers has been placing advertisements in newspapers calling on county supervisors to increase school funding.\n\nDuring the economic recession, Fairfax County made significant cuts to the schools budget and teachers saw pay freezes.\n\nTeachers say their frustration stems from the fact that Fairfax, regarded as one of the nation’s premier school systems, now lags in average salary behind other school divisions in the Washington region. The average Fairfax teacher could earn about $7,500 more per year working over the county line in Arlington and about $6,900 more over the Potomac in Montgomery County, according to the 2014 Washington Area Boards of Education guide.\n\nIn 2014, the average teacher salary in Fairfax is $67,245, while the average teacher salary in Arlington is $74,903 and the average in Montgomery County is $74,038.\n\nSeeking to highlight the pay disparity, a group of teachers in the Woodson English department began brainstorming ideas, Sebunia said. One teacher mentioned that maintaining a second wardrobe of professional attire to wear to school was becoming a hefty expense.\n\nThe group decided this month to begin wearing casual clothes to work as a protest. The county schools’ regulations have one line applying to teacher attire: “Employees shall dress and conduct themselves in a professional manner.”\n\n“The idea was that we’re not going to spend money on professional clothes, we’re going to spend it on groceries,” said Sebunia.\n\nMarvin said that Woodson faculty have the enthusiastic support of the principal, Jeff Yost.\n\n“We have excellent teachers, and their dressing down in no way affects their teaching or student learning,” said Yost, whose wife is a teacher. “They arrive before the students and they stay after school for hours helping students and collaborating with their colleagues. Additionally, they spend hours outside of school grading work and planning class lessons. The 40-hour workweek is a joke when it comes to the work FCPS’s teachers, counselors and administrators do each week.”\n\nPay freezes have affected many teachers significantly. Sebunia said that she and her husband, who works in the Fairfax schools’ human resources department, both took second jobs in recent years to make ends meet.\n\nBecause of mandated retirement contribution increases, Sebunia said she and her husband actually saw their take-home pay decrease, despite small salary raises in recent years. As a result, Sebunia said, she can no longer afford day care for her 5-year-old daughter.\n\n“As a teacher, you work very hard to help other people’s children be successful and get into good schools and colleges,” Sebunia said. “But as we do that, realistically our own children’s chances of going there get smaller and smaller. It’s demoralizing to realize all your efforts aren’t helping your own child.”\n\nMarvin said that working in a classroom is a high-stress job and that the school system experiences significant turnover each year as teachers burn out. It also hurts, he said, to see teachers in neighboring school districts earning more.\n\n“It saps our morale,” Marvin said. The dressing-down campaign “is a way for teachers to stand up for themselves.”",
  "latent_10587": "Image: The Everett Collection\n\nMost people know Robert Reed as Mike Brady on The Brady Bunch. And he was also Mike Brady on The Brady Bunch Variety Hour, The Brady Girls Get Married, A Very Brady Christmas, The Bradys,The Love Boat and Day by Day. Just like Dawn Wells and Mary Ann from Gilligan's Island,Reed stuck with the fatherly role his entire life.\n\nDespite the commitment, Reed considered himself a serious actor and initially didn't love the role that would come to define his career. However, out of devotion to the kids on the show, he stuck around and appeared in all the reboots.\n\nBut just because Reed appeared on the feel-good sitcom for five seasons doesn't mean he wasn't a brilliant actor. In fact, Reed was a part of some of the most groundbreaking television shows, miniseries and movies of the 1960s and '70s.\n\nToday would have been Reed's 85th birthday. We already know and love Mike Brady. To celebrate Reed's legacy, we're taking a look at other notable, diverse roles the skilled actor played throughout his distinguished career.\n\n1. Kenneth Preston - 'The Defenders' Reed first came to prominence as Kenneth Preston on the 1961 courtroom drama The Defenders. The series featured Reed as a part of a father-and-son legal duo that specializes in defending unusual cases, including neo-Nazis, atheists and civil rights objectors. Image: CBS Television Distribution\n\n2. Lt. Adam Tobias - 'Mannix' At the same time Reed was appearing as Mike Brady on the family-friendly sitcom, he also had a recurring role on the hit detective series Mannix. From 1969–74, Lt. Adam Tobias assisted Joe Mannix with special cases, appearing in a total of 22 episodes. Image: CBS Television Distribution\n\n3. Paul McIlvain - 'Pray for the Wildcats' After The Brady Bunch wrapped, Reed made appearances in several successful TV movies and miniseries. One of the most notable ones was 1974's Pray for the Wildcats, which also starred William Shatner and Andy Griffith. Keeping with the tradition of wild television movies of the 1970s, this one was about a crazy business executive who chases his workers on dirt bikes through the desert, killing a young man along the way. Image: ABC\n\n4. Dr. Pat Caddison - 'Medical Center' Reed earned his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his guest-starring part on Medical Center in 1975. Trying to distance himself from the wholesome and simple Mike Brady, Reed starred as Pat Caddison, a doctor who comes out as transgender. Image: Warner Bros. Television\n\n5. Teddy Boylan - 'Rich Man, Poor Man' Reed's second Primetime Emmy Award nomination came in 1976 from the seven-part miniseries Rich Man, Poor Man. It was another star-studded cast featuring Reed, who appeared alongside Peter Strauss, Nick Nolte, Susan Blakely and Ed Asner. Image: Universal Television\n\n6. Dr. William Reynolds - 'Roots' As far as miniseries go, it doesn't get more acclaimed than the legendary 1976 drama Roots. Reed looks almost unrecognizable as Dr. William Reynolds, a slave owner who acquires Kunta Kinte. Image: Warner Bros. Television\n\n7. Johnny Lubitch - 'The Boy in the Plastic Bubble' In this unforgetable TV movie, Reed plays Johnny Lubitch, the father of a teenage boy who can't live with unfiltered air. Let's not forget that John Travolta and Diana Hyland, Reed's wife and son in the film, got together after meeting on the set of this film. Image: ABC\n\n8. Dr. Adam Rose - 'Nurse' Reed's last major role, outside of the various revivals of The Brady Bunch in the 1980s, was Dr. Adam Rose on Nurse in 1981. (You can tell Reed enjoyed playing doctors on television.) Despite being lauded by critics, the medical drama only lasted two seasons. Image: CBS Television Distribution",

  "latent_10708": "Disney Research have just released a paper describing an RTL-SDR based smart watch that they’ve developed a proof of concept for. The smart watch is unique in that it can be used to actually detect the exact object that the wearer is touching.\n\nThe prototype watch does this by using the RTL-SDR to detect the electromagnetic (EM) noise emitted by particular objects and compare it against a stored database. They call this technology EM-Sense. In the paper the authors summarize:\n\nMost everyday electrical and electromechanical objects emit small amounts of electromagnetic (EM) noise during regular operation. When a user makes physical contact with such an object, this EM signal propagates through the user, owing to the conductivity of the human body. By modifying a small, low-cost, software-defined radio, we can detect and classify these signals in real-time, enabling robust on-touch object detection. Unlike prior work, our approach requires no instrumentation of objects or the environment; our sensor is self-contained and can be worn unobtrusively on the body. We call our technique EM-Sense and built a proof-of concept smartwatch implementation. Our studies show that discrimination between dozens of objects is feasible, independent of wearer, time and local environment.\n\nThe frequencies required for EM detection are around 0 – 1 MHz which falls outside the range of the RTL-SDR’s lowest frequency of 24 MHz. To get around this, they ran the RTL-SDR in direct sampling mode. The RTL-SDR is connected to the watch, but a Nexus 5 smartphone is used to handle the USB processing which streams the signal data over WiFi to a laptop that handles the signal processing and live classification. In the future they hope to use a more advanced SDR solution, but the RTL-SDR has given them the proof of concept needed at a very low cost.\n\nAn example use scenario of the watch that Disney suggests is as follows:\n\nHome – At home, Julia wakes up and gets ready for another productive day at work. Her EM-Sense-capable smartwatch informs and augments her activities throughout the day. For instance, when Julia grabs her electric toothbrush, EMSense automatically starts a timer. When she steps on a scale, a scrollable history of her weight is displayed on her smartwatch automatically. Down in the kitchen, EM-Sense detects patterns of appliance touches, such as the refrigerator and the stove. From this and the time of day, EM-Sense infers that Julia is cooking breakfast and fetches the morning news, which can be played from her smartwatch. Fixed Structures – When Julia arrives at the office, EMSense detects when she grasps the handle of her office door. She is then notified about imminent calendar events and waiting messages: “You have 12 messages and a meeting in 8 minutes”. Julia then leaves a reminder – tagged to the door handle – to be played at the end of the day: “Don’t forget to pick up milk on the way home.” Workshop – In the workshop, EM-Sense assists Julia in her fabrication project. First, Julia checks the remaining time of a 3D print by touching anywhere on the print bed – “five minutes left” – perfect timing to finish a complementary wood base. Next, Julia uses a Dremel to cut a piece of wood. EM Sense detects the tool and displays its rotatory speed on the smartwatch screen. If it knows the task, it can even recommend the ideal speed. Similarly, as Julia uses other tools in the workshop, a tutorial displayed on the smartwatch automatically advances. Finally, the 3D print is done and the finished pieces are fitted together. Office – Back at her desk, Julia continues work on her laptop. By simply touching the trackpad, EM-Sense automatically authenticates Julia without needing a password. Later in the day, Julia meets with a colleague to work on a collaborative task. They use a large multitouch screen to brainstorm ideas. Their EM-Sense-capable smartwatches make it possible to know when each user makes contact with the screen. This information is then transmitted to the large touchscreen, allowing it to differentiate their touch inputs. With this, both Julia and her colleague can use distinct tools (e.g., pens with different colors); their smartwatches provide personal color selection, tools, and settings. Transportation – At the end of the day, Julia closes her office door and the reminder she left earlier is played back: “Don’t forget to pick up milk on the way home.” In the parking lot, Julia starts her motorcycle. EM-Sense detects her mode of transportation automatically (e.g., bus, car, bicycle) and provides her with a route overview: “You are 10 minutes from home, with light traffic”.",
  "latent_10789": "Three-year campaign edges to fruition as late amendment tabled that will stop companies using laws to silence critics\n\nA three-year campaign to reform Britain's \"chilling\" libel laws is days away from victory after the government did a U-turn on a key proposal which would prevent companies using defamation laws to silence their critics.\n\nIn an 11th-hour heave to get the defamation bill on the statute books, the government has tabled a fresh amendment that will prevent big businesses from suing newspapers, academics or citizens unless they can first prove \"substantial financial loss\" has been caused by their critics.\n\nThe amendment will mean a new law forcing a court to strike out an application to sue \"unless the body corporate can show that the publication of the words of matters complained of has caused, or is likely to cause, substantial financial loss to the claimant\".\n\nMike Harris, head of advocacy at Index on Censorship said: \"We are cautiously optimistic that this should deliver the type of reform we were hoping for to stop corporations bullying individuals.\"\n\nThe lobby group has been at the vanguard of a campaign to change Britain's laws which has let to controversial including one which saw a big US healthcare company sue a British cardiologist, Dr Peter Wilmshurt, who criticised their research and another where the British Chiropractic Association sued a British science writer, Simon Singh.\n\nThe government blocked Labour's attempts to get a blanket ban on the statute books last week, but promised to reconsider the wording in the face of huge criticism that if the current libel laws weren't change, big businesses would continue to use their financial muscle to \"take journalists out of the game\".\n\nLabour and Liberal Democrat MPs were concerned that companies were also using the laws to silence academics and doctors who had been sued for criticising medical companies and health practitioners.\n\n\"This amendment makes clear that bodies trading for profit must have suffered or be likely to suffer serious financial loss in order to satisfy the serious harm test for bringing a defamation claim,\" said a spokesman for the ministry of justice.\n\nLabour will support this amendment when the bill returns to the House of Lords on Tuesday. Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: \"We're pleased the government has accepted Labour's argument that a hurdle is needed before corporations can pursue defamation proceedings.\"\n\nHowever, the party still has concerns over government opposition to a law which would prevent companies contracted by local authorities to sue citizen critics.\n\n\"We need a level playing field so that criticism of, say, a privately run prison is allowed just as it is allowed about prisons run by the public sector,\" said Khan.\n\nThe party will push for its original Lords amendment, which was removed in the commons last week, to be reinstated.\n\nLord Lester, who has spearheaded the campaign for libel reform, has tabled a third amendment aimed at putting belt and braces on legislation which bars local authorities from suing their critics.\n\nThis ban has already been established in case law following a dispute between Derbyshire council and the Times newspaper, but he is concerned that the Localism Act of 2011 undoes some of this precedent.\n\nIf the bill gets through the house of Lords on Tuesday it should have a safe passage to the statute books, ending a three-year battle by Lester and campaign groups including Index on Censorship, English Pen and Sense about Science.",
  "latent_10821": "Hans Holbein the Younger and the Politics of Art\n\nJust two years into the reign of James I, a Dutch painter and poet named Karel van Mander toured Whitehall Palace and came upon something that astounded him: a large mural of two generations of Tudors. Dominating the nine foot by twelve foot painting on the wall was the long-dead Henry VIII. At his side was his third wife, Jane Seymour; above the couple were his parents, Henry VII and Elizabeth of York.\n\nA 17th century painting reproduction of the Whitehall Mural\n\nVan Mander, stunned, wrote that Henry VIII “stood there, majestic in his splendor…so lifelike that the spectator felt abashed, annihilated in his presence.”\n\nLifelike. This was the supreme achievement of the mural’s creator, Hans Holbein. then and now. Peter Ackroyd has written, “He illustrates his sitters in the light of some sudden but characteristic emotion, as if he had caught their thought on the wing.”\n\nHans Holbein the Younger\n\nIt is in part because of Holbein that we feel we know the Tudor personalities, from Henry VIII and Jane Seymour to Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell to a baby Prince Edward. But do we really know Holbein?\n\nIt seems to us now as if Hans Holbein the Younger was always there, the favorite, the prize artist of the king. But in fact his artistic reign was fairly brief. He did not become “court painter” until shortly before painting that famous mural. It had taken years to win the trust of Henry VIII and secure royal commissions. Just three years after the Whitehall mural, he was under a cloud because of his painting of Henry’s fourth wife, Anne of Cleves. Three years after that, he was dead.\n\n—————————————————————————————————Hans Holbein was born in 1497 in Augsburg, now the third largest city in Bavaria, Germany. Then it was a “free Imperial city” within the Holy Roman Empire, faithful to emperor and pope. Hans Holbein the Elder came from a family of talented artists and made sure to teach his son everything he knew. The father painted mostly altarpieces, church windows and other religious works—in the late medieval age, this was where artists found their majority of paying work.\n\nMartin Luther transformed Germany—and then the rest of Christendom—when he challenged papal authority in 1517, nailing his 95 theses to the door of the castle church of Wittenerg. Two years earlier, Hans and his older brother Ambrosius had moved to the thriving Swiss city of Basel to work as journeyman painters. He created portraits and murals and designed woodcuts for printers. But soon enough Hans Holbein was engulfed in Luther’s revolution.\n\n“Dance of Death,” The Abbot\n\nHolbein’s cover of the Lutheran Bible\n\nIt is in his woodcuts that Hans Holbein the Younger gives some indication of his religious beliefs. He designed the title page of Martin Luther’s bible. And he created woodcuts for The Dance of Death, an eerie series of drawings showing a skeleton reaching for people across every level of society: merchant, king, abbess, old woman—-and pope. Death came to everyone, high or low, was the message.\n\nBut in the first of several ironies, when Holbein came to England, his sponsor was Sir Thomas More, known for his hatred of Luther and determination to destroy the books written by those who wanted to reform the church.\n\nHolbein departed from Basel in 1526, leaving a wife and children behind. Religious commissions had dried up as Lutheranism ignited. No one wanted altarpieces anymore. To earn enough money to live—and to, hopefully, find fame—he’d need to establish himself in a foreign court. He tried France first, but nothing happened. The famous Dutch Renaissance humanist Erasmus, whom Holbein had painted at least twice, gave him a letter of recommendation to be given to Sir Thomas More, a fellow Humanist and one of the most valued councilors of Henry VIII.\n\nSir Thomas More\n\nHolbein may have lived in More’s Chelsea home for a time. What is known for certain is that he painted a famous portrait of Sir Thomas as well as many of his family members. More raved about the artist’s abilities in a letter to Erasmus. If he knew about Holbein’s belief in religious reform, he’d decided to overlook it.\n\nIn 1529 Sir Thomas More became chancellor of England. It would seem that Holbein couldn’t have picked a better patron.\n\nBut More was devoted to Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of Henry VIII, and although he tried hard to avoid it, he got caught up in the Great Matter of the king’s divorce. More did not have a high opinion of Anne Boleyn, who would eventually become Henry’s second queen, and could not swear an oath of supremacy to king over pope. In 1532 he resigned as chancellor, in anguish, claiming illness.\n\nHolbein was not damaged by his patron’s fall from power because he’d returned to Basel, to his family and his circle of artist friends. But this was no place for an artist. The pendulum had swung so far in Basel that religious reformers were destroying statues and works of art in churches. It is believed that some of Holbein’s paintings were burned in the rages of iconoclasm. Holbein decided to go back to England. Before he left, he painted his wife, looking undeniably sad.\n\nHolbein’s wife and two of their children\n\nThere was a whole new group running the Tudor court in 1533, and Holbein headed for the top. His new patron? The stylish Anne Boleyn. He designed decorations for her coronation; pieces of jewelry; and several silver cups. It is believed that he painted Queen Anne’s portrait, but after her fall, Henry VIII had many images of his second wife destroyed. One that survives is a sketch of Anne signed by Holbein.\n\nThe Ambassadors\n\nPerhaps the greatest contribution Anne made to the legacy of Holbein was sponsoring his painting The Ambassadors, considered his master work. The strongest clue that Anne commissioned the work is that on a table between the two Frenchmen is a wooden cylinder used to determine dates. Visible is April 11, the day that the court was officially told that Anne Boleyn would be awarded royal honors.\n\nHolbein sketch of Anne Boleyn\n\nAnne’s execution in May 1536 could have led to Holbein’s downfall. Instead, he shifted again, becoming the favored painter of Henry VIII himself and Thomas Cromwell, who many believe concocted the charges against Anne of adultery and incest.\n\nHenry VIII, painted the year Anne Boleyn was executed\n\nHolbein painted Jane Seymour, Anne Boleyn’s prim-looking replacement as queen, and the family mural in Whitehall. He received the all-important commissions to paint the king himself and his heir, Prince Edward. He painted Cromwell. This was when Holbein’s status at court became official and he earned an annual salary of thirty pounds.\n\nJane Seymour died the same year that the mural was painted. Henry VIII was reluctant to marry a foreign princess without having any idea of what she looked like. So Holbein was sent to various courts to paint the candidates: France, Flanders, Germany.\n\nThe famous portrait of Anne of Cleves\n\nIn Cleves, he painted Anne, the older sister of Duke William, and Henry was charmed by her appearance. Yet from almost the moment he set eyes on her when she arrived, days before their wedding, he loathed Anne of Cleves. “I like her not,” the king declared.\n\nDid Holbein, the artist celebrated for his lifelike images, over-flatter Anne of Cleves in his painting? Did he feel pressure from Cromwell, who supported the marriage alliance to a German power, to make her look more attractive than she was? Cromwell was arrested and then executed in 1540, and one of the reasons for his shocking fall from power was that Henry felt his minister had bungled his fourth marriage. “I am not well handled,” the king said, menacingly.\n\nThomas Cromwell\n\nDid Holbein handle his part well? Others have said that Anne of Cleves’ painting must have been accurate because, unlike Cromwell, Holbein was not punished in the fallout of the Cleves divorce. Which is strictly true. But Hans Holbein did not receive any more high profile royal commissions. He concentrated on private commissions, such as miniatures of various members of the nobility, like Katherine Willoughby, the young wife of the Duke of Suffolk.\n\nIn late 1543 at the age of 45, Hans Holbein died, perhaps of the plague, in London. He left a will, written in haste. His debts were settled and some of his monies went to the care of the children in Basel he had left behind. His grave is unmarked.\n\n—————————————————————————————————\n\nAckroyd, Peter, The Life of Thomas More\n\nIves, Eric, The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn\n\nThurley, Simon, Whitehall Palace: An Architectural History of the Royal Apartments, 1240–1690\n\nWeir, Alison, Henry VIII: The King and His Court\n\nWolf, Norbert, Hans Holbein the Younger, the German Raphael\n\n—————————————————————————————————\n\nNancy Bilyeau is the author of an award-winning trilogy of historical thrillers set in the time of Henry VIII: The Crown, The Chalice and The Tapestry.

He says the officers are in disbelief over how the situation has been handled and adds that \"unrepairable damage\" has been done between Chief Rahinsky and his officers.\n\nThe story has gained national attention. On Tuesday, Dec. 12, Chief Rahinsky released a short clip of body camera footage showing 11-year-old Honestie Hodges held at gunpoint and placed in handcuffs during a search for a suspect on Dec. 6.\n\n\"I was in disbelief,\" said Bingel. \"I'm speaking on behalf of the members, because we are all in disbelief.\"\n\nBingel says it was the chief's statements in that press conference that struck a nerve.\n\n\"What you will see on the body worn camera is the juvenile was treated the same way we would've treated any adult,\" said Rahinsky. \"When you're dealing with an 11-year-old, it's inappropriate.\"\n\n\"I don't know why he made those comments the way he made them,\" said Bingel. \"I really don't, and it's really baffling for all the membership.\"\n\nBingel says the chief did not speak to the officers involved in the incident before that press conference.\n\n\"I think the chief should've taken a step back and talked to his command staff,\" said Bingel. \"He's surrounded by a lot of great command, experienced command ,and he really didn't seek much input. I think there's been a lot of damage done, and I don't think he acted quick enough to restore that.\"\n\nSome officers in the union believe \"unrepairable damage\" has been made. \"That's accurate,\" said Bingel. \"But you never want to give up hope, right?\"\n\nBingel has 27 years in law enforcement on his resume and says the officers on scene that night were following protocol. He says that original video clip shown gives an incomplete picture of what really happened.\n\n\"They were furious that only a small portion was shown without the interaction they had with Honestie after the fact and how they talked to the mom and how they explained things to her,\" said Bingel. \"When you guys first saw it, they show Honestie being put in handcuffs, screaming, and then that's it. That leaves only the imagination to wonder what happened next.\"\n\nBingel agrees with Chief Rahinsky that changes need to be made, but for a different reason.\n\n\"I think communication is the number one change that needs to be improved upon,\" said Bingel. \"We need better communication with our commissioners, with our mayor, and with the community. We just need to remember that we've got a job to do, and we can't let this distraction take away from serving the citizens. I don't expect people outside of law enforcement to understand everything we do. As hard as they might try to understand, they're not going to, and I think we need to realize that.\"\n\nWhile Bingel says many of the officers in the union feel that enough damage has been made, he is open to meeting with the chief to restore those bonds. He also says there's a huge disconnect between the police department and city hall and wants to restore communication with them as well as the community.\n\nChief Rahinsky says there is still another 100 minutes of body camera footage to review. Their internal investigation should be completed in the next few days.\n\nThat stabbing suspect was eventually found and arrested at another home near that scene.",

One, people were already revved up by Twilight and wanted to see the next big love trilogy meets fantasy flick. Two, America and most of the globe are in love with the ultra violence. That isn’t to say nobody likes vampire romance, but I have a suspicion less kissy kissy and more stabby stabby is what the people want.\n\nNo.\n\nTo be honest, I didn’t see this huge success coming. I read all three books last year and enjoyed them for what they were: Namely science fiction meets young adult. The books aren’t heavy on romance though, and are more about the protagonist trying to survive with absolutely no control of her situation. Of course she’s dealing with trust issues and doesn’t know how to deal with her feelings for the two different guys, but it’s her identity that is most important in the books.\n\nAs far as adaptations go the book was translated to film incredibly well. I can’t help but think author of The Hunger Games Suzanne Collins cowriting the script helped.\n\nOne surprise though, is that the book utilized a first person narrative through each of all three books, and it was a surprise to see the movies didn’t utilize a voice-over to mimic the book more exactly. Due to this change a lot of little details had to be changed in order to show and not tell. I won’t be nitpicking little details, but these are the major changes I noticed that changed the material, good and bad.\n\nConsidering everything below will compare the book and movie you’d be a nitwit to not expect major spoilers below.\n\nBad: Things they took out.\n\n1. Katniss’ Trust Issues.\n\nLeather typically helps people bond. Oh wait that’s bondage.\n\nThis is probably my biggest gripe with the film as the character of Katniss is severely diminished as far as her cocksuredness and the internal conflict she had in the books. One of the main themes in the book was Katniss questioning her own morality and just how easy it was for her to kill the other children. She even reasons she can kill Peeta at one point. This was taken out of the movie, largely through little details, but over the course of the film this change really resonates.\n\nIt starts in the opening minute of the game. In the book Katniss thinks she sees Peeta telling her not to run for the bow but she isn’t sure. In the movie it’s very clear he’s warning her. Overtly warning her shows Peeta is on her side, which weakens the twist of him turning on her and joining an alliance.\n\nLater when Katniss is healing Peeta she does it for sponsors, not to make Peeta feel better or because she likes him. The filmmakers seem to be playing up the “will she or won’t she” aspect here when the real issue is about a girl caught up in something bigger than herself and trying to understand it. Instead she’s more of a hero doing what’s right. She actually doesn’t want to kiss him in the book, but forces herself to do so for survival’s sake.\n\nIn the book, when the gamemakers change the rules and say there can only be one victor when it’s just Peeta and Katniss, Katniss draws her bow on Peeta in fear of him attacking her. In the movie she completely trusts him. Of course, by taking out all the tension and trust issues spoken to above this makes sense to take out. If not, she’d look like a loon with no prior distrust to back up a fully cocked bow.\n\n2. The Mockingjay pin is acquired differently.\n\nIn the book, the pin is acquired as a gift from the District 12 mayor’s daughter. This humanizes the rulers of the district, showing the government may not be as strong as we think. It also allows Katniss to learn the symbolic nature of the Mockingjay which also explains how the government isn’t as strong as some think. The bird was bioengineered to spy on the public but over time the public realized this and used it against the government.\n\nThis affects the second book/movie since the mayor and mayors daughter will be more important, but the hints as to the government losing its grip are lost. The meaning of the symbol on all the posters is lost as well.\n\n3. Ultra Violence in great detail.\n\nI found the book to be a lot more violent than the movie. This of course is due to the movie requiring a PG-13 rating which in turn forced all the gore and violence off camera. Is this such a good thing? Considering the human mind can perceive violence a lot more forcibly through visuals I’d say it definitely helps the sanity of the viewer and the children most likely watching. But it takes a very important element out of the series; namely the twisted and disgusting nature of the Capitol. Knowing children are dying and seeing them die for entertainment are two different things. Losing the violence essentially weakens this story element.\n\nGood: Things they took out.\n\n1. No Avox.\n\nNotice the Avox at the top right\n\nI always found the Avox, a name given to folks who tried to escape a district and are horribly mutilated for their crime, as very outlandish and weird. True, this creature is named as if it’s no longer human, and really slams home the inhuman nature of the Capitol and its laws. But this element felt forced to me. They do appear in the movie, albeit in the background waiting on Katniss before she enters the games. More than likely this element will be introduced in later movies anyway. It’s not really necessary in the first movie, considering the sequels will get much more complicated politically.\n\n2. Haymitch is a total drunk.\n\nIn the book Haymitch is first introduced on Reaping Day and quickly falls off the stage in a drunken stupor. Later on in the train, the reader never sees him eat, but only drink alcohol. It’s a way to show he is serious about mentoring Peeta and Katniss when he starts to eat and drinks less. But is it really that necessary? In the movie he does drink, but not for long, and never is shown to be a fool. Why introduce a character element that will be negated anyway, especially when you only have 2 hours to get to the point.\n\n3. Peeta’s father doesn’t bring cookies.\n\nBefore Katniss is thrown on a train and sent to the Capitol she gets to say goodbye to a few folks. In the movie that’s her mom, sister, and Gale. In the book, Peeta’s father also makes an appearance offering her some cookies and wishing her good luck. This always irked me, namely because his own son is in the games. How dare you give someone else extra energy, cookies, to help kill your own son. Katniss does end up tossing her cookies, hehe, and it’s a detail that didn’t need to be there. If it was left in the movie, people might start thinking Peeta is a little special or not worth living.\n\n4. Mutant Hounds.\n\nThey look something like this\n\nIn the book mutant dogs are released on the remaining challengers with the eyes of past tributes. Oh, and they can walk upright. Say what? Talk about a Michael Bay element. This gave me pause, as if Suzanne Collins wanted some extra baddy at the end ala Saturday morning cartoons. It definitely adds an additional twisted and sick element to the thinking process of the gamemaker and the Capitol, but it’s otherwise a silly idea. Would viewers at home watching the games on live television even realize the eyes were from dead tributes? Weird.\n\nBad: Things they added:\n\n1. Gamekeeper war room scenes.\n\nStar-date 1456…oh wait wrong movie\n\nTotally understandable addition, considering a movie needs an obvious villain or viewers will get wonky fast. Unfortunately this takes a lot of the fear of the unknown out of Katniss surviving the games and gives the viewer a safer feeling. In the book, Katniss typically only guesses at what is going on, and again this is due to the first person perspective, but that lends to the reader being more fearful. The movie implements shaky camera techniques for a reason; to keep the viewer off kilter and make us think it’s real. Well, cutting to a war room with a super awesome hologram table doesn’t do that.\n\n2. Parachute gifts have notes.\n\nIn the book a sponsor’s gift was given with no message. The movie adds a nice little Chinese cookie message. An obvious addition to translate what exactly the gift is for to moviegoers. Sadly this takes a clever element out of the movie. The gifts were treated almost like riddles as Katniss had to figure out why the gift came, or what Haymitch meant by giving the gift at the time she received it. It allows the reader and Katniss to discover something together. I do think they could have kept this element, they’d just need Katniss to speak allowed, ala Robert Downey Jr. in Sherlock Holmes.\n\n3. District 11 doesn’t give any bread.\n\nIn the book, after Rue dies, District 11 bands together and sends Katniss some bread, even though the gift was obviously expensive so late in the game. It showed a solidarity of districts that was lost from the movie. True, you get some of that after Thresh spares Katniss, but to get a gift from a District that isn’t your own is huge and the reader learns its the firs time it ever happened. This is the first sign of the political machinations moving in the direction of the next two books.\n\nGood things they added.\n\n1. “Hope” scene between gamemaker and President Snow.\n\nIn the movie, President Snow explains to the gamemaker his thoughts on withholding hope from the people. In the books it’s not clear Snow is a real villain until much later. Considering the Capitol needs a face to hate, this makes perfect sense to be in the film.\n\n2. District 11 revolts.\n\nThis is another element you learn about in the sequels, but it fits well in the movie. Without it no real change would be felt across districts and it lets the viewer know Katniss is already changing the landscape. It doesn’t replace the omission of the bread gift, but it’s something.\n\n3. We get to see Gale watch Katniss on TV.\n\nIn the book, Gale is seen before Katniss leaves for the games and then disappears from the book entirely. The shots of him watching Katniss keep him pertinent in the movie right till the end. In the books it was as if Suzanne Collins forgot about him, weakening his purpose. Of course this can only be done in third person and I’d imagine Collins would have had more Gale if she wasn’t bound by the first person perspective in the books.\n\n4. The gamemaker gets his due.\n\nThis element is learned in book 2, but to be added in the movie is a big help in understanding the stakes. Without it, the viewer would just assume the game was over and nothing really changed. The addition of the berries is a nice way of showing how evil President Snow is too.\n\nThe Score:\n\nIf you add up the good versus the bad above you get:\n\nGood: 8\n\nBad: 6\n\nSo did I like it?\n\nUltimately I was a little disappointed with the film because they didn’t do a lot to convert this into the visual format. There are many details they had to switch around to get the film to be a third person narrative, but I was hoping for more changes to the source material. Obviously they can’t do this or 12 year old girls will have the producers heads, but after reading the series I felt like it was an okay series that could have been improved upon. I was expecting The Hunger Games 2.0 and the film ended up being a very close representation of the book minus much of the internal conflict Katniss goes through. Instead of a conflicted character with a world on her shoulders she falls into the stereotypical heroes journey. It makes the movie a bit flat in comparison to the books.\n\nWant to see the differences for yourself? Get The Hunger Games on Blu-ray, DVD, or Paperback from Amazon.",

The woman was rushed to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield where she was pronounced dead at 11:22 a.m.\n\nWitnesses told police that an elderly man had fled the scene and ran up the stairs to the fifth floor. Police began a search of a fifth-floor apartment and found a 78-year-old man dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, Gulluni said.\n\nThe names of the two deceased was not released pending notification of family. It was also not disclosed what the relationship was between them.\n\nThe investigation is being handled by the Holyoke Police Detective Bureau, along with troopers from the state police Detective Unit assigned to Gulluni's office.\n\nThe address of the shooting is Veterans Park Apartments, a complex that offers affordable housing for seniors.

  "latent_11702": "In October 2012 a woman from Massachusetts called Lindsey Stone went on a work trip to Washington DC, and paid a visit to Arlington National Cemetery, where American war heroes are buried. Crouching next to a sign that said ‘Silence and Respect’, she raised a middle finger and pretended to shout while a colleague took her photo. It was the kind of puerile clowning that most of us (well me, anyway) have indulged in at some point, and once upon a time, the resulting image would have been noticed only by the few friends or family to whom the owner of the camera showed it. However, this being the era of sharing, Stone posted the photo to her Facebook profile.\n\nWithin weeks, a ‘Fire Lindsey Stone’ page had materialised, populated by commentators frothing with outrage at a desecration of hallowed ground. Anger rained down on Stone’s employer, a non-profit that helps adults with special needs. Her employers decided, reluctantly, that Stone and her colleague would have to leave.\n\nMore recently, Edward Snowden’s revelations about the panoptic scope of government surveillance have raised the hoary spectre of ‘Big Brother’. But what Prism’s fancy PowerPoint decks and self-aggrandising logo suggest to me is not so much an implacable, omniscient overseer as a bunch of suits in shabby cubicles trying to persuade each other they’re still relevant. After all, there’s little need for state surveillance when we’re doing such a good job of spying on ourselves. Big Brother isn’t watching us; he’s taking selfies and posting them on Instagram like everyone else. And he probably hasn’t given a second thought to what might happen to that picture of him posing with a joint.\n\nWalls are a relatively recent innovation. Members of pre-modern societies happily coexisted while carrying out almost all of their lives in public view\n\nStone’s story is hardly unique. Earlier this year, an Aeroflot air hostess was fired from her job after a picture she had taken of herself giving the finger to a cabin full of passengers circulated on Twitter. She had originally posted it to her profile on a Russian social networking site without, presumably, envisaging it becoming a global news story. Every day, embarrassments are endured, jobs lost and individuals endangered because of unforeseen consequences triggered by a tweet or a status update. Despite the many anxious articles about the latest change to Facebook’s privacy settings, we just don’t seem to be able to get our heads around the idea that when we post our private life, we publish it.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, Facebook launched the drably named ‘Graph Search’, a search engine that allows you to crawl through the data in everyone else’s profiles. Days after it went live, a tech-savvy Londoner called Tom Scott started a blog in which he posted details of searches that he had performed using the new service. By putting together imaginative combinations of ‘likes’ and profile settings he managed to turn up ‘Married people who like prostitutes’, ‘Single women nearby who like to get drunk’, and ‘Islamic men who are interested in other men and live in Tehran’ (where homosexuality is illegal).\n\nScott was careful to erase names from the screenshots he posted online: he didn’t want to land anyone in trouble with employers, or predatory sociopaths, or agents of repressive regimes, or all three at once. But his findings served as a reminder that many Facebook users are standing in their bedroom naked without realising there’s a crowd outside the window. Facebook says that as long as users are given the full range of privacy options, they can be relied on to figure them out. Privacy campaigners want Facebook and others to be clearer and more upfront with users about who can view their personal data. Both agree that users deserve to be given control over their choices.\n\nBut what if the problem isn’t Facebook’s privacy settings, but our own?\n\nA few years ago George Loewenstein, professor of behavioural economics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, set out to investigate how people think about the consequences of their privacy choices on the internet. He soon concluded that they don’t.\n\nIn one study, Loewenstein and his collaborators asked two groups of students to fill out an online survey about their lives. Everyone received the same questions, ranging from the innocuous to the embarrassing or potentially incriminating. One group was presented with an official-looking website that bore the imprimatur of their university, and were assured that their answers would remain anonymous. The other group filled out the questions on a garishly coloured website on which the question ‘How BAD Are U???’ was accompanied by a grinning devil. It featured no assurance of anonymity.\n\nBizarrely, the ‘How BAD Are U???’ website was much more likely to elicit revealing confessions, like whether a student had copied someone else’s homework or tried cocaine. The first set of respondents reacted cautiously to the institutional feel of the first website and its obscurely concerning assurances about anonymity. The second group fell under the sway of the perennial youthful imperative to be cool, and opened up, in a way that could have got them into serious trouble in the real world. The students were using their instincts about privacy, and their instincts proved to be deeply wayward. ‘Thinking about online privacy doesn’t come naturally to us,’ Loewenstein told me when I spoke to him on the phone. ‘Nothing in our evolution or culture has equipped us to deal with it.’\n\nWhen a boy hit puberty, he disappeared into the jungle, returning a man. In today’s digital culture this is precisely the stage at which we make our lives most exposed to the public gaze\n\nWe might be particularly prone to disclosing private information to a well-designed digital interface, making an unconscious and often unwise association between ease-of-use and safety. For example, a now-defunct website called Grouphug.us solicited anonymous confessions. The original format of the site was a masterpiece of bad font design: it used light grey text on a dark grey background, making it very hard to read. Then, in 2008, the site had a revamp, and a new, easier-to-read black font against a white background was adopted. The cognitive scientists Adam Alter and Danny Oppenheimer gathered a random sample of 500 confessions from either side of the change. They found that the confessions submitted after the redesign were generally far more revealing than those submitted before: instead of minor peccadilloes, people admitted to major crimes. (Facebook employs some of the best web designers in the world.)\n\nThis is not the only way our deeply embedded real-world instincts can backfire online. Take our rather noble instinct for reciprocity: returning a favour. If I reveal personal information to you, you’re more likely to reveal something to me. This works reasonably well when you can see my face and make a judgment about how likely I am to betray your confidence, but on Facebook it’s harder to tell if I’m trustworthy. Loewenstein found that people were much readier to answer probing questions if they were told that others had already answered them. This kind of rule-of-thumb — when in doubt, do what everyone else is doing — works pretty well when it comes to things such as what foods to avoid, but it’s not so reliable on the internet. As James Grimmelmann, director of the intellectual property programme at the University of Maryland, puts it in his article ‘Facebook and the Social Dynamics of Privacy’ (2008): ‘When our friends all jump off the Facebook privacy bridge, we do too.’\n\nGiving people more control over their privacy choices won’t solve these deeper problems. Indeed, Loewenstein found evidence for a ‘control paradox’. Just as many people mistakenly think that driving is safer than flying because they feel they have more control over it, so giving people more privacy settings to fiddle with makes them worry less about what they actually divulge.\n\nThen again, perhaps none of this matters. Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg is not the only tech person to suggest that privacy is an anachronistic social convention about which younger generations care little. And it’s certainly true that for most of human existence, most people have got by with very little private space, as I found when I spoke to John L Locke, professor of linguistics at Ohio University and the author of Eavesdropping: An Intimate History (2010). Locke told me that internal walls are a relatively recent innovation. There are many anthropological reports of pre-modern societies whose members happily coexisted while carrying out almost all of their lives in public view.\n\nYou might argue, then, that the internet is simply taking us back to something like a state of nature. However, hunter-gatherer societies never had to worry about invisible strangers; not to mention nosy governments, rapacious corporations or HR bosses. And even in the most open cultures, there are usually rituals of withdrawal from the arena. ‘People have always sought refuge from the public gaze,’ Locke said, citing the work of Paul Fejos, a Hungarian-born anthropologist who, in the 1940s, studied the Yagua people of Northern Peru, who lived in houses of up to 50 people. There were no partitions, but inhabitants could achieve privacy any time they wanted by simply turning away. ‘No one in the house,’ wrote Fejos, ‘will look upon, or observe, one who is in private facing the wall, no matter how urgently he may wish to talk to him.’\n\nThe need for privacy remains, but the means to meet it — our privacy instincts — are no longer fit for purpose\n\nFrom the 1960s onwards, Thomas Gregor, professor of anthropology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, studied an indigenous Brazilian tribe called the Mehinaku, who lived in oval huts with no internal walls, each housing a family of 10 or 12. Mehinaku villagers were expected to remove themselves altogether from the life of the village at important stages of life, such as adolescence. When a boy hit puberty, he disappeared into the jungle, returning a man. In today’s digital culture, of course, this is precisely the stage at which we make our lives most exposed to the public gaze.\n\nGrimmelmann thinks the suggestion that we are voluntarily waving goodbye to privacy is nonsense: ‘The way we think about privacy might change, but the instinct for it runs deep.’ He points out that today’s teenagers retain as fierce a sense of their own private space as previous generations. But it’s much easier to shut the bedroom door than it is to prevent the spread of your texts or photos through an online network. The need for privacy remains, but the means to meet it — our privacy instincts — are no longer fit for purpose.\n\nOver time, we will probably get smarter about online sharing. But right now, we’re pretty stupid about it. Perhaps this is because, at some primal level, we don’t really believe in the internet. Humans evolved their instinct for privacy in a world where words and acts disappeared the moment they were spoken or made. Our brains are barely getting used to the idea that our thoughts or actions can be written down or photographed, let alone take on a free-floating, indestructible life of their own. Until we catch up, we’ll continue to overshare.\n\nA long-serving New York Times journalist who recently left his post was clearing his desk when he came across an internal memo from 1983 on computer policy. It said that while computers could be used to communicate, they should never be used for indiscreet or potentially embarrassing messages: ‘We have typewriters for that.’ Thirty years later, and the Kremlin’s security agency has concluded that The New York Times IT department was on to something: it recently put in an order for electric typewriters. An agency source told Russia’s Izvestiya newspaper that, following the WikiLeaks and Snowden scandals, and the bugging of the Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev at the G20 summit in London, ‘it has been decided to expand the practice of creating paper documents’.\n\nIts invention enabled us to capture and store our thoughts and memories but, today, the best thing about paper is that it can be shredded.",

So are the seasteaders. And the gun-hoarding survivalists of all stripes. And those of us who are interested in reviving the New York City Secession Movement. (Our plan is to secede and then, uh, magically raise the city by 30 feet. Still working on details there, do check back.) But yes. The coasts will drown, or the United States will disband, or World War III will come, or the currency will go belly-up, or the NATO black helicopters will take us out, or the squirrels will take over, or some combination thereof will occur in the not terribly distant future.\n\nThese concerns inspired the dream of the arcology, which gripped SF writers for decades. A self-sustaining city-state is the simplest way to deal with generation ships, post-apocalyptic societies, climate change and the future of overpopulation, after all. And Mussolini even kind of tried it, with the planned city EUR, so it must be a good idea.\n\nPaolo Soleri gets credit for the term.

You get to make some crazy plan, and then, if you’re Zaha Hadid or Norman Foster, you maybe get to build a cool museum or a mildly green train station now and then. But for everything else, everyone on the Internet passes around your renderings, presenting them as news. The problem being: renderings are never news, because they almost never get built. Anyone who’s looked at New York City’s building process in the last 12 years should know that at a fundamental level.\n\nBut some arcologies came close. A few even exist! And a few others probably should.\n\nThe Shimizu TRY 2004 Mega-City Pyramid\n\nThis is “a proposed project for construction of a massive pyramid over Tokyo Bay in Japan.

So Mubadala is an amazing thing: a financial firm, an aerospace research and production firm, a healthcare firm, and basically everything else you would shove into one company if you were super-smart and had all of the money and were also THE GOVERNMENT. Mindblowing, right?\n\nSo “Masdar City” is actually a special economic zone — while being half-residential at the same time. Why would you put your company there? “The benefits of setting up in Masdar City include 100% foreign ownership with no restrictions on capital movements, profits or quotas, strong IP protection framework, zero per cent import tariffs, zero per cent corporate or individual tax and zero currency restrictions.” Ah.\n\nhttps://medium.com/media/fd2ddb4aa3d12dbb135e0d9f42a6ff60/href\n\nEven in a country of wild resources, Masdar City has been scaled back: “the final population will probably not exceed 40,000 and the completion date has been put at 2021 or 2025.

Flights into Moscow’s Domodedovo airport bank sharply over the proposed site shortly before landing. “ Oh and: “However construction has not yet begun, and has been postponed due to the economic crisis — whether it’ll start up again remains to be seen.” Spoiler: unlikely. (Not to be confused with Shenzen’s Crystal Island! Which won a design competition in 2009 and also will never exist.)\n\nAlso: it seems to no longer appear on Foster + Partners’ website.

The incident demonstrates precisely how a dysfunctional campus culture—which is prevalent on so many campuses today and blooms in the absence of speech-friendly policies—can so easily lead to censorship and viewpoint-based discrimination.\n\nAccording to The Atlantic, Israeli filmmaker Shimon Dotan was invited to screen his documentary film The Settlers at a religion and film conference at SU in March 2017. A few weeks after the award-winning filmmaker was invited by one of the conference’s faculty organizers, he received an email from another of the organizers, Professor M. Gail Hamner of SU’s Department of Religion, stating the following:\n\nI now am embarrassed to share that my SU colleagues, on hearing about my attempt to secure your presentation, have warned me that the BDS faction on campus will make matters very unpleasant for you and for me if you come. In particular my film colleague in English who granted me affiliated faculty in the film and screen studies program and who supported my proposal to the Humanities Council for this conference told me point blank that if I have not myself seen your film and cannot myself vouch for it to the Council, I will lose credibility with a number of film and Women/Gender studies colleagues. Sadly, I have not had the chance to see your film and can only vouch for it through my friend and through published reviews. Clearly I am politically naive. I also feel tremendous shame in reneging on a half-offered invitation.\n\nLet’s break this down: Dotan was disinvited because one or more members of the SU faculty feared professional repercussions for allowing a politically controversial film to be shown on campus. SU’s policies state that the university is “committed to the principle that freedom of discussion is essential to the search for truth and, consequently, welcomes and encourages the expression of dissent.” But rather than allowing the film to foster a discussion on Israeli politics, Professor Hamner disinvited Dotan because of the backlash she anticipated due to the topic of his film.\n\nThe unfettered debate and freedom of discussion promised by SU means nothing if university professors refuse to to uphold these principles in practice. Rather than shying away from politically charged films, professors should embrace such works and the ensuing discussions they raise. After all, if professors at SU or any university refused to show every film that potentially offended a faction on campus, very few noteworthy films could be shown at all.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the first time free speech has been stifled at SU: In 2011, SU expelled a school of education student for a Facebook comment, and the campus police threatened students with disciplinary action if they wore offensive Halloween costumes. In 2010, SU investigated a law student for his satirical blog about the law school. In other words, SU has a disturbing history of disrespect for the freedom of expression—a particularly ironic one, considering the First Amendment is emblazoned on its S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.\n\nLike these prior incidents, Dotan’s disinvitation is another instance where expression was stifled at SU merely because it might offend someone. It is also inherently misguided: Professor Hamner admitted that she had not even seen the film prior to disinviting Dotan. If she had, she might have realized that the film is actually critical of the Israeli settlers. Dotan was not too pleased, writing to the colleague who originally invited him:\n\nGail Hamner rejected the idea of inviting the film without seeing it! She didn’t even ask to see it. All she was concerned about is that BDS activists may not be happy with the screening of an Israeli film at Syracuse. That is really troubling. And that happens at a University, at a temple of freedom of speech, or so we want to believe.\n\nFinally, the administration stepped in by re-inviting Dotan to screen his film. It issued several statements attributing the disinvitation controversy to a big misunderstanding and expounding on its opposition to the BDS movement and its support for free speech. However, the damage had already been done.\n\nSU Associate Professor Miriam F. Elman, a faculty advisor to a campus Israeli-Palestinian dialogue group, tweeted about what she called a “blatant violation of #freespeech & academic freedom,” as well as the reversal:\n\n@TheAtlantic regret this blatant violation of #freespeech & academic freedom on my campus. This isn’t who we are @SUMaxwell @SyracuseU — Miriam F. Elman (@MiriamElman) September 1, 2016\n\nFIRE eagerly awaits an update on SU’s soon-to-be-revised policies—ones we hope will encourage a culture of free expression on campus, and ensure a disinvitation like this one never happens again.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this post misstated the years in which SU investigated or punished student speech. Those dates have been corrected. FIRE regrets the errors.",

  "latent_12445": "Nintendo has always been known to march to the beat of its own drum, and its marketing presence in the past few months in Canada is no exception.\n\nTake for instance Friday, dubbed Nintendo Day, with the simultaneous launch of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Pokémon Alpha Sapphire and\n\nOmega Ruby, and its new line of Amiibo figures.\n\nIn order to build anticipation and hype, Nintendo held a promotional event in downtown Toronto. But it wasn’t the kind of marketing event you might be familiar with.\n\nVideo game companies often hold events for both the press and the public on the eve of a big game’s launch, especially during the holiday season. Last month, for example, Ubisoft took over the Liberty Grand hall to celebrate the launch of Assassin’s Creed: Unity and decked it out with actors in Napoleonic military uniforms, live music and luxurious catering.\n\nInstead of a similarly lavish setting, Nintendo plonked itself on the Skywalk adjacent to Union Station, right in the middle of thousands of Torontonians’ commute.\n\nFans crowded the concrete floor where stations were set up to play Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and Pokémon on the 3DS. An announcer shouted into a mic like a pro wrestling announcer as some fans got to play 8 Player Smash on a large screen. Two people dressed in Mario and Luigi costumes posed in from of a giant cake covered in video game logos and a near-fluorescent Smash Ball (the most coveted item in Super Smash Bros.).\n\nYou might think Nintendo’s going the low-budget route for its promotions – it’s easy to fit into the narrative of the slumping Wii U console, and repeated failures to meet its expected sales quarter after quarter, to the point where Nintendo of Japan’s CEO Satoru Iwata had to make multiple public apologies to shareholders in the past two years.\n\nBut a second look reveals a savvy marketing campaign designed to get the word out to a much wider audience. People walking through the boarded-up bowels of Union Station got a first-hand look at brand new games on beautiful, high-end screens, with dozens of super-fans eating it all up.\n\nA few passersby seemed uninterested and annoyed that Nintendo took up most of the walkway’s width, but many others looked amused and/or delighted by the scene – constructed by public relations strategists though it might be – in the middle of their everyday commute.\n\nAnd thanks to the Skywalk’s floor-to-ceiling windows on one end, countless drivers and pedestrians on Front Street got a glance at the crowd and meters-high portraits of Mario, Kirby and Pikachu.\n\nThe strategy seems to be paying off this year. On Tuesday, Nintendo announced that Super Smash Bros. for Wii U has sold more than 500,000 physical and digital copies combined since Friday. And since its release in May, Mario Kart 8 has sold 3.49 million units, or roughly half the entire Wii U install base.\n\nSmash Bros. in particular has enjoyed an unusual promotional campaign. The Smash Club for Canada, a roving series of events with a vaguely fighting game tournament-type vibe, was announced by Nintendo of America’s president Reggie Fils-Aime drenching a stack of pancakes with Canadian maple syrup from a can, handed to him by a fully uniformed hockey player.\n\nOur games are full of innovation, right? And so we definitely want in our marketing to be full of innovation as well\n\nThe events favoured the public over press and VIPs in suits, organizing them in tournament-type “heats” to play the full version of Smash Bros. for both the 3DS and Wii U. At one such event in Toronto, held in a warehouse-like venue on the Lakeshore, a projector showed a list of rules that were a mix of gameplay guidelines and rhetoric from David Fincher’s Fight Club.\n\nStudents with backpacks and fans in cosplay were the rule, rather than executives in suits and programmers in flannel.\n\nNot convinced? Then how about this Mario-themed number on this week’s Dancing With the Stars, as the duo of Sadie Robertson and Mark Ballas danced next to a giant Koopa Shell and banana peel, to an arrangement made by Nintendo composer Koji Kondo. Cross-brand promotion has never been weirder.\n\n“Our games are full of innovation, right? And so we definitely want in our marketing to be full of innovation as well,” explained Pierre-Paul Trepanier, Nintendo of Canada’s general manager. “ So I think it’s a good thing that we don’t do what everybody else does. We try to do things differently – in everything we do.”\n\nIt seems that Nintendo, at least in Canada, are too busy with its offbeat promotions to worry about the cutthroat console horse race. In the meantime, it’s taking its games – and its fervent fandom – to the streets.\n\n“We have such loyal, devoted, strong fans in Canada, and we’re really excited about just throwing a part for them, and inviting them over, and having a good time with them,” Trepanier said.\n\nYou can read more of Jonathan Ore’s work at Dorkshelf",
  "latent_12457": "For Love Andujar, a single mother in the Bronx, facing the latest MTA fare increase means struggling to choose between buying a gallon of milk for her two children, or putting money on her MetroCard to get to work.\n\nAndujar, who recently left her job to care for her son and grandmother, is currently enrolled in a program to re-enter the workforce. But she says it’s difficult to attend because she often can’t afford the cost of a MetroCard.\n\n“There’ve been times where I’ve had to call out from work or miss school so I could give my fare to my child,” says Andujar. “What happens to people like me? The cost of $135 a month is a lot of money for me. It puts me in a position to have to sacrifice food or an activity with my kids just to be able to go out and find work.”\n\nAndujar was one of many Bronx residents, community advocates, and elected officials to testify at a Bronx public hearing on two MTA fare hike proposals on Tuesday night. Attendees urged the MTA board members to consider the impact of the impending 4 percent increase on fares and tolls of subways, bridges, and tunnels on commuters, especially when current fares are unaffordable for low-income New Yorkers.\n\nOne of the two plans set to be implemented in March would keep the base fare at $2.75, but reduce the 11 percent bonus riders get for putting $5.50 on their card to 5 percent. The second option would increase the base fare of a MetroCard swipe to $3 with a purchase bonus of 16 percent.\n\nRonald Griffin, a Bronx resident and member of the Riders Alliance, a commuter advocacy group, says he can’t afford a MetroCard for himself or his two sons, who are both in college.\n\n“I shouldn’t have to think: do I buy groceries, pay my rent, or buy a MetroCard?” says Griffin, 46. “I think that, soon, this city will only be for the rich.”\n\nAccording to a report released in April by the Community Service Society, an antipoverty non-profit organization, one of four low-income working New Yorkers cannot afford bus and subway fares. The Community Service Society, along with Riders Alliance, are pushing Mayor Bill de Blasio to consider subsidized fares for the approximately 800,000 New Yorkers at or below the poverty line, and include an additional $200 million in funding for half-price MetroCards in the executive budget for January.\n\n“We have this real emergency where folks have to sacrifice meals for MetroCards,” Rebecca Bailin, campaign manager of Riders Alliance, tells the Voice. “Meanwhile, the fares continue to go up and still we see terrible service, signal malfunctions, transit deserts, a lack of buses. Mayor de Blasio ran on a platform of economic equality, and that’s part of why we’re asking him to alleviate poverty and get people to work, school, and doctor’s appointments.”\n\nA majority of Council Members and several borough presidents support the idea. Bronx Deputy Borough President, Aurelia Greene, speaking on behalf of Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr., noted the Community Service Society report’s findings that transit expenses often exceeded 10 percent of family budgets for the working poor, and the “Fair Fare” program could save riders up to $700 each year off monthly unlimited passes.\n\n“For a relatively small amount of money, considering the size of the city’s budget, we can make the lives of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers appreciably better,” Greene told the board members.\n\nHere are the upcoming MTA hearings on the fare increase scheduled for this month:\n\nThursday, December 15, 2016:\n\nWest of Hudson\n\nCrowne Plaza Suffern\n\nMontebello Ballroom\n\n3 Executive Blvd\n\nSuffern, NY.\n\nRegistration period is open from 4 to 8 p.m. Hearing begins at 5 p.m.\n\nBy Metro-North: from Hoboken Terminal New Jersey to Suffern Station where taxi service is available\n\nMonday, December 19, 2016:\n\nBrooklyn\n\nWalt Whitman Theater at Brooklyn College\n\n2900 Campus Road (near the junction of Nostrand Avenue and Avenue H)\n\nBrooklyn, NY.\n\nRegistration period is open from 4 to 8 p.m. Hearing begins at 5 p.m.\n\nBy Subway: 2 or 5 train to Flatbush Av-Brooklyn College\n\nBy Bus: B6, B11, B41, B41-LTD, B44, B44 SBS, B103, Q35\n\nTuesday, December 20, 2016:\n\nWestchester\n\nNew York Power Authority\n\nJaguar Room\n\n123 Main Street (Enter on Hamilton Ave.)\n\nWhite Plains, NY.\n\nRegistration period is open from 4 to 8 p.m. Hearing begins at 5 p.m.\n\nBy Metro-North: to White Plains Station",

  "latent_12556": "Austerity Bomb? Don’t Panic. Keep Your Eyes on the Prize.\n\n“Austerity bomb” is the metaphor of the day. First introduced by Brian Beutler, it has now been endorsed by Paul Krugman as a replacement for “fiscal cliff.” Both are bad metaphors. They invite us to think that the most important thing on the national agenda is to avoid the cliff or defuse the bomb before disaster strikes. Instead, we need to stay calm keep our eyes on the prize, that is, on real reform of our muddled fiscal policy. Unless we are willing to look beyond what happens at the end of the year, we risk being panicked into a deal that will leave us in an even worse fiscal mess than we are in now. Here are the three long-term considerations that should be at the center of budget negotiations:\n\n1. How Big a Government do we want?\n\nThe first question we should be asking is how large federal government we want. As the chart shows, over the past 50 years total federal government expenditures have averaged about 21.5 percent of GDP. During the recent presidential campaign, GOP candidate Mitt Romney proposed holding them at 20 percent. In an earlier budget plan, his vice-presidential running mate Paul Ryan had proposed an even lower target. During the upcoming budget negotiations, Republicans will apply a lot of pressure to reach a deal that includes a spending cap of 20 percent or less.\n\nHere are two good reasons to think that 20 percent is not enough.\n\nOne is that federal spending at 20 percent of GDP today would not provide the same level of services that U.S. citizens received in the 1960s and 1970s, when spending was last at that level for an extended period. In 1960, the elderly dependency ratio—the number of people 65 and older per 100 people of working age—was 15. Today it is 22. In in ten years it will be 29. It is simple arithmetic to see that government spending of 20 percent of GDP today will either provide a much lower level of support to senior citizens than in the past, or a much lower level of spending on courts, education, infrastructure, military and the rest of the budget. In short, 20 percent would not mean a return to the normal post-World War II level of government services, as is often said, but rather, something much below that level.\n\nThe second reason is that there is little evidence that a majority of voters of either party are willing to accept a federal government capped at 20 percent of GDP. Romney and Ryan ran on that platform in the 2012 election and lost. In fact, Republicans have lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. The votes their party do get come disproportionately from older voters. How long will they go on voting for a party whose platform is based on cutting their benefits?\n\nFurthermore, in past periods when Republicans controlled the White House, and sometimes Congress, as well, federal spending regularly exceeded the 20 percent target. Spending averaged 22.7 percent of potential GDP during the Reagan years and 21 percent during the administration of George W. Bush. The reality is that the GOP coalition includes spenders as well as cutters—spenders on military hardware, on farm subsidies, on entitlements for the loyal ranks of senior Republican voters, and more. When push comes to shove, the spenders prevail.\n\nIt would be worse than pointless to accept a deal that, explicitly or implicitly, imposes an unrealistically low spending cap as the price for defusing the austerity bomb. Any such deal would just have to be redone in a few years, by which time the budget would be in worse shape than it is now. Yet that is just what is being offered by conservatives as the price for reaching an agreement by the end of the year.\n\nNegotiators endlessly obsess over the ratio of spending cuts to revenue increases. Republicans are, reluctantly, allowing that they will accept some small revenue increases, but only if they get three or four dollars of spending cuts per dollar of revenue. During the pre-election debates, President Obama hinted that he might go along with such a formula. That kind of a deal just doesn’t add up. For fiscal year 2012, spending will be about 24 percent of GDP and tax revenue about 16 percent. Starting from that benchmark, even a one-to-one ratio would leave an unrealistically low level of spending. My advice: Don’t go there.\n\n2. Focus on tax structure, not tax rates\n\nThe second focus of the budget negotiations should be the structure of the tax system. Far too much time is spent talking about tax rates. Rates are a side issue. Yes, the pending expiration of the Bush tax cuts and the resulting increase in top-end tax rates gives the Democrats a useful bargaining chip—but it is only a chip. Higher tax rates are not an end in themselves. The real goals should be broadening the tax base by closing loopholes and returning the distribution of the tax burden among income groups to something like its historical norm.\n\nSome people are saying that there is not enough money to be had by broadening the tax base, but that is a myth. It is true only if base-broadening is limited to timid measures like the proposed cap on personal deductions for high-earning households. True, such a cap would yield only moderate revenues, but there is real red meat out there if budget negotiators were only willing to go after it. For starters, here are three big-ticket items that I have argued for in the past:\n\nTax all capital gains and dividends as ordinary income. If accompanied by appropriate reforms to the corporate income tax doing so could increase revenues and simultaneously reduce the distortions and disincentives to investment decisions that are built into the present system for taxing capital income. (See details on taxing capital income here and the corporate tax here.)\n\nCompletely eliminate the home mortgage deduction for all income groups. The goal should be equal tax treatment of housing and other forms of investment. Unequal tax treatment of housing encourages speculative behavior, increases price volatility, and crowds out more productive forms of investment, all to the detriment of growth and macroeconomic stability. Contrary to popular belief, the mortgage interest deduction is not a middle-class benefit. A study by the Tax Policy Center found the deduction to be worth an average of $5,393 per year to households in the top 1 percent but just $215 per year for those in the middle 20 percent. (See details of the case against the mortgage interest deduction here.)\n\nCompletely eliminate the charitable deduction. Contrary to popular belief, less than a third of giving that qualifies for the deduction goes to genuinely charitable purposes. Furthermore, the bulk of charitable giving comes from middle- and lower-income families who do not even itemize deductions. The charitable deduction is an expensive boondoggle through which high-income taxpayers finance special-interest nonprofit ventures that masquerade as charity. (See details of the case against the charitable deduction here and here.)\n\nWould these and other changes put an unfair share of the tax burden on upper-income taxpayers? Not by historical standards. According to CBO data, from 1979 to 2007, the share of income received by the top 1 percent of taxpayers increased by 275 percent while the share of taxes paid only doubled. Reforms like the three outlined above should be viewed not as measures to soak the rich but to restore a reasonable balance.\n\n3. Focus on the structural balance, not the current balance\n\nWe have heard said again and again that the middle of a weak and incomplete recovery is a bad time to be balancing the budget. True—if we are talking about the current budget balance. Not true—if we are talking about the structural balance.\n\nWe fear the austerity bomb because its abrupt tax increases and spending cuts could throw the economy back into recession. That is a genuine worry. Austerity programs in Europe stand as a case in point. Keeping that in mind, the goal of negotiators should be to implement structural changes to budget policy that allow the recovery to continue and begin to bite only when the economy approaches full employment.\n\nThe economics of that kind of reform are straightforward. There is broad agreement on a simple rule of thumb that would ensure the long-run sustainability of fiscal policy. Briefly, the rule calls for a small structural primary balance. (The primary balance of the budget is the surplus or deficit excluding interest payments; the structural primary balance is the primary balance that would prevail when the economy is operating at potential GDP. See here for all the wonky details.) The required small primary surplus would be consistent with a small deficit of the overall budget averaged over the business cycle.\n\nAs of 2012, the structural primary balance of the federal budget is in deficit by almost 6 percent. That is why we need to make aggressive adjustments to be made to both spending and revenue, as described above. However, those adjustments do not have to come into force immediately. They should instead be agreed to now and phased in over time.\n\nThe difficulty comes not from the economics of fiscal consolidation, but from the politics. How can we guarantee that our political leaders will use the unique moment of bargaining power provided by the “austerity bomb” to make realistic, lasting fiscal reforms rather than to concoct another set of short-term fixes that will soon become unfixed? How can we be sure that policymakers will stick to the program when times turn good again, rather than squandering their boom-time surpluses as they did in the past decade? Those of us not involved in the negotiations can only offer advice, then sit nervously on the sidelines and hope.",

A musical anthropologist might write a thesis on it, but why bother?\n\nWhy bother when you have the living “Hitch-story” still on his feet, guitar strapped to his back strolling these same streets and willing to talk about it.\n\nBrian “Hitch” Hitchings, singer, songwriter, guitarist and one-third, one-fourth or one-fifth – depending on the year – of Plymouth rock’s history-making jam band, Third Left.\n\nHitch is an original, maybe the original.\n\nSure, there was live music in Plymouth before Hitch and friends appeared on the scene, but not much.\n\nAnd if you were looking for original music, not just cover bands, BH (Before Hitch) there was hardly any.\n\nWhere would they have played, anyway?\n\nThe courthouse was an actual courthouse 10 years ago.\n\nWhere the Main Street Sports Bar now sits was the Colonial Restaurant.\n\nWhere Speedwells sits today there was a used record store - not classic reissues on pristine vinyl but old albums that had seen their day.\n\nThe Pillory Pub was a souvenir store, Driftwood was adrift and the Tavern on the Wharf was full of fried fish.\n\nTen years ago downtown Plymouth featured a classic All-American Main Street, which is to say, showing its age and fading fast.\n\nThe early years\n\nTwenty years ago Hitch was at Plymouth Community Intermediate School and in his first band, Running with Scissors, with longtime collaborator, Zak Fey.\n\n“Somewhere there’s a VHS tape of our award winning performance at the PCIS talent show,” Hitchings said.\n\nRunning With Scissors played back yards, front yards, and nsometimes someone even let them in the front door, but they never had a gig downtown.\n\nThe reporter’s notes are a bit muddled here. Hitchings agreed to an interview at the restaurant of his choice and he selected Dillon’s Local, where it was a bit loud sitting right next to the band, and a little dark.\n\n“I thought it would be quiet on a Monday, a good place for an interview” Hitchings said, smiling at the band members, “but look what music does for a restaurant.”\n\nHe’s a player and a promoter.\n\n“Look what music does for a restaurant, and what it's doing for a town,” Hitch went on for a moment. “When 2020 arrives this place is going to go crazy!”\n\nHitchings puts 2020 into perspective: more people, more gigs, more music.\n\nHitchings has played on a rooftop on White Horse Beach on July third, at the center of the hurricane called Brown’s Bank, at an all-women college, a few stops on what many would say is a magical, musical mystery tour.\n\nOn this night, after the interview, it’s going to be at the Monday “Acoustic Nights” upstairs at the Middle Street BBC.\n\nDifferent venues, over 20 years, but the energy is the same.\n\nHe’s a mischievous spirit, a trickster, a troublemaker, a hell of a musician, and he seems to know everyone.\n\nHe doesn’t drop names. They come off his fingers like notes from his guitar.\n\nNames of local bands, names of local bars, names of local musicians, some here, some gone, none forgotten: Oneal Armstrong, Hayley Sabella, the Skybox, the Crow’s Nest, Upstairs at the Colonial, Speedwells, T-Bones, Johnny C, Johnny Souza, Ricky T’s, Cabbyshack, Sean O’Tooles, Brian Stratton, Brian Rojik, The Infractions…\n\nHe knew the chef at Dillons Local too, and when the waitress came to take his order, he knew her as well. He has his own menu item at Dillon’s Local.\n\nOrder “The Hitch” and you’ll get a classic grilled cheese with a sidecar of bacon.\n\nThat’s not a typo. It’s not a side order, it’s a side car: the sandwich comes hitched to a massive stack of bacon.\n\nHe’s supposed to be talking about the history of the music scene in Plymouth though and is gently reminded for the first and not the last time.\n\nHe should know that history. He was there. He is a big part of the history of live music in Plymouth.\n\nAfter Running with Scissors it was The Basics in high school, the Cosby Twins (a fraternity house band) at UMass-Lowell and then several iterations of the band that emerges out of Cape Cod Bay at low tide every year, 3rd Left.\n\n3rd Left is itself a long list of players who have come, gone, returned in different disguises: “There was me, Zak (Fey) and (Bryan) Pierce, then me, Zak, Pierce, and John Chebator, who played lead guitar and backup vocals.”\n\nThere was a time, he admits, when neither he nor Zak sang. “Too shy,” he said.\n\nThere was the Hitchings, Fey, Pierce, John Chebator, Andrew Cardoso (aux. percussion, backup vocals) version of the band. This was the band that started to break big, locally and throughout the region but still had few places to play in town.\n\nHitch stops digging in his pile of bacon to give a nod of approval to the Lindsays, the live entertainment at Dillon’s Local this night, then he wanders a bit off subject again, says that the bartenders, the waiters, the chefs and the musicians are all in this together.\n\n“We’re all just trying to entertain the customers,” he said.\n\nThen he thinks to mention the “T-Bird.” Zak Fey’s dad, Tom Fey.\n\n“I have to pay homage to the T-Bird,” Hitch says. “Without the T-Bird there would be no Scissors, no Basics, no 3rd Left.”\n\nOver and over again he mentions the Feys, as if they live on a mountaintop and dispense musical wisdom to anyone willing to make the climb.\n\nThe Feys are a musical family and a musical force in Plymouth. They play all over town, in various iterations, and mostly they’re an inspiration.\n\nMusicians will always talk about the excitement of having a place to play when they start out and they’re often not talking about a paying gig but rather, that place or person that encouraged them to play, that offered their basement or garage, that saw something in them.\n\nThe Feys are that and more, Hitchings says.\n\nThere’s Father Tom, the T-Bird, Hitch’s longtime bandmate and drummer Zak Fey, his brother Chris Fey, a pianist, guitarist, singer and hell of a drummer as well, pianist and singer Dan Fey, singer Ben Fey, pianist and singer Sheila Fey, multi-instrumentalists Pat “The Future” Fey, and youngest daughter Mal Fey, who sings and plays piano and guitar.\n\nThis is a family that would need more than one psychedelic bus if they went on the road.\n\nAfter a moment of silence in their honor, Hitch returns to the subject at hand.\n\n“Running with Scissors faded fast,\" he said. \"Couple years go by and we started a band called The Basics when we were juniors in high school. Me, Zak Fey, Andrew Hill (bass and was also in Running with Scissors) Andrew Cardoso (vocals).\n\n“The Basics was our first try at writing original music. Zak's dad recorded us with an old reel to reel. We played a battle of the bands at the Orpheum Theatre, but mostly high school graduation parties.\n\n“We jammed at Handlebar Harry's too, but then Cardoso went off to UMass Amherst and left the Basics. That shook us up a bit, but then me and Zak start trading vocal leads and getting more confident singing.\n\n“Our senior year at Plymouth North we meet Bob Torrey and his band Dead End Avenue at Ricky T's Blues Bar, where he would let us youngins play.”\n\nThere’s a seminal spot: Ricky T’s, at Cordage, at the end of the tracks, a sparsely decorated bar on the ground level of Building 1 at Cordage where you could hear live music most nights of the week.\n\nThe Basics played there – though half the band was underage – as did Bob Torrey’s band, Dead End Avenue, and a host of top local blues players.\n\nThey weren’t being paid, but Hitchings says you could feel something happening, momentum building.\n\nThe mountain of bacon had been laid to waste, and looking up with a grin Hitchings asked, “Do you remember Sean O’Tooles?”\n\nFollow Frank Mand on Twitter @frankmandOCM.",

  "latent_13035": "Download Audio\n\nThousands of low-income seniors will see a drop in their state benefits starting March 1. Officials say they have tried to mitigate the negative impacts on beneficiaries, which stem from last year’s budget cuts.\n\nIn a letter sent out February 18th by the Senior Benefits Office in Wasilla, Alaskans over 65 years old living below or near the poverty line were notified that many would see a reduction in cash assistance paid every month to help with fuel, food, and medication costs.\n\n15.8 percent of seniors in Alaska are part of the program, administered by the Division of Public Assistance within the state’s Department of Health and Human Services. Though assistance is given to 11,746 seniors state-wide, cuts were narrowed to 5,348 of the recipients in the highest income bracket in order to protect the most vulnerable seniors.\n\n“The decision to affect the top-tier was made in order to minimize the impact as much as possible for the lowest income seniors,” said Denise Daniello, executive director of the Alaska Commission on Aging.\n\nThat means an individual living on $25,760 will see his or her benefits go from $125 a month to just $47–a reduction of 62 percent.\n\nLower-income households will be unaffected. According to figures in a fact-sheet put out by the department, a senior living on $11,040 a year will continue to see $250 a month in assistance.\n\nWhile DHSS spokesperson Sarana Schell wrote in an email that no more cuts are expected to the program in the 2017 budget, Daniello believes that that amid drastic budget shortfalls for the state nothing is certain.\n\n“That’s like looking into your crystal ball,” she said. “I think all programs are susceptible to cuts.”\n\nThe Senior Benefits Program expires in 2018 unless law-makers opt to renew funding for it.",

Cargo ship's getting away? Slow it down with some neighborly torpedoes to the engine.\n\nSalvage the parts you didn't destroy and mount them on your own ship. Add insult to injury - rip enemies apart with their own guns!\n\nSwap out engine parts to change the behavior of your ship - play it like an arcade game, like a classic space game, or with full inertia and momentum.\n\nAnd all this in professional graphics and gameplay.\n\nThese aren't idle dreams - we've already done it. We just need to polish it up.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE GAME\n\nSkyjacker is based on the \"Abyss Lights\" book series written by our project lead, Eugene Zhukov. The player is the lone human in a galaxy of conflict - abducted by aliens, raised by pirates, wanted by privateers and mercenaries alike. You start on the bottom of the Pirate Stock Exchange and work your way up to the top, not by deliveries and fetch-quests, but through brutal missions like assassinations, sabotage, kidnapping, robberies, infiltrations and extractions.\n\nThere is no fixed path. You bid on the jobs you want, and if you screw up, the game doesn't end. When you succeed, you grow in prestige and power; you'll start to receive exclusive proposals and rewards, customize your ship with high-grade parts that fit your style, and build up a crew of dangerous, hopefully-loyal wingmen. And as you become strong, remember one thing: you're a pirate. With great power comes no responsibility.\n\nThe Skyjacker universe is rich in details that unfold around you. There are ten significant alien races, each with unique biological features, social structures, interlocking histories, and star faring technologies - some industrial, some organic, and a few biotech that literally farm their spaceships in deep space.\n\nWe've developed a radical set of visual designs that don't rely on classic cubic forms, to really drive home the fact that you're not in Kansas anymore, and we've got the talents of composer Krzysztof Wierzynkiewic (\"Witcher 2\" and \"Bulletstorm\") to help bring out the colors of space.\n\nOn top of the single player campaign Skyjacker also features a robust MULTIPLAYER experience. The standard game types are all available: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Last Man Standing. There’s even a Cooperative multiplayer mode, with a variety of encounters players can work together to survive. We say “can” instead of “should” - you are pirates, after all.\n\nThis is our dream, so if there’s anything else you want to know, ask away - we promise to respond as quickly as we can!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDEMO ME!\n\nYou got it!\n\nWhat you're about to experience is an alpha build of the game, a prototype. THIS IS NOT A POLISHED END PRODUCT! It's going to be buggy, it's going to have placeholders, and it's going to crash. Here are some responses up front:\n\nThere will be several color schemes available for the HUD and in-game menus.\n\nThe voices you hear are the developers and are very much temporary, there to make sure voices work and offer the right \"feel\". Professional voice actors are another thing Kickstarter will be paying for!\n\nInverse flight controls are disabled in the current demo, but will be enabled in the final version of the game. Same goes for the chase cam and third-person views.\n\nIf you just can't get it running, let us know and we'll try to sort it out.\n\nHERE is a list of links to download the demo. Please don't forget to PATCH the demo to get completely new experience!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSPACE COMBAT\n\nSpace combat is a large focus of the game. This is a place where the player uses all his skills and talents in tandem with battle features of his spacecraft to achieve mission goals. The intro video of this project's head demonstrates real gameplay of space combat in the current version of the game.\n\nSuch factors as Flight Model, vehicle physical parameters (mass, type of armor, engines power, etc.) and weaponry settings (number of fire points, types and quality of ammo, weaponry features) have a direct influence on the combat result. The player is motivated to progress in all aspects of the game to win his space battles.\n\nThe ability to break any in-game objects into their component parts is the key factor of space battle in SKYJACKER.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEVEL OF COMPLETENESS\n\nHere's what we've got:\n\n100% of the know-how and features related to the controllable demolition of compound in-game objects, including a system for construction of ships in hangars.\n\nFully realized game design documents with all basic aspects of the gameplay, all single player mission descriptions, schematics of game locations, multiplayer mode balance tables and basic scenarios, etc.\n\n90% of the total art content is complete, including 300+ visual assets for hangar mode, 80+ designs of enemy ships, numerous types of asteroids, atmospheres, planets, etc.\n\nA playable alpha build of the game as a proof in concept.\n\n16 tracks from the soundtrack, with more on the way.\n\nSpace Battle Mode screens\n\nGame Menu screens\n\nAnd here's what we need:\n\nGame missions for the campaign assembled according to the game design document, and multiplayer load balance and testing. This is the biggest task that needs funding! We have to weave the assets into an actual game.\n\nThe last 10% of art content, including solar plasma clouds, asteroids with armored tunnels for interior battles, more environmental parts to enrich locations, another pass on textures for spaceships, etc.\n\nVoice recording and localization - especially to English.\n\nTesting and debugging of the final game.\n\nWe are planning to reach beta in 8 months and a release candidate in 10. Then, another 2-3 months to stress test and stamp out all possible bugs. And then: we go gold!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\n\nWe’ve gotten this far through internal development, while running odd jobs for other developers and publishers to make ends meet. We’ve already invested years of our time and savings into reaching this point. We need your help to reach this last mark. We need your funding, because that’s how we’ll keep the lights on and our families fed.\n\nWhat do you get out of it?

It was the first company of Eugene Zhukov (CEO and Producer of Digitilus), where SKYJACKER went from by its program technology, art design and gameplay features.\n\nWe’ve been developing Skyjacker for years now as our own property.We paid the bills by working internally with over100 clients and 400+ projects under the name Abyss Lights Studio. We’ve produced content for titles like Need for Speed, League of Legends, Asterix & Obelix, Batman & Robin, World of Tanks, Penumbra, Aliens in the Attic (everyone's gotta eat), and the children's TV show \"Lazy Town\". You can check out our professional demo reel here, and our new web-site here.\n\nRecently we made the decision to focus on in-house game development. The result: Digitilus LLC, with its two offices based in Los Angeles (California , United States) and Kiev (Ukraine). Our mission is to aggressively promote the theme of space exploration, using our talents and passion to bring the genre back to life.

  "latent_13182": "The election of President Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE and the naming of several billionaires to his cabinet have raised concerns about conflicts of interests. Many Americans believe that the United States has outstanding transparency and far more than any other countries, but neither is true. The U.S. demands for the reporting of officials’ wealth is quite rudimentary. Far more public openness and scrutiny is needed.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Trump said he would release his tax returns after an audit was completed. But without a full revelation of his many business connections with foreign countries and nationals, we cannot accurately assess his conflicts of interests. That can only be done if he publishes his finances in full, which should be a legal requirement for a presidential candidate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is also the view of the U.S voters. A recent opinion poll in the swing state of North Carolina showed that 60 percent think he needs to release his returns, compared to only 32 percent who don't think it's necessary for him to do so. Similarly, 59 percent of those polled wanted to see him fully divest himself from his business interests, compared with only 32 percent who did not think it's necessary for him to take that step.\n\nLate in the day in 1966, the United States finally adopted a Freedom of Information Act, but it is unfortunately lax and full of loopholes. It does not even require exact information about assets and incomes but allows lofty reports of vast intervals of assets.\n\nIn the Nordic countries - Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden - by contrast, all asset registers and tax returns are available to anybody in the public. As a consequence, these four countries regularly top the Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International, though the United States is still decently ranked as no. 16.\n\nSweden pioneered with radical transparency in 1766. The party of the commoners had just gained power from the aristocratic party in parliament, and they wanted to expose the bribes the aristocrats had received from Russia and France. Five years later Denmark adopted a similar law, which also aimed at exposing corrupt aristocrats. The introduction of this far-reaching transparency stuck, and it has survived in all the four Nordic countries. In the 19th century, the Russian Empire conquered Finland from Sweden, which remained under czarist rule for a century, but even so its impressive transparency persisted.\n\nIn 2016, even Ukraine overtook the United States in transparency by demanding that all the most senior 100,000 officials and parliamentarians revealed their assets and incomes online exactly and in detail. To general surprise, they did so overwhelmingly. Transparency can be enforced even in pervasively corrupt societies so it should be all the easier in the United States.\n\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, an additional concern is the widespread practice of anonymous ownership through trusts or offshore companies. Delaware has become the favored offshore haven of anonymous ownership for oligarchs from all over the world. In 2012, The New York Times reported that in one single building in Wilmington, Delaware, no less than 285,000 legal entities were registered, but nothing has been done to rein in this dubious practice.\n\nGiven the current preoccupation with financing of international terrorism and money laundering, the United States needs legislation requiring information about the ultimate beneficiaries of all property registered in the country. Most European countries have such requirements.\n\nU.S. banks have become strictly regulated to stop money laundering, but recently the Wall Street Journal has revealed that “tens of billions of dollars every year move through opaque law-firm bank accounts that create a gap in U.S. money-laundering defenses.” These funds can be channeled to anonymous companies in the United States without any inspection. The legal excuse is the attorney-client privilege, which is supposed to keep communication between an attorney and his or her client secret, but the United States has extended this secrecy also to unlimited money flows. This appears to be a practice peculiar to the Untied States.\n\nWith the current U.S. rules, a dubious wealthy individual can buy substantial real estate In the United States through an anonymous offshore company registered in the United States, receiving its funding anonymously through a renowned law firm. There are simply no official controls of any step of such a transaction.\n\nThe United States would need to adopt a far more rigorous Freedom of Information Act to sort out its conflicts of interest problem. It needs also to prohibit the presence of anonymous companies on U.S. soil, and to subject U.S. law firms to the same regulations for international monetary flows as commercial banks.\n\nAnders Aslund is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington.\n\nThe views expressed by contributors are their own and are not the views of The Hill.",

In general, 67 percent were in favor of the treatment, while 65 percent said they would recommend it to other patients.\n\nThe findings were presented earlier this month at an Israeli Oncologists Union conference in Eilat. The study was led by Dr. Ido Wolf, the director of oncology at the Sheba Cancer Center, with the assistance of researchers Yasmin Leshem, Damien Urbach, Adato Berliz, Tamar Ben Ephraim and Meital Gerty.\n\nAccording to the study, the most common types of cancer for which medical marijuana is prescribed are lung cancer (21 percent ), breast cancer (12 percent ) and pancreatic cancer (10 percent ).\n\nResearchers found that an average of 325 days passed between the time that patients were diagnosed with cancer and the time that they submitted permit requests to grow or possess medical marijuana. About 81 percent of those requests cited pain resulting from the illness. Some 8 percent of patients requested medical marijuana to combat nausea, while another 8 percent complained of weakness.\n\nMost cancer patients who are currently being treated with medical marijuana are advised of the option only in the advanced stages of the illness, according to researchers. \"The treatment should be offered to the patients in earlier stages of cancer,\" the report notes.\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

According to the study, \"The treatment should be offered to patients by trained medical teams because we are dealing with an effective treatment.\"\n\nSide effects resulting from the regular use of medical marijuana were defined in the study as \"moderate.\" Dizziness was the main side effect documented by the researchers.\n\nAccording to Miri Ziv, the director of the Israel Cancer Association, \"Medical marijuana has become one of the treatments available to cancer patients in Israel in recent years [and therefore] the association believes that the issue should be regulated by the professionals in the field.\"\n\nIn recent years, the number of medical marijuana users in Israel has increased by some 66 percent per year, according to the study. To date, medical marijuana has been approved for use by about 6,000 Israelis suffering from various illnesses, the report states.\n\nWhile many legal issues related to medical marijuana use remain unresolved, Health Ministry officials believe that once the issue is fully regulated, the number of patients treated with medical marijuana will reach 40,000.\n\nOf the 12 farms authorized to cultivate medical marijuana in Israel, at least seven are currently active, according to the report. Under directives from the Health Ministry, the distribution centers currently in operation are entitled to NIS 360 a month, per patient, to supply medical marijuana. They are entitled to another NIS 24 for rolling cigarettes and NIS 100 for delivery.\n\nPatients who hold medical marijuana permits issued before 2009 are entitled to grow up to 10 plants at home, with a maximum height of 1.5 meters. Permits issued during the past two years only allow patients to possess medical marijuana, in keeping with the quantities prescribed.\n\nRead this article in Hebrew.",

  "latent_13767": "The DNC chair and Florida congresswoman changed her mind on an important issue but she and other corporate Democrats continue to betray the legacy of their party.\n\nReturn with us now to the saga of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the soul of the Democratic Party.\n\nFirst, a quick recap: Rep. Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), chair of the Democratic National Committee, also has been an advocate for the payday loan industry. The website ThinkProgress even described her as the “top Democratic ally” of “predatory payday lenders.” You know — the bottom-feeding bloodsuckers of the working poor. Yes, them.\n\nLow-income workers living from paycheck to paycheck, especially women and minorities, are the payday lenders’ prime targets — easy pickings because they’re often desperate. Twelve million Americans reportedly borrow nearly $50 billion a year through payday loans, at rates that can soar above 300 percent, sometimes even beyond 500 percent. Bethany McLean at The Atlantic recently reported that the government’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) studied millions of payday loans and found that “67 percent went to borrowers with seven or more transactions a year and that a majority of those borrowers paid more in fees than the amount of their initial loan.”\n\nYet when the CFPB was drawing up new rules to make it harder for payday predators to feast on the poor, Rep. Wasserman Schultz co-sponsored a bill to delay those new rules by two years. How, you ask, could the head of the party’s national committee embrace such an appalling exploitation of working people?\n\nJust follow the money. Last year, the payday loan industry spent $3.5 million lobbying; and as we wrote two weeks ago, in Wasserman Schultz’s home state, since 2009, payday lenders have bought protection from Democrats and Republicans alike by contributing $2.5 million or so to candidates from both parties, including her. That’s how “Representative” Wasserman Schultz, among others, wound up representing the predators instead of the poor.\n\nThat position became a major issue in her campaign for reelection to the House this year — she has a primary opponent for the first time since she entered Congress — and was even threatening the prospect of her continuing as DNC chair and presiding over the Democratic National Convention next month in Philadelphia. More than 40,000 have signed a petition calling for her removal from that post.\n\nHow, you ask, could the head of the party’s national committee embrace such an appalling exploitation of working people?\n\nShe had become a symbol of the failure of Democratic elites to understand that there is an uprising in the land. Millions of Americans are rebelling against the leadership of both parties. They are fed up with inside-the-Beltway politicians who pay only lip service to the deep needs of everyday people and the country; fed up with incumbents who ask for their votes, are given them in good faith, and then return to Washington to do the bidding of the donor class and its lobbyists.\n\nDonald Trump gets it. He has roiled and humiliated and conquered an out-of-touch Republican establishment in Washington that also ignored the popular uprising against corporate domination and crony capitalism, and now GOP titans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, spear carriers for Big Money, are being hauled around the talk-show circuit in Trump’s tumbrel, eating crow and swearing fealty to the misogynistic, bigoted and pathologically lying brute who bestrides their party.\n\nDemocratic insiders like Wasserman Schultz, however, continued to whistle past the graveyard, believing that the well-funded and well-connected Clinton machine — and general fear of a Trump regime — were enough to carry them to victory in November, despite the grass-roots disgust with a party that reeks of rot from the top. Once the champions of people who came home from work with hands dirty from toil and sweat, too many establishment Democrats went over to the dark side, taking up the cause of the well-manicured executives (think: Goldman Sachs) who write the checks and the mercenaries who deliver them (for a substantial cut, of course).\n\nThe lust for loot which now defines the Democratic establishment became pronounced in the Bill Clinton years, when the Clinton-friendly Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) abandoned its liberal roots and embraced “market-based solutions” that led to deregulation, tax breaks, and subsidies for the 1 percent. Seeking to fill coffers emptied by the loss of support from a declining labor movement, Democrats rushed into the arms of big business and crony capitalists.\n\nAnother case in point (and, alas, there are many): the Democratic governor of Connecticut, Dan Malloy, who seems to treat his state’s corporate residents far better than the 1 in 10 of his citizens who live at or below the poverty line.\n\nToo many establishment Democrats went over to the dark side, taking up the cause of the well-manicured executives (think: Goldman Sachs) who write the checks and the mercenaries who deliver them (for a substantial cut, of course).\n\nAt International Business Times last week, investigative reporter David Sirota analyzed the proposed merger of Cigna and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, a deal that would create the biggest health insurance company in the country. Cigna is based in Connecticut and Katharine Wade, the state’s insurance commissioner, appointed by Governor Malloy, is a former Cigna lobbyist with deep family ties to the company.\n\nSirota reported:\n\n“Malloy’s decision to appoint Wade to such a powerful regulatory post on the eve of the merger was not made in a vacuum,” Sirota reported. “It came after employees of Cigna, its lobbying firm Robinson & Cole and Anthem delivered more than $1.3 million to national and state political groups affiliated with Malloy, including the Democratic Governors Association (DGA), the Connecticut Democratic Party, Malloy’s own gubernatorial campaign and a political action committee supporting Connecticut Democrats [our italics]. Since Malloy’s first successful run for governor in the 2010 election cycle, donors from the insurance companies and the lobbying firm have given more than $2 million to Malloy-linked groups, according to the figures compiled by PoliticalMoneyLine and the National Institute on Money In State Politics. Almost half that cash has come in since 2015, the year the merger was announced.\n\nSirota now reports that since his investigation first was published, the state has “formally denied open records requests for information about their meetings with Cigna and Anthem, and declared that ‘any’ documents about the health insurance companies’ proposed merger that haven’t already been made public will be kept secret.” His FOIA request was turned down “one day after Anthem requested [state insurance commissioner] Wade approve an average 26 percent increase in health insurance premiums for individual plans.” So much for transparency.\n\nAnd while we’re in Connecticut, let’s also take a look at what Malloy is doing for the world’s biggest hedge fund — Bridgewater Associates, based in his state, with an estimated worth of $150 billion. The founder of the firm, Ray Dalio, is the richest man in Connecticut, by one estimate weighing in at $14.3 billion.\n\nDalio made $1.4 billion in 2015 alone, according to Institutional Investor’s Alpha magazine. That same year, his top two executives pulled in $250 million each. Yet as part of Connecticut’s campaign to keep companies from leaving the state, Malloy is taking $22 million of the public’s money and giving it to Dalio to stay put.\n\nYou might think a Democratic governor would have thrown down the gauntlet and told Bridgewater’s top three, “Get outta here! You guys made almost $2 billion among yourselves. Shake your piggy bank or look under your sofa cushions for the $22 million; we’re not milking the public for it.”\n\nBut no, Malloy and his fellow Democrats buckled. Buckled to the one-tenth of the one-tenth of the one-hundredth percent of the rich. Ordinary taxpayers will now ante up.\n\nSo given all of that, guess who’s the chairman of the platform committee for the upcoming Democratic National Convention? Right: Dan Malloy, governor of Connecticut, subsidizer of billionaires. Guess who named him? Right again: Wasserman Schultz, “top Democratic ally” of “predatory payday lenders.” We’re not making this up.\n\nNot only will Malloy be presiding over the priorities of the Democratic platform at the convention next month, he doubtless will be making the rounds with Wasserman Schultz and other party elites as they genuflect before the corporate sponsors and lobbyists she has invited to pay for the lavish fun-and-games that will surround the coronation. Many of those corporate sponsors and lobbyists have actively lobbied against progressive policies like health-care reform and a Wall Street cleanup and even contributed large sums to Republicans. Yes, we know, shocking.\n\nSo take the planks in the platform and the platitudes and promises in the speeches with a grain of salt. It’s all about the money.\n\nExcept when it’s not. Except for those moments when ordinary people rise up and declare: “Not this time!”\n\nWhich brings us back to predatory lenders and their buddy, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nLook around: There’s an uprising in the land, remember, and it isn’t going away after Hillary Clinton, now the presumptive nominee, is crowned. This year even Wasserman Schultz couldn’t ignore the decibel level of an aroused public. Unaccustomed to a challenge in the Democratic “wealth primary” where money usually favors incumbents, she now finds herself called to account by an articulate opponent who champions working people, Tim Canova. Across the country tens of thousands of consumer advocates — and tens of thousands of other progressives angry at her perceived favoritism toward Hillary Clinton — have been demanding that Wasserman Schultz resign as the party’s chair or be dumped before the convention opens Philadelphia.\n\nLook around: There’s an uprising in the land, remember, and it isn’t going away after Hillary Clinton, now the presumptive nominee, is crowned.\n\nSo last week the previously tone-deaf Wasserman Schultz perked up, did an about-face and announced she will go along with the proposed new rules on payday lending after all. At first blush, that’s good; the rules are a step in the right direction. But all that lobbying cash must have had some effect, because the new rules only go so far. A New York Times editorial calls them “a lame response” to predatory loans and says the final version of the new regulations “will need stronger, more explicit consumer protections for the new regulatory system to be effective.”\n\nNick Bourke, director of small-dollar loans for the Pew Charitable Trusts, is a man who closely follows these things and got to the heart of the matter: Not only do the proposed new rules “fall short,” they will allow payday lenders to lock out attempts at lower-cost bank loans. His judgment is stark:\n\nAs drafted, the CFPB rule would allow lenders to continue to make high-cost loans, such as a line of credit with a 15-percent transaction fee and 299-percent interest rate, or a $1,250 loan on which the borrower would repay a total of $3,700 in fees, interest and principal,” Bourke wrote. “These and many other high-cost payday installment loans are already on the market in most states, and they will thrive if the regulation takes effect without change.\n\nNonetheless, the new rules were improvement enough for Allied Progress, an organization that has taken on Wasserman Schultz in Florida’s late August primary, to declare victory. And they were enough for Wasserman Schultz to do a 180-degree turn which she clearly hopes will not too dramatically reveal her hypocrisy. “It is clear to me,” she said, “that the CFPB strikes the right balance and I look forward to working with my constituents and consumer groups as the CFPB works toward a final rule.”\n\nAll well and good, but if she survives her primary to return to Washington, be sure to keep the lights on in those rooms where the final version of the rules are negotiated. A powerful member of Congress with support from a Democrat in the White House could seriously weaken a law or a rule when the outcome is decided behind closed doors and money whispers in the ear of a politician supplicant: “I’m still here. Remember. Or else.”\n\nBut the times, they really may be a-changing, as the saga of Wasserman Schultz reveals. You can be deaf to the public’s shouts for only so long. The insurgency of popular discontent that has upended politics this year will continue no matter the results in November. For much too long now it’s been clear that money doesn’t just rule democracy, it is democracy.\n\nUntil we prove it isn’t.",
  "latent_13803": "I love this 1790 hand-colored etching by Thomas Rowlandson from the Royal Collection Trust, which depicts 12 vignettes of everyday life and work in Georgian England. Sketches like these offer us a glimpse of ordinary life in the 18th century, much as photos and videos today. These vignettes are drawn from life, and unlike the serious, well-thought out poses of formal portraits, they show people of a bygone era going about their ordinary business.\n\nIn Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen wrote of the militia visiting Meryton and Brighton. In her day, soldiers were encamped throughout Great Britain, ready to go to war at a moment’s notice or defend the homeland from invasions. Mrs. Bennet, Lydia, and Kitty were enamored with the smart bright uniforms of officers, who they regarded as quite the catch. The men passing through town provided new faces as well as relief from the routine of village life, for village folk (most of whom rarely traveled beyond the confines of their counties) moved in small and familiar social circles, for better or worse. (Mrs. Elton, anyone?)\n\nThe well-fed officer above assesses new recruits, who are obviously not officer material. One imagines that their lives in the army will not be as cushy as Captain Denny’s or Mr. Wickham’s, and that they would perform the most plebeian tasks.\n\nHigh perch phaetons were the race cars of their day and a status of wealth. It is obvious that this woman is a skilled driver, but her escort remains close at hand to ensure her safety.\n\nIncreasingly throughout this century, women were allowed to marry for love, but ensuring one’s future as a wife could be a risky business. What if she married for love and her husband turned out to be a ne’er-do-well, barely able to support his family, as with Fanny Price’s father? Aristocratic women had no choice but to follow family dictates in order maintain the family’s status or improve their fortune. Other families sought to move up social ranks through their daughter’s mate. One wonders in the image below if the young woman is married to her escort … or if she is simply taking a stroll with her father or uncle? We can only guess.\n\nThe trio below seems to be promenading along a street (or park). The women look chic in their walking outfits, the younger one wearing a hat with feathers and carrying a fan; the older woman, no doubt, making sure that her charge’s reputation remains spotless. Jane Austen began writing Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice at the end of the 18th century, when these garments were fashionable. It’s one of the many reasons why we glimpse such a variety of costumes in various Austen film adaptations. In creating movie costumes, some costume designers choose the era in which Austen wrote the first drafts of those early novels; others choose to dress their actresses in the filmy empire gowns that were popular when the books were published.\n\nTaking tea was not as formalized a ceremony at the end of the 18th century as it would become later during the 19th century. Tea was quite an expensive commodity, kept under lock and key by the mistress of the house. At Chawton Cottage, Jane was in charge of the tea chest and making tea in the morning. Servants often brewed tea from leaves that had been used by their betters, thereby imbibing a much weaker beverage.\n\nIn this group, the hostess at right dispenses the tea one guest at a time, which her footman delivers to each in turn, with the ladies having been served first. It is an afternoon tea, for the ladies are not dressed for the evening. Mrs and Miss Bates would have been often invited to tea to Hartfield, but rarely to dine, a privilege reserved for more exalted guests, like Mr. Knightley. This was just the way of the world.\n\nIt is hard to tell if this young woman is about to ride in Hyde Park or in the country. For both instances, she is suitably dressed.\n\nOne can only imagine how boring the daily routine was for the average Georgian woman, whose life was constrained by society’s strictures and who was not allowed to “work” for a living. Woman’s work consisted of sewing, overseeing the kitchens, or, as in Mrs. Austen’s case, actively taking a part in cooking, and making wines and preserves. While many ladies of the house did not sully their hands in the kitchen, they actively collected recipes, which they passed down to their cooks. On an interesting note, while tailors made men’s clothes, they did not sew the shirts. This task was left to the women, who hand-stitched shirts for their men and made clothing for their babies and the poor. Jane and Cassandra Austen often made shirts for their brothers, a fact mentioned in letters.\n\nThe image above causes me to believe that the woman being ogled may not be entirely suitable for polite company, or she may well be a widow who cares not a fig about her reputation. Her companion is openly eyeing her through his eye glass. To be sure, they might well be standing in the Pump Room in Bath, where they would be surrounded by a crowd of people. Can you imagine Lizzy Bennet holding still under such scrutiny? Methinks not.\n\nEntertainment was left to professional performers, many of whom roamed from town to town, and to talented family members. One can imagine how quiet and uneventful life in the country must have been! Had Emma liked Jane Fairfax, this scene could have shown Jane playing the pianoforte as Emma sang. Women in general contributed much to a family’s entertainment. Jane Austen wrote comedic plays in her younger years (and made up fanciful stories for her nieces and nephews as a spinster), and her mother wrote poetry. Lady Catherine de Bourgh would have been a proficient if she had ever bothered to apply herself to the pianoforte (Hah!). Modest Elizabeth Bennet considered her musical skills merely pedestrian, although Mr. Darcy was charmed by her efforts. Marianne Dashwood probably found an outlet for her passions while at the pianoforte. Austen characterized her heroines by their talents. Instead of energetically joining the family during impromptu dances, mousy Anne Elliot made herself useful at the instrument. Mary Crawford’s extraordinary talents with the harp made Edmund Bertram fall even more in love with her, whereas poor Mary Bennet committed one social faux pas after another by failing to understand that her musical talents were painful to witness.\n\nEmma’s planned outing to Box Hill was no doubt accompanied by servants, who carried the food, plates, and cutlery and laid out the repast for the party. In this scene, it seems that the soldiers performed the offices of serving the food to the ladies. Except for the boatman, I can find no evidence of servants, unless they are assembled inside the tent, which makes no sense. One soldier plays the flute to his companion, another couple promenades as they talk. A group sits on a blanket, finishing their repast and drinking wine or ale.\n\nA dog sleeps peacefully among the assembly and a female guest rests while leaning against the tent. Inside, a man sits at a table. It must have taken some effort to transport all that food and equipment, and I wonder if this was done via the boat and river earlier in the day as the rest of the party walked from the country house (visible in the background) to the picnic site. One thing is for certain, Rowlandson’s contemporaries would have known first-hand how such a picnic was contrived.\n\nA foppish gentleman in the image below examines a bill, while the inn keeper (?) looks on and a servant carries his case. This image must have been duplicated at many roadside inns and coach houses, and would not be unusual today. This scene was labeled “exchanging” money, which explains the merchant’s/innkeeper’s outstretched hand.\n\nThe man below is peering through a telescope at … what? A balloon ascent? Birds? A boat on the horizon? Curious minds want to know.\n\nThe last scene depicts vendors selling their wares, either from a stall, from containers on the pavement, or from baskets attached to donkeys. A variety of shoppers, some better dressed than others, are shown examining goods or purchasing items.\n\nOur moderns sensibilities are struck by the unhygienic way that food was sold by street vendors back then. There were no disposable plates, so one can only assume that used plates and cups were merely wiped with a wet cloth before food was ladled out to serve another diner. Many individuals lived in small one or two room “apartments” that had no kitchens. For them, eating street food was common … if they had the money.\n\nItems of clothing seem to be sold in the stall, while bulk food (potatoes, grain?) is carried by the donkeys. When the Austen family moved from Steventon to Bath, their diets changed drastically, for they had to depend on food purchased at local markets. They had grown their own vegetables in the country, and owned a cow and a few chickens and pigs. In Steventon, the Austen family could largely eat off the bounty of their land, stretching their budget, but in Bath they depended on food carted in from surrounding farms and milk from anemic city cows who lived in dank stalls and were put out to pasture in public parks. Purchased food was often doctored, and it was almost impossible to eat fresh seafood, unless one lived near the coast. For many reasons, including the matter of finding fresh and affordable food, Jane Austen must have been in shock the entire time she lived in Bath.\n\nMore about the image:\n\nCreator: Thomas Rowlandson (1757-1827) (etcher)\n\nCreation Date:\n\n27 Jun 1790\n\nMaterials:\n\nHand-coloured etching\n\nDimensions:\n\n38.5 x 28.0 cm\n\nRCIN\n\n810396\n\nDescription:\n\nA hand-coloured print with 12 vignettes of everyday life and work.

  "latent_13826": "Emma Willats has a freezer full of foxes and badgers that she is turning into traditional kilt wear.\n\nEmma is transforming roadkill into kilt wear Jonathan Addie / cropped\n\nStanding in her converted bothy workshop skinning a badger, Emma Willats is pondering just why the wild animal has such \"suicidal tendencies\".\n\n\"At the moment I'm inundated with badgers, I dunno what's going on with badgers right now, they're all getting killed.\n\n\"They're so much harder to do,\" she explains. \"Foxes are easier but I don't want all the foxes to get killed on the roads either.\"\n\nIt's a curious paradox for the vegan taxidermist who has just launched her roadkill sporran business The Dapper Dead.\n\nOnly using roadkill or animals which have died naturally for her kilt accessories, the animal-lover's stocks are largely dependant on foxes and badgers being hit by cars.\n\nShe adds: \"You don't want them to die but if they do, then you want them.\"\n\nEmma is inundated by 'suicidal' badgers Jonathan Addie\n\nEmma's career path has taken a sharp turn in the last 12 months. Running her own dog grooming business in Aberdeen for the last few years, she's swapped blow drying pets for pickling roadkill, tending to their fur with the same precision but for an entirely different purpose.\n\nAfter her partner was involved in a serious road collision, she wanted to work from home to help with his recovery, transforming the bothy at their remote cottage near Huntly in Aberdeenshire into her own taxidermy workshop.\n\nIt's an unusual move, especially for someone who identifies as a vegan. But Emma explains that she has been around taxidermy for years, studying equine science at university and spending a lot of time in a zoology department surrounded by 'pretty horrendous' attempts at preserved dead animals.\n\nLate last year she took a course in Edinburgh with renowned taxidermist George Jamieson, who helped Emma hone her skills. Completely self-taught himself, he suggested she move on from stuffed birds to tackling a Scottish kilt accessory instead, using the full face of a dead animal in a nod to more traditional styles of sporrans often worn by officers and sergeants in the military.\n\nInitially thinking the idea was \"a bit weird\", she adds: \"The more I thought about it and the more I looked at the sporrans that were out there, some of them were horrendous so I thought I can do better than that. So I went back to him and said I'd like to do a sporran class.\"\n\nEmma's sporrans are 'full mask', showing the animal's face Jonathan Addie\n\nStraight away Emma knew that she didn't want to purchase animals which were bred specifically for making fur products and so turned to roadkill. Living in a remote area surrounded by wildlife, her friends would message her to point out badgers and foxes lying by the road for her to collect for her pieces.\n\nKeeping record of her stocks, she photographs each animal she picks up for licencing purposes, calling the Scottish National Heritage in case she stumbles upon anything unusual.\n\nWith a freezer filled with animals, she says she has plenty badgers to work on, as well as a barn owl, a patagonian mara and a raccoon sent from a safari park.\n\nShe recently finished a child-sized sporran with the fur of a guinea pig, which was donated to her by the owner of a pet food store and says she has now finished six pieces with a further eight currently in progress.\n\nWhile Emma acknowledges it may seem contradictory for a vegan to work with fur for a living, her philosophy is more about repurposing and recycling animals in a modern way, allowing people to appreciate taxidermy in a new era.\n\nEmma recently made a guinea pig sporran for a child Emma Willats\n\n\"I personally have absolutely no squeamishness when it comes to dead stuff, the way I look at it is if its dead, its dead.\n\n\"If it got hit by a car it would only get thrown in a ditch by a council worker and I feel like that's a waste really.\n\n\"I feel like as long as it did not die for me to use it then I'm happy to do it basically. It's the same with the leather I use, I try to use recycled leather sofas and jackets so that it is not something that is dying for me to make something from it.\n\n\"I try and do it that way where possible so that I can feel guilt free about it.\"\n\nMany of Emma's friends understand and support her unusual stance on fur and although some people have been negative since she started her business, once she explains the roadkill and recycling elements, many become interested.\n\nAt a recent wedding show displaying her sporrans, she was delighted to discover most customers were open to the idea, with many women adding they would wear her fox sporran as a handbag.\n\nHowever, she adds: \"I did have one woman come up to me who said 'that's disgusting, its got a face' and I said to her 'well your leather bag used to have a face' and her look said it all really.\"\n\nEmma hopes her sporrans will start a discussion on fur farms Emma Willats\n\nWhile The Dapper Dead is bringing 21st century Scottish approach to taxidermy, Emma also feels it's important to start a dialogue about the use of fur in more popular styles of sporran found in kilt shops.\n\nShe says: \"The irony is, if you look at most sporrans, they've got farmed fur on them. People are all outraged by fur but nobody thinks to question the fur on their sporrans.\n\n\"A lot of the fur is animals bred, like mink, just for their fur. You'll buy that in any kilt shop and nobody bats an eyelid because it's normal but as soon as you put a face on it people start to panic.\"\n\nAs she tends to the fur of the skinned badger in her workshop, she recalls a story which hit headlines a few weeks ago with striking similarities to her own business.\n\n\"It was like every second person, I was like leave me alone with the cat handbag!\" she laughs.\n\nTurning a ginger cat into a ladies bag, modern taxidermy was suddenly thrust into the spotlight after the item was listed on Ebay - and Emma couldn't be more pleased.\n\nShe says: \"Yeah I liked it, I think she did quite a good job of it and the fact it was a handbag was quite cool because people can wear that on a more daily basis.\n\n\"It was roadkill as well so it's not like it died for the blooming bag but a lot of people were losing their minds over it.\"\n\nWant to receive the latest headlines straight to your inbox?

  "latent_13880": "(CNN) Hundreds of children, women and men who had been living at an overcrowded drug rehabilitation shelter in western Mexico were rescued in a police operation carried out Tuesday night, according to authorities.\n\nPolice found 271 people at the shelter, called \"Spiritual Awakening, Alcoholics and Drug Addicts of the West,\" in the city of Tonalá in the western state of Jalisco. The alleged victims were living in what authorities described as \"inhumane conditions.\" Police found 68 women, 91 men and 112 minors crammed into the facility.\n\nThe treatment center is located in Tonalá, Jalisco, Mexico.\n\n\"We're still in the process of completing the operation. We found very serious conditions of overcrowding. We also found that people were being fed in a subhuman and inappropriate way,\" Jalisco State's Attorney Jesús Eduardo Almaguer said in a statement.\n\nAlmaguer said his office was alerted to the problem after a complaint from a woman who says she was beaten and kept from leaving the facility until she paid 1,500 Mexican pesos (U.S. $81.83) after she went there to visit a patient.\n\nAuthorities released images of the living conditions inside the center.\n\nPictures of the treatment center released by the Jalisco State's Attorney's Office show a room with buckets of what appears to be stew and vegetables that were kept on the floor. Another image showed rooms crowded with multiple metal bunk beds in what appears to be a dorm that was also used as a storage area.\n\nRead More",

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nIran on Monday rejected Israeli and Saudi claims that the Islamic Republic was a destabilizing force in the region, saying that it came as no surprise that Jerusalem and Riyadh share the same views.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi made the comments after both Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman and Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir each said at the Munich Security Conference on Sunday that Iran constitutes a threat to each of their countries, has not moderated its behavior in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal and should face renewed economic pressure from the international community.\n\nWhile the Israeli and Saudi ministers stopped short of saying they would cooperate to thwart Iran, Qassemi said that Jerusalem and Riyadh are already working \"hand in glove\" in the Middle East and their matching assessments given on Sunday came as no surprise.“The parallelism between the positions of the Saudi foreign minister and the Israeli war minister on Iran is not coincidental. Many instances of evidence indicate coordination between the two regimes in regional cases,” Iranian official news agency Press TV quoted Qassemi as saying.Saudi accuses Iran of undermining regional securityThe Iranian official said that Liberman's and Jubeir's claims against Iran reflected their countries' \"painful desperation.\"“Both regimes think they should stir the international atmosphere against Iran as a means of making up for their multitudinous defeats and frustrations in the region,” he charged.Qassemi said that Israel's attempts to enlist a Muslim country in its efforts against Iran were \"pathetic.\"In addition to Liberman and Jubeir, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif also spoke at Sunday's Munich Security Conference. While Liberman called for an alliance with Sunni states, Jubeir did not directly respond when asked if he envisions a coalition with Israel against Tehran.Jubeir, who spoke after Liberman and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlet Cavusoglu, pointedly rejected a new Iranian call for a dialogue with Sunni Arab Gulf states, telling the conference that the Islamic Republic is trying to “upend the order” in the Middle East and seeks the destruction of Saudi Arabia.“The Iranians speak of wanting to turn a new page, wanting to look forward, not backward. This is great, but what about the present?” he asked. “We can’t ignore what they are doing in the region. We can’t ignore their constitution which calls for the export of the revolution. How can one deal with a nation whose intent is to destroy us?”Liberman, meanwhile, accused Iran of trying to undermine Saudi Arabia and termed Maj.-Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, “the No.1 terrorist in the world.”“If you ask me, ‘What is the biggest news in the Middle East?’ I think that [for] the first time since 1948 the moderate Arab world, Sunni world, understands that the biggest threat for them is not Israel, not Jews and not Zionism, but Iran and Iranian proxies,” Liberman said, pointing to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip and the Houthi militia in Yemen.Ben Lynfield and Anna Ahronheim contributed to this report.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_13969": "Gradle 3.0 is now available\n\nThe Gradle team is pleased to announce Gradle 3.0.\n\nPerformance continues to be a focus for the Gradle team and the third major release reflects this. The Gradle Daemon is a key performance enhancer, making builds up to 75% faster, but it needed to be explicitly enabled in previous versions of Gradle. This is no longer necessary as the Daemon is now enabled by default in 3.0. We’ve put a lot of effort into fixing the most significant issues with the Gradle Daemon, especially on Windows platforms. We have also been working hard to make the Gradle Daemon aware of its health and impact to the system it’s running on and use this information for self-healing actions as well as better daemon status reporting. The Gradle Daemon is the foundation for a great Gradle experience.\n\nEver wished for better IDE support when writing Gradle build scripts? This release provides the first support for Gradle Script Kotlin, which is a Kotlin-based build language for Gradle scripts. Its deep integration with both IDEA and Eclipse provides many of the things you would expect from an IDE such as auto-completion, refactoring, navigation to source, and more. Groovy is still the primary build language for Gradle scripts and will always be supported, but we are working intensely to make Gradle Script Kotlin fully production ready by the end of the year in order to provide the best possible development experience to Gradle users. See Chris Beams’s blog post for more information about this exciting new feature.\n\nAdditionally, Gradle 3.0 provides support for running on the latest Java 9 EAP builds. Users can also build and run tests using these early versions of JDK 9, but there are some limitations. Check out the section on Java 9 support below for more details.\n\nWith the release of Gradle 3.0, it’s a good time to reflect on the progress we’ve made over the last 2 years. Check out some of the improvements since Gradle 2.0. Lots of reasons to upgrade!\n\nWe’re also pleased to make available a draft of our new Performance Guide. This is intended to be a short guide that shows you how to dramatically improve your build performance in the time it takes to eat lunch. Check it out and please provide any feedback via the guide’s GitHub Issues.\n\nCheck the 3.0 release notes for more information.\n\nUpgrade Instructions\n\nSwitch your build to use Gradle 3.0 quickly by updating your wrapper properties:\n\n./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=3.0\n\nStandalone downloads are available at https://gradle.org/gradle-download/.\n\nReporting Problems\n\nIf you find a problem with Gradle 3.0, please post a reply to this topic or create a new topic in Bugs. Be sure to include which operating system you are using, the version of Gradle you upgraded from and any steps you have found that reproduce your problem.",
  "latent_14008": "In a ruling which could have far-reaching consequences for how the European Union deals with migrants in future, the European Court of Justice on Wednesday upheld the right of member states to deport asylum-seekers to the first EU country they enter.\n\nThe ruling amounted to an effective rejection of Angela Merkel’s controversial “open-door” refugee policy, which saw more than one million asylum-seekers flood into Germany.\n\nThe court ruled that the EU’s Dublin regulations, under which refugees must seek asylum in the first member state they enter, still apply despite the unprecedented influx of 2015.\n\nIn doing so, the court ignored the advice of Eleanor Sharpston, its British advocate-general, who warned that the system could leave border states “unable to cope”.\n\nThe court ruled on the cases of two Afghan sisters and a Syrian man who entered the EU during the 2015 crisis.\n\nThe Jafari sisters, Khadija and Zainab, entered the EU through Croatia after fleeing Afghanistan with their children. At the time, Mrs Merkel had opened Germany’s borders to migrants and Austria was operating a similar policy.\n\nCroatia allowed the sisters and their children to cross its territory in order to reach one of the two countries.",
  "latent_14040": "UK unemployment rose by 28,000 to 2.67 million during the three months to January, with the unemployment rate at 8.4%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nUnemployment amongst women accounted for most of the increase.\n\nThe government said the data showed the situation was \"stabilising\" but Labour said ministers were being \"complacent\".\n\nThe number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance increased by 7,200 to 1.61 million in February.\n\nEncouraging\n\nThe rise in unemployment was the lowest in almost a year.\n\n\"This is a more encouraging set of figures, with signs that the labour market is stabilising,\" said Employment Minister Chris Grayling.\n\nLabour said government schemes for creating jobs were failing.\n\n\"Britain's jobs crisis shows no signs of letting up, yet complacent ministers are failing to act,\" said shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne.\n\nPart time jobs\n\nThe figures also showed another increase in the number of part-time jobs.\n\nI could see that my confidence was being knocked and that if I didn't do something, I would get to the point that I was too scared to try Julia Gandy, Started her own business after leaving the public sector\n\nPart-time employment rose by 59,000 to 6.6 million and full-time employment fell 50,000.\n\nThe number of people working part-time because they could not find a full-time job increased by 110,000 to its highest level since records began in 1992.\n\n\"The new jobs being created are mainly part-time. These jobs are not paying enough to replace the full-time earnings that people need,\" said TUC general Secretary Brendan Barber.\n\nEarnings 'surprise'\n\nAverage earnings increased by 1.4% in the year to January, down from a rate of 1.9% in December.\n\nThe ONS figures also showed a small increase in the number of people in work - up by 9,000 in the three months to January.\n\n\"The unemployment figures aren't too bad in the sense that the level of joblessness remains high, but the level appears to have flattened out,\" said Philip Shaw from Investec.\n\n\"What is a surprise is the weakness of pay growth, with the drop in the rate of headline earnings down to 1.4%,\" he added.\n\nAusterity impact\n\nAnalysis Women have again been hit hardest by the rise in unemployment -making up nearly 80% of the increase in the jobless figures. The figures also underline the extent to which the loss of full-time jobs is being masked by an increase in part-time employment. Full-time jobs fell by 50,000 but there were 59,000 new part-time posts. Ministers meanwhile are flagging up the fact that the private sector is now creating more jobs than are being lost in the public sector. ONS staff however have cautioned against the monthly comparison figures being used by ministers to argue that month-on-month unemployment fell by 5,000. They say the Labour Market Survey is designed to take a quarterly view of unemployment.\n\nEmployment in the public sector continued to fall, according to separate figures also released by the ONS.\n\nPublic sector employment fell by 37,000 in the final quarter of 2011 to just under six million.\n\nPublic sector employment has fallen by 270,000 in total over the year.\n\nHowever, the number of people employed in private sector firms increased by 45,000 to 23 million in the final three months of 2011.\n\n\"Unsurprisingly, the public sector is bearing a considerable brunt of the pain with the austerity measures continuing to take their toll,\" said Matt Gascoigne, from recruitment consultants Badenoch and Clark.\n\nThe unemployment news follows some more positive data for the UK economy.\n\nRetail sales rose by a surprise 0.9% in January as fears of a recession faded.\n\nPositive data\n\n\"Overall, the outlook is still quite downbeat,\" said Nida Ali, economic advisor to the Ernst & Young's ITEM Club.\n\n\"Although there has been a raft of recent positive data for the UK economy in the early months of 2012, the improvement is unlikely to be enough to create more jobs.\"\n\nRecent news on employment has been mixed.\n\nOn Tuesday Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland announced 1,900 job cuts between them.\n\nHowever Jaguar Land Rover said it would create 1,000 new positions in Britain and Tesco has also announced plans to hire new staff.",
  "latent_14110": "Distributing files via DNS\n\n2015-08-03 00:19\n\nAfter publishing my Storing ASCII art in the DNS post last year, I've been thinking about using the same method to distribute files.\n\nWhile transmitting data over DNS is not a new concept, I believe it has never been done using NAPTR records. The well known iodine DNS tunnel uses NULL resource records to transmit binary data, but I wanted something which can be used with standard tools like dig. On this topic, I've recently read the Internet Draft defining the SINK resource record and it seems like it could be used and abused for some fun hacks.\n\nBack to today's topic though. The idea behind this experiment is to encode a given file in base64, and then create a NAPTR record for each line of the ouput.\n\nI used the following shell script to produce the zone file:\n\ncounter = 100 base64 rrda-1.01.tar.gz -b 64 | while read line ; do echo $1 'NAPTR' $counter '10 \"\" \"' $line '\" \"\" .' let \"counter++\" done\n\nPlease note that this snippet was created and tested on Mac OS X. On Linux, the -b option needs to be replaced by -w to wrap encoded lines.\n\nWe can query the zone to check the content of NAPTR records:\n\ndig rrda.statdns.org NAPTR +short +tcp\n\nOnce we get the NAPTR records content, we can strip the leading and trailing data to get our lines back in the original order, and decode the base64 data to recreate the file.\n\nAnd here is a one-liner to get the original file back and pipe it through tar:\n\ndig rrda.statdns.org NAPTR +short +tcp | sort | sed -e 's/[0-9]* 10 \"\" \"//g;s/\" \"\" .//g' | base64 --decode | tar xvfz -\n\nFor extra points, the zone used to distribute files can be signed with DNSSEC, in order to create a secure file distribution channel. This is left as an exercise to the reader.",
  "latent_14267": "Censored Part 2 — The value of giving offense\n\nScott Carpenter Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jan 6, 2016\n\nGoogle Ideas traveled to the Oslo Freedom Forum to meet with a diverse group of policy makers, artists, journalists, writers, entrepreneurs, activists, hackers, and diplomats. This is the second of a series of conversations with some of the world’s most prominent experts on the global fight for free expression, and the role that technology plays on both sides of the struggle.\n\nListen carefully the next time you hear someone on television talking about how “offensive” a comment or column or cartoon is, and you might be surprised how often you find yourself listening to someone attempting to curtail the right to free speech. It never seems quite so sinister when the person says so, but then again that’s partly the point. The right to give offense — which in some cases also means the obligation to take offense — is important precisely because it’s often the first right to be abandoned, even in otherwise free countries.\n\nKenan Malik, an English author and intellectual who writes extensively on the history of Enlightenment values, makes the case that societies ought to embrace free speech culturally as much as they enshrine it legally. “When most people think about threats to free speech they think about government censors or writers being locked up… but there is a more insidious kind of threat which is the creation of culture which says it’s wrong to give offense.” A recent Pew Research Center study found that 40% of millennials support the government restricting offensive statements against minority groups, while only roughly 25% of older generations support such laws.\n\nKenan Malik is an Indian-born English writer, lecturer, and broadcaster.\n\nRestrictions against the right to give offense often come in the form of so-called hate speech laws or blasphemy laws, which are usually described by governments as intended to protect minorities. But the cost of that protection is an erosion of the idea of free speech. Once we grant governments the right to decide what types of speech are permitted, and therefore what types of information are, or ought to be, available to citizens, the logical next step is granting governments the power to regulate the channels for that information.",

I’m sure he has the best … drugs money can buy. He can do anything to keep himself alive.\"\n\nSterling, 80, reportedly has been holed up in his Beverly Hills penthouse, having fled his Malibu mansion for fear that it’s bugged. He has been \"calling everyone, saying: ‘Tell me I’m not a racist,’\" a source told the Post, adding that the friends are refusing, thinking Sterling might be recording them.\n\nArticle continues below ...\n\nSterling was recorded privately chastising his 31-year-old girlfriend for posting photos online of herself with Lakers Hall of Famer Magic Johnson and Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp.\n\n”It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you’re associating with black people. Do you have to?” Sterling asks.\n\nOn Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver condemned the remarks, banned Sterling for life from any association with the league or his team, and fined him $2.5 million.\n\nNBA owners seem as committed as Silver to ending Sterling’s ownership of the Clippers. The league’s advisory/finance committee held its first meeting about Sterling on Thursday, two days after Silver said he would urge owners to force a sale of the team.\n\nThe 10-member committee held a conference call to discuss \"the process for termination of Donald T. Sterling’s ownership of the Los Angeles Clippers,\" NBA executive vice president Mike Bass said in a statement.\n\n\"The committee unanimously agreed to move forward as expeditiously as possible and will reconvene next week.\"\n\nA forced sale would require approval by three-fourths of the league’s 30 owners. Silver said he was confident he would get the votes.\n\nA number of big names already have expressed interest in buying the team that Sterling has owned since 1981, including Oprah Winfrey and Floyd Mayweather Jr.\n\nFirst, owners must force Sterling to give it up — which he may choose to fight. According to the league’s constitution and bylaws, Silver or an owner would have to file a written charge against Sterling, who would have five days to respond. Silver would then call a hearing of the board of governors, which would vote after hearing the evidence against Sterling.\n\nSacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive hopes it doesn’t come to that.\n\n\"I don’t want to talk about kind of the legal side of it because I can’t really comment on it, but my feeling is that I have faith in people,\" he said. \"And I would hope that at some point Mr. Sterling would come to his senses and do the right thing. That he would apologize to Magic Johnson, that he would apologize to the fans, the league, the black community and he would do the right thing and he would accept what Commissioner Silver has suggested, he would put the team up for sale and perhaps even take a very small portion of the substantial profits and donate them to a good cause.\n\n\"It’s not going to be easy to own a team where the fans don’t welcome you, where the sponsors shun you and where you’re not welcomed by the other owners. And I think he can do the right thing and, hopefully, good sense will prevail at some point.\"",

Therefore its only regular meaning is \"characterized by or related to the act of correcting\". For example, one can say \"korekta laboro\" in the sense of \"correction work\", i.e. the work that consists of correcting something. PIV has another good example: \"la korektaj reguloj de presejo\", i.e. the rules that a printing house has defined concerning how to correct manuscripts. Note, however, that this regular meaning of \"korekta\" is only very rarely needed.\n\nAlso note that while it is right to say that \"correct\" cannot be a regular meaning of \"korekta\", \"korekta\" has been used in the sense of \"correct\" by many competent Esperanto speakers, including Zamenhof himself (in his late years). So one can say that \"korekta\" does in the actual usage have this meaning, even though it is not a regular meaning.\n\nBut also note that many competent Esperanto speakers avoid the usage of \"korekta\" in the sense of \"correct\" because of its irregularity, as they want to contribute to Esperanto usage becoming more in line with the general rules. The most respected dictionary (PIV) and the most respected grammar (PMEG) both recommend avoiding \"korekta\" in the sense of \"correct\".

It’s an issue in Bavaria as much as it is an issue in Birmingham, ironically.”\n\nMr Duncan Smith said that he believed the Prime Minister “remains resolved” to push through the proposal and predicted an agreement could come in the new year.\n\nAsked why Mr Tusk said there was no consensus on the issue, Mr Duncan Smith said: “I wasn’t sure he said very much actually. I read the letter, I thought it was carefully drafted to say that the door is still open for discussions on this matter.”\n\nHe was also asked earlier by journalists whether there were any alternatives to the proposal, as Mr Tusk had suggested. “Yes, that they agree with us,” Mr Duncan Smith said. “It’s an alternative to the way that the EU sometimes goes about their business. The reality is it was in our manifesto.”\n\nThe combative remarks raise the stakes ahead of the European Council meeting in December, when detailed discussions of Britain’s renegotiation are expected to take place.\n\nMr Duncan Smith, a former Conservative leader, is presumed to be one of the most Eurosceptic members of the Cabinet.",
  "latent_14577": "NEW YORK -- Justice Department lawyers faced tough questioning from federal judges Thursday over whether former high-level officials like John Ashcroft and Robert Mueller III can be held accountable for abuses of immigration detainees in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n\"Tell me now who did it,\" Judge Richard Wesley, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, asked. \"Someone had to say it's the FBI's call.\"\n\nBut the Justice Department lawyers would not say who decided to place the fate of more than 700 Arabs and Muslims swept up on immigration violations under the FBI's control. Ashcroft was then the attorney general, Mueller the director of the FBI.\n\nFor more than a decade since Ibrahim Turkmen and other detainees filed their lawsuit in 2002, government lawyers and civil liberties advocates have been fighting a complicated battle over who can be held responsible for the harsh treatment they experienced.\n\nAfter the FBI designated them all as persons of interest in the 9/11 attacks, often on the flimsiest of evidence, the Arabs and Muslims were held in jails for months under conditions as harsh as those at the federal \"supermax\" prison in Florence, Colorado. They were banned from talking to lawyers, prevented from reading the Quran and, in some cases, slammed against walls.\n\nTwo withering reports from the Justice Department's inspector general blasted those jailhouse conditions, but no high-level official from the George W. Bush administration has ever been held accountable. The class action lawsuit against Ashcroft, Mueller and others has instead faltered, hobbled by the 2009 Supreme Court ruling in a similar case, Ashcroft v. Iqbal.\n\nIn the Iqbal case, the court ruled that wronged immigrants could only proceed with a lawsuit against Ashcroft and Mueller if they had a \"plausible\" claim that those officials knew about or directed unconstitutional discrimination. Because those plaintiffs had been denied discovery -- the legal process by which they might have been able to probe the government's documents for more evidence -- their case was fatally hamstrung.\n\nIn Turkmen v. Ashcroft, the government is similarly attempting to shut out the plaintiffs. It argues there is no plausible basis to conclude that an FBI directive to hold the plaintiffs under the tough conditions accorded to suspected terrorists -- instead of those generally accorded to immigration violators, which they by and large were -- led to the resulting abuses in Federal Bureau of Prisons custody.\n\n\"The key point here is, somebody made a decision to hold them in segregation -- but Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Mueller did not make that decision,\" said Justice Department attorney H. Thomas Byron III.\n\nJudge Rosemary Pooler asked whether that meant the warden at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Manhattan -- just blocks from where the World Trade Center towers once stood and the site of some of the worst abuses -- had led a \"rogue organization.\"\n\nIn January 2013, a U.S. district judge agreed with the Justice Department, throwing out the part of the lawsuit aimed at Ashcroft, Mueller and James Ziglar, former director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. But lawyers at the Center for Constitutional Rights are appealing to have the case against those officials reinstated, as well as pursuing other claims in the same lawsuit against Bureau of Prisons officials who directly oversaw the prisons where their clients were abused.\n\nIntense questioning from the circuit judges on Thursday suggested that they may be searching to find a way to keep Ashcroft and Mueller in the case, despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Iqbal.\n\n\"It seems to me that it is plausible that Mr. Ashcroft might be right back in this litigation,\" said Wesley.",

Washington struggled in the first half of the season, but they have won 9 of the last 10 games and 16 of the last 19. Beal is currently averaging 22.3 points shooting 46.9% from the field and 81.5% from the free throw line, all career highs. He’s also averaging 3.7 assists and 3.0 rebounds per game. Perhaps what Beal is best known for is his 3-point shooting. He averages 7.2 3-point attempts per game, which is 8th in the league, and he’s making 39% of them. When the Wizards visited Oklahoma City on November 30th, Beal shot 4/10 (40%) from three as he led Washington in scoring with 31 points. Keeping Beal in check will be key for the Thunder to come away with a victory on the road.\n\nKeys to the Game\n\nInterior is Important : Oklahoma City ranks 3rd in the NBA in rebounding with 46.1 boards per game and 2nd in points in the paint with 49.6 per game. Washington, however, is 19th in rebounds with 43.3 per game and 10th in points in the paint with 44.6 per game. In the first meeting between the Thunder and the Wizards, Washington was able to force overtime due largely to outscoring the Thunder 56-52 in the paint and out-rebounding them 48-47. Steven Adams needs to be a focal part of the Thunder’s game plan, and based on how he has been playing lately, he could have a big game.\n\n: Oklahoma City ranks 3rd in the NBA in rebounding with 46.1 boards per game and 2nd in points in the paint with 49.6 per game.

Stop the Three : The Thunder struggled to protect the perimeter on Saturday against the Warriors, allowing Golden State to make 13/31 (41.9%) from beyond the arc, and while the Wizards are not quite as proficient from deep, they still make an impressive 36.9% of their attempts from three (7th in the NBA). Fortunately for the Thunder, the Wizards only attempt 23.9 threes a game, which is 23rd in the league. Protecting the perimeter and forcing Wizards to try other methods of scoring will be key to playing solid defense and getting out of Washington with a win.\n\n: The Thunder struggled to protect the perimeter on Saturday against the Warriors, allowing Golden State to make 13/31 (41.9%) from beyond the arc, and while the Wizards are not quite as proficient from deep, they still make an impressive 36.9% of their attempts from three (7th in the NBA).

Control the Tempo: Both the Thunder and the Wizards are good teams in transition on both sides of the ball. Oklahoma City is 2nd in fast break points with 17.1 per game, while Washington is 6th with 15.2. Defensively, the Thunder allows only 11.3 fast break points per game (4th in the NBA), while the Wizards allow 11.8 (8th in the NBA). In the first matchup in Oklahoma City, the Thunder absolutely dominated the transition game scoring 25 fast break points to the Wizards’ 5 points. If Oklahoma City can have a repeat performance in their transition game, they will most assuredly have a leg up on Washington.\n\nArticle written by Zack Low.

  "latent_14628": "How to Stop Hoarding Books\n\nBrad Bollenbach Blocked Unblock Follow Following Dec 18, 2007\n\nA truly good book teaches me better than to read it. I must soon lay it down, and commence living on its hint. What I began by reading, I must finish by acting.\n\n— Henry David Thoreau\n\nMuch of who I am today grew from seeds planted by interesting literature. As a 12-year-old magician, I consumed a large part of the history and practice of the art form by way of written word. A few years later, as an up-and-coming chess player, I met Bobby Fischer in the pages of My 60 Memorable Games. Jeremy Silman’s How to Reassess Your Chess virtually revolutionized the way I looked at the game. Eckhart Tolle’s words of wisdom helped me let go of the ego, which instilled in me a social fearlessness that has made meeting women a non-issue.\n\nI am a writer today because of what words have done to me, and because delivering a message that changes people’s lives is, to me, a worthy challenge.\n\nThere is one downside to being a book lover though: I want to own them all.\n\nThe Road to Hoardom\n\nI think Maslow’s Hierarchy needs another rung: Books — just above Safety and below Love.\n\nAs much as I love to read, my shelves are full of books I haven’t gotten around to. When a blogger I admire recommends an interesting book, I can’t help myself. They’re smart. They like this book. Maybe if I read it, I’ll be smart too. Sometimes I’ll drop everything and head directly to the bookstore, because clearly this book contains secrets I must know to make my next move. I bring the book home, glance through a few chapters while sitting on the can, put it on the coffee table for later indulgence, and get back to whatever I was doing pre-bookstore-run.\n\nI don’t have time to actually read my new book yet. I’ve got a lot of work to do, and I’m already part way through a couple other ones, so it’ll have to wait.\n\nBut then a strange thing happens: Over the next couple weeks, I’ve done it again. I’ve bought another must-have book, given it some “can time”, and the last book, the one that was waiting for me on the coffee table, has silently migrated to my bookshelf, without ever getting read.\n\nMy name is Brad, and I’m a book hoarder.\n\nHow to Have Your Book and Read It Too\n\nIf you’re like me, and you love to buy far more books than you can read, how do you stop the insanity? After all, we’re not going to just stop buying books. Sometimes I hear of a book so intriguing that I’m not willing to wait until I’ve finished my current library. Giving our old books away won’t fix the overcollection problem. Even a strict book budget can be worked around by buying cheaper books. As for buying the audio version, no thanks. I learn much better with a dead tree in my hands.\n\nHere’s the solution I came up with: Make a rule that you will read X number of books you currently own before buying another one. I call this the read-to-purchase ratio.\n\nThis solution works well for me because it lets me control my book purchasing habits without requiring that I wait several years until I’ve consumed my existing selection. Had I done that, I’d still not have read the books that inspired me to create 30 sleeps. It also encourages me to read more, particularly to make more time for books than for blogs or mailing lists, knowing that I can reward myself with a new book soon enough, and not feel guilty about it.\n\nMy own read-to-purchase ratio is 5-to-1. Choosing a ratio that’ll work for you involves finding that sweet spot between how much time you have to read, how quickly you read, and how many shelves you’ve still got to get through.\n\nUsing this simple rule, you can make steady progress at taming the literary beast, without having to give up your Amazon adventures.",

  "latent_14915": "Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog,\n\nAdam Andrzejewski, CEO of OpenTheBooks.com, has just written an eye-opening piece over at Forbes detailing indefensible, yet entirely legal, conflicts of interest in Oregon.\n\nHere are a few excerpts from his piece, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown And AG Ellen Rosenblum Blaze The Oregon Trail Of Political Patronage:\n\nAs the state contemplates an income tax hike, Oregon’s elites line their pockets with taxpayer money. In 2016, as politicians across America were fleeing voter wrath, Oregon’s governor and attorney general were blazing an unlikely trail – accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from businesses with state contracts. Since 1940, at the federal level, individuals and entities negotiating or working under federal contracts are prohibited from giving political cash to candidates, parties or committees. In Oregon, however, this political patronage is perfectly legal, at least for now. Our analysis at American Transparency (OpenTheBooks.com) found 207 state contractors gave $805,876 in campaign cash to Governor Kate Brown ($518,203) and Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum ($287,673) since 2012. These businesses hold lifetime state contracts worth at least $2.6 billion. State contractor donations to the governor and attorney general represent 57 percent of current cash on hand in their campaign committees.\n\nHere’s just one example (for many more, read the entire article)\n\nWe found 41 law firms holding state contracts with a lifetime value of nearly $50 million who gave political donations to Rosenblum ($196,093 in donations) and Brown ($89,958 in donations) since 2012. Oregon outsources legal work to these firms despite Rosenblum’s Department of Justice employing up to 1,228 staffers at an annual taxpayer cost of $74 million. Why put state employees to work when you can outsource it to potential donors? By comparison, the Attorneys General of Illinois and New York have 875 and 1,685 employees respectively. Even in Illinois, where the number one manufactured product is corruption, it is illegal for state vendors with contracts over $50,000 to give campaign donations to statewide office holders. The 2011 Illinois law barred this “pay to play” practice in which contractors give campaign donations to powerful statewide office holders.

No quid pro quo or illegal activity by any elected official, company or individual referenced in this editorial is implied or intended.

Maybe he wouldn't make the Rays starting five, but I'm sure they'd find a spot for him in the bullpen.\n\nHapp wasn't thrilled to be in our bullpen, after the trade last year, I wonder how Happ-y he'd be if/when we send him down to Buffalo. That's the unfortunate thing about being one of the few guys who has options left, among those vying for a spot on the pitching staff.\n\nAnyway, glad he's signed, I think the arbitration hearings would be a bad things for a player, have him sit there and listen while his team states the reasons why he's lousy and doesn't deserve the money he's asked for from the arbitrator.",
  "latent_15247": "With President Trump issuing a flurry of executive orders in his first week in office, it’s important for everyone who opposes him to understand the history of this political tool.\n\nUnfortunately for those appalled by Trump’s directives, it cannot be said that the mere issuance of the orders is an outrageous departure from tradition. The truth is that previous presidents have successfully used executive orders to make significant policy changes.\n\nPrior experience also suggests that while it won’t necessarily be impossible to successfully challenge Trump’s executive orders in court — several of George W. Bush’s were — it will be quite difficult, since judges usually interpret presidential power broadly, especially if the legislative branch isn’t objecting.\n\nKenneth Mayer, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and one of the foremost academic experts on executive orders, points out that of the thousands of them in U.S. history, “the number of actions that have been explicitly overturned … is pretty small, we’re not talking about tens or dozens or hundreds, it’s really just a handful.”\n\nA subsequent president can rescind them, or Congress can pass laws declaring that it — rather than the president — holds the power on the issue. But that can take an extremely long time.\n\n“The fact that Trump, as all presidents have done before him … is taking action is not by itself unusual,” says Mayer.\n\nStuart Eizenstat, an attorney who served in high-level posts in the Carter and Clinton administrations, goes further. “While I may disagree with Trump in various areas, I think it’s important in the first 100 days for presidents to show action,” he argues. “Executive orders are a way of getting off to a fast start and showing a sense of direction. … As long as they’re not abused, they’re perfectly permissible and even useful to set the tone of a new administration. That’s what he was elected to do.”\n\nEizenstat himself witnessed this up close on Jimmy Carter’s first day in office, when Carter fulfilled a campaign promise by pardoning Americans who had evaded the Vietnam-era draft and issued Executive Order 11967 to facilitate the amnesty.\n\nThe good news, such as it is, is that the executive branch is only supposed to execute the law, not make it. This means that some of Trump’s executive orders are more symbolic nods to his base than a real change in governance.\n\nFor instance, Trump has loudly celebrated his Wednesday executive order calling for “the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border.” But presidents can only spend money that’s been appropriated by Congress, for the purposes Congress directed.\n\nSo if you read deep into the executive order, you’ll find that it merely instructs the secretary of homeland security to “identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall.” This means the secretary will look at money already appropriated by Congress and try to find some designated for a purpose that could somehow be interpreted as “build the wall.”\n\nIn other words, Trump’s order sets his administration looking under the federal budget’s sofa cushions for spare change, which is not going to add up to anything like the $20-$40 billion the wall would cost.\n\nWhen Trump excitedly tweeted that “we will build the wall!” it actually just meant “we will build the wall if someday Congress gives me money for it!” — something that was true before he signed the executive order.\n\nWhere Trump’s executive orders can have the most impact is in the same places where Obama has been able to act without Congress. He could reverse the Obama executive order which allowed hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to stay indefinitely. He could also temporarily block visas for anyone from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The human damage in both cases would be enormous.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by Abraham Lincoln. An executive order signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt created the legal authority for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n\nHarry Truman abolished racial discrimination in the military with an executive order. Truman used another to require “loyalty investigations” of every person hired by the executive branch, laying the foundation of political persecution which Joseph McCarthy then enthusiastically built on.\n\nSo executive orders are neither inherently good nor bad. They’re an essential mechanism of presidential power that’s been used by every president except William Henry Harrison, who presumably would have issued some if he hadn’t died after 31 days in office.\n\nThis is so because it’s impossible for Congress to pass laws that foresee every possible eventuality. Instead, the legislative branch generally sets broad goals and leaves it to the executive branch and its regulatory agencies to figure out how to accomplish them.\n\nThis leads to a profusion of executive orders that range from the incredibly picayune, such as ones giving executive branch employees a half day off on Christmas Eve, to the extremely consequential. According to David Pozen, a law professor at Columbia University and former special advisor in the Obama State Department, “the whole classification system” of the U.S. government is essentially a creation of executive orders, with no congressional involvement.\n\nThis is a problem since executive orders have been a nebulous concept from the start. As a Congressional Research Service report explains, “executive orders and proclamations are not defined in the Constitution” and “there is also no specific provision in the Constitution authorizing [them]” – hence “the ambiguity behind executive orders and proclamations poses a great concern for Congress and the public.” Until the early 20th century the government didn’t even keep close track of them and many are lost to history.\n\nSo it’s tough to confidently judge the legal legitimacy of any individual executive order, including Trump’s. The question of how far a president’s power extends is inherently a political one. If the executive branch overreaches, the whole theory of the U.S. government is that the legislative and judicial branches will — even if they agree politically with the president’s actions — be jealous of their own prerogatives and push back. But theory and practice often differ.\n\nThat said, after 241 years as a country we do have codified precedent about how executive orders work. Presidents base their authority to issue them on a combination of Article II of the Constitution (which makes the president the holder of “executive power” and commander in chief of the military, but also requires that he or she “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed”) and a claim that specific laws passed by Congress delegate the power being wielded to the executive branch.\n\nAs professor Mayer says, presidents generally get away with this — but not always. One major exception occurred in 1952, when an incipient strike threatened steel production during the Korean War. In response Truman issued Executive Order 10340, which stated that he was using his power as commander in chief to direct the secretary of commerce to nationalize and operate most of the nation’s steel factories. The steel company owners sued, and the Supreme Court eventually ruled that the president does not have the power to seize private property without authorization by Congress.\n\nSeveral of George W. Bush’s post-9/11 executive orders were also struck down thanks to lawsuits. Executive Order 13233 clamped down on public access to the records of past presidents until a court ruled that it was partially in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Obama later rescinded the order completely. Bush’s Executive Order 13224 declared that 27 organizations were “specially designated global terrorists,” but it was later partially struck down by a judge for being “unconstitutionally vague on its face” because it included no limits on the president’s power to make such a determination.\n\nObama’s Executive Order 13492, which sought to close the Guantánamo detention facility, was thwarted in a different way, mostly by the legislative branch: Congress passed laws forbidding any appropriated funds from being used to move detainees elsewhere or set up another location where they could go. (Obama himself also bears responsibility for his own executive order’s failure.)\n\nBut these are clearly exceptions, not the rule. So where does that leave Trump’s adversaries today?\n\nEizenstat has been thinking about these issues for a long time, and in an intriguing interview several decades ago objected to liberals focusing on executive orders issued by Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush that gave the White House the power to kill or water down environmental regulations. Instead, he said, they should focus on winning elections.\n\n“The law’s always up for grabs,” he argued. “The law is not an inflexible instrument like a cannon that can be lined up and fired. It’s a flexible human instrument that responds to political power. … When you have the power of the presidency, you have the capacity to put people in place who will be sensitive to upholding these laws. When you lose that authority, you’re left with futile rear-guard actions.”\n\nEizenstat feels the same today. Even worse, he says, is the counterintuitive possibility that with fellow Republicans in control of Congress, Trump may use executive orders more than Obama did as a Democrat with a GOP legislative branch — because Trump will be less fearful of challenges.\n\nOf course, none of this is what anyone horrified by Trump’s policies wants to hear, and any rational person will be alarmed to live in a country where the law is up for grabs. But we do live in a such a country, and the only course of action for Trump’s foes that’s likely to succeed is to get and hold elective political power.",
  "latent_15256": "Hurtling toward a massive financial crisis.\n\nBy Harry Dent, Senior Editor, Economy & Markets:\n\nForty-five years and counting: We’ve been on a debt spree since the early 1970s when we went off the gold standard, covering every possible angle. Trade deficits, government deficits, unfunded entitlements, private debt – you name it! Our total debt has grown 2.5-times GDP since 1971.\n\nHow could economists not see this as a problem? How is this the least bit sustainable?\n\nIt isn’t. We’re hurtling toward a massive financial crisis, and all we have to show for it are financial asset bubbles destined to burst. And when they do, they’ll wipe out the artificial wealth they’ve created for many decades… in just a few years, as they did from late 1929 into late 1932!\n\nThe chart below shows the common-sense truth.\n\nAs with any drug – and debt is a financially enhancing drug – it takes more and more to create less and less of an effect. Eventually, you reach the “zero point” where there is no effect and the drug kills you from its very strain and toxicity.\n\nWe’re rapidly approaching that zero point, after every dollar of debt has produced less and less GDP steadily since 1966:\n\nNote that the anomaly in the chart after 2008 was due to the impact of unprecedented QE. Ever since that disruption, the trends have pointed back down – making a beeline toward that zero point again.\n\nBack in 2002, Swiss investor and market prognosticator Marc Faber published a similar chart. His findings showed the zero point for debt creation would occur around 2015. With updated data, we now see that the zero point will hit around the beginning of 2017.\n\nIn other words – right about NOW!\n\nThis is why central banks around the world have failed to spurn inflation despite endless money-printing. The more money they print, the less effect it has.\n\nJust ask Japan. They’ve been doing this since 1997 with zero GDP growth and zero inflation, on average. Lately it seems like any time they get out of a recession they’re thrown right back into one!\n\nBut there is another ramification to all this money-printing…\n\nWhen central banks create money out of thin air – through the fractional reserve banking system and through QE – it has to go somewhere.\n\nWhen the economy is so indebted that consumers and companies can’t take on any new debts, the money can’t go there. So, it winds up going into financial speculation, especially as investment firms can lever up at little cost due to zero or negative interest rates. Stock prices bubble instead of inflation as the economy keeps sucking wind!\n\nSure enough, this next chart shows that debt and equity prices go hand-in-hand:\n\nIn the 20 years between 1995 and 2015, debt grew at a rate of 4.2-times GDP, and stock prices followed at 4.3-times. Total U.S. sector debt now stands at 348% of GDP, with stocks at 214%.\n\nAll told, these two combined are 588% of GDP, far more than any time in history.\n\nIs this a bubble burst waiting to happen? Count on 2017 marking the beginning of the greatest crash we’ve seen since 1929-1932. And I have a new book coming out to commemorate this occasion, The Sale of a Lifetime, which will hit shelves on September 15. It examines financial bubbles, and I couldn’t have picked a better time to release it, at the height of the greatest bubble in modern history.\n\nWe’re simply running out of time. With debt into the hundreds of trillions, rapidly growing debt-to-GDP ratios, and plummeting stocks for major banks all around the globe, it’s only a matter of time before the sky comes falling and investors get flattened! It’s no longer a question of “If,” but “When.”\n\nIn the latest infographic from Dent Research, The Global Banking Crisis 2.0, we break down the real numbers to show you what’s really going on, so you don’t end up a blind investor.

  "latent_15414": "By Shelby Smithey\n\nCompleting 409 paintings in 365 days—it’s probably as difficult as it sounds, but Pensacola artist Loren Miller plans to find out for himself at the start of the new year. His project, “American Canvas,” is a massive endeavor in which he plans to create a painting of each of the 409 National Park Service Units in one year to commemorate the 100th year anniversary.\n\n“It calculates to roughly 1.12 paintings per day, including weekends and holidays,” Miller said. “I’ll be relying on people all across the nation to help provide inspiration and reference to the many Park Service Units I could not possibly visit.”\n\nMiller is from Jay and began drawing and painting in high school. He attended the Savannah College of Art and Design and later Florida State University. He has been painting for about eight years and opened his art studio, Koa Studio, in May and has been working as a full-time artist since then.\n\nBetween portrait sittings, art classes, and tattoo sessions, Miller has started a Kickstarter campaign aimed at raising enough support to allow him to undertake his ambitious year-long art project in 2016.\n\n“Of course the largest obstacle is the amount of painting I’ll have to do in one year,” Miller said. “A total of 409 paintings in 365 days is quite a task. If the project is funded, I’ll be able to devote all of my time to the project and not have to worry about working other jobs to pay for studio rent.”\n\nMiller said that he has a great team of people that will be assisting in the creation of the prints and, most importantly, the final book.\n\n“Needless to say, I’ll be a busy man, but this is something I am very passionate about,” he said.\n\nMiller said that he grew up in a family that instilled a deep love and appreciation for the outdoors. Once he learned to paint in college, he began to combine his love of hiking and painting by creating outdoor landscape paintings.\n\n“I’ve always loved the outdoors, and Gulf Islands National Seashore has been a constant source of inspiration for my landscape artwork,” Miller said. “One evening I was talking with my good friend Tim Roberts about my paintings and upcoming painting trip to Grand Teton National Park, when we got into a discussion about the history of the NPS.”\n\nRoberts is a professional consulting historian with 321Innovations and has worked with the National Park Service many times during his career.\n\n“I discovered that other than the 59 National Parks, there are actually 350 other National Park Service units, including historic sites, monuments, parkways, battlefields, recreation areas, seashores and more,” Miller said. “All of these units are beautiful and unique, but often overshadowed by the larger parks and remembered only by the locals.\n\nMiller said that he and Roberts came up with a plan to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the NPS by highlighting every single NPS unit, which later became ‘American Canvas.”\n\n“During the last year, I have been involved with a number of projects related to the upcoming Centennial celebration but never saw any projects that were looking to encompass all of the units,” Roberts said. “Loren’s artistic ability is amazing, and the idea of him working with people all over the country to capture the essence of so many special places on canvas just seemed like a worthwhile way to celebrate America’s Best Idea.”\n\nMiller will travel to as many units as his budget allows but said that the rest depends on fellow National Park enthusiasts across the nation to be his eyes in the parks that he cannot get to. He said that most every park he’s contacted has been more than gracious in sending photo references of their parks.\n\n“The amount of traveling I’ll be able to do will depend entirely on how much money we raise,” he said. “Initially, I was worried about getting reference photos for the parks that I cannot visit. After talking to many parks and discovering their enthusiasm in helping contribute to our effort, that fear has since disappeared.”\n\nMiller said that the most challenging part will be the amount of painting involved.\n\n“Our plans are to spend some time exhibiting all of the paintings in various museums and galleries, to help raise awareness of the National Park Service,” Miller said. “After that, we plan on working with each park to sell the paintings, with part of the proceeds going to that specific park.”\n\nMiller said that his goal is to raise $35,000, which the largest bulk of will go toward supplies for paints, canvases, brushes and any other materials needed to create the paintings. He said that the second part of the money will go toward the design and creation of the book, which includes scanning and editing all of the paintings, and the introductions to each park.\n\nMiller said that the book will highlight each and every NPS unit and include information about what makes each unit so unique.\n\n“The last part will go to paying for the studio space for me to work in,” Miller said. “Being that this will be more than a full-time job, I will not have time for any other work. I will be entirely dedicated to this project during the year. Any additional funds will go to travel expenses. The more money we raise over our minimum, the more I’ll get to visit these amazing parks and paint them in person.”\n\n“The National Park System is by far America’s greatest idea, and it is my hope that with other’s help, we can celebrate it through painting in 2016,” Miller said.\n\nTo donate to Miller’s project, visit kickstarter.com and search for “American Canvas” or visit lorenmillerart.com.",

  "latent_15514": "Black students at Boston Latin, the nation’s oldest, most prestigious public school, set off a social media firestorm this week, accusing the elite exam school of ignoring the casual use of racial slurs and offensive online taunts.\n\nIn a YouTube video posted Monday, two students representing a group called Black Leaders Advocating for Change and Knowledge said the school has turned a deaf ear to their concerns about classmates’ racial slights.\n\n“We are here to make our voices heard, to show BLS administration and everyone that we refuse to be silenced and we’re not afraid to speak up,” the students say in the video. “We’re here to use this campaign to unite our community, to unite the community of black alumni and the students of color at BLS and schools like it.”\n\nThe students encourage their peers to flood social media with accounts of their experiences, using the hashtag #BlackAtBls.\n\nAmong the examples the students give in the video: “When people can walk in the halls saying (the n-word) without fear of being reprimanded” and “When your white peers are using Twitter and Facebook to put out racial slurs and negative things about students of color and you print out the tweets and give them to your headmaster in a binder and then she does nothing about it. #BlackAtBls.”\n\nLongtime Boston Latin headmaster Lynne Mooney Teta, who did not respond to a Herald request for comment, acknowledged the students in a tweet Tuesday that read: “Thank you #BLACKatBLS for bringing your concerns forward. Eager to work together to create a better BLS climate for all.”\n\nThe brouhaha has forced a meeting tomorrow between the students and school administrators.\n\nSeveral Latin students wore all black to school Tuesday in solidarity, and the # BlackAtBls hash tag exploded on Twitter this week, with current and past Boston Latin students sharing their own experiences, including:\n\n• “That one time I had to do in house suspension for cutting school because a teacher saw a black girl exiting the bldg #ItWasntMe #blackatbls”\n\n• “When people tell you you’ll get into college only because you’re black. #blackatbls”\n\n• “When your school only acknowledges their students of color when it looks good for the school and their fancy alumni #blackatbls”\n\n• “I don’t know how to describe you, you speak too white to be ghetto #blackatbls”\n\n• “When your teacher calls you the name of three different black girls in the grade ‘cause y’all look exactly alike’ #BlackatBLS”\n\n• “When people look to the 1 black person in the class to represent the black community’s views as they’re discussing black history #BlackAtBLS”\n\n• “When your teacher asks every student who was absent if they had ebola when they get back… #BlackAtBLS”\n\nCity Councilor Tito Jackson, who has worked with the students and praised them on Twitter yesterday, said Boston Latin has up to this point “not really taken these what I believe important issues to heart and actually done something about them.”\n\n“It’s my expectation that the school leadership will take the urgent and appropriate steps to ensure the best learning environment for all students at Boston Latin School,” Jackson said.\n\nRahn Dorsey, Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s chief of education, said on Boston Herald Radio yesterday that officials need to “get to some of the root issues and to talk about substantive practice changes, as well.”\n\n“Whether that’s actual or what those students feel, kind of doesn’t matter,” Dorsey said. “If it’s being raised, we need to address it.”\n\nBoston Latin’s student body is 8.5 percent black — in a district where overall, 35 percent of students are black.\n\nIn a statement, Boston Public Schools spokesman Richard Weir said leaders at the school take the students’ concerns “very seriously.”\n\n“The BLS headmaster and assistant headmasters have committed themselves to working together with the students to create a better school climate for all,.” Weir said. “They have invited members of the group to meet with them this week for an important shared dialogue to collaboratively plan a path forward and inform the next steps they will take as a school community.”\n\nBoston NAACP President Michael Curry said the concerns date back to comments some students endorsed on social media in the aftermath of the 2014 Ferguson, Mo., police shooting, including one that stated blacks “should just go back to Africa where they belong.”\n\n“It made them feel very uncomfortable, because these are kids who were sitting in the class with them, and they had to work on projects with,” said Curry, who’s met with students at Latin over the issue. “If you don’t do something about it, it can boil over, and we don’t need that is in our school system, especially at one of the premiere schools in the country.”",
  "latent_15597": "After the recent Jon Finkel/Gizmodo girl hubbub, I realized not only that are there a lot of issues about Magic players dating, but also that we’re quite passionate about those issues. If you’re a guy who plays Magic, how/what do you tell girls about it? Is it okay to hit on female Magic players, and if so, how do you do it?\n\nObviously, the issues faced by female Magic players are quite different than those faced by male players. If they’re single, being Magic players can be a lot of fun for them. The guy : girl ratio is obviously slanted heavily toward guys. These are often relatively smart men with the same passions as the women. I’ve met several women who considered one of the best parts of playing Magic to be receiving so much male attention and having such a large selection of men interested in dating them. I’ve known some women who went around dating one alpha Magic player after another. In some cases, it has even led to successful marriages.\n\nOf course, some women just want to play Magic and consider the copious amount of male attention to be a drawback. My suggestion to them would be to treat Magic just like any other co-ed activity that isn’t female-dominated. Men are going to hit on you. While this may be frustrating, being able to handle it is an important life skill for you to have. The debate of whether it’s cool aside, it’s reality, it’s going to happen, and the question is: How are you going to handle it?\n\nThere has been much written on the female Magic-playing experience lately, and I’m obviously more of an expert on the male experience, so I’m going to focus primarily on that perspective:\n\n1. How do I best interact with women who play Magic?\n\n2. How do I balance Magic and dating?\n\n3. How do I best approach the subject of being a Magic player with women who don’t play?\n\nThe first question you need to ask yourself is: How big a part of your life and your identity are playing Magic and being a Magic player? When I started playing Magic, I was engaged to be married. I quickly became obsessed with competitive Magic. At first, Linda played, too. We started by inviting people over to our house for Magic night. We taught our friends to play, gave them cards to play with, and lit candles and played eerie music by Loreena McKennitt. Soon, however, this wasn’t enough to satisfy my competitive urges. I started playing in tournaments, and I made powerful decks for Linda to play in them, too. She did well, but couldn’t handle the frustration of usually finishing second or third, but never winning. After she quit, things started to go downhill quickly.\n\nI have two vivid Magic-related memories from the late stages of our relationship. The first one was when I took her for a walk to break the news that I’d spent eighty of my precious dollars to buy a used Black Lotus for my deck. “Honey, it’ll help me win money, and besides, it’s a great investment!” The second one was when I got home from a daylong tournament on a Sunday to find her crying on the sofa. Hoping and expecting me to have been home earlier, she’d made dinner reservations at an expensive restaurant in order to surprise me (this was before cell phones were ubiquitous), and she was devastated when I came home too late for us to make it to the restaurant. In the end, I broke off the relationship for bigger reasons than its Magic-related tension, but that tension definitely had been a symptom of our problems and was among the issues that hurt our closeness.\n\nAfter breaking up with Linda, I became completely consumed with competitive Magic. Being good at Magic became a central part of my identity and a crucial pillar of my ego. My first girlfriend after Linda didn’t play Magic—I met her through my roommate, and that relationship was inevitably brief. My next major relationship was with a Magic player, and that also seemed inevitable.\n\nWhen Magic becomes your whole world, it affects how you should approach dating non-Magic-players and whether you should try to date only other Magic players. The problem with limiting yourself to dating just female Magic players is that not only are there relatively few of them, but that most other male Magic players will be pursuing them also. You have two easy outs: Either don’t have a girlfriend, or date any woman who’ll take you the way you are. Otherwise, you’ll need to work hard either to convince a desirable Magic player to date you, or to convince a desirable non-Magic-player to date you.\n\nWhile I was going to one Pro Tour after another, dating a non-Magic-player wasn’t really an option for me. I was playing Magic for hours every single day and traveling to Magic tournaments every month. Playing Magic was a primary way for me to spend time with my girlfriend. It was also one of my only opportunities to meet women, as absurd as that sounds. It’s much like any other hobby—if your life revolves around it, so does your social life. It wasn’t just with women—soon, one hundred percent of my male friends were Magic players. My non-Magic-playing friends either became Magic players or drifted apart from me. While this may seem sad and/or pathetic, it’s pretty natural when you have a passion around which your life is centered.\n\nWhile it’s not easy to attract desirable female Magic players to be your girlfriend, it is possible. The most obvious thing that you can do is be really good at Magic. All women appreciate excellence. Magic-playing women especially appreciate excellence at Magic. This dovetails nicely with a life focused around Magic. If you’re spending hours per day playing Magic, you either should be really good at it . . . or should soon get really good at it—otherwise, perhaps you’re spending too much time playing Magic.\n\nDesirable, single female Magic players have a lot of men interested in dating them, and they can afford to be picky about whom they date. In addition, if they’re attractive, you’ll be competing against non-Magic-playing men as well. While some non-Magic-playing women may think that a guy being into Magic is a deal-breaker (See Finkel, Jon), most non-Magic-playing men won’t care very much as long as they find the woman otherwise attractive.\n\nMany of the same principles that apply to pursuing non-Magic-playing women apply to pursuing Magic-playing women.\n\nBe excellent.\n\nPresent yourself well.\n\nFlirt.\n\nBe different.\n\nHave a plan.\n\nKnow your competition.\n\nKnow her.\n\nAs discussed, be excellent. In this case, winning Magic tournaments is one of the best ways to demonstrate this. Having the coolest decks and the coolest Magic collection can help, but when it comes to Magic, nothing is sexier than winning, especially winning a lot of money. If you do win an event, invite a girl out to celebrate with you. This is good for several reasons. First, you’ll get her caught up in the euphoria of your win—she’ll get a bit of a contact high from you (if you’re like most people, winning a Magic tournament gives you a high). Second, it’s a good chance for her to see you while you’re feeling smug and cocky. Despite what many say, this is like catnip for most women. After winning a tournament, you’ll be feeling confident and good about yourself—the perfect time for you to be interacting with someone you want to date. Finally, if the woman associates you winning a Magic tournament with you buying her dinner, she’ll become your cheerleader. If a woman finds herself caring about whether you win or lose, she’s now caring about you, too.\n\nPresent yourself well. This one’s pretty obvious. Many Magic players don’t seem to care about their appearance at tournaments, and that’s great for you. If you dress and groom yourself well, this will be a good way to set you apart from the competition.\n\nIf you’re good at Magic, you’re probably good at strategy. Attracting female Magic players is a competition also. Use strategy here, too. Take a moment to watch your competition in order to get good tips on what not to do:\n\nDon’t come to the event unshowered and wearing a sloppy tee-shirt and jeans.\n\nDon’t just walk up to a girl and start treating her like a noob.\n\nDon’t insult her intelligence.\n\nDon’t be a braggart.\n\nDon’t get lost in the crowd of men hovering around her.\n\nDon’t use talking loudly and forcefully about your Magic opinions as a way to get her attention.\n\nFlirt. This isn’t something special to Magic tournaments. You should use flirting as a tool with any woman who interests you. Make her laugh. Being funny is a crucial flirting tool. Make brief eye contact with her from across the room, perhaps with a knowing smile to go with it.\n\nBe different. Dressing nicely is a good start. If you’re the guy in a dress shirt and a sport coat, girls will notice you at a Magic tournament. With so much competition, you need to stand out. Obviously, you don’t want to stand out for the wrong reasons: being loud, being obnoxious, being a bad winner, or being a bad loser. You want to come across as smart, talented, classy, and clever. When I see a woman surrounded by admirers at a Magic tournament, I avoid joining them. I wait for her to come to me. While this won’t usually work if she doesn’t know you at all, you should at least wait until she’s unoccupied to approach her.\n\nHave a plan. Remember: Use strategy. If you’re good at Magic and she knows it, perhaps she’ll play Two-Headed Giant with you. Doing this will give you something to bond over and help her see your talent more. Find out places where you can “accidentally” run into her in the future and “accidentally” look your best. Show interest in things that interest her. Listen to her talk about herself, and listen sympathetically to her bad-beats stories.\n\nKnow your competition. This is closely tied in with being different. If you understand what the other men in your Magic circle have to offer, you can better figure out what you should do to be impressive.\n\nAnother fact of Magic dating life is that most desirable female Magic players have boyfriends. There are two reasons. First, many desirable women who play Magic learned Magic and became interested in it through a boyfriend. Second, if a desirable female Magic player wants a boyfriend, she’s got so many men from whom to choose that she’ll typically have one. Often, the only way to find a desirable Magic-playing woman to date is to flirt with the ones who are taken. Then, you wait for one of them to become available, or perhaps even get one to choose you over her current boyfriend. Obviously, this can be a moral gray area, but I’m not advocating directly stealing someone’s girlfriend. I’m suggesting you should make yourself desirable enough to her that she might choose to pursue you instead of her boyfriend—or at least to choose you if she breaks up with him. Still, I don’t recommend this if you care about having a friendship with her current boyfriend.\n\nKnow her. This is another principle that applies whether or not she plays Magic. If you know a woman well, you’re better equipped to woo her. Why does she play Magic? Is it because she wants to win a Pro Tour? Is she into Magic alters and art? Does she just like hanging out with gamers? Gathering information is an important part of winning a woman over. If she’s still learning and wants to get better at Magic, helping her get better can be good if you do it right. The landmines to avoid here are insulting her intelligence and coming across as condescending. If you have demonstrated enough to her that you’re really good at Magic, you should be able to tell; ideally, she’ll even approach you with a Magic question. Perhaps offer to help her test and prepare for a PTQ. Be careful to avoid being pushy. If a woman rebuffs an advance, back off immediately. Not only do you lose any shot with her if you’re pushy, you might end up looking bad to other people as well.\n\nI hope this gives you a better idea about how to approach dating Magic players. While it’s similar to dating women in general, there are other factors to take into account. Next week, I’ll be focusing more on dating non-Magic-players and on balancing Magic with a relationship. I’ll also use more of my personal experiences to help illustrate it. For now, focus on presenting yourself well and on winning at Magic. Good things will follow.",

The Atlantic's six-month season begins June 1, although it got off to an early start this year, with Tropical Storm Alberto moving through the Atlantic off the U.S. East Coast last week.\n\nNOAA also said it predicts a near-normal season for the Eastern Pacific, estimating a 70% chance of 12 to 18 named storms - with five to nine hurricanes, of which two to five would be major - for that area. The Eastern Pacific's season is May 15 to November 30.\n\nA major hurricane, designated as Category 3 or greater, has winds of well above 100 mph. The weakest hurricanes have top sustained winds of at least 74 mph, and named storms have top winds of at least 39 mph.\n\nNOAA officials said uncertainty over whether the El Nino weather pattern will form made it difficult to be more precise in predicting the Atlantic storm season.\n\n\"If (El Nino) develops by late summer to early fall ... conditions could be less conducive for hurricane formation and intensification during the peak months (August to October) of the season, possibly shifting the activity toward the lower end of the predicted range,” said Gerry Bell, lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.\n\nThe forecasts do not predict how many of the storms will reach land.\n\nThursday's predictions came as a strengthening Hurricane Bud, churning in the Pacific, appeared poised to bring heavy rain to coastal southwestern Mexico.\n\nIt is extremely rare for an Eastern Pacific hurricane to affect the U.S. mainland, though some do have an influence on Hawaii.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto broke up in the Atlantic this week and another tropical depression was causing heavy rainfall in southern Florida, Bell said. However, he said the early storms were no harbinger of a more active season than normal.\n\nFor the Atlantic, a normal season would produce 12 named storms, including six hurricanes and three major hurricanes.

Advocating primary cancer treatment with cannabis rather than just mitigation of symptoms has historically been relegated to fringe activists, with virtually no acknowledgment from mainstream drug policy reform organizations or corporations.\n\nIn just the past few months, that has all changed, and the involvement of legitimate institutions in developing cannabinoid-based anti-cancer drugs brings new credibility cannabis extract movement.\n\nPublic Companies Move Toward Cannabinoid Medicine\n\nGW Pharmaceuticals, a British pharmaceutical firm specializing in cannabis medicines, recently commenced early clinical trials for the use of extracts to treat glioblastoma multiforme, a type of brain cancer.\n\nThey also recently announced a patent on the use of cannabis extracts to treat glioma, and years ago already secured a patent on the general use of phytocannabinoids in the treatment of cancer.\n\nOther corporations are trying to improve upon the established uses of cannabinoids to kill cancer cells. Medical Marijuana Sciences, Inc., a subsidiary of Nuvilex, Inc., is working to develop advanced cannabinoid therapies that utilize encapsulation technologies.\n\nCorporations Search For Improved Delivery Systems\n\nBy encapsulating cannabinoids in a cellulose-based protective capsule, the molecules can be delivered directly to tumor sites. Nuvilex’s propriety encapsulation technology is known as “Cell-in-a-Box”.\n\nThe Chairman of MMS’ Scientific Advisory Board, Dr. Mark L. Rabe, recently presented on this topic at the Second Annual National Medical Cannabis Unity Conference.\n\n“Dr. Rabe discussed the research showing that cannabinoids kill or inhibit all the major forms of cancer, and how live-cell encapsulation could enhance those effects.”\n\nIn his presentation, Dr. Rabe discussed the research showing that cannabinoids kill or inhibit all the major forms of cancer, and how live-cell encapsulation could enhance those effects.\n\nHe also demonstrated his company’s awareness that people are already using traditional cannabis extracts to eliminate cancers, citing Dr. William Courtney’s infant brain cancer patient who went into remission solely with the use of cannabis oil.\n\nDr. Rabe’s presentation marks a revolutionary step forward in the cannabis extract movement – for the first time, a mainstream doctor at a mainstream conference presented direct evidence of cannabis treating cancer.\n\nPlandai Biotechnology is a Seattle-based firm with a presence across the world, including South Africa. An MP in the country named Dr. Mario Oriani-Ambrosini recently submitted a bill to legalize medicinal cannabis, specifically so it can be researched and used to treat cancer.\n\nAccordingly, Plandai recently submitted a request for ministerial dispensation to the Secretary of Parliament of South Africa, asking for the allowance of cannabis research. Like Nuvilex, Plandai intends to use an advanced form of cannabis extract medicine, combining live-plant nano-particle extraction with a Pheroid entrapment system to deliver pharmaceutical-grade doses of cannabinoids to specific tissues.\n\nThe press release in which Plandai announced their goals also mentions The Cancer Treatment Campaign, a movement which formed to support Dr. Oriani-Ambrosini’s legislation.\n\nGiven that people have been reporting cancer remissions from traditional cannabis extracts for years, it’s reasonable to expect that better medicines combined with modern innovation will yield even better results.",

  "latent_15925": "One of the most prominent and important UFO sighting happened in Roswell, a desert in the South-Western part of United States of America. This incident gained widespread publicity, mainly owing to the media coverage and the involvement of government to deviate the attention of people away from the Roswell Incident. On the evening of 3rd July, 1947, the first sighting happened. It was observed by Mr. Dan Wilmut and his wife, who were casually sitting in the porch of their house when they saw a disc-shaped bright object moving swiftly across the sky above them.\n\nMr. Dan Wilmut claimed that the speed of the UFO was anything between 400 to 500 miles an hour and rapidly traversed his skyline initially appearing in the South-East before vanishing into thin air in the North-West direction. The UFO was estimated to be around 20-25 feet wide and had lights glowing from it. Details given by Mr. Wilmut were made public by the International UFO Museum in 1997, during a press release.\n\nAfter the spotting, there were thunderstorms in that area and the residents saw nothing that night. However, same claimed to hear an explosion but were of the notion that it was a thunderstorm, due to the prevailing weather. The next morning, Foreman of J.B. Ranch, based in Tiny Corona near New Mexico, Mr. Mac Brazel, accompanied with his neighbor, thought of visiting his sheep to ensure their well-being post the outrageous showers that occurred the previous night. On reaching there, they discovered debris, making it apparent that probably an aircraft had crashed the previous night. On a closer observation of the debris, the material was something he had never seen before as it was very light, but highly tough at the same time. Deeply interested by looking at the material, he took a piece of the debris and showed it to his friends and neighbors.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Wilmut also informed the Chaves County Sheriff George Wilcox, who thought of it to be something related to the army operations and, as a result, informed the Rowell Army Air Field. An elite intelligence only-atomic unit of the army, The 509th Bomb Group was headquartered at the Air Field and Major Jesse Marcel spearheaded the operations involving recovery and transport of the debris. After preliminary examination, Colonel William Blanchard, the Commander of the group, issued a press release stating that the “crashed disk” has been recovered. The media pushed a person from the group, who unwillingly said that the wreckage has been flown to higher headquarters without disclosing the location.\n\nAt this stage, the government intervened into the matter and a General, Roger Ramey, heading a separate unit at Texas, which was a far flung place located about 400 miles from the crash site there was an “unbelievably foolish mistake” committed by Blanchard as it was not a crashed disk, but a weather balloon that had crashed, thereby sharply countering the statement issued by Blanchard. However, colleagues who knew Blanchard from before said that Blanchard was a no-nonsense man with extremely high judgment capacity and if he had said that it was a crashed disk, it had to be a crashed disk, owing to his experience and stature.\n\nEyebrows were raised and public suspicion reached all new heights, as a result of the information Glenn Davis, a young mortician shared with the world. Ballard Funeral Room, the workplace of Davis, was assigned the contract to supply ambulance mortuary services to the Roswell Air Field. On the day the wreckage was recovered, he got repeated calls from the airfield, enquiring about the availability of small hermetically sealed caskets or any other ways to preserve bodies that were exposed to the atmosphere since many days. This sparked Glenn’s curiosity, who visited the Base Hospital to know more, but was quickly escorted out of the building. But before walking out, Glenn noticed two ambulances which had their rear doors open and contained wreckage which had weird symbols on its surface. Curiosity and inquisitiveness reaching all new levels, he arranged to meet a nurse from the hospital whom he knew from before at a coffee shop. The nurse, religious and god-fearing person, expressed her discomfort as she assisted two doctors in performing autopsies of two “small non-human bodies” and also drew it on a napkin to illustrate their appearances. However, when he tried to meet her again, it went on vain and he learnt that she was transferred to England.\n\nMore information about this incident is unavailable as all the people involved and the eyewitnesses disappeared or vanished abruptly, further raising eyebrows towards the government that they are involved and are taking all measures to cover the incident up. A few people who were indirectly involved in this incident still testify about the incident, however no rock-solid proof or information is available to the public, making this one more UFO sighting about which the government wants to keep in the dark.\n\nFind out more at our Roswell UFO Incident tag.",

While I'm not convinced that this truly makes sense, I do know that I've now had conversations with a few different people who have hademotional reactions to having to go through the patdowns, where they truly felt abused afterwards. Some of the accounts are downright frightening, of people who clearly were seriously impacted by the experience. harbingerofdoom alerts us to the news of a proposed law in New Hampshire that would make the TSA search a sexual assault , where penalties would mark those convicted as Tier III sex offenders. The bill specifically \"makes the touching or viewing with a technological device of a person's breasts or genitals by a government security agent without probable cause a sexual assault.\"I have to admit that I'm a bit torn about this. As mentioned, I know some people who certainly have felt sexually abused by the searches/patdowns. And I have no doubt that emotional abuse is real and horrifying. I also have serious questions about the usefulness or appropriateness of these searches, and think we'd certainly be best without them. But labeling a TSA agent a sex offender for doing what the TSA requires seems like a pretty extreme response. I recognize the goal here probably isn't to get TSA agents branded sex offenders, but to create a situation that leads to a policy change. But the whole \"sex offender\" list concept has been abused over the years in dangerous ways, labeling all sorts of people \"sex offenders\" and branding them for life, even if their \"crime\" wasn't what one would normally consider a traditional \"sex\" offense. I'm not convinced that expanding that list, even if to drive a policy change, is a good idea.\n\nFiled Under: new hampshire, patdowns, sex offenders, sexual assault, tsa",

  "latent_16246": "An executive from the UK distributor of Game of Thrones came out this week and said concerns about sexual violence against women on the show are “nonsense.” Excuse me while I roll my eyes to Moon Bay.\n\nIn a discussion panel at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, Gary Davey, managing director of content at Sky, was asked about the scene where Sansa Stark was raped on her wedding night by Ramsay Bolton. That scene angered a lot of fans, who argued that not only was it not part of her original story arc, but it was yet another example of sexual violence being used as character motivation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response, he basically said it was a stupid argument because men get hurt too.\n\n“I think that’s nonsense,” he said. “There is also a lot of violence to men. For anybody who’s watched the show it can be a very violent show. I don’t think the violence against women is particularly highlighted. It is just part of the story. The rape happens, it’s part of the story, it was in the books.”\n\nI do want to start off by saying there’s a big difference between some guy getting arrowed in the face and a woman being stripped and sexually assaulted. It seems short-sighted to conflate the situations as two sides of the same coin, “men get killed, women get raped.” Especially given Theon Greyjoy’s sexual assault and humiliation at the hands of Ramsay, which is all but blanketed over by that statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, that’s not the issue I want to discuss. This is about how sexual violence is portrayed on television, and why it’s so prevalent in the first place. This is something Davey himself acknowledged during his panel earlier this week.\n\n“I think it is bit silly, it is not like sex and violence on TV is a new idea,” he said. “In fact, I’m not sure it’s any worse or any better than it’s ever been.”\n\nNow, I’m not the type of person who’s going to condemn every example of sexual violence on a television show, against both women and men. However, I am going to say that many shows don’t do it responsibly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexuality is very hard to put on television or film, with US censors often coming down more strongly against sexual content and nudity than violence. Sometimes, shows circumvent the censors by combining sex and violence in a way that allows them to do both.\n\nIt sounds counter-intuitive, but it’s worked. It 2014, the CW “period drama” Reign made headlines for a scene where the female protagonist Mary was brutally raped, even though earlier that year censors blocked a scene showing Mary having consensual sex with her husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaw and Order: SVU has been producing episodes on sexual violence for 17 seasons, including one episode where someone rapes women to spread HIV, another where a porn-addicted boy sticks stuff up his ass and a third where a serial rapist targets women based on their ovulation cycles. All of those examples are disgusting, inhumane, and, sadly, some of the easier ways to get sex on primetime.\n\nThere are many, many downsides to this. It creates a correlation between sex and violence, where one happens as the result of the other. It turns sex into a negative experience, associating it with pain and suffering. It also becomes a crutch for writers when they don’t know how to give their characters a conflict, primarily their female characters.\n\nAbove all, it’s disrespectful to actual victims of sexual violence. According to RAINN, one in six women, and one in 33 men, are victims of attempted or completed rape. Their experiences shouldn’t be stylized or “gorified” for the camera, but rather given the time and respect they deserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are examples where sexual violence is used in a constructive way on television. Jessica Jones carries strong themes of sexual violence, trauma, and PTSD, but it focuses on the victims and their stories, not the acts themselves. It also gives equal time and respect to both Kilgrave’s female and male victims, without separating the severity of their experiences based on their genders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes Game of Thrones deserve the worst criticism for its depiction of sexual violence? In my opinion, no. It isn’t beyond criticism by any means, but I think it sometimes gets more flack than it deserves. And I also think you can criticize the scenes while also recognizing the show’s existing strengths.\n\nI’m not a fan of the Sansa rape scene, but I didn’t entirely hate it either. I’m more ambivalent. I see it as something that would actually happen between Sansa and Ramsay at that point in their relationship, but I also see the unnecessary harm it does to her character and motivation. It’s definitely a subjective response on my part, and I understand and respect those who are more upset about the scene than I might be.\n\nLuckily, we are seeing improvements in regards to how TV networks respond to sexual violence, Sky executive aside. The aforementioned Reign episode led to CW issuing a sort-of moratorium on sexual violence in their shows, which looks like it’s still in effect. Plus, Game of Thrones was way lighter on the sexual violence in Season 6, with Sansa, Cersei and Daenerys taking over the Seven Kingdoms by the season finale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough, it must be pointed out, all three of those women are victims of rape, and none of their experiences were “nonsense.”\n\n[The Guardian]",

While the president-elect may hope to concentrate on domestic issues, as Obama did, international realities will not permit this luxury. Indeed, if our international perils are not addressed soon and systematically, they will worsen, with even direr consequences later.\n\nConsider the five gravest challenges confronting America in the next four years, starting with the most imminent.\n\nFirst, and almost certainly the highest national-security priority for voters last Tuesday, are the closely related threats of radical Islamic terrorism and the Middle East's spreading chaos. Obama's unwillingness even to acknowledge radical Islam's ideological basis, let alone his failure to counteract its multiple dangerous manifestations, has left us increasingly vulnerable to terrorist attack. And in the Middle East itself, despite long-overdue territorial gains against ISIS, governments have been disintegrating or gravely weakened, thus providing safe havens where ISIS and other terrorists can again take root.\n\nIf Trump does not quickly reverse Obama's strategy, regional chaos will only grow, and the terrorist threat here and in Europe will increase. Destroying ISIS should certainly be a priority, but not Obama's approach, which actually strengthens Iran's hand at the expense of America's traditional allies in the region, Israel and Arab states alike.\n\nSecond, nuclear proliferation, primarily by Iran and North Korea, is continuing and even accelerating. Obama's cherished nuclear deal with Tehran has not contained Iran's nuclear program, has not stopped its cooperation with Pyongyang, and has not changed its offensive behavior across the Middle East. Iran obtained the nuclear deal's financial benefits at the outset, agreeing only to make cosmetic, easily reversible modifications to its nuclear infrastructure. Almost certainly, the ayatollahs have been cheating since before the ink was dry on the deal.\n\nAs for North Korea, even Obama's own director of national intelligence, James Clapper, acknowledged last month the hollowness of nearly 25 years of negotiation with Pyongyang, saying, “I think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause.”\n\nFailure to contain nuclear, chemical and biological proliferation today has even more dangerous longer-term consequences, namely even greater proliferation. Moreover, the prospect that terrorists could receive weapons of mass destruction risks the perfect storm of more 9/11s but with far more tragic consequences. Moving vigorously to eliminate the rising proliferation tidal wave will either be the hallmark of Trump's presidency — or possibly its epitaph.\n\nThird, Vladimir Putin's Russia is on the prowl in Eastern Europe and the Middle East in ways unprecedented since the Cold War. Unchecked by Obama's weak and feckless policies, Putin has had every reason to believe that persistence will achieve any objective Russia has the capacity to seek. He sees little incentive to restrain his ambitions or engage in genuine cooperation when Washington is bereft of strong, decisive leadership. Rebuilding protective structures of deterrence in Europe; reducing Moscow's Middle East influence to pre-Obama days; and utilizing Russia effectively against Islamic terrorism and in the epic struggle with China may seem contradictory, but all are possible with renewed U.S. strength of purpose and the attendant resources, political and economic as well as military.\n\nFourth, China's belligerent assertion of territorial claims in the South and East China Seas, its extensive military buildup, and its disdain for international commitments in trade and other fields all demonstrate not merely the attributes of a rising regional power, but one that neither respects nor fears the consequences of ignoring or even humiliating America. And after eight years of Obama, why not? Continued failure to deal firmly with Chinese adventurism and intransigence will result in more Asian states falling under Beijing's sway, as the Philippines appears to be doing, simply accepting their fate as Middle Kingdom vassals. While no one seeks confrontation with China, submissiveness such as Obama's only encourages more aggressive behavior.\n\nFinally, although mostly ignored during the campaign, global governance will inevitably pose increasing challenges for America. Trump's campaign indirectly addressed part of this issue on immigration, but the fundamental importance of protecting U.S. sovereignty is far broader and more complex. Obama is entirely content with surrendering vital decisions to multinational organizations, courts and treaties, even while we are seeing key projects to diminish the authority of the nation-state begin to come apart: Britain voted to leave the European Union, and African governments are withdrawing from the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of this struggle is yet unknown, but it will be increasingly at the center of global affairs in the years ahead. So congratulations, President-elect Trump! The easy part is now over.\n\nJohn Bolton, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations and, previously, the undersecretary of State for arms control and international security.",

  "latent_16476": "Unintended Consequences of Central Banks Money Printing, Bubbles in Emerging Markets\n\nThe central banks of the developed world are printing money and are engaged in a very-low-interest-rate regime. What does that mean for emerging markets? It is more than just a dilemma, it is a tri-lemma – they have problems not just coming and going but also sitting still! I am in Zurich tonight after a long day, with a 4:30 AM wake-up call to get back home, but deadlines are deadlines. So, to make this one easier on me as well as hopefully instructive for you, you will get chapter 15 of my new book, Endgame, in which coauthor Jonathan Tepper and I speculate about the future of emerging markets in general and investments in them in particular. We once again are on the New York Times best-seller list this week, by the way (thanks to many of you).\n\nLoose Monetary Policies and Emerging Markets\n\nThe reviews keep coming in. I have never met Anthony Harrington, but he is clearly a keen and astute analyst, since he has called this book a must-read. Seriously, he homes in on one aspect that I think is critical; and that is the issue of trade deficits and fiscal deficits and how they affect each other. You can read his work at http://www.qfinance.com/blogs/anthony-harrington/2011/03/23/mauldins-end-game-teaches-politicians-the-basics-but-are-they-listening-austerity-measures.And this week, if you have not yet bought your copy, let me commend you to my friends at Laissez Faire Books. I have been buying books from them for nearly 30 years. They are the best source for Austrian economics and libertarian books, along with the usual offering of investment books current in the market. They have matched the Amazon price for Endgame; but if you are interested, move around their website and pick up a few other things along with my book. http://www.lfb.org/product_info.php?products_id=1014&PromoCode=L401M301And now, let’s look at emerging markets.So far we have focused on the United States and other mature, developed economies that have far too much debt. With Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland at close to zero percent interest rates, it seemed like a good idea to stimulate the economy. However, emerging markets that maintain pegged currencies or that shadow the dollar are essentially reduced to importing excessively loose monetary policies. Reserve growth across many emerging countries has been very strong over the last year. Emerging Asian countries account for almost 50 percent of global foreign exchange reserves. Huge Asian reserve growth since early last year is a result of mimicking loose monetary policies in the developed world to keep their currencies competitive. China has accumulated the most reserves of any emerging market country. This is directly related to its currency peg and its need to recycle the dollars it gets from its exports.A result of Asian emerging markets’ importing loose monetary policy from developed markets is that domestic inflation rates are rising quickly, as policy rates remain too accommodative. Asian emerging market countries are facing a trilemma: They can fix any two of a pegged exchange rate, free flows of capital, or independence in monetary policy, but not all three. The end result is likely to be higher policy rates and currency appreciation. (See Figure 15.1.)\n\nBubbles in Emerging Markets\n\nMany emerging markets will double or triple over the next few years. Emerging markets are extremely small as a percentage of total global market capitalization. When investors diversify away from developed markets, it will be like putting a fire hose through a straw. Liquidity from developed markets will overwhelm emerging markets. Part of this is from investors in the developed world wanting to go where the growth is, but part of it is a result of quantitative easing all over the world, especially in the United States. That is why you see emerging markets like Brazil taxing inbound capital flows in an effort to keep their own economies from developing a bubble. (See Figure 15.2.)\n\nThere are good reasons why the United States and the United Kingdom are among the highest capitalizations. In part, this is because a higher percentage of companies are publicly traded in the United States and the United Kingdom, whereas in other countries, many more are privately held, family-owned, or indeed government-run. Individually, almost all emerging markets are less than 0.5 percent of total world capitalization, as Figure 15.3 shows.\n\nTo further emphasize the small size of some emerging equity markets and their potential to grow, in Figure 15.4 we have compared the total market caps of some of these markets alongside the market caps of some well-known blue chip stocks (in millions of $).\n\nConsider the following examples: Microsoft has a bigger market cap than all of Indonesia, General Electric and Wells Fargo have market caps almost double that of all of the Philippines, Monsanto and Time Warner have bigger market caps than all of Vietnam and Pakistan, and GAP Inc’s market cap is almost double that of Sri Lanka’s.\n\nIn the reflation trade, a few characteristics drive outperformance in emerging markets:\n\n• Generous liquidity, that is, rapid monetary expansion\n\n• Positive demographics\n\n• Declining real interest rates\n\n• Underleveraged consumer\n\n• Banking sector with low loans-to-GDP ratio\n\nThe main countries that satisfy these requirements are Turkey, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Brazil.\n\nLocal conditions in some emerging market countries will act as a fire starter to excessive liquidity from abroad. In countries like Indonesia, Brazil, and Turkey, due to solid economies, increasing productivity, and thus falling inflation, they are transitioning to lower interest-rate regimes. This often has the consequence of detracting investors from the falling returns on cash and debt products and pulling them toward higher-yielding equities.\n\nFurther, large populations and still relatively low levels of GDP per capita give some idea of the scope for expansion in countries like China, India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka if the prosperity of more developed economies, such as Taiwan and the Czech Republic, is anything to go by.\n\nIn this scenario, liquidity is likely to remain well above the norm for some time, and China will be little different from the other emerging markets:\n\nSmall markets + Ample liquidity + Investor risk appetite\n\n+ Historically low interest rates = Bubblelike conditions\n\nChinese equity, property, and other asset markets will benefit hugely. China differs from many other emerging markets because it has tight capital controls that keep a lid on overseas speculation. If these controls were relaxed, however, and the currency allowed to freely fluctuate, then all bets are off as to the effect on Chinese markets. This would be no different from Japan in the 1980s, when the capital accounts were opened up and the yen was allowed to float. Indeed, many if not all of the bubbles that have occurred since the Dutch Tulip Mania in the seventeenth century have been precipitated by a combination of financial liberalization and innovation.\n\nThere is always a bull market somewhere. If you go back to the 1970s in terms of loose monetary policies and excessive government debt, does that mean that we’ll see a repeat of a decade in the doldrums for U.S. and European stock markets? Possibly, but it should not matter to a global macro investor. Again, there are always bull markets somewhere.\n\nFigure 15.5 shows that from 1970 to 1985, if you had invested $1 in the United States, you would have $2 by 1985. If you had invested in Japan, you would have made $6 over the same period, and if you had invested in Hong Kong, you would have made more than $8. Emerging markets will be the big winners of the loose monetary policies around the world. Just as the Fed’s loose monetary policy after the Internet bubble burst created the housing bubble, the Fed’s money printing will inflate emerging markets.\n\nThe surplus liquidity isn’t likely to ignite an inflationary boom in the U.S. economy if consumers refuse to borrow and spend. But that liquidity has to go somewhere, and emerging markets look like the most likely destination. Emerging markets and commodities took the first hits in the credit implosion because they were viewed as warrants (longterm call options) on global growth.\n\nAs history shows, the leading sector of the previous bull market typically is not the leader of a new bull market. The emerging markets look like they are the new global leaders. Emerging economies account for 43.7 percent of global output and, according to the IMF, will account for 70 percent of the world’s growth going forward, yet they represent only 10.9 percent of global stock market capitalization. China by itself makes up 15 percent of the global economy but less than 2 percent of market cap, while the United States provides 21 percent of output but 43.4 percent of market cap.\n\nMost investors weight the American and European markets too heavily. This is partly due to home bias in investing, but it is really more like a drunk searching for his keys under the lamppost. He searches there not because he is likely to find his keys but because there is light. In the same way, most investors in emerging markets do not look for the right data and merely decide to either take risk and invest or reduce risk and withdraw funds. Their investments into emerging markets are unsystematic.\n\nMost investors buy or sell emerging markets indiscriminately based on their willingness to take on further risk or shed risk. Figure 15.6 shows the extremely high correlation between the VIX Index, global equity volatility, and the U.S. dollar versus South African rand exchange rate (USDZAR). You can’t make up charts like this.\n\nDuring the emerging markets rally in 2006 and 2007, almost all markets traded in line with the others. Figure 15.7 shows that for much of 2006, the Indian Sensex and the Mexican Bolsa Index had a 96 percent correlation, even though their economies could not have been more different. (File under the “investors are lemmings” category.)\n\nEmerging markets could easily be the next bubble. However, they don’t even need to be the next bubble or the next big thing for investors to profit from them. As recessions ended in the United States and Europe in 1992 and 2003 and central banks kept liquidity flowing freely, almost all emerging markets rallied indiscriminately.\n\nLoose liquidity and undervalued emerging market currencies are leading toward excess foreign exchange reserve accumulation and loose credit conditions. Underleveraged emerging markets with higher velocity will continue to benefit from the accommodative monetary policies of a developed world beset with high debt and low monetary velocity. Continued reserve accumulation can lead to inflationary pressure, overinvestment, complications in the management of monetary policy, misallocation of domestic banks’ lending, and asset bubbles.\n\nDifficult Choices\n\nWe have written about the difficult choices developed countries will face as they deal with the hangover from too much debt. Emerging market countries face the flip side of the same problem. They are, for the most part, underleveraged and have higher monetary velocity, yet they are importing the loose money policies from the United States and Europe.\n\nWhat can emerging markets do to try to reduce inflows of hot money and prevent bubbles? There are a number of tools available to policy makers of liquidity-receiving economies in response to excess global liquidity and large capital inflows. As the IMF has pointed out, emerging markets can allow a more flexible exchange rate policy. They can accumulate reserves (using sterilized or unsterilized intervention as appropriate). They can reduce interest rates if the inflation outlook permits, and they can tighten fiscal policy when the overall macroeconomic policy stance is too loose. All of these involve difficult tradeoffs where the costs and benefits are not obvious.\n\nThe bottom line is that governments around the world need to be alert and make difficult choices to deal with a world excess liquidity. From an investor’s point of view, we would enjoy the current ride in emerging markets but recognize that they are high beta to the U.S. economy and stock markets. The next time the United States goes into recession—and there will be a next time—it is likely that emerging markets will suffer significant losses. So, emerging markets are a trade and not a long-term investment.\n\nThat being said, at the bottom of the next U.S. recession, we think emerging market countries could see their economies and stock markets finally decouple from the United States, and at that point, they could become the trade of the decade. We suggest that investors use the time to find specific stocks and not just country ETFs, or find someone who can do that work for you. Fortunes can be made if you do your homework.\n\nSnowbird, New York, Portland, and La Jolla\n\nLet me remind you that my conference in La Jolla is filling up and the registration deadline is looming. As I said last week, at my Strategic Investment Conference, the first two questions that each speaker will get at the end of their presentation will be, first, “What will happen when QE2 goes away?” and second, “Under what conditions will the Fed launch QE3?”\n\nI will pose them to Martin Barnes, Marc Faber, Louis-Vincent Gave, Paul McCulley, David Rosenberg, and Gary Shilling – and John Paulson has agreed to speak as well! They will be joined by Neil Howe (The Fourth Turning, and demographics guru) and George Friedman of Stratfor, as well as your humble analyst and Altegris partner Jon Sundt. I mean, really, is there a conference anywhere this year that has a line-up that powerful?\n\nThe conference is April 28-30 in La Jolla. It is filling up fast. You can register at https://hedge-fund-conference.com/2011/invitation.aspx?ref=mauldin. Sadly, it is for accredited investors only, but I will report back to you the answers from the speakers to those questions.\n\nAs noted at the outset, I am in Zurich tonight. The weather in Europe this week has been fantastic, some of the best I have ever had. London, Malta, Milan, Zug, Zurich – just brilliant. I had dinner outside with Massimo Lattman on Lake Zurich tonight. A very successful entrepreneur and manager, he had such great stories and insights to share, on a gorgeous night. You live for moments like that.\n\nSaturday I am off to Snowbird, Utah, for my partner at SMG Steve Blumenthal’s 50th birthday party, then on to New York on Sunday for meetings and media to help promote the book. I will detail the schedule next week.\n\nI will also be providing the keynote address for the West Coast-based investment advisory firm of Arnerich Massena at their 2011 Investment Symposium, on April 11-12, in Newberg, Oregon, outside of Portland.\n\nOK, don’t tell my kids about this next bit. (When we travel together, I am a bit of a stickler about schedules. Moving seven kids and their families with kids can get to be a logistical issue. Dad can get on their case if they don’t move fast enough.\n\nSo, last night I was with Niels Jensen on the train from Milan to Zug, our destination a quaint little “village” in Switzerland near Zurich. Lots of fund managers are moving there for tax reasons, lifestyle, etc. It was late and I was writing away on the train, deep in my creative throes, charmed with an idea for a new research report I am writing. Niels said, “John, you might want to pack up. We are getting close.” I looked at my watch and thought I had five minutes, so I kept typing away. Creative juices and all, you know? You’ve got to give the Muse her lead.\n\nHowever, we pulled into the station sooner than I expected. I started packing up quickly, but there were a lot of wires and stuff. Spilled the last of the Prosecco on my coat (is that maybe why I thought I was creative?). I ran to the door, only to have it close and lock, and watched Niels, standing with my luggage on the platform, waving goodbye as the train pulled out! Nothing to do but feel like an idiot and travel on to Zurich, then take the next train back (this one with local stops) to Zug. I got to the small hotel. No one was at the desk or would answer the phone. Not knowing what to do, I looked around and saw there was a key on the counter. Next to it was a note reading, “Mr. Mauldin, your luggage is in your room. Have a good night.” Anywhere else this is an invitation to free luggage. In Zug, I guess, this is how they take care of latecomers.\n\nThe next day, as we are back at the train station, heading for Zurich, this gentleman walks up and asks, “Are you John Mauldin? I have this new econometric model I’ve been wanting to show you.” So, on the train to Zurich I looked at feedback mechanisms and how they can be used to analyze markets. Actually quite intriguing. It is a small damn world, but a really fun one.\n\nIt is time to hit the send button. The wake-up call will come way too soon. But, there is a party going on underneath my hotel room window. They are singing songs from the ’60s and ’70s here in the Old Town in Zurich. Maybe just one drink and then bed. Have a great week! Auf wiedersehen!\n\nYour loving Switzerland analyst,\n\nJohn F.

  "latent_16693": "PISCATAWAY -- The phone call came to the Princeton University wrestling office, and Chris Ayres was instantly intrigued.\n\n\"I'd like to think that I came up with it, but I didn't,'' Ayres said, explaining how the concept of an outdoor wrestling match between Rutgers and Princeton originated from a phone call from Scarlet Knights coach Scott Goodale. \"It was just one afternoon in the office, nothing out of the ordinary, and then Goody calls us and says, 'Hey, do you want to wrestle us in the football stadium?' At first you're like, 'Wow, okay.' ''\n\nBut then, Ayers said, there was the matter of hammering out the details that come with staging the unique event. Could they actually contest it inside a football stadium? Would the weather conditions be ideal enough for it? How do you get fans interested in it?\n\n\"We got both staffs on the phone, put everybody on conference (call), and at the end of the day we said we (both) said we'd try to fill the stadium as much as we could,'' Ayers recalled. \"And then it was like, 'Yeah, let's do it.'''\n\nSix months after the outdoor wrestling match was announced, Rutgers officials are putting the finishing touchdowns on an anticipated doubleheader Saturday that will include the Scarlet Knights football team matching up with Penn State in an 8 p.m. kickoff at High Point Solutions Stadium.\n\nSeven hours before the Big Ten football game, at 11 a.m., the Princeton and Rutgers wrestling teams will square off on a mat placed in the north end of the stadium.\n\nWhile the football game is expected to draw more than 50,000 fans, nearly 14,000 tickets have already been sold for the wrestling match between longtime Central Jersey rivals.\n\n\"We want to be involved in huge events and you have to showcase the sport -- that's what I've been preaching the whole time,'' Ayers said.\n\nSaid Goodale: \"I think the best thing about being in Jersey is that we're able to do this in front of, hopefully, 20,000 people. You can't do that everywhere. You can do it in State College, Pa., you can do it in Stillwater, Okla., maybe you could do it in Minnesota, and obviously you could do it in Iowa.\n\n\"But you can do it in New Jersey.''\n\nRutgers and Princeton have had a long rivalry in all their sports, with their football teams staging what's regarded as the first intercollegiate football game on Nov. 6, 1869 over a patch of sod in New Brunswick where the College Avenue Gymnasium now stands.\n\nIt's why Rutgers proclaims to be the \"Birthplace of College Football.'' And it's also why Rutgers officials labeled the outdoor wrestling match as the \"Battle at the Birthplace.''\n\n\"I'm a huge, huge college football fan,'' Goodale said. \"I know when they threw that name out, it was pretty cool and I thought of college football and all the history that's gone on here, and the history with Princeton. It just made sense. It's kind of neat. It'll be a great atmosphere, and it's just a neat out-of-the-box thing, and it's what has us excited.''\n\nThe Rutgers and Princeton wrestling teams have met 79 times since first meeting on Jan. 14, 1931, with the Scarlet Knights winning 20 straight bouts to take a 41-33-5 advantage in the series.\n\n\"I don't think Scott envisions his program anywhere else but being in the top 10 consistently every year,'' Ayers said. \"I think we can do the same thing. So I feel like this is the starting point to have a really good rivalry between two top 10 teams. So it's going to be more exciting down the road.''\n\nRU's 1st sports event came 150 years ago",
  "latent_17089": "Ahead of spiked’s conference ‘The New Intolerance on Campus’, taking place in London on 17 February, some of the speakers will kick off the discussion here on spiked. Brendan O’Neill gets things rolling by defending freedom for hate speech.\n\nThe policing of hatred represents one of the greatest threats to freedom of speech in the 21st century. From coddled campuses, where student leaders ban speech they deem to be ‘hatemongering’, to the public sphere more broadly, where hate-speech laws govern what we can say about race, religion and sexuality, various ways of thinking have been rebranded as ‘hatred’ and are shamed or silenced into oblivion. It can be hard to stand up to this war on hatred; who wants to be known as ‘pro-hate’? But it is essential that we do, for the control and punishment of hatred represents an alarming intrusion of the state and others into the realm of ideas, and even emotions. Everything that is wrong with the policing of hatred can be seen on campus. Censorious students give various justifications for their bans on everything from raunchy pop songs to ‘transphobic’ feminists. They claim to be maintaining ‘safe spaces’ for students, ensuring existential comfort, etc. But one of their key arguments is that they are forcefielding campuses against ‘hate speech’, against individuals whose unpopular views could ‘incite hatred’ against certain groups. It seems never to strike them that the very idea that an emotion may legitimately be kept off campus might just be the definition of thoughtpolicing.\n\nThe behaviour of these campus censors speaks to one of the key problems with measures against hate speech: the way they rebrand certain people’s genuinely held beliefs as ‘hatred’ that must be stamped out. The student union at Derby severely restricts the rights of Abort67, a pro-life organisation, on the basis that it’s a ‘hate group’. Anti-Islamist speakers have been banned from campuses on the grounds that they ‘could incite hatred’, presumably of Islamists. Islamists themselves have faced student censorship because, in the words of one LGBT society, they ‘preach hate’. Students have sought to ban feminists who don’t believe transsexuals are real women, claiming they could ‘incite hatred’ against trans people. In all these cases, what the campus censors decreed to be ‘hatred’ were actually real, powerful moral beliefs held by various individuals. Only a moral infant could describe Abort67 as a ‘hate group’ — it’s simply very strongly opposed to abortion (wrongly, in my view). Anti-Islamist speakers do not ‘hate’ Muslims — they disagree passionately with Islamism, a political outlook. Germaine Greer doesn’t ‘hate’ trans people — she simply believes that womanhood isn’t something that can be achieved overnight with some drugs. Even some of the Islamist preachers hounded off campus for being hateful usually only express a severe religious opposition to homosexuality and women’s equality. Theirs is a moral conviction, however disagreeable. One man’s ‘hate speech’ is another man’s deeply felt belief. Student censors’ cynical rebranding of moral views they don’t like as ‘hatred’ mirrors developments in society at large (giving the lie to the idea that the Stepford Students are singlehandedly destroying liberty). Across Europe in recent years, hate-speech laws have been used to punish priests for railing against homosexuality; animal-rights activists for badmouthing the Islamic ritual slaughter of animals; football fans for singing scurrilous songs. Now, you can agree or disagree with these people’s views, but surely we can recognise that they’re truly felt?\n\nTo lump together unpopular moralities as ‘hatred’ is to create a new category of heresy. Indeed, in modern parlance, the phrase ‘hate speech’ plays the same role ‘heretical’ once did: it denotes views that officialdom or self-styled representatives of fragile minorities have decreed to be wicked, and inexpressible. In our post-moral times, where it’s risky to say that any viewpoint is better than another, the self-elected guardians of public safety cannot write people off as evil. So instead they accuse them of practising ‘hate speech’ and throw the legal book at them. It’s a sly form of censorship, elevating the subjective feelings of the listener, their sense of being under-valued, over the objective right of the speaker to express his beliefs. The second problem with the war on hate is also seen in campus life: the wrongness of silencing even those views most of us agree are actually hateful. If it’s wrong to rebrand outré moral views as ‘hatred’, it’s equally wrong to censor real hatred. Student unions ban far-right groups. They create ever-growing safe spaces in which certain racist or anti-gay ideas can’t be expressed. This seems nice, an attempt to expel foul views from public zones — but it’s actually the worst way imaginable to deal with prejudiced ideologies.",
  "latent_17118": "A push to “boycott, divest and sanction” (BDS) Israeli companies has limited impact on the credit profile of Israel, yet it directly harms its intended beneficiaries, the Palestinians. The BDS movement, including universities, pension funds and leaders of some Christian denominations (to the chagrin of many congregants), ignores economic data. And it coincides with a disturbing rise of violent anti-Semitism across Europe.\n\n“The impact of BDS is more psychological than real so far and has had no discernible impact on Israeli trade or the broader economy,” Kristin Lindow, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service and Moody’s lead analyst for Israel (in full disclosure, a former Moody’s colleague) told Forbes. “That said, the sanctions do run the risk of hurting the Palestinian economy, which is much smaller and poorer than that of Israel, as seen in the case of SodaStream.”\n\nWhile the broader Israeli economy is presently shielded from BDS, one victim is SodaStream, an Israeli company manufacturing DIY soda that shuttered a West Bank factory and moved it to southern Israel. This cut hundreds of jobs for Palestinians that reportedly paid between three and five times the local prevailing wage.\n\nSodaStream’s CEO Daniel Birnbaum denied the move was BDS-related, though its profits plunged after BDS activists locked the fizzy pop maker in its crosshairs.\n\n\"It has nothing to do with politics; we're relocating to a modern facility that is three times the size,\" Birnbaum told The Independent. \"But if it was up to me, I would have stayed. We showed the world Arabs and Jews can work together.\"\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves: Israel (population 8.3 million) has GDP of $291 billion, the Palestinian Territories (population 4.1 million), $11.3 billion. In 2012, Israeli sales to the Palestinian Authority were $4.3 billion, about 5% of Israeli exports (excluding diamonds) less than 2% of Israeli GDP, according to the Bank of Israel. In 2012, Palestinian sales to Israel accounted for about 81% of Palestinian exports and less than a percentage point of Israeli GDP. Palestinian purchases from Israel were two-thirds of total Palestinian imports (or 27% of Palestinian GDP).\n\nSuch trade flow asymmetry shows Palestine needs Israel, economically speaking. Yet the BDS crowd would impair economic ties between these areas, despite evidence that trade between peoples lessens outbreak of war. BDS-ers want to obliterate the vast trade surplus Israel extends to Palestine and offer nothing in its place.\n\nIt’s easy to cast digital stones from the comfort of a California dorm room or a posh British mansion. It’s difficult to gainfully employ some 110,000 Palestinians as Israel does, or build 16 industrial parks in the West Bank and East Jerusalem hosting 1,000 facilities where Jews and Arabs work shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nDespite overheated BDS rhetoric about exploitation, last year the Palestinian Authority’s official newspaper hailed working conditions for Palestinians employed by Israelis in West Bank settlements. It also scolded Palestinians hiring other Palestinians for low wages with no benefits.\n\nWe typecast librarians and mainline Protestants as mild-mannered pleasers, yet The American Library Association, along with the United Church of Christ and the Episcopal Church, have considered BDS in this misguided Holy War against Israel. Throw in White House and congressional Democrats who, against the will of most Americans, might snub Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his U.S. visit next month. And a nuclear Iran, a regime vowing ethnic cleansing against Jews, grows more likely each day as Secretary of State John Kerry dithers.\n\nThrough all this, Israel grows increasingly vulnerable, even as it continues to economically bolster Palestine. The BDS movement inflames rather than enlightens global dialogue around the peace process. Israel invests heavily in Palestine; the rest of the world doesn’t bother.\n\nOne bright spot is leadership in Congress from Peter Roskam (R-IL) and Juan Vargas (D-CA), who just introduced The Israel Trade and Commercial Enhancement Act. It would require U.S. negotiators to discourage Israeli BDS within countries seeking U.S. trade agreements. This would apply, for example, to a deal currently under negotiation with the European Union, where anti-Semitism and BDS are growing. This bill makes moral and economic sense; it would protect the shared prosperity of both Palestine and Israel.",

The popular right-wing website has been a loyal ally to President Donald Trump, perhaps more devoted to his cause than any other.\n\nThe article about Pai’s move has 1,117 comments, mostly aghast at the FCC’s plan.\n\n“This is as anti consumer as it gets.

It’s a heist and a hijacking,” writes commenter Dr. Pangloss in the top-voted comment on the thread.\n\nOthers, like john05, quickly came to the correct conclusion that this could even help telecommunications companies that are close to the Democratic Party. “Comcast will be laughing all the way to the bank when it gets permission to bias its subscribers’ internet traffic in favor of its own media holdings like MSNBC,” he noted.\n\n“Why is Trump on board with this?” asked commenter STOP! “We need more monopoly-busting (e.g. Goolag. Twitter, Facebook free speech guarantee), not less.”\n\nJulian Assange and Kim Dotcom, tech libertarians whose anti-authority politics drove them toward anti-establishment Trump, broke with the president over the issue. Both are influential within the online Trump community.\n\nDotcom, in particular, was called out to comment on the move by activist Barrett Brown.",

  "latent_17261": "Let’s face it, whether you plan on being the wisecracking sidekick, the angry police chief, the sassy secretary, wise housekeeper, runaway slave, or Denzel Washington, being the “token” character in popular films and media isn’t the ideal occupation. We can make an iconic superhero a few shades darker, but let’s stop “twerking” around the real issues and ask ourselves: what it is really like to be the token in a predominantly white society?\n\nThe Show\n\nToken is a comedy drama that follows the experiences of Myke, a young black writer living in Orange County, and his three white friends who happen to be tokens in their own right. Christian is a practicing Christian, struggling to keep his more destructive impulses in check; Sam is a bundle of insecurities and white privilege but mostly just a hipster; and Grant is a whacky Improv actor who just wants to be taken seriously. As the creators of Token, we hope to bring to light certain cultural taboos in the hopes of engaging in a national conversation about diversity in American culture and media.\n\nOur Goal\n\nToken is a half-hour TV pilot through which we aim to spark conversations that television and film tend to shy away from. In order to do this, we will submit the completed pilot to the New York Television Festival.\n\nThe Independent Pilot Competition (IPC) is the NYTVF’s flagship, annual competition, accepting independently-produced, original television pilots and web series from around the globe.\n\nFunding\n\nProducing a high-quality television pilot requires the time, effort, and monetary contributions of a dedicated crew and community. With your help, we can access better resources, so that the final product will look, sound, and feel as good as possible.\n\nThe funding from this Kickstarter project will be directed towards the rental of camera and lighting equipment, location permits, original music, food for our crew, and other costs associated with seven days of shooting. All crew members and actors are kindly donating their time, in addition to a large amount of our overall budget.\n\nMeet the Characters\n\nMyke's Bio: A frequent target of bias, racism, misunderstanding, bigotry, causal ignorance, and territorial aggression, Myke has developed an \"I'm always right\" complex. He's able to justify all of his actions, his opinions, and every bad thing that happens to him, to the point of zero accountability.\n\nGrant's Bio: Always subscribing to some new trend, he's the offensive result of popular culture. A rising star in the Improv comedy community, Grant is finally starting to garner a following – just in time for him to reject it completely for the sake of “being taken seriously\".\n\nSam's Bio: Angry for the sake of being angry and defiant for the sake of being defiant, Sam isn’t the easiest person to get along with. His attempts to defy privileged white stereotypes are often counterproductive. He has the last word and moral authority over the conversation, but his tendency to overthink makes him his own worst enemy. He also tries to play music but is generally terrible at it.\n\nChristian's Bio: Beloved by mothers and banned from Dave N' Busters everywhere, Christian is the self-proclaimed \"beating heart\" of the group. Whether he's working on his indie video game project or singing along to church songs in his youth group, Christian tries desperately to balance his strong morals with his destructive impulses. We'll see how that goes.\n\nSherry's Bio: Born on a train headed from Alaska to disaster, Sherry has always felt more comfortable on the move. Whether it's fronting her all-female noise rock band the \"Screaming Twenties,\" or simply giving the stink eye to her patrons at the Vegan Vegan Vegan cafe, Sherry aims to stir up some trouble while slipping quietly out the backdoor. Her name's an alcohol, for Christian's sake.\n\nMeaghan's Bio: Social justice warrior by day and social justice warrior by night, Meaghan knows the score. Whether it's calling out transgressions on her blogroll or simply calling out transgressions in everyday life, Meaghan's not about to sit down and take the world's injustices. Now if only she could shake the fact that she lives in Orange...\n\nMeet the Team\n\nMyke, Grant, Sam, and Christian:\n\nThe writers and creators of Token, the four of us became roommates after meeting in the Screenwriting department at Chapman University. Myke, the eponymous Token black guy of the group, pitched the idea as a way to vent our frustrations about our current status in life, and work together on our mutual goal of making a television show with cultural and personal relevance. We are also acting in the pilot as fictional portrayals of ourselves.\n\nScott Wild: Studied producing at Chapman University before venturing out into the industry to work in production and post-production with brands like Dell, Eddie Bauer, Brooks, and others. A vocal feminist and civil rights supporter, he hopes Token will be a successful part of socially conscious television.\n\nJoel Blacker:\n\nDirector of the pilot, Joel is an accomplished director working in Hollywood with various production companies doing everything from directing to cinematography. Joel has a very unique vision that he brings with him on everything he does, and is British, which means he has a unique accent he brings with him on everything he does as well.\n\nIf you'd like to follow our progress on the project, please follow us on facebook at facebook.com/TokenSeries",
  "latent_17300": "It was a cold morning on the campus of the little Christian college I attended in Western Pennsylvania. Along with about 20 other students, I’d trundled in and unwrapped my coat and scarf. Now we all sat there sipping our coffees, waiting for the hardest class of the year to get rolling.\n\nOur literary criticism professor paused as he announced the optional reading titles on our list for the next week, a funny look on his face.\n\n“This one,” he said, “you may not like. It was written in 1984, published in ’85 or ’86, and was a reaction against the rise of the religious rightâ€Š—â€Šagainst the values that places like our school stand for. It’s pro-feminist, and anti-complementarianâ€Š—â€Šagainst traditional gender roles. It sort of parodies what we believe in, in an interesting way. I’m curious what you’ll make of it.”\n\nThe shade thrown by my usually soft-spoken professor caught my attention. I had to read this book.\n\nAnd so I did, unwittingly cracking open the beginning of the end for meek, conservative Christian me.\n\nThe story of The Handmaid’s Tale is a fairly simple dystopian one: A young woman is re-educated by the new totalitarian (and Christian) government regime to be a childbearing surrogate for the wife of a high-ranking military official. She tells her story after the fact, a narrative recorded on audio tapes found years later in someone’s attic. Her name is Offred, literally \"of Fred,\" having no name of her own anymore in this new society. It takes place in the U.S., post-Constitution, post-democracy, post-liberal humanism. Women are chattel. Religion is god. Order comes above all else.\n\nSPONSORED\n\nTo the average American in 1985, it seemed pretty far out there, an unlikely vision of future written as a warning. It’s been controversial since it came out, making ALA’s 100 most banned books list between 1990 and 1999, but that was because of the sex scenes in it and the way it depicted Christianity. It wasn’t really taken seriously as political foreshadowing.\n\nBut for me, when I read it for the first time, it felt like a prophecy that echoed rhythm of the world I had been raised in, reflecting the vision my church and community had for the future of American culture and politics.\n\nI was raised in a fundamentalist Christian communityâ€Š—â€Šthe church we attended could fairly be called a cult, and my parents took things a step further than even our church did, homeschooling and raising nine kids. I was the oldest. We were part of a larger movement now called “Quiverfull,” the term taken from a Psalm where the writer talks about God blessing the man whose “quiver is full of arrows.” The metaphor refers to children, and our community understood this to be a command: Have children and raise them in this aggressively conservative faith, and then there will be more “true” believer Christians in the world to bring about cultural revolution in the name of Jesus Christ. Children like me were raised to see life as apocalyptic, and ourselves as serving on the front lines of a culture war to make America Christian.\n\nWomen in this world were treated much like those in The Handmaid’s Taleâ€Š—â€Šmost, like my mom, didn’t have their own bank accounts, didn’t have their own email addresses, and couldn’t leave the home without permission from their husbands. They were called helpmeets, a word taken from the King James Version of the Bible, which refers to wives as created to meet the needs of their husbands and be helpers to them.\n\nI even participated in a super-conservative worship church dance troupe for young women, called His Handmaidsâ€Š—â€Šagain a term taken from the Bible, from the Virgin Mary’s response to the angel Gabriel telling her she’s going to be pregnant with the Messiah, which some translations open with “I am the Lord’s handmaiden, let it be unto me as you say.”\n\nJust like Offred, women existed within the community to serve higher purposes than our own desires. Young girls who led the congregation wore white dresses and were stripped of identifying featuresâ€Š—â€Šno jewelry, no nail polish, hair tied back and not in the faceâ€Š—â€Šwhile wives were submissive helpers to their husbands, with my mother used as the fertile ground for my father to breed a quiver full of Christian culture warriors.\n\nAnd me, the oldest child in a family of nine? As was common in the movement, I was my mom’s right hand. She sometimes called me her strength, because I helped her co-parent my younger siblings and keep the household running. When she had twins shortly before my 13th birthday, it was me who got up with her during the nighttime feedings, not my dad. When things were too busy on Sunday nights, I took over doing all the family laundry and ironing. And I did the dinner dishes almost exclusively for about 10 years, foregoing activities with my peers at church and in the community because I had too many obligations to fulfill at home. Like Offred, my life’s purpose was subsumed into serving the “greater good” of my far-right Christian community.\n\nWe were not alone, either. My situation grew out of a larger movement in the conservative Christian community to be more invested in politics and cultural affairs on the national level. This push was led by the Moral Majority, a group of Christian leaders founded by Jerry Falwell in 1971, which sought to take on Washington to bring Christian ethics to bear on policy at a national level.\n\nThe Moral Majority focused on issues related to their priorities for promoting and protecting traditional family values. They celebrated Ronald Reagan’s presidency and encouraged his refusal to act on the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which was killing thousands, largely because they saw it as fundamentally a judgment from God on the “immoral” behavior of homosexuals. According to historian Rachel Colemanâ€Š—â€Ša Ph.D. candidate at Indiana University, who is also a Quiverfull Daughter and whose research focuses on 20th century history of childhood, children, and religionâ€Š—â€Šit wasn’t until kids started getting affected and dying from infected blood in transfusions that the issue was seen as valid. As a result, President Reagan eventually did act, releasing a series of PSAs about the epidemic…but these were all focused on kids, the future of the religious crusade for a Christian United States.\n\nAlso part of this movement was the rise of Operation Rescue, a Christian group that encouraged protest (and, loosely, some terrorist-style) tactics against abortion practitioners and those receiving abortion services. In the wake of Roe v. Wade passing in 1973, the Moral Majority hit on abortion as the issue that would most viscerally and immediately grab the attention of their audience and rally support and action at the grassroots level. We still see this struggle impacting negotiations on the Hill today, as abortion remains an impossibly hot-button issue, regularly derailing policymaking. Shock-and-awe tactics with grisly photos of dead fetuses and terror of increased government oversight on family-related issues drummed up droves of supporters buying into the agenda of the Moral Majority.\n\nThis terror-based approach to protecting the “traditional family” and “family values” had a watershed affect, driving the Right to work against civil protections for sexual orientation and gender presentation, creating a fear frenzy that drove the War on Drugs to incarcerate an entire generation of young black men, while causing Christian universities (led by my alma mater) to seek legal exemption from being under Title IX if they would surrender access to federal funding.\n\nThis collective terror also allowed Phyllis Schlafly and the Moral Majority to lobby successfully against the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1982. The United States is one of the last remaining countries in the world without a constitutional clause that protects the rights of women as full and equal citizens with men, and this prevents us from participating in key international coalitions against gender discrimination (like CEDAW, which we haven’t ratified either). The Moral Majority effectively took the United States backwards a century policy-wiseâ€Šm â€Šand we still haven’t fully recovered.\n\nIt was during this rise of the Moral Majority that Atwood wrote The Handmaid’s Tale. I was born, the first of what would be nine kids, just about five years after the book was first published.\n\nAtwood has given many interviews about the writing of The Handmaid’s Tale and her creative process for it, but the thing that strikes me the most is her comment that she made a rule for herself not to include anything in the novel that hadn’t already been done by some society, somewhere. Nothing was new. And so, as I read the book for the first time that cold morning in 2010, the fictional world sounded a whole lot like my real life.\n\nMy ex-husband, who I met at that same little Christian college and who had also grown up in the same group of churches, wanted nothing more than to be a father, to have 10 kids and to homeschool them. When our marriage was careening to an end, we were sitting in a car outside his family’s house when he asked me if I might consider having a baby with him to rekindle something.\n\nWe’d chosen to wait initially for a host of reasons, the strongest one for me being that I had been raising kids for the last 10 to 12 years of my life and couldn’t see myself having the energy to plunge back into the world of poopy diapers and snotty noses. Two years into our marriage, I’d had a few pregnancy scares and each time as I waited for my period, I had had nightmares and panic attacks, unable to shake a deep-set terror of being trapped at home with a baby and no life outside the home. I would wake up crying and shaking from a dream about being pregnant, and the next morning he’d make me coffee and listen to my stories and try to assuage my fears.\n\nSo when he asked me to have a kid to save our marriage, I was stunned. “Are you serious?” I asked.\n\n“Don’t be that way,” he responded. “I just think that I could love you again if you were a mother.”\n\nSpeechless, I told him to get out of the car. “I’m not discussing this,” I said. “There’s no way in hell I’d bring a kid into this mess if we can’t fix this on our own.\"\n\nIt was our last big fight. We stopped communicating shortly thereafter, and the next time I had a real conversation was at the courthouse after our divorce hearing. He asked me to go to lunch, and I said no, because I running was late for my gynecologist appointment to get an IUD.\n\nOffred learns early on that she is not the first Handmaid to be given to the Commander’s household to bear a child for him and his wife. The last one, she gathers from bits of gossip here and there, committed suicide.\n\nIn her room there is a little cupboard, and on the back wall of the cupboard is scratched nolite te bastardes carborundorum, which is bad Latin for “Don’t let the bastards grind you down.” Offred assumes this message is left for her by the last Handmaid, a hand of camaraderie offered to her from beyond the grave.\n\nWhen I ended my relationship to my father shortly after I got divorced, it was because he and I reached a crossroads where he had to choose to treat me according to his religious ideology or to treat me like a human, his daughter, his firstborn. He chose his ideology, and continued to use it to manipulate and mistreat myself and my mother and my siblings. We stopped talking, and I got my first tattooâ€Š—â€Ša black armband with script, “N.T. B. C.” Don’t let the bastards grind you down. Don’t forget you are human. Don’t forget what you have overcome.\n\nOffred never tells the reader her real nameâ€Š—â€Šshe only says she had another one, once. Under the new regime, her name is that of the man for whom she exists as a birthing vessel. It’s not important, she doesn’t exist as an individual anymore, her life is not her own.\n\nWhen I got divorced, I repudiated the worldview that had been imposed upon me, rejecting a life where I existed only according to my relationship to my father or my husband. I took a new last name, a family name from further back on my grandmother’s side, naming myself to own myself. That was also the year I got my own bedroom for the first time, coming full circle out of a universe where my identity could not exist on its own terms, and carving out for myself a place in the world, a home, a name, a future that was my own to direct.\n\nToday, Donald Trump is president of the United States, and there is increasing “constitutional anxiety” on Capitol Hillâ€Š—â€Šwhat will he do next? Mike Pence is second in line for the presidency, and if Trump is impeached, we will have instead of an incompetent egoist for a president, a calculating and careful man who leaves a legacy behind him of anti-women, anti-LGBTQ, anti-immigrant policy-making. VP Pence is exactly the kind of man the Moral Majority of 1985 would have hoped to elect, as is demonstrated by their rallying around anti-minority and anti-choice legislators and policies and foundations.\n\nThe Quiverfull movement was created for this kind of world. I was raised to be a helpmeet in a world like Offred’s, and watching (white, middle class) liberals around me be shocked and unnerved by the election results has been curious for me. Didn’t they know this has been in the works for decades? I didn’t come out of nowhere, and neither did Trump, and nor did The Handmaid’s Tale.\n\nAtwood recently wrote about the book in the New York Times, in anticipation of the new mini-series coming out on Hulu starring Elisabeth Moss and Alexis Bledel. She writes:\n\n“Is ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ a prediction? That is the third question I’m askedâ€Š—â€Šincreasingly, as forces within American society seize power and enact decrees that embody what they were saying they wanted to do, even back in 1984, when I was writing the novel. No, it isn’t a prediction, because predicting the future isn’t really possible: There are too many variables and unforeseen possibilities. Let’s say it’s an antiprediction: If this future can be described in detail, maybe it won’t happen. But such wishful thinking cannot be depended on either.”\n\nThe publication of The Handmaid’s Tale during the time of the Reagan presidency and the Moral Majority was an apt collision of vision and fears expressed through fictionâ€Š—â€Šthe release of the new mini-series timed at the end of the first 100 days of Donald Trump, U.S. President #45, is a powerful piece of foresight on the behalf of the studio which created it. Americans are more politically engaged than they have been in years, and we would all do well to pay attention to this “antiprediction” of a TV show in hopes that we can learn from it and resist the fruit of 1980s Christian conservative thinking running our government today, and save the future of our democracy.\n\nRead more at The Establishment, and follow us on Facebook and Twitter.",

therefore, understanding, improving and mastering the interpersonal skills will have a positive effect on your overall level of happiness, plus:\n\nThe benefits of improving your interpersonal skills:\n\nIt is increasing your ability to build long-lasting and meaningful relationships.\n\nMakes your communication effective; you get the results you want because you know where you are going and how to get there.\n\nGives you confidence and drive to advance your career.\n\nHelps you to understand yourself and others better.\n\nProvides the tools you need to manage and live your emotions with positive effects.\n\nCreates the perfect ground for you to use and expand your potential and talents.\n\nAllows you to feel connected to other people.\n\nGives you the opportunity to search and find the place where you feel you belong and where you are useful, liked, loved and wanted.\n\nYou are living now through the age of technology and, as technology evolves more and more, you are faced with a dilemma:\n\nHow much of yourself are you sharing and putting into the world?\n\nHow much of yourself are you revealing to those around you because, what technology does the most, it is helping you to stay hidden?\n\nThe danger of immersing yourself in building relationships through, and only through technology is that you lose the ability to be alone sometimes, to be vulnerable, to show people who you are.\n\nAs a consequence, you could end up spending valuable time and energy with:\n\nRelationships that are going nowhere,\n\nMaintaining a personal image that is not YOU,\n\nTrying, without success, to achieve high levels of standards that you don’t have but you pretended to have.\n\nIf the interpersonal skills would have rules…\n\nThe first rule should be to allow people to know you as you are.\n\nbecause who you are is easy to maintain, easy to be honest about it and has the potential to make your life happy and fulfilled.\n\nDon’t be like the Chihuahua.\n\nBecause some celebrities wear them in their purse, everybody wants one, and now, Chihuahua is one of the most abandoned dog breeds in America.\n\nOwn being yourself, and who you are and you will not feel the desire to abandon yourself, most probably, never.\n\nBuild your life on your strengths, abilities, and talents.\n\nWhen you take out the fear of being who you are, you develop the ability to see and accept the rest of people as they are as well, which is a must have interpersonal skill.\n\nMake yourself seen and known, no need to be perfect because when you’re seen and known, you become the beautiful perfectly imperfect human next to another perfectly imperfect human.\n\nPeople don’t care too much if you are perfect or how successful you are, people care, though, very much about what can you do for them, how are you useful to them, what are your skills and knowledge that can enrich their lives, how important they see themselves in your eyes.\n\nYou have tremendous power to make people feel good, or less good.\n\nBeyond being something that you learn to do, Interpersonal skills are something you learn to be:\n\nHow are you related to others?\n\nWhat are you bringing into their lives?\n\nIt takes such little effort and costs to make people feel good about themselves, is it not? Just consider the fact that it takes the same amount of energy to be a positive influence in people’s lives as it takes to be a negative one.\n\nYou can change the world not only, by what you know how to do, but also by how you are in the world and how you’re allowing others to be in your world. Life is not about one winner; in life, you have the power to make winners almost all the people around you.\n\nThe second rule for interpersonal skills could be to See people as people.\n\nCorporate CEO’s and politicians that are taking decisions against others can allow themselves to do it because they took out from their minds the people and they see only the numbers. If these CEO’s and politicians will get to know the people affected by their decisions, they will most certainly take much better decisions because once you know a person personally, it is very hard to do harm intentionally.\n\nSee people as people, understand that they are coming into your life with a history and different life experiences than yours.\n\nStart from the premise that people are good by nature. They will do the best they know how to do.\n\nThe third rule for interpersonal skills could be to allow yourself to be wrong sometimes.\n\nWith being wrong comes progress. How?\n\nBeing wrong sometimes, allows you to get creative, to search outside the box. Creates a need and there is no better teacher or motivator other than a need.\n\nPlus, being wrong can give you more confidence because you can fully appreciate the many times you are right.\n\nIf you are never wrong, you’re setting a very high bar for yourself, a bar that you cannot keep for too long.\n\nUpgrade, improve and discover more about interpersonal skills by checking\n\nThe Core Interpersonal Skills\n\nChapters:\n\n1.

  "latent_17335": "11 Pages Posted: 5 Oct 2010 Last revised: 17 Mar 2017\n\nDate Written: October 4, 2010\n\nAbstract\n\nThe standard police procedural, even including great dramas like NYPD Blue and Hill Street Blues, adheres to time-honored narrative conventions. It focuses on good if sometimes imperfect cops trying to find the real bad guys - the perpetrators - and bring them to justice. A crime had ruptured the social fabric, and at the end of the episode, guilt is determined and things are put to right. The standard procedural is concerned mainly with individual fault and heroism. It does not raise disquieting questions about the criminal justice system, the legal system, or the social and political arrangements that lead to a permanent underclass. There are eight million stories in the Naked City, and in the police procedural, every one of them stands on its own.\n\nThe Wire is a different kind of television. It aims not to reassure but to unsettle, or as David Simon once put it, \"to pick a fight.\" Unlike the standard police procedural, which resolves a discrete problem every week, The Wire keeps widening its lens to reveal the context in which crime and policing take place. Although the show begins as a description of an actual wiretap, the series soon turns out to be about a series of interlocking systems, wired for dysfunction.\n\nThe Wire is deeply concerned with institutions, how they constrain the shape of individual lives, and how they perpetuate themselves, often at the expense of achieving their legitimate goals. However, although the show’s most cherished subject is the institutional roadblocks to good policing, The Wire defies the standard paradigm in this regard as well. It is not one of those cop shows that reflexively portray constitutional rights as annoying hindrances to law enforcement. Other shows tell us that cops need free rein; that we ought to trust their instincts and keep the government and the Constitution off their backs. This show vividly demonstrates that those instincts are sometimes misguided or self protective and that the right kinds of limits can play an important role in good police work.\n\nThis essay is an exploration and appreciation of The Wire’s remarkable portrait of the criminal justice system, with particular attention to its insights about policing and criminal procedure. It uses the chess lesson scene from Season One, “The King Stay the King,” as a starting point.",
  "latent_17359": "Vesa Rantanen is staring straight into my eyes. He heads up research and development at Nokia Technologies, and while holding my gaze, he's telling me the story of how his team ended up in the VR business. But I'm having a hard time paying attention. While he's talking to me, others are gathering around. They're weirdly looking at me. I can hear them whispering on my left, so I turn to take a quick peek. When I do, I see myself in the distance, wearing a Gear VR. I wave, and the me I'm looking at waves at the same time.\n\nIn fact, Rantanen isn't staring into my eyes at all. He's looking into the lens array on the Ozo, Nokia's spherical virtual reality camera. Microphones on the Ozo are picking up his speech, and the whispers of those around him. Through my VR headset and headphones, I can see and hear whatever the Ozo is seeing an hearing nearly as effectively as if it were my own eyes and ears.\n\nIt's not the first time I've tried a VR a headset, but it's the first time I've ever experienced something like this. Instead of diving into 3D computer-generated simulation of a pre-prepared world, Nokia's next-gen spherical camera is actually teleporting me across the room in real time. But that distance of just a few feet could easily be hundreds of miles. That possibility in particular speaks to Nokia's plan.\n\nThe Ozo is set to be unveiled on November 30 in Los Angeles, and expected to cost around $50,000.\n\nDesigned and built in Finland, Nokia's VR camera is made of aluminum, is big about the size of a human head, and weighs less than 10 pounds. The device, which sort of resembles a puffer fish, hosts eight 2K by 2K resolution cameras, each spaced out so the distance between lenses is the same as the distance between two human eyes. This helps the Ozo recreate a realistic view of all perspectives as you move your head around. Images are processed in pairs to create the best possible stereoscopic effect. There are microphones all over it too, Rantanen says. \"Since audio is at least half of the virtual reality experience, we've built eight microphones into OZO for 3D audio capture,\" he tells me. The 195 degree field of view per lens is enough to capture the full surroundings, even behind the \"fin\" at the back of the head where removable SSD cartridge and battery pack are stored. A large opening at the top of the device, and another one beneath it, were designed to function as a natural air cooling system, eliminating the need for a fan and, along with it, any worry about fan noise altering the audio.\n\nThe Ozo is set to be unveiled on November 30 in Los Angeles, and expected to cost around $50,000. That's about three times the price tag of the GoPro Odyssey. However, while the GoPro's footage must still be assembled in laborious post-production processes, the Ozo can generate a full 360-degree stereoscopic video in real time. Thanks to HD-SDI connections on the body, the camera can stream 1.5 Gbps of compressed RAW footage to store data from the streams from the eight lens, broadcast full 360-degree panoramic video, and also stream a low-res feed for monitoring. The camera is Wi-Fi enabled, too, allowing filmmakers to control the system remotely in real time while shooting.\n\nMaurizio Pesce\n\nNokia's bold move into virtual reality is a clear statement that the Finns are still alive, and that they're more interested in the projected $150 billion dollar VR industry than they are in the mobile handset industry.\n\nAnd yet, there's a fil rouge between Nokia's old business and the new one. In fact, when I met the Ozo team earlier this month at Slush, Finland's biggest startup event, it was clear to me that the company's original \"Connecting People\" slogan, which served Nokia well when it dominated mobile phone sales, has just been reinterpreted for the VR era.\n\nGetting to observe and hear what the camera sees and hears in real time with no discernible lag is a huge step forward—and so realistic that I foolishly found myself trying to interact with my surroundings multiple times during the demo. When it comes to playback, too, there's no need to download and assemble multiple files. Ozo's software dynamically stitches all the feeds into a nearly seamless sphere. (There's a very small jump perceptible when your field of view is transitioning between stereo pairs). If needed, Nokia's editing system comes with the option to traditionally render the footage, and the resulting videos will be compatible with existing VR viewers such as HTC Vive and the Oculus-partnered Samsung Gear VR. Unfortunately, even the low-res preview can't be streamed wirelessly, so you still need to be wired up with a cable. This reduces your ability to roam around—but in any case, your movements won't interact with the narrative, so you quickly understand that your only job is stand still and look around. But think of those occasions where an immersive 360-degree view would be ideal, like a trackside experience during a race, or a concert viewed from the stage. You could get front-row seats to anything and never leave the sofa.\n\nMaurizio Pesce\n\nWhen Microsoft closed its Nokia acquisition, roughly 18 months ago, the 200-person Nokia Tecnologies division was created in Helsinki, Finland. Charged with exploring new ways for humans to interact with technology, a bunch of engineers came up with the idea of a virtual reality camera and got the funds to develop some concepts further. Of course, OZO isn't the first out-of-the-box solution for 360 videos, but unlike other options such as Ricoh's Theta S, the 360fly Action Camera and Kodak's spherical-shooting PIXPRO SP360-4K action cam it's the only one that can add some pretty good stereoscopic 3-D effects to the footage. But the Ozo is definitely not a camera intended for consumers. Instead, it's built for professional content creators and broadcasters. And eventually consumers, who'll be on the other end of the streaming. (The company showed the camera off to the Hollywood production community this summer.)\n\nNokia considers virtual reality the best business to exploit its deep expertise in optics, sensors and audio, and wants to use it to revolutionize media and entertainment. That's what Ozo is to Nokia: a category changer. For starters, it will allow people to be in different places, revisit the past looking around in a different directions, and experience a story in different ways. Anyone working in the field will tell you that VR is going to be about a lot more than just games. The New York Times' recent experiment with Cardboard is pointing in that exact direction too. These advancements, both the big ones and the small ones, are each bringing us one step closer to the ultimate empathy machine.",

This means they don’t know how to use contraception properly or keep themselves safe from any STIs, STDs and HIV, and has led to many young people catching them or girls falling pregnant, which has a big knock on effect on their education and employment opportunities, as they are leaving school at a very young age.\n\n“So far the school sessions have been going really well. The children seem to be very interested to learn about sexual reproductive health.\n\n“I spoke to some of the pupils and they said that they had never been shown how to use a condom, but after our session they told us they’d be confident using them from now on. It’s great to know the work we’re doing is making a difference in the local community.”\n\nThe boys travelled to Zambia through the International Citizen Service (ICS) programme, funded by UK aid.\n\nICS volunteers work alongside young local volunteers in some of the poorest communities in Africa, Asia and Latin America on issues like sexual health, education, women’s rights and economic empowerment.\n\nRaphael believes everyone should try volunteering.\n\nHe said: “Volunteering is one of the things that I believe everyone should try at least once. The impact it has is wide reaching, and is vital for development of the world as a whole. To interact with those most in need, and on a personal level, is just something that cannot be achieved in any other way.\n\n“But why did I choose to volunteer to teach sexual health? Well, I would say, you may be surprised on how entangled this specific issue is with the many problems facing Zambia and other developing countries.\n\n“Concerns such as early marriage and teenage pregnancy do not just pose problems for the girls affected, but also for the wider economic and social development of the country.\n\n“Having such a large percentage of dependent people puts a strain on both local communities and governments. The predominance of HIV and AIDS, which not only puts immense difficulties on those affected, but also on the health service and on international aid, which provides most of the treatment for the condition.\n\n“Improving sexual health would not just provide immeasurable benefits for those directly affected, but also for the country as a whole on its path for progress.”\n\nAfter returning to the UK on April 9, Dylan and Raphael will also take on an Action at Home project, to try and use their new skills also benefit their local communities in South Wales.\n\nFelicity Morgan, director of ICS at VSO, said: “ICS volunteers like Raphael are doing amazing work around the world, every day. Our volunteers have helped promote children’s rights in Nigeria, campaign against child marriage in Bangladesh and bring safe drinking water to communities in Nepal.\n\n“We’re incredibly proud that UK Aid is supporting young Brits bring about positive change in some of the world’s poorest communities. As an organisation working on the frontline against poverty VSO see how people across Britain play an important role in delivering UK Aid; from the NHS and Army helping end the Ebola crisis, to the millions who donate, and the contribution we all make through a tiny percentage of our taxes, together we are all making the world fairer.”\n\nFor more information about ICS and how to apply, visit http://www.volunteerics.org/",

  "latent_17397": "The past three parts of this series discussed national interest electric transmission corridors, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC’s) authority to issue federal construction permits over the objections of state and local regulators, and the use of easements, rights of way, and eminent domain by the utilities to get access to the land needed for the transmission lines themselves. In the final part of this series, I discuss a means by which states may be able to avoid being overruled by the FERC and close with some concluding remarks.\n\nUp until now, the “Transmission Infrastructure Modernization” section of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the EPAct) could be construed as a big power grab by the federal government and a usurpation of states’ rights. And, in most respects, that’s an accurate complaint. But at the same time that Congress gave the Federal Electric Regulatory Commission (FERC) the legal authority to overrule local control regarding transmission lines in national interest electric transmission corridors (NIETCs), Congress also gave the states a way to avoid being overruled quite so easily.The EPAct grants the authority for three or more states to enter into “regional transmission siting agencies” (RTSAs). These agencies would “facilitate siting of future electric energy transmission facilities within those States and; carry out the electric energy transmission siting responsibilities of those States.” RTSAs have to be approved by Congress since they’re exercising nominally federal responsibilities, but once approved, the EPAct grants RTSAs the authority to site transmission lines within the states that are part of the regional compact and removes that authority from the federal government (the FERC, specifically). Only in cases where the RTSA’s member states disagree with each other on transmission line siting does the FERC get to step back in.\n\nIf the states want to retain some amount of local control over where transmission lines are constructed or expanded in their state, then their best bet is to get together with the other states and come up with their own plans instead of relying on the federal government to do it for (or against) them. In the event that they form an RTSA, the RTSA has all the authorities that the FERC would otherwise have and no Administration can remove that authority without an act of Congress. So, if New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio want to form an RTSA, or if California and Arizona want to bring Nevada or New Mexico into an RTSA, the states can collectively keep the federal government from overruling all their local decisions on energy types, transmission line routing, etc.\n\nThe nine pages that make up the Title XII, subtitle B (“Transmission Infrastructure Modernization”) represent a massive transfer of authority from the state and local level to the federal level. The broadly defined and vaguely worded powers were probably written with the best of intentions, and I suspect that many of the Representatives and Senators, who voted for the EPAct in 2005 did so with the understanding that they were voting for a bill that would not strip their home states and districts of the authority to decide what happens within their borders. They expected, as I did when I originally heard about these new provisions back in 2005, that the EPAct was written in such a way that it would be applied on a case-by-case basis. Unfortunately, at 551 pages (in .pdf format), the EPAct itself has too much legislation for every Congressperson to spend the week I’ve spent analyzing just a single section (1221), never mind the time it would take to read all 525 sections and anticipate the future ramifications of all of them.\n\nIt’s difficult to know whether Congress voted for a law that was deeply flawed by overly broad and vague language because of inattention and insufficient time to review the legislation or because they wanted to expand federal authority into this arena. The language that Congressional staffers wrote, phrases like “national energy policy,” “energy independence”, and “national defense,” was chosen specifically in order to give current and future Presidents greatly expanded authority. After all, it’s not at all clear what the national energy policy (NEP)actually is. Neither “Reliable, Affordable, Environmentally-Sound Energy” nor the EPAct itself really suffices as a NEP, although both produce sound bites and grand language that sounds great to easily distracted voters.\n\nThere will be a legal challenge to this aspect of the EPAct eventually. The first step of that process was the designation of the two new NIETCs. The next step will be for the FERC to overrule the permitting authority of the state(s) involved. And when that happens, the affected state(s) will sue the FERC and the case will move inexorably through the federal courts until it sits before the Supreme Court. However, there is no reason to believe that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of the state(s). In fact, given the unanimous decision in Berman v. Parker and the 5-4 decision in Kelo v. the City of New London (that was decided by the Court’s liberals), it’s very likely that the Supreme Court will defer to Congressional authority in this regard as well.\n\nThat the federal government has a role in ensuring sufficient redundancy, reliability, and capacity in the power grid cannot reasonably disputed. The problem is that, when we demanded that Congress act on our behalf with regard to electricity transmission lines, they chose to draw the line to closely to the federal government and too far from the control of state and local governments. For this reason we should start demanding of our Congressional representative that the EPAct be revisited and the larger abuses of federal power that presently exist removed.\n\nNo administration, current or future, should have the ability to declare the entire country a region of national interest where state and local laws are meaningless. That way lies madness.\n\nPrevious:\n\nThe Designation of National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors\n\nConstruction Permitting in National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors\n\nRights-of-Way and Exercising Eminent Domain",
  "latent_17407": "Hello everyone! Decided to mix things up a little and make a fic that centers around canon characters. Been a while since I've done something like that so its time to knuckle down and grind off the rust. So without further ado, let's begin to story.\n\nChapter 1: Hitting Home\n\nCinder was a patient woman. Given enough time, she could bring down even the most formidable enemy. Beacon was no exception. She had already infiltrated their ranks and played her part as the harmless foreign student. For all intents and purposes, everyone at the academy was none the wiser to her presence. A deadly mistake on their part.\n\nShe just needed an opening. Beacon had a reputation for being invulnerable, almost mythical in its strength. No normal person could ever hope to put a hole in its defenses. But Cinder knew all too well she was much more than a normal person.\n\nBut there was only one problem, a thorn in her side that refused to go away. Team RWBY had proven to be too meddlesome for their own good. Time and time again they had interfered in her plans, almost ruining them entirely. She wouldn't tolerate such insolence from children. She had to teach them a lesson.\n\nWhich was why she was now sitting in her temporary room in Beacon. Emerald and Mercury had left her on her own, choosing to spend the morning eating breakfast with the other students. She held up the scroll in her hand, a small progress bar flashing on its display.\n\nRWBY reminded her much of Beacon. They were strong, but they weren't untouchable. All it took was a little push in the right spot for everything to fall to pieces. Right now, they were a chain holding her down, but a chain was only as strong as its weakest link.\n\nThe progress bar on her scroll completely filled. The screen turned black until a familiar head of pink and brown hair popped up. Neo smiled, but remained as silent as ever.\n\n\"Break the fool out. I'm not quite finished with him yet. I'm sending you a couple of files. Have him read them and make sure he follows them to the letter,\" Cinder said. Neo gave an amused smirk. With a gracious nod, the screen turned black again.\n\nCinder dropped the scroll on the bed she was sitting on. As much as she wanted to say everything was going smoothly, she knew it wasn't the case. The White Fang's patience was growing thin. Their loyalty was beginning to waver at the time she needed them most. She needed to ensure their cooperation even if that insufferable Faunus Adam Taurus guaranteed it. She needed to throw them a bone. What better way to instill good faith than to attack the people they hated most?\n\nThey needed a motive and she needed results. If this plan went smoothly, she'd satisfy both ends. If she intended to strike a fatal blow against RWBY, she needed to hurt the one who had the most weaknesses, the one who had the most to lose.\n\n\"The Schnee heiress,\" Cinder said as she rose from her bed. The girl loved to put on a cold façade, but Cinder had seen plenty before. All she had to do was put everyone she cared about in the line of fire. Family, friends, even her treasured company would not escape her. Once Cinder hung the bait in front of the Schnee girl, she'd drag her friends to their deaths on her own.\n\nAnd when all was said and done, nobody will suspect a thing. A ruin of ash and fire will be all that remained of the proud Schnee name.\n\nRoman couldn't bring himself to sleep. Even though his holding cell was filled with the night's darkness, he didn't have the slightest urge to lie down and doze off. If anything, he was more awake now than he was when the sun was out. No surprise given his penchant to rob people blind at any hour of the night.\n\nHe watched out of the corner of his eye as yet another guard passed by his cell. That made six in the past hour. It was almost as if they didn't want him to escape. Day in and day out it was the same thing. Sit in his cell in mind-numbing silence for hours on end, receive his meals, maybe endure Ironwood's military bravado for a minute or two, then finish the day with more sitting in silence. This was why he despised prison. Not because of the small cell or the terrible food, but because it was so dreadfully boring.\n\nRoman sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. If he had to spend another day in confinement he just might have considered ratting Cinder out. At least he'd get some amusement from that. But considering the woman's intolerance for anything that didn't fall into her master plan, he doubted it was a healthy alternative to sitting in a cell and suffering Ironwood's egotistical chest pounding.\n\nOn the other side of his cell, another guard passed by. He eyed Roman for a moment before continuing his rounds. It was already late and he was eager to turn in for the night. The guard halted when he caught sight of a small figure leaning on a cane a few feet away. Her face was obscured by the parasol she held over her head, but the odd multi-colored clothing she wore made it clear enough she wasn't another guard.\n\n\"This is a restricted area! Put your hands where I can see them!\" the guard shouted as he raised his rifle. The girl with the parasol lifted it just slightly so that her mismatched eyes appeared. A cocky smirk grew on her face as she pulled the parasol to her side, revealing a black bowler hat with a red band on her head.\n\n\"This is your last warning! Put your hands in the air or I will shoot!\" the guard said. Neo closed her parasol and nonchalantly strolled towards the guard, her smug grin never leaving. The guard's finger inched closer to the trigger, his teeth gritting as Neo took one carefree step after another.\n\n\"That's it!\" the guard stood his ground and pulled the trigger. His rifle cracked an ear-splitting bang. Neo twitched as the bullet struck her chest. Her chest cracked and splintered. Then her entire body shattered like glass.\n\nThe guard could barely utter a sound of confusion before Neo suddenly appeared behind him, wrapping the hook of Roman's cane around his neck and pulling him back while thrusting her other hand towards his spine.\n\nA spike of blinding pain speared through his torso. The agony nearly making him black out. A warm feeling spread to his chest and down his legs, staining his clothes crimson. His eyes fell on the long, thin blade protruding from his chest. A pool of blood steadily flowed from the wound.\n\nNeo pulled back her blade and let the guard fall into a puddle of his own blood. Wiping the blade clean with her gloved hand, she sauntered over to Roman's cell. That gunshot was going to attract attention. She needed to move fast if she had any hope of making a smooth exit.\n\nShe stopped in front of Roman's cell and pulled a security card from her pocket. She swiped it across the card reader next to Roman's door and stepped back as it slid open.\n\nRoman looked up at Neo, his eyes narrowing. The shorter girl tossed him his cane and he grabbed it with one hand, but still he didn't move a muscle.\n\n\"You're wearing my hat,\" he said. Neo rolled her eyes with a playful grin and gave Roman a curtsy, her head bowed and her arm outstretched. Roman's hat fell from her head and rolled down her arm into her open hand.\n\nRoman rose from his seat and took his hat from her hand. He didn't bother asking her if she had a plan or even if she was here on her own. He knew Neo well enough to know she always came prepared. He walked past her into the open hall, looking down at the bloody corpse of the guard with disgust.\n\n\"Well, he certainly had it coming,\" he said as he passed by the corpse, being careful not to step in the slowly growing pool of blood. Neo stopped next to him and jabbed the handle of her parasol into his side, drawing a scowl from him.\n\n\"What do you want, a thank you?\" he asked. Neo shook her head and pointed her parasol at the window taking up the entire wall behind them. From their vantage point, they could see Beacon Tower glowing brightly in the night sky. A black dot slowly grew larger and larger until Roman could make out the fine details of an airship heading right for them.\n\nRoman grinned and lifted his cane, firing a flare into the window. A rush of hot air brushed past them as the window exploded. Alarms blared throughout the complex, washing the hall with flashing red lights.\n\nThe airship turned to the side as it glided to a stop. A door on its hull slid open, revealing a group of White Fang soldiers armed with guns. They quickly mobilized, surrounding Torchwick and aiming their weapons down the hall as guards suddenly poured out from the opposite side.\n\nThe White Fang opened fire, gunning down every guard not in cover. Roman aimed his cane and fired another flare at a guard hiding behind a pillar. The explosion knocked him to the ground where he was swiftly riddled with bullets by the White Fang.\n\nRoman lowered his cane, watching with a smirk as every guard tried to return fire only to be forced back into cover by a hail of bullets. Roman walked backwards into the airship's door, waving the pinned officers goodbye.\n\n\"You've been lovely hosts but I really must be going. Tell Ironwood I regret not thanking him in person,\" he said. Neo came to his side and snapped her fingers. Immediately, the White Fang retreated back into the airship as it lifted into the sky. Roman stepped back into the airship's cabin, the door sliding shut behind him. A flurry of rapid pinging noises reverberated in the room as the guards tried in vain to shoot the airship down.\n\nRoman snickered as he turned his back to the door. He could feel the hum of the engines flare to life as his body was pressed downwards from the ship's takeoff. He took a quick look around the airship's cabin, noticing a large group of White Fang soldiers sitting in the corner.\n\nThe interior of the airship was exquisitely designed. Leather couches were placed against walls painted with elaborate diamond patterns. At the far end of the cabin was a fully stocked bar with every type of liquor from the four kingdoms. Each window was flanked with a pair of black velvet curtains that matched the carpet. There were even a few statues of abstract design scattered about the cabin. But what drew Torchwick's attention was the Schnee Dust Company logo printed on the ceiling.\n\n\"You've been busy, haven't you?\" Torchwick asked. Neo reached into her coat pocket and fished out a scroll, holding it out to him. Torchwick took the scroll from her. A series of pictures were displayed on the screen. A massive mountain, a high-class home built on its steep surface, an SDC guard facility, a monorail, and a dust quarry were all there and explained in painstaking detail.\n\n\"I appreciate the thought, Neo. But we have enough dust to buy Vytal ten times over. I'm not interested in hitting the Schnees as much fun as that would be,\" Roman said as he held the scroll out to Neo. The shorter girl furrowed her brow and pushed his hand back. She pressed a finger against the screen and flicked it to the side. A long page of paragraphs filled the screen.\n\nRoman raised a brow and scanned through every word. The more he read, the wider his smile grew. No doubt this was all Cinder's doing. The woman had a knack for learning every little detail about her enemies. She was more clever than he gave her credit for. He could get all the results with virtually no way of it coming back to him. That was assuming of course, the plan went off without a hitch.\n\n\"Oh Red, you're never going to see this coming. Not until you and your friends are six feet under. Hmm…maybe a little more than six feet,\" he said. He slid the scroll into his pocket, giving Neo an appreciative nod.\n\n\"I believe you just made this worth my time. I just hope Cinder follows through on her side of the plan,\" he said. Neo shrugged with a playful grin. Everything was falling into place. Cinder's plan was set in motion and by the end of tomorrow, the Schnee Estate would be theirs. Once that was done, they'd begin the real work. All they had to do was give the right people a little push. The rest would take care of itself.\n\nYang wearily blinked away her sleep. She looked through half-lidded eyes at the clock hanging on the wall.\n\n\"Guhh…why is it so early? Just five more minutes…\" she muttered, trying to ignore the voices coming from somewhere in the room. She buried herself deeper into a mess of blankets and pillows, sighing contently. She didn't care if she had classes. She didn't care if the voices in the room were growing more insistent. But she did kind of care when something snatched her precious warm blankets from her grasp.\n\n\"Yang, it's Saturday. Get up. It's almost noon,\" Blake said. Yang groaned and curled into the fetal position, shaking her head adamantly.\n\n\"It's still too early,\" she replied. Her hand shot suddenly shot out and snatched her covers back from Blake's grip. Yang quickly wrapped herself into a bundle and shut her eyes, hoping it would be enough to send her into another deep sleep.\n\n\"Yang, you need to see this,\" Blake said. Her tone sounded more serious than usual, causing Yang to crack an eye open. Next to Blake, Ruby was holding her scroll out. A news report was playing on the screen. Yang raised a brow and reluctantly pulled herself out of bed. She sat up to see what appeared to be a newscast in the midst of a report.\n\n\"According to official reports, only one convict was able to escape in the ensuing chaos. Roman Torchwick, responsible for multiple dust-related thefts throughout Vale, was reportedly aided in his escape by a group of White Fang members. Police are currently asking for tips regarding his whereabouts but stress that civilians should not confront him directly. He is reported as being armed and dangerous.\"\n\nBlake narrowed her eyes as a picture of Roman appeared on the screen. He was only captive for a few days before he managed to escape. She should have expected as much. It was foolish to think he'd stay locked up forever.\n\n\"It seems the White Fang will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. Even if it means breaking someone like Torchwick out,\" she said. Yang looked away from the scroll in Ruby's hand, a look of concern on her face.\n\n\"You're not going to tear your hair out trying to find him again, are ya?\" she asked. Blake ruefully shook her head.\n\n\"There's no point. We don't have the slightest idea where he could be. I doubt he'd go back to Mountain Glenn after everything that's happened,\" Blake said. Ruby tore her eyes away from her scroll, her expression brimming with youthful determination\n\n\"Don't worry, Blake. We'll catch him for sure,\" she said. Blake turned to her leader with a small smile.\n\n\"I appreciate the confidence, Ruby,\" she said. Ruby gave an enthusiastic nod and returned to looking at her scroll. Blake turned to the window that overlooked most of Beacon's grounds. She could see Vale off in the horizon. Her amber eyes narrowed as a familiar, uneasy thought resurfaced in her mind.\n\nThe White Fang used to stand for something. They used to be the only shelter Faunus had. Now they're little better than the people they protected us from. Should I just give up on them?\n\nBlake frowned. She didn't relish the thought of abandoning all hope for her brothers and sisters in the White Fang. For everything they'd done, she wanted to believe there was still good in them. There had to be. The White Fang saved her from a terrible life. Even if they were a shadow of their former selves, they could still accomplish some good in the world.\n\n\"Hey, where's Weiss?\" Yang asked. Blake snapped out of her thoughts. Weiss, as usual, was the first to get up. Even during the weekend she made a habit of waking early in the morning.\n\n\"She went to the CCT. Judging from the look on her face, she wasn't very happy to go,\" Blake said. Yang raised a brow as she stood up from her bed.\n\n\"Isn't she always like that though?\" she quipped. Blake allowed a small smile and shrugged. She woke up not long after Weiss. Even if she was half-asleep, it wasn't hard to notice the scorn on Weiss' face when she was getting dressed. It was a face she usually reserved for whenever Ruby's antics interrupted her homework or when Jaune tried to ask her out again. Whatever called her attention to the CCT, she didn't seem enthusiastic to deal with it.\n\nBlake returned her attention to the window. After scouting Mountain Glenn and stopping a Grimm invasion in the middle of the city, she was determined to relax a little. She sat down on her bed, her eyes falling on a book lying beside her.\n\nI suppose reading a few chapters won't hurt.\n\nThe elevator door opened with a smooth hiss, revealing Weiss' less than pleased face. As usual the CCT was filled with other Beacon students contacting home with smiles on their faces. Weiss hardly counted herself among them.\n\nUsually she would have made the call from the library's own communication terminals, but considering the likelihood of her have a shouting match with her own sister, she elected to make the call from here.\n\nWeiss stepped into the circular room, immediately making a beeline towards the front desk. As usual, a holographic attendant was sitting at attention, a small smile on its face.\n\n\"Welcome to the Beacon Cross Continental Transmit center. How may I help you?\" the projection asked. Weiss folded her arms, her dangerous scowl growing as she almost spit her words out.\n\n\"There's a call waiting for me from Atlas from a Winter Schnee,\" she said. The hologram didn't seem the least bit put off by her rude tone as she made a few beeping noises before smiling again.\n\n\"Please head over to terminal 10. Winter Schnee will be patched in momentarily,\" the hologram said. Weiss gave the hologram a curt nod and moved to the corner of the room. She sat down in front of the terminal with her arms crossed, her fingers drumming against the sleeves of her jacket. The monitor hummed to life and lit up, flashing Beacon Academy's insignia.\n\nThe monitor dimmed to black and Winter came into view. Her skin was just as pale as her namesake, unmarred by scars or blemishes. Her long white hair was tied into a neat braid; her bangs combed to the side and kept in place by a hairclip in the shape of a snowflake. Her eyes were a clear crystal blue, much like Weiss' own.\n\nFrom what little Weiss could see, Winter had once again lavished herself in the finest clothes money could buy. Her jeweled earrings, diamond necklace, and expensive looking fur collared coat made it painfully obvious she was the kind of girl who reaped the benefits of their wealth while carrying none of the burden that came with it.\n\n\"Winter,\" Weiss said, her voice dripping with venom. Her sister didn't seem to notice or care about the malice in her tone. She nodded and flashed a brief smile.\n\n\"Weiss, it's good to see you. You took a rather long time to answer. I was beginning to think I'd been stood up,\" she said. Weiss frowned. Not even ten seconds in and Winter was already making jabs at her.\n\nI can't let her have the upper hand. Don't give away anything.\n\nWeiss' expression stayed perfectly still. Living her whole life being groomed as the heiress to the Schnee Dust Company, she learned to keep a cool head and a steady hand. She had to be well-versed in business and negotiation if the SDC had any hope of surviving under her leadership. As petty as it may have seemed, talking to Winter was no different than talking to a rival company head. It was a battlefield in its own right, operating on a completely different set of rules.\n\nNever let them think they have the upper hand. Make them feel like it's a privilege that they even share the same space as you. Schnees always hold the power, Weiss. We are the epitome of perfection. Act like it.\n\nHer father's words echoed in her mind. That was how he lived. It was how he raised the SDC to become an industrial powerhouse. Having a sharp tongue and a sharper blade was what made a Schnee. She had to do the same now.\n\n\"My free time has been stretched rather thin as of late, Winter. I'm sure you're aware of how busy I've been ever since I left home,\" Weiss said in a business-like manner. Winter merely chuckled in response. Weiss should have expected as much. Even though she wasn't next in line to lead the SDC, she had plenty of training in business and political maneuverings. Of course, Winter's skills were nothing compared to her own.\n\n\"I'm sorry if my call came at an inopportune time. I sometimes forget you're halfway across the world studying all manner of things. None of which seem to be aimed towards helping father,\" Winter replied. Weiss forced herself to suppress her scowl. She had no idea what it was like having to hold up to her father's standards. She had to do more than Winter could ever imagine. What right did she have to say Weiss wasn't doing anything to help father?\n\n\"You'd be surprised what you can learn when you leave home, Winter,\" Weiss replied. Winter rolled her eyes and shrugged.\n\n\"I suppose it can't be helped. I only meant to call because I'm rather bored here. Mother insisted we spend some quality time as a family in the vacation home. Really, it's just a fancy way of saying 'let's avoid each other like we always do in a different house',\" Winter said. Weiss raised a brow. She had been to the vacation home plenty of times. Sitting on a wide cliff on a mountain, it had an impressive view of the surrounding valleys and mountain ranges. It was also fairly close to one of the largest quarries the SDC operated.\n\nBecause of the quarry's close proximity to their home, a guard facility was built at the base of the mountain in case any Faunus decided to 'start a hopeless uprising' as her father put it. There were a few cases of Faunus acting out or disobeying orders. It always ended the same way. A merciless crackdown on the instigators and harsh punishments to ensure it won't happen again even if those punished had nothing to do with it.\n\nI wonder what Blake would think if she knew what really went on in those quarries. She thought.\n\n\"Why call me then? You understand that I have a lot of pressing issues at the moment,\" Weiss said. Winter pulled her braid over her shoulder, absently running a hand over it as she looked downwards.\n\n\"Well I was hoping to have some sisterly bonding if nothing else,\" she said. Weiss heard what sounded like a sharp knocking sound coming from the other end. Winter looked up with a confused face.\n\n\"Who could possibly be at my door now?\" Winter stood up from her chair and disappeared from view. Weiss could hear her footsteps come to stop and heard her door open.\n\nThen she heard her sister's panicked screams.\n\nWeiss stood up from her seat, her hands planted on the terminal's desk. She could hear things crashing in Winter's room and what sounded like a scuffle and Winter's cries for help.\n\n\"Winter?! WINTER!? What's going on?!\" Weiss shouted. The other line went quiet. Weiss couldn't see anything on the terminal. Weiss' heart felt like it was lodged in her throat. Her whole body shivered, begging for a sign that her sister was okay.\n\nThen she saw it.\n\nA white coat. A cane. And a bowler hat.\n\nIt was Torchwick.\n\n\"Well, this is certainly awkward. I didn't mean to interrupt your courtesy call, Ice Queen. Please, forget I was ever here,\" Roman said. He walked out of sight, making a sharp whistle to someone in the room. Then Weiss saw a familiar girl with a parasol step in front of Winter's terminal. With an evil smirk, Neo pulled her parasol back and smashed it against the terminal, turning the screen black.\n\nWeiss felt like she was frozen. Every part of her body felt numb and tense at the same time. A sharp, jagged feeling rose up in her chest as her knuckles clenched to impossible limits. Her mind was running with one incoherent thought after another. But there was only one thought that came in as clear as day.\n\nI have to do something!",
  "latent_17485": "First female-focused brand to launch cannabis in Canada; celebrating with Women & Weed speaker series Nov. 7\n\nTORONTO, ON--(Marketwired - October 19, 2017) - Van der Pop (VdP), North America's leading female-focused cannabis brand, is pleased to announce its two branded strains of cannabis will be available for purchase by the end of November, in partnership with WeedMD, a federally-licensed producer and distributor of medical cannabis in Canada, through the WeedMD website. VdP will offer two different strains exclusively to patients registered through the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) system. Van der Pop will celebrate the launch with the inaugural 'Van der Pop Presents: Women & Weed' event on Nov. 7 in Toronto, providing an engaging, educational afternoon for women, focused on a variety of cannabis-related topics. The event was created as a result of a large-scale North American survey undertaken by Van der Pop in August 2017, unearthing beliefs and perceptions surrounding cannabis held by the 1500 women consulted. Results from the ground-breaking survey will also be unveiled and discussed.\n\nTrue to VdP's aim to provide beautifully designed products and experiences to consumers, the strains will be available as part of a limited edition kit that will feature each strain in childproof packaging, two sleek Miren jars for airtight, UV-protected storage, VdP rolling papers and other welcome goodies. The launch will be marked with a free speaker's series called Van der Pop Presents: Women & Weed on Tuesday, November 7, focused on topics and issues in the cannabis industry specifically as they relate to women, featuring keynote speakers Tahira Rehmatullah (former GM of Marley Natural), Barinder Rasode (CEO, NICHE Canada), Olivia Harris (CCO, LEVO) and more, hosted by April Pride (founder of Van der Pop). Van der Pop will also partner with a brand-new group called High, The Collective, to present one of the panels. The Van der Pop study surveyed more than 1500 women across North America and focused on their experiences with the current cannabis landscape, attitudes, perceptions, behaviours and expectations about the future of the industry as it adapts to growing legalization.\n\n\"I am thrilled to finally release this collaboration. Our goal is to provide a consistent, beautiful experience for women that addresses their therapeutic needs. We're confident that these carefully-chosen, grown and cultivated strains will fit in perfectly with the rest of our Van der Pop offerings,\" said Pride. \"The launch kit is the cherry on top of this partnership with WeedMD, and I'm so looking forward to our November event. It's going to be an insightful, exciting day speaking on a whole host of cannabis-related issues with an incredible lineup of accomplished women.\"\n\nThe Study\n\nSignificant findings include the fact that, while 6 out of 10 female cannabis consumers search online for cannabis related info, only 26% feel like they have a go-to resource. As well, nearly 7 in 10 women who either consume cannabis or are interested in doing so, feel there is a negative stigma associated with cannabis consumption, relatively consistent across legal, medicinal and pre-legalization states in the US, as well as in Canada. The conclusion that women have a thirst for accurate, specific information about cannabis led to the creation of the innovative Women & Weed event, to help guide women through the cannabis space and create an opportunity to connect with like-minded consumers.\n\nEvent Details\n\nVan der Pop Presents: Women & Weed (Nov. 7 at The Addisons Residence, 2 to 6:45 p.m.): will feature prominent speakers such as Olivia Harris (CCO LEVO), Tahira Rehmatullah (former GM of Marley Natural), Barinder Rasode (CEO, NICHE Canada), marijuana maven Irie Selkirk, Brandi Leifso (Evio Beauty Group), Michelle Bilodeau (High, the Collective) and Tokyo Smoke's own Odessa Paloma Parker (Head of Content) and Berkeley Poole (Creative Director). The series will be hosted by Van der Pop founder April Pride, and will be free for 100 women to attend with advance registration here. Speakers will cover topics such as design, fashion and creativity in the cannabis industry, wellness, the medical perspective, and unique challenges and opportunities that female entrepreneurs and employees face in the industry. High, The Collective, a brand-new group formed by Michelle Bilodeau, Sue Kuruvilla, Deanne Moser and Chrissy Roebuck, will co-present the entrepreneur-focused segment, featuring panelists such as Jennifer Newton of Zjuzj (a lifestyle line that creates perfect accoutrements to cannabis) and cannabis advocate Sarah Hanlon (Big Brother Canada 3).\n\n\"As a leading Canadian cannabis grower and producer, we are thrilled to promote opportunities to collaborate and encourage communication with our industry peers – always collecting feedback and adapting our products to provide what consumers want. The innovative 'Women & Weed' event and study is exactly why we chose to partner with a company like Van der Pop,\" said Bruce Dawson-Scully, CEO of WeedMD. \"We need people like April and the Van der Pop team to lead the industry and ensure that everyone has access to accurate, up-to-date information.

  "latent_17486": "Black Lives Matter activists finally have an answer to critics demanding specific policy proposals.\n\nThis has been a central question posed to the movement, which aims to eliminate racial disparities in the criminal justice system, since it rose to national prominence following the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. A lot of groups — from supporters to media to Hillary Clinton — have challenged the movement to define its policy agenda.\n\n\"You're going to have to come together as a movement and say, 'Here's what we want done about it,'\" Clinton said in a meeting with Black Lives Matter activists last week. \"Because you can get lip service from as many as white people as you can pack into Yankee stadium and a million more like it, who are going to say, 'Oh, we get it, we get it. We're going to be nicer.' That's not enough — at least in my book. That's not how I see politics.\"\n\nBut now activists have an answer to Clinton's call with the launch of Campaign Zero. The website details several proposals to limit police use of force, particularly shootings against black people who are disproportionately likely to die at the hands of police. The proposals aren't particularly surprising for anyone who's closely followed the Black Lives Matter movement, but it's the most comprehensive set of ideas ever released by advocates.\n\nWhat is Campaign Zero?\n\nCampaign Zero, launched by We the Protesters, has a single — but ambitious — goal: reduce all police violence in the US to zero. To do this, the campaign laid out several policy proposals that it says were \"informed by the demands of protesters nationwide, the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, recommendations from research organizations, and comprehensive data on the causes and impact of police violence.\" (Note that the policies weren't put forward by the official Black Lives Matter group, which doesn't necessarily represent all activists who have adopted the \"Black Lives Matter\" cause.)\n\nThe campaign broke down its policy ideas to 10 categories:\n\nEnd broken windows policing. This refers to a style of policing that goes after minor crimes and activities, based on the notion that letting minor crimes go unaddressed can foster and lead to even worse crimes in a community. In practice, this tactic has disproportionately impacted minority Americans — in New York City, the vast majority of stops in 2012 were of black or Hispanic people. Campaign Zero proposes ending this type of policing by decriminalizing or deprioritizing public alcohol consumption, marijuana possession, disorderly conduct, trespassing, loitering, disturbing the peace, and spitting, as well as ending racial profiling and establishing mental health response teams that are better equipped to deal with mental health crises (which can result in, for example, disorderly conduct) than police. Community oversight. When a police officer engages in misconduct, the most likely organization to investigate the situation is the police department the officer comes from — creating an obvious conflict of interest. Campaign Zero proposes adding more community oversight over police by making it easier for citizens to file complaints and establishing civilian-run commissions that will help set policy at police departments and make recommendations for discipline following a civilian complaint. Limit use of force. Police officers are currently allowed to use deadly force when they merely perceive — albeit reasonably, according to courts — a deadly threat, even if a threat isn't actually present. And police departments aren't required to report uses of force to the federal government. Campaign Zero proposes authorizing deadly force only when there is an imminent threat to the officer's life or the life of another person, and the use of force is strictly unavoidable to protect life. It also proposes changing police policies, including reporting and use of force standards. Independently investigate and prosecute. Following a police shooting, investigations are typically headed by the police department and the local prosecutor's office, which has close ties to the police department — both of which create conflicts of interest. Campaign Zero wants governments to establish independent prosecutors at the state level for cases in which police seriously injure or kill someone, which would now require an investigation. The campaign also suggests reducing the standard of proof for federal civil rights investigations of police officers. Community representation. In some communities, the racial demographics of the police force are wildly different from the community they represent. Ferguson, for example, is about two-thirds black, but only three of 53 commissioned police officers were black at the time of the Brown shooting. Campaign Zero says police departments should develop and publicly release plans to achieve representative proportion of women and people of color through outreach, recruitment, and changes to policies. Body cameras and filming the police. Most police departments still don't fully equip officers with body cameras, and many don't have dashboard cameras for their cars. But recording devices have played a crucial role in holding police accountable — in Cincinnati, for instance, a body camera filmed a campus police officer's shooting of Samuel DuBose, leading the local prosecutor to conclude that the shooting was \"asinine,\" \"senseless,\" and \"unwarranted\" before he pressed charges. Campaign Zero suggests equipping all police officers with body cameras, as well as banning cops from taking people's cellphones or other recording devices without the person's consent or a warrant. Training. Many police departments only require training on an annual or one-time basis, and the training tends to focus on use of force, not on deescalation or racial bias. Campaign Zero suggests requiring officers to go undergo training on a quarterly basis, with greater focus on addressing subconscious racial biases and other prejudices against, for example, LGBTQ people. End for-profit policing. In some jurisdictions, police are used by local governments as a revenue generator. One of the most damning findings from the Justice Department report on Ferguson is that the police department and courts issued fines and fees to help fill local budget gaps. Campaign Zero tries to eliminate these perverse incentives by ending police department quotas for tickets and arrests, limiting fines and fees on low-income people, and stopping police from taking money or property from innocent people, as they currently do through \"civil forfeiture\" laws. Demilitarization. The Ferguson protests captured nationwide attention after police deployed militarized equipment — sniper rifles, riot gear, camouflage, armored trucks, and chemical agents such as tear gas — against largely peaceful demonstrators. But police have this type of gear in large part because the federal government subsidizes it or gives it away to local and state police. Campaign Zero proposes ending the 1033 program that provides militarized equipment to police, as well as limiting when local and state police can purchase and use this type of equipment. Fair police contracts. Police unions have negotiated strong contracts for their officers over the past few decades, sometimes imposing big hurdles to investigations — such as the 48-hour rule, which prevents investigators from talking to an officer involved in a shooting until 48 hours pass. Campaign Zero aims to eliminate these types of barriers while requiring police departments keep officers' disciplinary history accessible to the public and ensuring officers don't get paid while they're being investigated for seriously injuring or killing a civilian.\n\nIn addition to these specific proposals, Campaign Zero also outlines different federal, state, and local plans that put these ideas into law. The campaign also put out a fact sheet on where different 2016 presidential candidates stand on their proposals, which should help supporters hold candidates accountable.\n\nWhat do Campaign Zero's policy proposals hope to address?\n\nThe proposals are specifically aimed at eliminating police violence, particularly against minority communities that are disproportionately impacted by policing. The campaign points to police in other developed countries — such as Germany and Japan — that manage to go through a full year without killing more than a dozen people (although these countries also have fewer guns, which means much less gun violence overall). And it cites some of the many troubling statistics in the US.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post's database, police have shot and killed 624 people so far in 2015. Nearly 22 percent of those shot and killed didn't have a deadly weapon, nearly 10 percent were completely unarmed, and more than 26 percent exhibited signs of mental illness.\n\nHistorically, these types of police killings have been racially skewed, as an analysis of the available (but incomplete) FBI data by Vox's Dara Lind found: Black people accounted for 31 percent of police shooting victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population.\n\nBlack teens were 21 times as likely as white teens to be shot and killed by police between 2010 and 2012, according to a ProPublica analysis of the FBI data. ProPublica reported: \"One way of appreciating that stark disparity, ProPublica's analysis shows, is to calculate how many more whites over those three years would have had to have been killed for them to have been at equal risk. The number is jarring — 185, more than one per week.\"\n\nSubconscious racial biases, known as implicit biases, may explain the disparities. Studies show, for example, that officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in video game simulations. Josh Correll, a University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor who conducted the research, said it's possible the bias could lead to even more skewed outcomes in the field. \"In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,\" he said, \"we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them.\"\n\nWhen police do use force, they're given wide legal latitude to do so — since they only have to reasonably perceive a threat, even if a threat isn't actually present. The two Supreme Court decisions — Tennessee v. Garner and Graham v. Connor — that established this standard give officers a lot of legal room to use force without fear of punishment, in the hopes that cops won't hesitate when they need to make split-second decisions to protect themselves and bystanders. Police officers say the loose standard is essential to their safety, although critics argue that these loose legal standards give law enforcement a license to kill innocent or unarmed people.\n\nCampaign Zero's policy proposals aim to address all of these problems. Stronger standards for use of force will limit when cops can shoot and otherwise hurt people. Implicit bias training could help officers overcome their subconscious prejudices. Body cameras will help hold cops accountable when they use force. And so on. It's a comprehensive set of proposals for a very broad set of problems.\n\nCan Campaign Zero's ideas work?\n\nThe policies could certainly reduce police use of force. But it's unlikely — for reasons unrelated to policing policies — that they can eliminate all police violence, as the campaign hopes to do.\n\nThe policy proposals are fairly reasonable. As much as this is a wish list for the Black Lives Matter movement, it's also a list of proposals that I have personally heard and seen from criminal justice experts over the past year — including the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Nothing in the list stuck out as particularly surprising, shocking, or unfeasible to me — although police advocates will certainly argue that some of the ideas, such as a higher legal standard for allowing use of force, could endanger officers' lives.\n\nStill, the goal to eliminate police violence altogether is unrealistic. There are always going to be situations in which police need to use deadly force. That's especially true in America, which is more violent — in part because it has way more guns — than its developed peers.\n\nFor example, a recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that police are much more likely to be killed in states with more firearms.\n\nApplying this to the international level, it seems likely America will always have more police killed on duty than other developed countries. According to UN data compiled by Simon Rogers for the Guardian, the US had 88.8 guns per 100 people in 2007. That's almost one gun per person in the US, and nearly double the second-closest country, Yemen, which has 54.8 guns per 100 people.\n\nFor US police officers, this means they not only will encounter more guns and deadly violence, but they can expect to encounter more guns and deadly violence, making them more likely to anticipate and perceive a threat and use deadly force as a result.\n\nBut even if eliminating all police violence is unrealistic, it's certainly a laudable goal that most people can get behind. And now, with these clear proposals, advocates will be able to go back to presidential candidates like Hillary Clinton and ask what exactly they're going to do about this issue — without facing questions that may paint the movement as bumbling or unclear.\n\nWatch: Why it's so important to film the police",

  "latent_17546": "This article originally appeared on VICE Canada.\n\nLet's face it: Really rich white guys have a whole range of options for how to spend their time and money when they can literally do and buy anything. They can hole up in a Vegas penthouse, hire an entirely Mormon staff because they're the only people worth trusting, grow ridiculously long fingernails and buy out the last remaining supply of banana nut ice cream at Baskin-Robbins. Or they can run for public office, pretend to give a shit about the dwindling opportunities faced by the Joe and Jill Lunchbuckets of the lower classes, and get elected the leader of the free world. What with these options on the table, retiring to play golf seems like a terrible failure of imagination.\n\nFor Daniel Plainview—the oil-tycoon hero played so imperiously by Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood, Paul Thomas Anderson's fifth and still greatest cinematic achievement—nothing says \"I'm king of the world!\" like staying good and smashed inside your own mansion that's full of cool stuff to shoot with a gun. And it has a bowling alley. Sure, Plainview's bristly face could use a shave, and he probably could've used one or two of those Mormons around to discourage him from bludgeoning guests to death with bowling pins, but not even Anthony Robbins could deny that the man has realized his full potential when he cries, \"I'm finished!\"\n\nPlainview's final line is the film's second-most iconic piece of dialogue after our hero's earlier boast about drinking up any and every milkshake you bring to his yard. But even now, ten years after the movie's original release, it doesn't feel like There Will Be Blood is done with us. Instead, Anderson's caustic parable about ambition, wealth, power, and the raw, ruthless ways of American capitalism may have more to say about our historical moment (and the imperatives that produced it) than any movie that doesn't have The Purge in its title.\n\nAnderson partially based his saga on the life of Edward Doheny, a genuine oil tycoon who bought up vast chunks of California and Mexico and got stinking rich thanks to what he found underneath. Writer Upton Sinclair had previously included a fictionalized version of Doheny in Oil!, the 1927 novel on which There Will Be Blood is officially, if loosely, based. (Anderson is likely to repeat this strategy of melding historical and fictional elements now that he's reunited with Day-Lewis to shoot a thus-far-untitled drama about a dressmaker for royals and other wealthy swells, a character purportedly based on pioneering fashion designer Charles James.)\n\nBut don't let the early-20th-century setting delude you into believing There Will Be Blood can be viewed from a safe historical remove—what we see in the movie's sun-scorched Californian landscapes should be familiar, since it's really our world being born. After all, it's about a man who understands the art of the deal and who anticipates our limitless thirst for the black stuff seeping up through the dirt. Plainview's story serves as an unusually frank exposé of what it really takes to get to the top of our heap in a system that routinely turns a blind eye to the misdeeds and malfeasance of the people who get rich enough to rig it. After all, the only person strong enough to destroy Plainview is Plainview himself—no one else even gets close.\n\nFrom the very first moment we see him deep in a mine (which makes his rise a literal one),\n\nPlainview's progress seems both inexorable and inevitable. He begins in humble and mucky conditions, but thanks to his determination, he soon masters his surroundings just as surely as he commandeers the people around him. In due course, he fills the film's landscapes and vistas with his derricks, pipelines, and other signs of his dominance. Nearly everyone he encounters submits to his will. Those who don't are subject to outpourings of rage that leave them stunned, humiliated, or dead.\n\nAlready packed with plenty of force thanks to Day-Lewis's customary degree of intensity, There Will Be Blood may have actually gained power over the last decade. That's largely because Plainview's ambition and attitudes—which inevitably read very differently as the Bush era petered out and Democrats peddled messages of hope—now seem writ large in Trump's equally cutthroat vision of American enterprise and society. Despite its sometimes more cautionary aspects, Plainview's narrative arc now doubles as a motivational training session, a testament to what you too can achieve with a combination of rugged individualism, a relentlessly competitive nature, and an internal reservoir of skillfully concealed misanthropy. His can-do spirit seems uniquely attuned to our times. \"I want no one else to succeed,\" he explains in a rare moment of candor that now feels appropriately Trumpian.\n\nOne reason Plainview's such a compelling figure is that he is capable of recognizing the energies that drive him and prevent him from ever being satisfied. Actually, Plainview's problems are probably worse than that. \"I hate most people,\" he confesses in the same conversation. As the story enters its final stages, he's lost his ability to conceal it. As befits such a dark, corrosive vision of humanity, Plainview doesn't get a happy ending.\n\nBack in our world, we can witness the rapid dismantling of what's already a pretty rickety excuse for a social safety net in America, along with the unrestrained proliferation of a kind of contempt that Plainview would recognize as his own. It's a lens that transforms just about everyone else into what the president loves to call \"haters and losers.\"\n\nAt the same time, Anderson invites us to admire Plainview's prowess and finesse as a salesman and a deal maker. Even before he admits it in a brutal final scene with his adopted son, it's clear how he uses the boy as a prop and a means of gaining others trust. \"I'm a family man,\" he claims. He briefly purports to be a religious one, too, though his fascination with his nemesis Eli seems to stem largely from self-recognition, having seen in his adversary another skilled charlatan and manipulator. If Plainview had gotten all of his tips down on paper, he could've written The Art of the Deal.\n\nAnderson's movie feels just as prescient about our moment thanks to its portrayal of the early oil business, which would soon become the cornerstone of the US economy. Anderson's depiction mixes the heroic with the ironic, deftly showing how the very dirty work of oil exploration fit into well-worn myths about the conquering of the American frontier. One difference here is that it's the poor white settlers who are getting suckered out of the land they occupy. The indigenous peoples there before them had already been \"pacified\" in the California Indian Wars of the 1850s and 1860s, though their rage lives on in the land claim disputes and pipeline standoffs seen at Standing Rock and British Columbia's Trans Mountain protest, among others.\n\nFor the early oil barons, once the land got good and grabbed, it was so easy to get that bubbling crude, it must've felt like God's way of saying He wanted us—though not all of us, of course—to be rich. Trump continues to exploit the notion that there's something fundamentally good, honest, and American about fossil-fuel exploitation, winning votes by promising to resurrect long-dead coal towns, boosting drilling and pipeline construction, and hiring Exxon's former boss as his administration's chief diplomat. (Let's not forget the climate change doubter and energy-sector booster now in charge of heading/dismantling the EPA.) That said, oil is a filthy, filthy thing in There Will Be Blood. Faces are perpetually smudged with the stuff, and corpses tend to be drenched in it. In other moments, Anderson emphasizes its reflective quality—more than once, a pool of oil literally becomes a black mirror.\n\nSince we typically expect to see an inky spate of nothing in those puddles, it's always disquieting to somehow see sun, sky and clouds instead. Likewise, when we look at Plainview now, we may see something we hadn't expected: a rapacious, destructive force of the present rather than a remnant of a comfortably distant past.\n\nFollow Jason Anderson on Twitter.",
  "latent_17691": "Editor’s note: Fox News has reached out to the Inquisitr with the following statements.\n\n“Sean Hannity has the unequivocal support of Fox News.” “Like the rest of the country, Sean Hannity is taking a vacation for Memorial Day weekend and will be back on Tuesday. Those who suggest otherwise are going to look foolish.”\n\nAs Sean Hannity announced that he would be taking an extended Memorial Day vacation, rumors swirled over what this could mean for the Fox News host, who had recently lost advertisers after making controversial statements about the murder of slain DNC staffer Seth Rich. According to the Atlantic, Fox News recently retracted a story published on their website on May 16 that echoed claims that Rich was murdered as a result of alleged connections to WikiLeaks made by Sean Hannity on his show that same day.\n\nOn the day of the May 23 retraction, Hannity stated on his show that he would no longer report on Seth Rich’s murder, but would keep “trying to find the truth.” Although Fox News claims that they support Hannity, the news host’s unusual behavior over the past week suggests that trouble may be brewing.\n\nHannity, an avid Twitter user, hasn’t tweeted since May 25. Although he claimed on Twitter that his Memorial Day weekend vacation was an annual event, parallels between Hannity’s choice to take a vacation amid trouble and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly’s decision to do the same shortly before being fired can be drawn.\n\nThe Atlantic reports that several companies have removed their advertisements from the Sean Hannity Show, including Crowne Plaza Hotels, Peloton bicycles, Leesa Sleep, Ring home security, Cars.com, and Casper. Hannity believes that these advertisers decided to pull commercials from his show as a result of a campaign by Media Matters For America (MMFA) to silence him, according to the Inquisitr. Hannity referred to MMFA’s efforts as “liberal fascism” and tweeted about the organization’s connections to billionaire George Soros.\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\nSean Hannity’s Claims About The Murder Of Seth Rich\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, Sean Hannity has repeatedly questioned the official version of events surrounding Seth Rich’s death, which is that the DNC staffer was killed as a result of a botched robbery. Along with questioning these claims, Hannity has also supported the controversial theory that Rich was killed because he allegedly leaked emails to WikiLeaks. Sean Hannity has asserted that if this theory is true, it means that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. On May 23, Hannity retweeted a tweet made by alleged Seth Rich associate Kim Dotcom, in which Dotcom stated that “There is no Russia collusion/hacking.”\n\nnull\n\nOn May 16, Fox News published an article on their website that seemed to agree with Hannity’s claims. According to the Los Angeles Times, the article asserted that an FBI forensics examination demonstrated that Seth Rich had leaked emails to WikiLeaks before his murder. Fox News cited private investigator Rod Wheeler as the source of this information. In their May 23 retraction of the story, Fox stated that Wheeler had backtracked his statements. WikiLeaks has neither confirmed nor denied the claims.\n\nFox’s Retraction And Hannity’s Announcement\n\nAfter Fox retracted the story, Hannity announced on his show that he would no longer cover the Seth Rich story because it was too upsetting to Rich’s family. Hannity stated that he had been communicating with Seth’s brother, Aaron Rich, and decided that it was best to cease reporting on the story, stating, “Out of respect for the family’s wishes for now, I am not discussing this matter at this time.” Hannity claims that he made this decision on his own and was not pressured by Fox. However, he acknowledged the pressure that Media Matters For America has placed on advertisers to pull their support for the Sean Hannity Show.\n\nOn Twitter, Hannity seemed less apologetic about his on-air statements and reassured his audience that he would continue investigating the facts of the case. Amid the controversy, Hannity also announced that he would be taking a long Memorial Day vacation and also assured his fans on Twitter that this was routine for him and even mocked those who view the timing of this vacation with skepticism.\n\nnull\n\nHannity And Fox News\n\nSean Hannity is one of the biggest names on Fox News, raking in millions of dollars each year in ad revenue, reports the Atlantic. According to Kantar Media, Hannity’s show brought in $65.7 million in 2016 and $56.1 million in 2015. As such, Fox News may not be so quick to get rid of him. However, with advertisers pulling their support, Hannity may not be able to generate his usual level of ad revenue for Fox News.\n\nNew Career At OAN?\n\nOne America News (OAN) is a news network owned by Herring Networks, Inc., an independent, family-owned media company that was established in 2004 and operates mainly in California and Washington, D.C. For some, OAN is a more conservative alternative to Fox News. One America News has been largely focused on the Seth Rich story and has even put up a $250,000 reward for anyone who gives information that helps solve the murder case.\n\nInterestingly, Sean Hannity has chosen to follow Robert Herring, the CEO of One America News, on Twitter. Could Hannity be eyeing a move to a network that espouses views that are more in line with his opinions? Herring has been very vocal on Twitter about the case of Seth Rich and the apparent hypocrisy of Democrats who would rather focus on investigating Russia. Herring has also advertised an OAN special report on Seth Rich entitled “The Mysterious Death Of Seth Rich.”\n\nnull\n\nHannity’s Fate\n\nThe world will likely be left in the dark regarding the fate of Sean Hannity and his future on Fox News until he comes back from his Memorial Day vacation. However, checking Hannity’s Twitter posts and new follows may shed some light on the Fox News host’s thinking.\n\n[Featured Image by Douglas C. Pizac/AP Images]",
  "latent_17848": "Image: Mete Atatüre\n\nOne of the many scientific and engineering challenges to realizing the prospects of quantum computing—which involves the use of quantum phenomena, like entanglement, to perform complex calculations—is creating a device that can electrically generate a single photon to be used for carrying data in a quantum network. One method for producing these single photons is the use of complex multiple laser arrangements that have been precisely set up with optical components to produce these single photons. Lately, layered materials that serve as quantum emitters have begun to show a way forward. But even these layered materials require some kind of light source to trigger the emission of a single photon.\n\nNow researchers at the University of Cambridge in England have constructed devices made from thin layers of graphene, boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) that generate a single photon entirely electrically. The combination of these three types of two-dimensional (2D) materials produces devices that are essentially all-electrical ultrathin quantum light-emitting diodes (LEDs).\n\nIn research described in the journal Nature Communications, the U.K.-based researchers demonstrated that the TMDs of tungsten diselenide and tungsten disulfide, which are both known for being optically active semiconductors, can serve as a platform for producing quantum-light generating devices.\n\nThe TMD layers provide a tightly confined area in two dimensions where electrons fill in holes. When an electron moves into one of these holes that reside at a lower energy, the difference in energy produces a photon. In the quantum LEDs produced by the U.K. researchers, a voltage pushes electrons through the device and fill holes, producing single photons when they do.\n\nThe researchers believe that this ultrathin platform run entirely electrically will bring on-chip single-photon emission for quantum communication closer to reality.\n\n“Ultimately, we need fully integrated devices that we can control by electrical impulses, instead of a laser that focuses on different segments of an integrated circuit,” said Professor Mete Atatüre of Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory, one of the paper’s senior authors, in a press release. “For quantum communication with single photons, and quantum networks between different nodes, we want to be able to just drive current and get light out. There are many emitters that are optically excitable, but only a handful are electrically driven.”\n\nThis research demonstrated that tungsten diselenide can operate electrically as a quantum emitter. But the researchers also showed that tungsten disulfide is an entirely new class of quantum emitter and offers all-electrical single-photon generation in the visible spectrum.\n\nAtatüre added: “We chose tungsten disulfide because we wanted to see if different materials offered different parts of the spectra for single photon emission. With this, we have shown that the quantum emission is not a unique feature of tungsten disulfide, which suggests that many other layered materials might be able to host quantum dot-like features as well.”",

They also assert that election officials inflated the number of parliamentary seats due to members of the ruling Cambodian People’s Party after the votes were tallied.\n\nOpCambodiaFreedom is on their side.\n\n“All politicians are rats. They’re animals. Our goal is to leak more government data and send a message to our dictators that we are not simply sitting and watching,” one of the hackers involved with OpCambodiaFreedom told GlobalPost.\n\nOpCambodiaFreedom, launched in June, has so far sought to reveal corrupt election practices. In their seminal hack in July, participants in the operation hacked into servers used by the Cambodian National Election Committee (NEC), just 10 days ahead of a nationwide vote. Claiming that the NEC planned to facilitate voter fraud, the hackers, known as Anons, temporarily disabled the website, defaced it and made off with large amounts of data.\n\nThe NEC, which has faced frequent accusations of fraud in past years, has promised to look into local complaints, and has admitted some irregularities in the polling process.\n\nBut participants in OpCambodiaFreedom are more concerned with systemic problems that plague Cambodian society, including severe poverty, censorship, corruption and government land grabs.\n\nMore from GlobalPost: Blood sugar: Oxfam accuses Coke and Pepsi of fueling land grabs\n\nFor years, military police and other authorities have been using violence and intimidation to carry out land grabbing operations, according to numerous reports.\n\nLand expropriation and further human rights abuses have attracted international attention in recent years.

Anons involved have abandoned the cavalier bravado typical of Anonymous operations, instead expressing their determination to take on the government on behalf of the Cambodian people.\n\nIn a country with limited internet penetration, like Cambodia, there are few domestic spectators to an online hack. But a combination of poor information security and government secrecy creates an environment that empowers skilled hackers and grants them access to large amounts of privileged information.\n\n“We would not say it is easy or difficult [to break into government systems].

  "latent_18132": "Junior Hoilett, Fraser Aird, Wandrille Lefevre and Lucas Cavallini. The Canadian men's national team roster released on Friday must have seemed like an early Christmas present for long suffering national team supporter. In just one day the Canadian team became significantly more talented than it has been in some time.\n\nThe news could be getting even better. A report from Marc Weber of the Vancouver Province says that Canada has reached out to Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder Gershon Koffie about playing for the national team, and it could happen.\n\nHe has been linked to the Canadian team in the past, but not substantially since 2013. That's when Floro named him alongside Felipe, Hassoun Camara and Whitecap's teammate Camilo: all who had applied for permanent residency, a step towards earning Canadian citizenship.\n\nThe 24-year-old Koffie was born in Ghana, and played for his nation of birth at the Under-20 level. Under FIFA rules this would appear to make Koffie ineligible to play for Canada, although some exceptions have been made in the past.\n\nKoffie is also not currently eligible for a Canadian citizenship either, as he hasn't been a permanent Canadian resident for long enough. However, the government has made exceptions to this rule for sport before.\n\nThe holding midfielder has been with the Vancouver Whitecaps since 2010, when he played two games for the club in NASL. He then made the transition with the team to Major League Soccer where he has played 130 games and scored 9 goals.\n\nHe has often been paired in the Vancouver Whitecaps midfield with current Canadian international Russell Teibert, something that makes him an enticing option from a chemistry standpoint.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Koffie would be available for the start of round 4, which begins on November 13 with Canada playing against Honduras in Vancouver.\n\nEven with all the recent success the Canadian program has had with convincing players on the fence to join the team, there could still be some red flags as to the timing of this information being released.\n\nDuring the last set of World Cup qualifiers, there was belief that Jonathan De Guzman, who has since been cap-tied, and played at a World Cup with the Netherlands, would play for Canada.\n\nKoffie's birth country of Ghana is playing Canada in a friendly on October 13.

  "latent_18210": "politics How Not to Announce a Subway\n\nThe many missteps that got us to the current two-stop subway mess.\n\nOntario Transportation Minister Glen Murray’s announcement that Scarborough will be getting a two-stop subway continues a long history of ham-fisted provincial interference in Toronto’s transit plans.\n\nIt did not need to be this way.\n\nIn July, an unexpected coalition of Toronto councillors approved a longer subway along a different route for Scarborough; it would have extended the Bloor-Danforth subway extension east and north from Kennedy Station to Sheppard and McCowan. That decision included many conditions to limit the city’s financial exposure and to prevent budgetary raids on other long-proposed rapid transit projects. Councillors hoped for a provincial contribution of $1.8 billion that Queen’s Park had rejected even before the vote, but left the door open to crafting a funding scheme for the subway. Meanwhile, $1.4 billion appeared to be available as Ontario’s share of whatever scheme council eventually chose.\n\nThe summer brought a provincial by-election with would-be MPPs tripping over each other to endorse a subway for Scarborough. The Liberal candidate, Mitzie Hunter, ran as a “subway champion” despite her previous support for light rapid transit (LRT) in the context of the Metrolinx “Big Move” network. The Liberals won, and that win committed Queen’s Park to building a subway.\n\nWith his announcement of a different, shorter subway, Murray pre-empted any discussion Toronto council might have on the LRT vs subway issue at its October meeting. (They had set a September 30 deadline for the other levels of government to announce whether they’d be contributing funding to the subway.) In a feisty mood, the minister attacked both Toronto and Ottawa for failing to bring any transit money to the table, and declared that Ontario would act unilaterally to build a subway line along the existing Scarborough RT corridor from Kennedy to the Scarborough Town Centre. That $1.4 billion would no longer available as part of whatever funding council might propose for their own subway plan.\n\nWe have made the decision that we are building along the alignment to the Scarborough Town Centre, and this is not a decision we will revisit.\n\n—Glen Murray, via his spokesperson\n\nMurray’s claim that Toronto has no money on the table does not square with council’s July commitment to a property tax increase to help pay for a Scarborough subway—although the amount of that increase was based on the provincial and federal government contributing more to the project than they are willing. As for Ottawa, the complaint might be more valid if they make no commitment in time for the October council debate, but in early September, Murray can only pout that the Tories won’t answer his phone calls.\n\nNews of this decision only recently reached Mayor Ford, TTC Chair Karen Stintz, and others at the municipal level, and nobody from the City attended Murray’s announcement. Equally telling was the absence of anyone from Metrolinx, the Ontario agency nominally responsible for planning the regional transit network.\n\n(Regional planning did get a nod with a scheme to bring Durham Transit’s “Pulse” system into Scarborough via a Bus Rapid Transit link serving the U of T’s Scarborough campus and Centennial College.)\n\nLurking behind the scenes was the ghost of the original plan for Scarborough transit, an LRT route that would have been 3.5 kilometres longer than the province’s subway, and would have included seven or eight stations instead of the two we’re now getting. That plan—fully funded and with initial design work already complete—had until recently been the plan, the one that had been signed off on by both the City and the province. That route would have followed the path of the current RT, and extended east and north to Centennial College and up to Sheppard, linking up with the already-approved Sheppard LRT.\n\nImplicitly responding to that light rail plan, and the proponents who still think it’s the best choice for Scarborough residents, Murray said “The majority of people who attend UTSC and Centennial come from the east, and this is why we are expanding the Durham Pulse service to come all the way to STC. This is only one part of a comprehensive plan dedicated to meeting the needs of Scarborough residents and students.” Students who can use DRT’s Pulse to reach their schools may rejoice, but there is no word on how residents in other parts of Scarborough with different travel demands will be served. Today, that “comprehensive plan” is little more than words in a press release.\n\nThe proposed subway map includes only two stations—Lawrence East and Scarborough Town Centre—although Murray has been quick to say that other locations would be considered. (After lambasting the municipal and federal governments for failing to contribute money to this project, Murray said that if they did change their minds and come to the table with cash, that funding could be used to extend the subway further.) Why were optional stations not included in his announcement?\n\nGlen Murray’s plan joins a parade of half-baked schemes for Scarborough transit, and complicates the debate with all-or-nothing posturing by the province. Instead of a transit network, Toronto sees yet another project-based announcement. Murray backed away from this in a CBC Metro Morning interview, when he talked about the continued importance of the Sheppard LRT and the Downtown Relief Line, but the out-of-context subway plan and a combative attitude to other governments were the big initial messages.\n\nThe real debate over transit funding and construction will come with municipal and provincial elections in 2014. Which view will prevail for Toronto and southern Ontario transit remains to be seen, but Toronto needs more than a quick play for attention by the transportation minister.\n\nImagine what an integrated plan for Murray’s subway extension might have looked like if it included:\n\nAccelerated construction of the Sheppard LRT (a line that in the original Transit City plan would have opened in late 2012);\n\nLinking Malvern, Scarborough Town Centre, and UofT SCarborough with the planned LRT;\n\nImproving GO service in Scarborough, and addressing the high GO fares that discourage riders inside Toronto from using that network;\n\nBringing riders into Scarborough not just west from Durham, but south from Markham;\n\nTalking about the wider expansion of Toronto’s LRT network.\n\nThat’s a plan that could inspire and show leadership, not cheap political theatre and the divisive strategies too commonly seen in Mayor Ford’s approach to transit issues. Glen Murray may have his dime ready to contribute to a Scarborough subway, but he forgets how many dollars Queen’s Park has promised but never spent as project completion dates recede into the future.",

  "latent_18250": "Credit: Gianluca Fabrizio/Getty Images\n\nWanted: Executive experienced in data, digital, social, search, media, creative, PR, events, shopper marketing, programmatic, mobile, print and outdoor. The ability to simultaneously and efficiently handle up to dozens of stakeholders (often with competing interests) a must. Successful candidate is skilled at managing up, managing down and balancing a P&L. Old-school thinkers need not apply.\n\nThis would be, if he or she existed, the job description for the perfect account management executive today, a species whose archetype has died and been reborn, albeit with a new set of required skills.\n\nAccount managers, as they were long known, were gradually culled over the last 10 to 15 years, according to observers, with cuts reaching their height during the recession. Any hiring during the recession, and even after, was largely in relation to tech-savvier disciplines as the demand for digital creative and media grew.\n\nBut the typical suit of decades past, often thought of as a yes-man or glad-hander, is no longer relevant. In his place has grown a new account lead responsible for much more than what was expected of account management even five years ago, never mind decades ago. Digital creatives aren't the hottest hires. Thanks to a marketing landscape that continues to shift as agencies of all stripes compete for any and all pieces of business, the account manager has evolved into one of the most powerful players in adland.\n\nThe fundamental work that famed account managers like Jay Chiat or John McGarry were renowned for -- developing relationships, serving clients and understanding their needs -- has not changed. But the means of doing it and what a client expects from its agency have. Today's account managers need to understand all facets of marketing, and understand them well. No matter what kind of agency employs them, account leaders need to be steeped in the digital landscape and everything that goes along with it: social platforms and their data, ad formats and attribution models (one could spend a month alone learning Facebook's or Google's intricacies and still not know everything), content strategy and distribution, and communications planning.\n\n\"It's a different kind of account management now,\" said Guy Hayward, global CEO at MDC Partners' KBS. \"In the old days, it was more about relationships and making sure the creative work was good, and all you had to worry about was TV, print, radio and outdoor.\"\n\nAs the business has morphed, so has the account manager's job to help the client make sense of it all. KBS recently reorganized its account management department, now calling it \"business leadership,\" as the shop seeks to provide clients with answers across multiple disciplines that may even stretch beyond an advertising solution.\n\n\"The thing that has changed is, historically, clients approached an agency with a specific problem to be solved,\" said Mr. Hayward. \"But it's really hard for a client now. There are so many opportunities, and things are changing so fast all the time, that it's very hard to decide what you should be doing. Our best business leaders are true problem solvers who have a creative solution.\"\n\nJust in the last decade, the number of agencies working for any given big marketer has arguably grown, thanks in part to clients moving away from a single- (or two- or three-) agency model. More agencies mean more coordination among them, and account management is the wrangler.\n\nOn top of all that, creative shops are competing for work with more agencies than ever before. Some digital shops are developing stronger account management departments as they look to compete for bigger pieces of business. Mollie Rosen, exec VP-agency relations and membership at the 4A's, says that specialized shops, particularly digital ones, previously had project manager roles rather than account management, but that's no longer the case. \"The discipline is taking root where it hadn't before,\" she said. \"More and more, great ideas can come from anywhere; there's more fluidity in the work; and more agencies are looking to play the role of the brand leader.\"\n\nIn fact, the role has become so important, she said, that next month the 4A's will launch a committee dedicated to account management. Ms. Rosen said client-agency relationships are more project-based now; there's unprecedented pressure from Wall Street, and a need for better trust between client and agency; and shops are on the hook more than ever to make margin. \"All those pressures lead to a real need to make sure we've got strong leaders to lead not just the clients' business but also the agencies' business,\" said Ms. Rosen.\n\n'Oligarchs': The Rise of the Holding Company Account Lead\n\nAgency parent companies over the last decade have increasingly brought account management to the holding company level in an effort to organize multiple agencies working for the same clients. WPP is well known for its \"team model,\" and Omnicom, for example, has had execs like Troy Ruhanen oversee collaboration among Omnicom agencies for the company's large multinational clients. (Mr. Ruhanen is now chief of TBWA, and Peter Sherman now oversees innovation and collaboration at Omnicom.) J. Walter Thompson CEO Tamara Ingram previously led WPP Group's Procter & Gamble team and later rose to oversee all of WPP's global accounts.\n\nWhen Publicis Groupe reorganized in December, the company said it was adding a number of chief client officers, essentially account management execs, reporting to Chief Revenue Officer Laura Desmond as it works to offer more integrated services. \"We're completely changing the way we work with clients and leading that change is the account person,\" said Arthur Sadoun, CEO of Publicis Communications, who described account management's role as moving from selling the advertising idea to selling the consumer experience across a number of channels.\n\nOften, agency CEOs grew up in account management. Now, they're sometime finding themselves looking up at holding company account executives. Mr. Sadoun said the key account manager of the future is not necessarily the agency CEO but an account leader \"who can transform big relationships\" into an \"integrated system\" that goes beyond one specific agency.\n\nTranslation: They decide where the money goes.\n\nThis can naturally cause tension between them and agency CEOs, one of which referred to holding company account managers as \"oligarchs.\"\n\n\"In some [holding company] cultures, being the global account lead is becoming more important than the agency CEO,\" this person said, because the lead controls big budgets that can often be a significant amount of an agency's fee. \"Who owns the client relationship is so key to who controls authority and power.\"\n\nBut account leaders are also fewer in number. Back in the old days, account management departments were often bloated, with multiple layers of employees to justify big fees. Not anymore. In the past 15 to 20 years, the departments have dwindled, thanks in part to the commission system dying, but also due to clients demanding access to top agency executives. The account mangers are now those liaisons.\n\nIndustry insiders point to this decade's \"procurement revolution\" as a tipping point for account management. As client procurement departments trimmed fees, agencies had to get lean, particularly holding company shops required to maintain a certain margin.\n\nTraining and Talent Shortage\n\nBut while the stock of account managers is rising, a confluence of factors is working against growing their ranks. During the recession, client budget cuts prompted agency layoffs, often in the account management department. As the theory went at the time, shops could still operate with a lean account management staff, at least leaner than the creative department.\n\nSqueezed fees also took a toll on in-house training programs for the posts. Even an MBA from a top-tier business school wasn't necessarily prepared for a broadening account management role. Agencies that felt pressure to cut costs often put their training programs on the chopping block, agency executives said.\n\nMs. Rosen said that there is concern among agencies that employees in account management today are not getting properly trained, especially when it comes to keeping up with the rapidly changing industry.\n\n\"Back in the day when we were working off commissions and there was more fat, you could always turn that into muscle,\" said TBWA New York CEO Rob Schwartz. \"Agencies would invest in more training programs. But if they want to train now, it's often coming out of profits.\"\n\nAnd, of course, shops have to compete with more businesses now for the best talent. Tech companies like Facebook and consultants like Deloitte are increasingly seeking account managers, and the pay and perks are often better. \"There are a lot of great companies to work for. What are agencies promising?\" said Mr. Schwartz. \"Long nights, low pay and chronic disrespect. That's not a recipe for A-plus talent.\"\n\nAgencies Don't Prioritize Account Management\n\nBut while the client's thinking has evolved when it comes to account managers, agencies are largely unenlightened when it comes to new business pitches, where creatives and strategists shine but account managers often get only a couple slides at the end of a deck.\n\n\"Clients say that account management is the most important role at an agency for them, but they say that they're often not sure they've gotten a good sense of that person and their capabilities\" during pitches, said Meghan McDonnell, senior VP at consultant Pile & Co. \"You need to give a meaningful role to the account person,\" she cautioned agencies.\n\nSome agency people realize their value, though. \"Being an account person is the hardest thing in advertising,\" said Rob Reilly, global creative chairman at McCann. Account management helps synthesize what clients need, he said. \"Knowing how to manage people and understand people is what great account people do.\"",

  "latent_18258": "by the Center for Biological Diversity\n\nTUCSON, Ariz.— The Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit today against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the agency’s failure to protect Coleman’s coralroot under the Endangered Species Act. Coleman’s coralroot is an extremely rare purple orchid found on national forest land in the footprint of the proposed Rosemont copper mine outside Tucson. If protected, it would become one of at least 10 endangered species that would be harmed by the proposed mine. The mine would result in the direct loss of at least 6,500 acres of wildlife habitat and would cause indirect harm to more than 145,000 acres of habitat.\n\n“You can’t blast a mile-wide open pit, produce 1,200 million tons of toxic waste and withdraw 33 billion gallons of water without leaving a permanent scar on this fragile landscape and the plants and animals that depend on it,” said Tierra Curry, a biologist with the Center. “Only Endangered Species Act protection can ensure this gorgeous, incredibly rare orchid isn’t wiped off the face of the Earth.”\n\nAfter the Center petitioned for the orchid’s protection in 2010, the Service determined it “may warrant” protection as an endangered species, but the agency has failed to make a decision within one year as required by law. If that “12-month finding” is positive, some protections will immediately go into effect for the rare flower.\n\nThe orchid, fascinating in that it has neither leaves nor roots, grows only in one spot in the Dragoon Mountains southeast of Tucson, as well as two locations in the Santa Rita Mountains, where the Rosemont copper mine is proposed. It was described as a distinct species in 2010 based on differences from another rare orchid being considered for federal protection, Chisos coralroot.\n\nColeman’s coralroot is remarkable in that it doesn’t make its own food through photosynthesis. Instead it gets nourishment from a symbiotic relationship with host fungi that colonize the roots of trees and shrubs, making it nearly impossible to cultivate. Because the orchid is completely dependent on its host relationship, it’s threatened by any action that disturbs the soil or threatens the fungi. The plant spends most of its life underground, putting up flowering shoots only when environmental conditions are right; in any given year, there are only a few hundred flowers aboveground.\n\n“The diversity of the Rosemont area is significant on a global scale. The Santa Rita Mountains are called the Sky Islands for a reason. Because they rise so dramatically from the surrounding plateau, they’re home to startlingly diverse pockets of extremely rare species,” said Curry. “The mine would be a disaster not just for the orchid, but for hundreds of wildlife species, not to mention the quality of life for people around Tucson.”\n\nHundreds of rare and endemic species occur on proposed mine lands. The Center has sought Endangered Species Act protection for four other species threatened by the proposed mine: the Rosemont talus snail, Sonoran talus snail, Bartram stonecrop and beardless chinchweed. The mine would destroy habitat for endangered species including the Chiricahua leopard frog, Gila chub, Gila topminnow, Huachuca water umbel, jaguar, lesser long-nosed bat, ocelot, Pima pineapple cactus and southwestern willow flycatcher, and for candidate species including the desert tortoise, northern Mexican garter snake and western yellow-billed cuckoo.\n\n“This shortsighted mining scheme would permanently pollute our water, degrade our national forest, kill endangered species, and cause unacceptable air and noise pollution,” said Curry. “And it won’t do our economy any favors either. It’ll cause losses in tourism and recreation dollars that will not be made up by the relatively small number of mine jobs.”\n\nThe mine still needs several permits to move forward, including an air-quality permit from Pima County that has already been denied once and a Clean Water Act permit from the Army Corps of Engineers that is pending. The Coronado National Forest released a draft “environmental impact statement” for the mine in September, which has been severely criticized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as wholly inadequate and based on faulty science. In an extremely rare move, the EPA gave the impact statement the lowest possible rating and threatened to intervene if permitting for the mine proceeds.\n\nSome of the most contentious issues surrounding the mine include impacts on drinking-water supplies. Concerns include impacts on existing wells in the area; plans to fill more than 150 stream drainages on the mine site; and a plan, yet untested in dry climates, to dry-stack waste tailings, a technique that critics fear will result in toxic pollutants leaching into groundwater during heavy rain events.\n\nAdvertisements",

  "latent_18465": "The Royals have signed veteran righties Chris Withrow, Al Alburquerque and Brandon League to minor league deals with Spring Training invites, Jeffrey Flanagan of MLB.com writes (Twitter links). Flanagan also notes the minor league signings of pitchers Bobby Parnell and Jonathan Sanchez, which had been previously reported; those two will combine with Withrow, Albuquerque and League to form a long list of formerly effective veterans who could compete for spots on the Royals’ pitching staff.\n\nThe 27-year-old Withrow was formerly a first-round pick of the Dodgers. After heading to Atlanta in a six-player deal involving Juan Uribe and Alberto Callaspo, Withrow spent 2016 with the Braves, where he posted a 3.58 ERA and an average fastball velocity approaching the mid-90s, but with an underwhelming 6.7 K/9 and 4.1 BB/9 in 37 2/3 innings. He ended last season with over three years of service time after spending 2015 on the shelf recovering from Tommy John surgery, and the Braves non-tendered him last month.\n\nAlburquerque spent the 2016 season in the Angels and Mariners organizations, appearing briefly in the big leagues with the Angels and posting a 3.74 ERA, 9.4 K/9 and 4.5 BB/9 in 33 2/3 innings in the minors. The formerly hard-throwing Tigers reliever has seen his velocity dip to the low 90s in recent seasons. It’s possible some of that velocity drop might have some connection to his contraction of the Chikungunya virus in 2015, however, and the 30-year-old has proven to be an effective, if control-challenged, big-league reliever in the past.\n\nLeague has not pitched since 2015, or in the big leagues since 2014, after struggling with shoulder trouble.

  "latent_18676": "Executive summary\n\nEducation policymakers and analysts express great concern about the performance of U.S. students on international tests. Education reformers frequently invoke the relatively poor performance of U.S. students to justify school policy changes.\n\nIn December 2012, the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) released national average results from the 2011 administration of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan promptly issued a press release calling the results “unacceptable,” saying that they “underscore the urgency of accelerating achievement in secondary school and the need to close large and persistent achievement gaps,” and calling particular attention to the fact that the 8th-grade scores in mathematics for U.S. students failed to improve since the previous administration of the TIMSS.\n\nMORE: This is a corrected version of a report initially posted on January 15, 2013. The corrections do not affect the report’s conclusions. Details can be found in\n\nAUDIO: Authors speak with the press about their report (MP3) This is a corrected version of a report initially posted on January 15, 2013. The corrections do not affect the report’s conclusions. Details can be found in “Response from Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein to OECD/PISA comments (PDF)\n\nTwo years earlier, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released results from another international test, the 2009 administration of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). Secretary Duncan’s statement was similar. The results, he said, “show that American students are poorly prepared to compete in today’s knowledge economy. … Americans need to wake up to this educational reality—instead of napping at the wheel while emerging competitors prepare their students for economic leadership.” In particular, Duncan stressed results for disadvantaged U.S. students: “As disturbing as these national trends are for America, enormous achievement gaps among black and Hispanic students portend even more trouble for the U.S. in the years ahead.”\n\nHowever, conclusions like these, which are often drawn from international test comparisons, are oversimplified, frequently exaggerated, and misleading. They ignore the complexity of test results and may lead policymakers to pursue inappropriate and even harmful reforms.\n\nBoth TIMSS and PISA eventually released not only the average national scores on their tests but also a rich international database from which analysts can disaggregate test scores by students’ social and economic characteristics, their school composition, and other informative criteria. Such analysis can lead to very different and more nuanced conclusions than those suggested from average national scores alone. For some reason, however, although TIMSS released its average national results in December, it scheduled release of the international database for five weeks later. This puzzling strategy ensured that policymakers and commentators would draw quick and perhaps misleading interpretations from the results. This is especially the case because analysis of the international database takes time, and headlines from the initial release are likely to be sealed in conventional wisdom by the time scholars have had the opportunity to complete a careful study.\n\nWhile we await the release of the TIMSS international database, this report describes a detailed analysis we have conducted of the 2009 PISA database. It offers a different picture of the 2009 PISA results than the one suggested by Secretary Duncan’s reaction to the average national scores of the United States and other nations.\n\nBecause of the complexity and size of the PISA international database, this report’s analysis is restricted to the comparative test performance of adolescents in the United States, in three top-scoring countries, and in three other post-industrial countries similar to the United States. These countries are illustrative of those with which the United States is usually compared. We compare the performance of adolescents in these seven countries who have similar social class characteristics. We compare performance in the most recent test for which data are available, as well as trends in performance over the last nearly two decades.\n\nIn general, we find that test data are too complex and oversimplified to permit meaningful policy conclusions regarding U.S. educational performance without deeper study of test results and methodology. However, a clear set of findings stands out and is supported by all data we have available:\n\nBecause social class inequality is greater in the United States than in any of the countries with which we can reasonably be compared, the relative performance of U.S. adolescents is better than it appears when countries’ national average performance is conventionally compared.\n\nBecause in every country, students at the bottom of the social class distribution perform worse than students higher in that distribution, U.S. average performance appears to be relatively low partly because we have so many more test takers from the bottom of the social class distribution.\n\nA sampling error in the U.S. administration of the most recent international (PISA) test resulted in students from the most disadvantaged schools being over-represented in the overall U.S. test-taker sample. This error further depressed the reported average U.S. test score.\n\nIf U.S. adolescents had a social class distribution that was similar to the distribution in countries to which the United States is frequently compared, average reading scores in the United States would be higher than average reading scores in the similar post-industrial countries we examined (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom), and average math scores in the United States would be about the same as average math scores in similar post-industrial countries.\n\nA re-estimated U.S. average PISA score that adjusted for a student population in the United States that is more disadvantaged than populations in otherwise similar post-industrial countries, and for the over-sampling of students from the most-disadvantaged schools in a recent U.S. international assessment sample, finds that the U.S. average score in both reading and mathematics would be higher than official reports indicate (in the case of mathematics, substantially higher).\n\nThis re-estimate would also improve the U.S. place in the international ranking of all OECD countries, bringing the U.S. average score to sixth in reading and 13th in math. Conventional ranking reports based on PISA, which make no adjustments for social class composition or for sampling errors, and which rank countries irrespective of whether score differences are large enough to be meaningful, report that the U.S. average score is 14th in reading and 25th in math.\n\nDisadvantaged and lower-middle-class U.S. students perform better (and in most cases, substantially better) than comparable students in similar post-industrial countries in reading. In math, disadvantaged and lower-middle-class U.S. students perform about the same as comparable students in similar post-industrial countries.\n\nAt all points in the social class distribution, U.S. students perform worse, and in many cases substantially worse, than students in a group of top-scoring countries (Canada, Finland, and Korea). Although controlling for social class distribution would narrow the difference in average scores between these countries and the United States, it would not eliminate it.\n\nU.S. students from disadvantaged social class backgrounds perform better relative to their social class peers in the three similar post-industrial countries than advantaged U.S. students perform relative to their social class peers. But U.S. students from advantaged social class backgrounds perform better relative to their social class peers in the top-scoring countries of Finland and Canada than disadvantaged U.S. students perform relative to their social class peers.\n\nOn average, and for almost every social class group, U.S. students do relatively better in reading than in math, compared to students in both the top-scoring and the similar post-industrial countries.\n\nBecause not only educational effectiveness but also countries’ social class composition changes over time, comparisons of test score trends over time by social class group provide more useful information to policymakers than comparisons of total average test scores at one point in time or even of changes in total average test scores over time.\n\nThe performance of the lowest social class U.S. students has been improving over time, while the performance of such students in both top-scoring and similar post-industrial countries has been falling.\n\nOver time, in some middle and advantaged social class groups where U.S. performance has not improved, comparable social class groups in some top-scoring and similar post-industrial countries have had declines in performance.\n\nPerformance levels and trends in Germany are an exception to the trends just described. Average math scores in Germany would still be higher than average U.S. math scores, even after standardizing for a similar social class distribution. Although the performance of disadvantaged students in the two countries is about the same, lower-middle-class students in Germany perform substantially better than comparable social class U.S. students. Over time, scores of German adolescents from all social class groups have been improving, and at a faster rate than U.S. improvement, even for social class groups and subjects where U.S. performance has also been improving. But the causes of German improvement (concentrated among immigrants and perhaps also attributable to East and West German integration) may be idiosyncratic, and without lessons for other countries or predictive of the future. Whether German rates of improvement can be sustained to the point where that country’s scores by social class group uniformly exceed those of the United States remains to be seen. As of 2009, this was not the case.\n\nGreat policy attention in recent years has been focused on the high average performance of adolescents in Finland. This attention may be justified, because both math and reading scores in Finland are higher for every social class group than in the United States. However, Finland’s scores have been falling for the most disadvantaged students while U.S. scores have been improving for similar social class students. This should lead to greater caution in applying presumed lessons from Finland. At first glance, it may seem that the decline in scores of disadvantaged students in Finland results in part from a recent influx of lower-class immigrants. However, average scores for all social class groups have been falling in Finland, and the gap in scores between Finland and the United States has narrowed in each social class group. Further, during the same period in which scores for the lowest social class group have declined, the share of all Finnish students in this group has also declined, which should have made the national challenge of educating the lowest social class students more manageable, so immigration is unlikely to provide much of the explanation for declining performance.\n\nAlthough this report’s primary focus is on reading and mathematics performance on PISA, it also examines mathematics test score performance in earlier administrations of the TIMSS. Where relevant, we also discuss what can already be learned from the limited information now available from the 2011 TIMSS. To help with the interpretation of these PISA and TIMSS data, we also explore reading and mathematics performance on two forms of the U.S. domestic National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).\n\nRelevant complexities are too often ignored when policymakers draw conclusions from international comparisons. Different international tests yield different rankings among countries and over time. PISA, TIMSS, and NAEP all purport to reflect the achievement of adolescents in mathematics (and PISA and NAEP in reading), yet results on different tests can vary greatly—in the most extreme cases, countries’ scores can go up on one test and down on another that purport to assess the same students in the same subject matter—and scholars have not investigated what causes such discrepancies. These differences can be caused by the content of the tests themselves (for example, differences in the specific skills that test makers consider to represent adolescent “mathematics”) or by flaws in sampling and test administration. Because these differences are revealed in the most cursory examination of test results, policymakers should exercise greater caution in drawing policy conclusions from international score comparisons.\n\nTo arrive at our conclusions, we made a number of explicit and transparent methodological decisions that reflect our best judgment. Three are of importance: our definition of social class groups, our selection of comparison countries, and our determination of when differences in test scores are meaningful.\n\nThere is no clear way to divide test takers from different countries into social class groups that reflect comparable social background characteristics relevant to academic performance. For this report, we chose differences in the number of books in adolescents’ homes to distinguish them by social class group; we consider that children in different countries have similar social class backgrounds if their homes have similar numbers of books. We think that this indicator of household literacy is plausibly relevant to student academic performance, and it has been used frequently for this purpose by social scientists. We show in a technical appendix that supplementing it with other plausible measures (mother’s educational level, and an index of “economic, social, and cultural status” created by PISA’s statisticians) does not provide better estimates. Also influencing our decision is that the number of books in the home is a social class measure common to both PISA and TIMSS, so its use permits us to explore longer trend lines and more international comparisons. As noted, however, data on these background characteristics were not released along with the national average scores on the 2011 TIMSS, and so our information on the performance of students from different social class groups on TIMSS must end with the previous, 2007, test administration.\n\nIn this report, we focus particularly on comparisons of U.S. performance in math and reading in PISA with performance in three “top-scoring countries” (Canada, Finland, and Korea) whose average scores are generally higher than U.S. scores, and with performance in three “similar post-industrial countries” (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) whose scores are generally similar to those of the United States. We employed no sophisticated statistical methodology to identify these six comparison countries. Assembling and disaggregating data for this report was time consuming, and we were not able to consider additional countries. We think our choices include countries to which the United States is commonly compared, and we are reasonably confident that adding other countries would not appreciably change our conclusions. If other scholars wish to develop data for other countries, we would gladly offer them methodological advice.\n\nTechnical reports on test scores typically distinguish differences that are “significant” from those that are not. But this distinction is not always useful for policy purposes and is frequently misunderstood by policymakers. To a technical expert, a score difference can be miniscule but still “significant” if it can be reproduced 95 percent of the time when a comparison is repeated. But miniscule score differences should be of little interest to policymakers. In general, social scientists consider an intervention to be worthwhile if it improves a median subject’s performance enough to be superior to the performance of about 57 percent or more of all subjects prior to the intervention. Such an intervention should be considered “significant” for policy purposes, but, to avoid confusion, we avoid the term “significant” altogether. Instead, for PISA, we consider countries’ (or social class groups’) average scores to be “about the same” if they are less than 8 test scale points different (even if this small difference would be repeated in 95 of 100 test administrations), to be “better” or “worse” if they are at least 8 but less than 18 scale points different, and “substantially better” or “substantially worse” if they differ by 18 scale points or more. Eighteen scale points in most cases is approximately equivalent to the difference social scientists generally consider to be the minimum result of a worthwhile intervention (an effect size of about 0.2 standard deviations). The TIMSS scale is slightly different from the PISA scale; for TIMSS, the cut points used in this report are 7 and 17 rather than 8 and 18.\n\nWith regard to these and other methodological decisions we have made, scholars and policymakers may choose different approaches. We are only certain of this: To make judgments only on the basis of statistically significant differences in national average scores, on only one test, at only one point in time, without regard to social class context or curricular or population sampling methodologies, is the worst possible choice. But, unfortunately, this is how most policymakers and analysts approach the field.\n\nThe most recent test for which an international database is presently available is PISA, administered in 2009. As noted, the database for TIMSS 2011 is scheduled for release later this month (January 2013). In December 2013, PISA will announce results and make data available from its 2012 test administration. Scholars will then be able to dig into TIMSS 2011 and PISA 2012 databases and place the publicly promoted average national results in proper context. The analyses that follow in this report should caution policymakers to await understanding of this context before drawing conclusions about lessons from TIMSS or PISA assessments. We plan to conduct our own analyses of these data when they become available, and publish supplements to this report as soon as it is practical to do so, given the care that should be taken with these complex databases.\n\nPart I. Introduction\n\nA 2009 international test of reading and math showed that American 15-year-olds perform more poorly, on average, than 15-year-olds in many other countries. This finding, from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), is consistent with previous PISA results, as well as with results from another international assessment of 8th-graders, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Survey (TIMSS).\n\nFrom such tests, many journalists and policymakers have concluded that American student achievement lags woefully behind that in many comparable industrialized nations, that this shortcoming threatens the nation’s economic future, and that these test results therefore suggest an urgent need for radical school reform.\n\nUpon release of the 2011 TIMSS results, for example, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan called them “unacceptable,” saying that they “underscore the urgency of accelerating achievement in secondary school and the need to close large and persistent achievement gaps” (Duncan 2012). Two years before, upon release of 2009 PISA scores, Duncan said that “…the 2009 PISA results show that American students are poorly prepared to compete in today’s knowledge economy. … Americans need to wake up to this educational reality—instead of napping at the wheel while emerging competitors prepare their students for economic leadership.” In particular, Duncan stressed the PISA results for disadvantaged U.S. students: “As disturbing as these national trends are for America, enormous achievement gaps among black and Hispanic students portend even more trouble for the U.S. in the years ahead. Last year, McKinsey & Company released an analysis which concluded that America’s failure to close achievement gaps had imposed—and here I quote—‘the economic equivalent of a permanent national recession.’” The PISA results, Duncan concluded, justify the reform policies he has been pursuing: “I was struck by the convergence between the practices of high-performing countries and many of the reforms that state and local leaders have pursued in the last two years” (Duncan 2010).\n\nThis conclusion, however, is oversimplified, exaggerated, and misleading. It ignores the complexity of the content of test results and may well be leading policymakers to pursue inappropriate and even harmful reforms that change aspects of the U.S. education system that may be working well and neglect aspects that may be working poorly.\n\nFor example, as Secretary Duncan said, U.S. educational reform policy is motivated by a belief that the U.S. educational system is particularly failing disadvantaged children. Yet an analysis of international test score levels and trends shows that in important ways disadvantaged U.S. children perform better, relative to children in comparable nations, than do middle-class and advantaged children. More careful analysis of these levels and trends may lead policymakers to reconsider their assumption that almost all improvement efforts should be directed to the education of disadvantaged children and few such efforts to the education of middle-class and advantaged children.\n\nEducation analysts in the United States pay close attention to the level and trends of test scores disaggregated by socioeconomic groupings. Indeed, a central element of U.S. domestic education policy is the requirement that average scores be reported separately for racial and ethnic groups and for children who are from families whose incomes are low enough to qualify for the subsidized lunch program. We understand that a school with high proportions of disadvantaged children may be able to produce great “value-added” for its pupils, although its average test score levels may be low. It would be foolish to fail to apply this same understanding to comparisons of international test scores.\n\nExtensive educational research in the United States has demonstrated that students’ family and community characteristics powerfully influence their school performance. Children whose parents read to them at home, whose health is good and can attend school regularly, who do not live in fear of crime and violence, who enjoy stable housing and continuous school attendance, whose parents’ regular employment creates security, who are exposed to museums, libraries, music and art lessons, who travel outside their immediate neighborhoods, and who are surrounded by adults who model high educational achievement and attainment will, on average, achieve at higher levels than children without these educationally relevant advantages. We know much less about the extent to which similar factors affect achievement in other countries, but we should assume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that they do.\n\nIt is also the case that countries’ educational effectiveness and their social class composition change over time. Consequently, comparisons of test score trends over time by social class group provide more useful information to policymakers than comparisons of total average test scores at one point in time or even of changes in total average test scores over time.\n\nUnfortunately, our conversation about international test score comparisons has ignored such questions. It would be foolish, for example, to let international comparisons motivate radical changes in educational policies in a country whose social class subgroup average scores were below those of other nations, if that country’s subgroups had been improving their performance at a more rapid rate than similar subgroups in other nations, even if the country’s overall average still had not caught up. Just as a domestic U.S. school’s average performance is influenced by its social class composition, so too might a country’s average performance be influenced by its social class composition.\n\nThe policy responses of educational reformers should be sufficiently nuanced to respond to such considerations, because policy initiatives might improve in response to more sophisticated inquiries.\n\nFor example, consider Country C. Its affluent students achieve better than affluent students in comparable countries, but not as much better as in the past; the performance of affluent students in Country C, while still relatively high, has been declining relative to the performance of affluent students in comparable countries. Country C’s socioeconomically disadvantaged students achieve less than disadvantaged children in comparable countries, but not as much less as in the past. The performance of disadvantaged students in Country C, while still relatively low, has been improving relative to the performance of disadvantaged students in comparable nations. In such circumstances, unsophisticated reformers in Country C might well decide to revamp how disadvantaged students are being taught, even though teaching methods have been successfully raising such students’ achievement relative to the achievement of similarly disadvantaged students in other countries and relative to the achievement of wealthier students in Country C itself. Such unsophisticated reformers might also ignore the condition of education of affluent students, believing that their relatively high performance suggests that no reform is needed, while overlooking the decline of such performance over time. Sophisticated education policymakers, in contrast, who have studied the data trends, might direct their reform efforts to the high-scoring rather than the low-scoring students.\n\nThus, in evaluating a country’s educational performance, we should want to know how children from different social class groups perform, in comparison to other social class groups within their own country and in comparison to children from similar social class groups in other countries. Describing only an “average” national score obscures what is likely to be more useful information. Yet it is only in terms of national averages that policy discussion of international test scores typically proceeds. U.S. policymakers would learn more if they also studied the performances of demographic (socioeconomic) subgroups and compared these to the performances of similar subgroups in other nations. To the extent international comparisons are important, it is critical to know whether each subgroup in the United States performs above or below the level of socioeconomically similar subgroups in comparable industrialized nations.\n\nIf we identify subgroups that perform relatively well or relatively poorly in one country or another, we should also ask how the performances of these subgroups, compared to the performances of similar subgroups in other nations, are changing over time. Are some subgroups improving their performance unusually rapidly, in comparison to socioeconomically similar subgroups in other nations, while other subgroups are exhibiting unusual deterioration in performance? Are various subgroups improving or declining in performance at different rates, and are these differences masked when we look only at national averages?\n\nIn this report, we also identify inconsistencies between various international tests that may well be related to inaccurate population sampling that has caused some tests to oversample some social class groups and undersample others. Such sampling errors inevitably lead to inaccuracies in reports of how students in a particular country perform, relative to those in other countries where the sampling may have been more accurate.\n\nOther considerations, rarely considered in public debate, also influence the care we should take in the interpretation of international comparisons. One is how the curriculum is sampled in the framework for any particular test. Because the full range of knowledge and skills that we describe as “mathematics” cannot possibly be covered in a single brief test, policymakers should also carefully examine whether an assessment called a “mathematics” test necessarily covers knowledge and skills similar to those covered by other assessments also called “mathematics” tests, and whether performance on these different assessments can reasonably be compared. For example, American adolescents perform relatively well on algebra questions, and relatively poorly on geometry questions, compared to adolescents in other countries. Reports on how the United States compares to other countries show the United States in a more favorable light to the extent a test has more algebra items and fewer geometry items. Whether there is an appropriate balance between these topics on any particular international assessment is rarely considered by policymakers who draw conclusions about the relative performance of U.S. students from that assessment. Similar questions arise with regard to a “reading” test.\n\nWhether U.S. policymakers want to reorient the curriculum to place more emphasis on geometry is a decision they should make without regard to whether such reorientation might influence comparative scores on an international test. It certainly might not be good public policy to reduce curricular emphasis on statistics and probability, skills essential to an educated citizenry in a democracy, in order to make more time available for geometry. There are undoubtedly other sub-skills covered by international reading and math tests on which some countries are relatively stronger and others are relatively weaker. Investigation of these differences should be undertaken before drawing policy conclusions from international test scores.\n\nTo stimulate an examination and discussion of these and several other complexities, we analyze data on the performance of adolescents from PISA and TIMSS, as well as from two forms of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a test given exclusively to a sample of U.S. students. The first form, Main NAEP, is modified in small ways over time, so that its coverage tracks modifications in the math curriculum. The second form, Long-Term Trend NAEP (LTT), which changes much less over time, assesses how students’ competence changes over time on a more nearly identical set of skills. The Main NAEP has been administered since 1990, and the LTT since the early 1970s.\n\nPart II. PISA 2009—the comparative performance of U.S. students by social class group\n\nDisaggregation of PISA test scores by social class group reveals some patterns that many education policymakers will find surprising. Average U.S. test scores are lower than average scores in countries to which the United States is frequently compared, in part because the share of disadvantaged students in the overall national population is greater in the United States than in comparison countries. If the social class distribution of the United States were similar to that of top-scoring countries, the average test score gap between the United States and these top-scoring countries would be cut in half in reading and by one-third in mathematics. Disadvantaged U.S. students perform comparatively better than do disadvantaged students in important comparison countries. The test score gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students in the United States is smaller than the gap in similar post-industrial countries; it is generally, although not always, greater than the gap in top-scoring countries. This section explores these findings in greater detail.\n\nTo simplify our comparisons of national average PISA scores and of these scores disaggregated by social class, we focus on the United States and six other countries—Canada, Finland, South Korea (hereinafter simply Korea), France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\n\nWe refer to three of these countries (Canada, Finland, and Korea) as “top-scoring countries” because they score much better overall than the United States in reading and math—about a third of a standard deviation better. Canada, Finland, and Korea are also the three “consistent high-performers” that U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan highlighted when he released the U.S. PISA results (Duncan 2010).\n\nWe call the other three (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) “similar post-industrial countries” because they score similarly overall to the United States. They also are countries whose firms are major competitors of U.S. firms in the production of higher-end manufactured goods and services for world markets. Their firms are not the only competitors of U.S. firms, but if the educational preparation of young workers is a factor in national firms’ competitiveness, it is worth comparing student performance in these countries with student performance in the United States to see if these countries’ educational systems, so different from that in the United States, play a role in their firms’ success.\n\nPISA is scored on a scale that covers very wide ranges of ability in math and reading. When scales were created for reading in 2000 and for math in 2003, the mean for all test takers from countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the sponsor of PISA, was set at 500 with a standard deviation of 100. When statisticians describe score comparisons, they generally talk about differences that are “significant.” Yet while “significance” is a useful term for technical discussion, it can be misleading for policy purposes, because a difference can be statistically significant but too small to influence policy. Therefore, in this report, we avoid describing differences in terms of statistical significance. Instead, we use terms like “better (or worse)” and “substantially better (or worse)” (both of which are significantly better for statistical purposes), and “about the same.”\n\nIn general, in this report, we use the term “about the same” to describe average score differences in PISA that are less than 8 scale points; we use the term “better (or worse)” to describe differences that are at least 8 points but less than 18 scale points, and we use the term “substantially (or much) better (or worse)” to describe differences that are 18 scale points or more. Of course, any fixed cut point is arbitrary, and readers may find it strange when we say, for example, that when two countries have an average difference of 7 scale points they perform about the same, whereas when their average difference is 8 scale points one performs better than the other. This is a necessary consequence of any descriptive system using cut points. However, this caution is in order: Readers without statistical sophistication will be tempted to think that a difference of 7 scale points is almost “better.” This is true. But a difference of 8 scale points is also almost “about the same.” Many readers, accustomed to finding differences where there are none, will be more reluctant to consider the latter than the former, but both are equally true.\n\nTable 1 displays overall average scores in reading and math reported by PISA for 2009. These are the basis (without any socioeconomic disaggregation) of most commonplace comparisons.\n\nTable 1 Overall average national scale scores, reading and math, for U.S. and six comparison countries, PISA 2009 Top scoring Similar post-industrial U.S. U.S. versus: Canada Finland Korea Average* France Germany U.K. Average* Top-scoring average Similar post-industrial average Reading 524 536 539 533 496 497 494 496 500 -33 +4 Math 527 541 546 538 497 513 492 501 487 -50 -13 * Simple (unweighted) average of three countries Source: Authors' analysis of OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) (2010a) Share on Facebook Tweet this chart Embed Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website.

We refer to these as Group 1 (lowest social class), 2 (lower social class), 3 (lower-middle social class), 4 (upper-middle social class), 5 (higher social class), and 6 (highest social class). We also refer to Groups 1 and 2 together as disadvantaged students, to Groups 3 and 4 together as middle-class students, and to Groups 5 and 6 together as advantaged students.\n\nThere is no precise way to make social class comparisons between countries. PISA collects data on many characteristics that are arguably related to social class status, and also assembles them into an overall index. Although none of the possible indicators of social class differences is entirely satisfactory, we think one, the number of books in the home (BH), is probably superior for purposes of international test score comparisons, and we use it for our analysis. A very high fraction of students in both the PISA and TIMSS surveys answer the BH question, something less true for other important social class indicator questions asked on the student questionnaires. As we explain in greater detail below, we also examine whether other social class indicators, such as mother’s education or PISA’s overall index, in addition to BH, would produce meaningfully different results, and determine that they would not. We conclude that BH serves as a reasonable representation of social class (home) influences on students’ academic performance.\n\nOur examination of 2009 PISA scores, disaggregated by social class group, reveals that:\n\nIn every country, students from more-advantaged social class groups outperform students from less-advantaged social class groups. The social class performance gap is large. In each country we study, the reading gap between the highest (Group 6) and the lowest (Group 1) social class groups is more than a full standard deviation. The math gap is also more than a full standard deviation in the United States and in four of the six comparison countries. In the other two, Canada and Finland, the gap is also large, almost a full standard deviation. The reading and math gaps are larger in France than in any country we studied.\n\nThe reading and math gaps are smaller in the United States than in each of the three similar post-industrial countries we studied.\n\nThe average U.S. scores in reading and math were about the same or lower than those in the six comparison countries in considerable part because a disproportionately greater share of U.S. students come from disadvantaged social class groups than do students in the six comparison countries.\n\nIf the United States had the same social class distribution as the average of the three top-scoring countries, or as the average of the three similar post-industrial countries, its average reading and math scores would have been higher than its reported averages.\n\nTable 2A displays the share by social class group of the national samples for the United States and the six comparison countries.\n\nTable 2A Share of PISA 2009 sample in each social class group, by country Social class group Canada Finland Korea France Germany U.K. U.S. Group 1 (Lowest) 9% 6% 5% 15% 12% 14% 20% Group 2 13 11 9 17 13 16 18 Group 3 31 34 31 31 29 29 28 Group 4 21 23 23 18 19 18 16 Group 5 17 20 22 13 16 15 12 Group 6 (Highest) 9 6 9 7 10 8 6 Source: Authors' analysis of OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 database for each country Share on Facebook Tweet this chart Embed Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website.

Column (a) shows the average distribution by social class in the three top-scoring countries, and column (b) shows the average distribution by social class in the three similar post-industrial countries.\n\nFrom these tables we can see that more U.S. 15-year-olds (37 percent ) are in the disadvantaged (Groups 1 and 2) social class groups than in any of the six comparison countries, and we can therefore see why comparisons that do not control for differences in social class distributions between countries may differ greatly from those that do. There are fewer U.S. students in the middle (Groups 3 and 4) social class groups than in the middle social class groups of the three similar post-industrial countries (Germany, France, and the United Kingdom), although the differences are small. Differences in the size of middle-class groups are larger when the United States is compared to the three top-scoring countries (Korea, Finland, and Canada). And in the advantaged (Groups 5 and 6) social class groups there are substantially fewer U.S. students than there are in these groups in all six of the comparison countries.\n\nAny meaningful comparison of average performance should be adjusted for these differences. To clarify why, consider two countries, in both of which affluent students score higher than poor students. Country A’s most affluent (social class Group 6) students score higher than Country B’s Group 6 students. Similarly, Country A’s least advantaged (Group 1) students score higher than Country B’s Group 1 students. Yet if the proportion of poor children in Country A is higher than the proportion of poor children in Country B, the average score of all students in Country A may be lower than the average score of all students in Country B, even though both affluent and poor students in Country A achieve at higher levels than socioeconomically similar students in Country B. Such apparent anomalies are termed “composition effects.”\n\nBefore pursuing policies to address seemingly poor American student achievement in comparison to other nations, we should ask to what extent, if any, lower average U.S. performance is attributable to composition effects. In fact, a part, though small, of the apparently lower U.S. average performance is attributable to composition effects.\n\nWe can judge the importance of this composition effect by standardizing the social class distribution of the United States and the comparison countries. If we reweight the average country scores from Table 1, substituting the average social class weights of the top-scoring and similar post-industrial comparison countries from Table 2B, the country scores would be as shown in Tables 3A-D. Tables 3A and 3C show what the 2009 PISA reading and math scores, respectively, would have been if each country had an identical social class distribution to that of the average of the top-scoring countries. Tables 3B and 3D show what the 2009 PISA reading and math scores, respectively, would have been if each country had an identical social class distribution to that of the average of the similar post-industrial countries.

With reweighting, the U.S. average reading and math performance would still be below that of the top-scoring countries, although the U.S. deficit in reading in comparison to Canada would no longer be substantial. The U.S. average reading performance would now seem to be better than that in Germany or the United Kingdom, whereas before social class standardization the reading scores in these two countries were about the same as those in the United States.\n\nFigure A1 Average national reading scores, actual and re-weighted using top-scoring country average social class group distribution, for U.S. and six comparison countries, PISA 2009 Source: Authors’ analysis of OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 database for each country Share on Facebook Tweet this chart Embed Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website.

In Appendix A, we perform an opposite exercise, showing how much the scores of other countries might decline if they had the less favorable social class distribution of the United States. There is no single correct way to standardize scores by social class distribution. Other weighting methods generate somewhat different results, but the pattern is the same. Because of this distortion of average scores from social class composition, for the balance of this report, we focus on scores by social class group, not on average national scores.\n\nTable 4 displays the 2009 reading and math scores for the United States and three similar post-industrial countries, disaggregated by comparable social class groups in each country.\n\nIn reading, in comparison to students in the three similar post-industrial countries, U.S. students from the lowest (Group 1) social class group scored substantially better than comparable social class students in each of the three similar post-industrial countries. U.S. students from the lower (Group 2) social class group performed better than comparable social class students in each of the three similar post-industrial countries. U.S. students in the lower-middle (Group 3) social class group performed better than comparable social class students in Germany and in the United Kingdom, and about the same as comparable social class students in France. U.S. students in the upper middle (Group 4) social class group performed about the same as comparable social class students in the three similar post-industrial countries. U.S. students in the higher (Group 5) social class group performed better than comparable social class students in Germany and in the United Kingdom, and about the same as comparable social class students in France. U.S. students in the highest (Group 6) social class group performed about the same as comparable social class students in the United Kingdom, better than comparable social class students in Germany, and worse than comparable social class students in France.\n\nTables 3A-B showed that the U.S. average reading score was higher than reported when social class distribution was controlled for. Table 4 shows that, in reading, U.S. students performed as well or better than students in the three similar post-industrial countries at every social class level. The only exception is students in France in the highest (Group 6) social class group, who performed better in reading than students in the United States.\n\nIn math, in comparison to students in the three similar post-industrial countries, U.S. students from the lowest (Group 1) social class group performed substantially better than comparable social class students in France and about the same as comparable social class students in Germany and the United Kingdom. U.S. students from the lower (Group 2) social class group performed about the same as comparable social class students in France and Germany and better than comparable social class students in the United Kingdom. In all other (Groups 3-6) social class groups, U.S. students performed substantially worse than comparable social class students in Germany, and about the same as comparable social class students in the United Kingdom. U.S. students in the upper-middle (Group 4) and highest (Group 6) social class groups performed substantially worse than comparable social class students in France, and U.S. students in the higher (Group 5) social class group performed worse than comparable social class students in France.\n\nUnlike in reading, however, in math U.S. students underperformed students from middle and advantaged (Groups 3-6) social class groups in France and Germany, and mostly performed about the same as students from similar social class groups in the United Kingdom. Only in a comparison with the lowest (Group 1) social class students in France were comparable social class U.S. students substantially superior in math performance.\n\nTable 4 also displays the test score gradient (commonly referred to as the “achievement gap”), measured in two ways: the gap in average scores between students in Group 1 and students in Group 6, and the gap in average scores between students in Group 2 and students in Group 5.\n\nIn reading, the Group 1/Group 6 achievement gap is smaller in the United States than in the three similar post-industrial countries, and much smaller than in France. The Group 2/Group 5 reading achievement gap is smaller in the United States than in France or the United Kingdom. In math, the Group 1/Group 6 achievement gap is smaller in the United States than in France or Germany, and about the same as in the United Kingdom. The Group 2/Group 5 math achievement gap is smaller in the United States than in each of the similar post-industrial countries.\n\nCareful examination of these gradients, however, should serve as a warning to be cautious about interpretation of “achievement gaps,” the subject of frequent policy comment in the United States. One interpretation of these gradients, mostly larger in the similar post-industrial countries than in the United States, suggests that social class has a bigger impact on reading and math performance in the similar post-industrial countries than it does in the United States. Perhaps this is because the United States has a more equal school system than have the similar post-industrial countries, or because non-school social class characteristics have a bigger impact in the similar post-industrial countries than they do in the United States. Either of these explanations is at variance with commonplace assumptions in U.S. policy discussion. This finding is especially noteworthy because income inequality is probably larger in the United States than in the similar post-industrial countries.\n\nHowever, having a more equal school system is not necessarily the same as having a superior school system. Consider the Group 2/Group 5 gradients for the United States and France: In reading, the U.S. gap is smaller than the gap in France. This is attributable to the United States having higher reading achievement in Group 2 and about the same reading achievement in Group 5. This seems to be a desirable relative (to France) outcome for the United States. But in math, the smaller U.S. gap is attributable to Group 2 mathematics achievement that is about the same in the two countries, with Group 5 mathematics achievement that is lower in the United States than in France. Generating a smaller gap by having lower achievement in the higher social class group is probably not a result most policymakers would seek.\n\nThe U.S.-Germany reading gradient comparison is even more favorable to the United States than the U.S.-France gradient comparison, with U.S. achievement higher both for Group 2 and Group 5 students. Because the Group 2 U.S. superiority is greater than the Group 5 superiority, the U.S. gap is smaller. This is a desirable result.\n\nBut in math, the smaller U.S. gap relative to the German gap is attributable to Group 2 scores that are about the same in the two countries while Group 5 scores are substantially lower in the United States than in Germany. Although the United States has a smaller achievement gap, this is not a desirable result.\n\nComparing the U.S. and U.K. gradients, in reading the result is similar to that in the German comparison—desirable for the United States, because U.S. Group 2 achievement is higher than that in the United Kingdom, while U.S. Group 5 achievement is also higher than in the United Kingdom, but not as much so. In math, U.S. achievement in Group 2 is higher than that in the United Kingdom, while Group 5 achievement in the two countries is about the same. This, too, is a desirable result for the United States, but not as desirable as it would be if Group 5 achievement were higher as well.\n\nTable 5 displays the 2009 reading and math scores for the United States and three top-scoring countries, disaggregated by comparable social class groups in each country.\n\nIn reading, disadvantaged (Groups 1 and 2) students in the U.S. score substantially worse than comparable students in the three top-scoring countries, the only exception being the lowest (Group 1) social class students, where U.S. students score worse but not substantially worse than their social class counterparts in Canada. Likewise for middle (Groups 3 and 4) social class students: U.S. students score worse than comparable students in Canada and substantially worse than comparable students in Finland and Korea. Higher (Group 5) social class students in the United States score about the same as comparable social class students in the three top-scoring countries, while the highest (Group 6) social class students in the United States score worse than comparable social class students in Finland and Korea and about the same as comparable social class students in Canada.\n\nIn comparing the United States and the three top-scoring countries in math, the picture is consistent across all social class groups and countries: U.S. students score substantially worse than comparable students in each social class group in the three top-scoring countries, the exception being that U.S. higher social class (Group 5) students score worse than comparable social class students in Canada.\n\nTable 5 also displays the test score gradients between advantaged and disadvantaged students in the United States and the top-scoring countries.\n\nUnlike the gradients in the similar post-industrial countries, the gradients in the top-scoring countries are generally smaller than those in the United States. In reading, the Group 6/Group 1 gap is smaller in Canada and in Finland than in the United States and about the same in Korea as in the United States. The Group 5/Group 2 reading gradient is smaller in Finland than in the United States and much smaller in Canada and Korea than in the United States.\n\nIn math, the Group 6/Group 1 gradient is much smaller in Canada and Finland than in the United States, as is the Group 5/Group 2 math gradient in Finland. The Group 5/Group 2 math gradients in Canada and Korea are smaller than in the United States.\n\nWhat stands out most, however, is the unusually large gap in achievement between Korean students in Group 6 and those in Group 1. This gradient of 149 scale points is larger than in any other comparison we have made, and results both from the unusually low relative performance in math of Korean students in Group 1 and unusually high relative performance in math of Korean students in Group 6. Although the lowest (Group 1) social class students in Korea score substantially better than similar social class students in the United States, the relative advantage of Korean performance is much more pronounced at the highest (Group 6) social class level.\n\nWe cannot say whether this Korea–United States difference is attributable to the United States having a more equal school system than does Korea, or because non-school characteristics of the highest social class students have a bigger positive impact on students in Korea than on students in the United States. For example, widely reported access to out-of-school tutoring may have an unusually large impact on the highest social class students in Korea.\n\nThe comparisons described in this part of the report show that, to some extent, the widely reported disparity between the performance of U.S. students and that of comparable countries’ students on the PISA is attributable to the U.S. sample of test takers being more heavily weighted toward disadvantaged students than the samples of comparable countries. Although adjustment for these social class differences does not eliminate the gap between the performance of United States and top-scoring country students, it narrows the gap. And relative to the performance of students in similar post-industrial countries, the performance of U.S. students in many cases no longer seems deficient once social class composition is taken into account.\n\nIn this connection, we note here but reserve for detailed discussion in Part IV an apparent flaw in the 2009 U.S. PISA sampling methodology. Although the U.S. sample included disadvantaged students in appropriate proportion to their actual representation in the U.S. 15-year-old population, the U.S. sample included a disproportionate number of disadvantaged students who were enrolled in schools with unusually large concentrations of such students. Because, after controlling for student social class status, students from families with low social class status will perform more poorly in schools with large concentrations of such students, this sampling flaw probably reduced the reported average score of students in the bottom social class groups (perhaps Groups 1-3). However, with available data, we cannot say to what extent this occurred. We do conclude, however, that this distortion probably depressed the reported average scores of U.S. students beyond the composition effect discussed in this section, artificially reducing the reported U.S. average score and its international ranking.\n\nA consistent pattern in the 2009 PISA scores is the better performance of U.S. students on the reading than on the math test, relative to the comparison countries. Table 6 displays this pattern.\n\nTable 6 Reading vs. math, U.S. compared with other countries, PISA 2009 U.S. versus: Canada Finland Korea France Germany U.K. Group 1 (Lowest) 19 32 -1 18 28 19 Group 2 8 18 9 9 18 7 Group 3 17 19 15 14 27 11 Group 4 19 18 26 14 32 15 Group 5 14 15 30 18 32 7 Group 6 (Highest) 15 22 36 11 35 4 Note: Numbers in this table are the reading gap less the math gap for each social class group. The reading (math) gap is the U.S. average reading (math) score for a given social class group less the comparison country's reading (math) score for that social class group.

For example, for the lowest (Group 1) social class, the Canada–U.S. reading gap is 17 scale points (from Table 5, the U.S. Group 1 reading score is 442 and the Canadian Group 1 reading score is 459). The Canada–U.S. math gap is 37 scale points (from Table 5, the U.S. Group 1 math score is 434 and the Canadian Group 1 math score is 471). The difference between the reading gap of 17 scale points and the math gap of 37 scale points is the 19 scale points shown in Table 6 for Group 1, Canada. Wherever a positive number appears in Table 6, the reading gap is smaller than the math gap. Note that a positive number does not signify that U.S. students perform better in reading than students in the same social class group in a comparison country, or better in reading but not in math; it may mean that, or it may mean that the U.S. comparative deficit is less in reading than in math for that particular social class group and country because the reading deficit is smaller than the math deficit.\n\nTable 6 shows that, on average, and for almost every social class group U.S. students do relatively better in reading than in math, compared to students in both the top-scoring and the similar post-industrial countries. The only exceptions to this pattern are with respect to social class Group 1 in Korea and to social class Groups 2, 5, and 6 in the United Kingdom. In these four cases, the reading and math gaps are about the same. In all other comparisons (for each social class group in each of the six comparison countries), the United States does relatively better in reading than in math, either because the U.S. reading score is higher than the reading score for the same social class group in a comparison country and the U.S. math score is less higher or lower, or because the U.S. reading score is lower than the reading score in the same social class group in a comparison country by a lesser amount than the U.S. math score is lower.\n\nPart III. PISA trends from 2000 to 2009\n\nData are now available for four administrations of PISA – 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2009. Score trends over this decade may seem surprising. We would ordinarily expect instruction to be more difficult when the concentration of disadvantaged students increases. Yet while the social class composition of the national PISA sample deteriorated more in the United States than in any other country, disadvantaged U.S. students nonetheless saw their scores improve, while scores of similarly disadvantaged students in countries to which the United States is frequently compared have been declining. PISA reported that the U.S. average reading score was about the same in 2009 as it had been in 2000, but if U.S. social class composition had not deteriorated, the average U.S. reading score would have improved from 2000 to 2009. PISA reported that the U.S. average math score was worse in 2009 than in 2000, but this was all because of deteriorating social class composition. If this deterioration had not occurred, U.S. average math performance would have been about the same in 2009 as it had been in 2000.\n\nThe test score gaps between disadvantaged students in the United States and in top-scoring countries generally narrowed, but the gaps between advantaged students in the United States and in these top-scoring countries widened in some cases. In comparison to similar post-industrial countries, the United States also narrowed the gap more at the bottom than at the top, and in some cases ended the decade with clear superiority over similar social class groups toward the bottom of the scale. This section explores these findings in greater detail.\n\nScore trends over time are as important for policy purposes as score levels at the current time. We want to know not only in which countries adolescents perform better than in other countries, but also whether there are socioeconomic factors or educational policies and practices that are causing a country’s performance to improve or deteriorate. If one country has lower 2009 PISA scores than another, but if scores in the lower-scoring country have been improving over the previous decade while scores in the higher-scoring country have been declining, policymakers in the lower-scoring country might be ill-advised to look exclusively to the higher-scoring country for model school improvement policies. At the very least, policymakers should attempt to understand why the higher-scoring country’s superior achievement appears, at least to some extent, to be unsustainable.\n\nPISA has been administered every three years since 2000, and the multiple years of data provide policymakers an opportunity to make more useful judgments than would be allowed by a single year of data. Unfortunately, there are no U.S. reading data for 2006 because of an error in test administration. Thus, we can look at changes in U.S. students’ math performance on PISA from 2000 to 2003, to 2006, and to 2009, but at reading performance only from 2000 to 2003 and then to 2009.\n\nStudents who were 15 years old and took the PISA in 2000 would have been affected by their families’ social, economic, and community environments beginning in about 1985, and would have entered school in about 1990. PISA score changes from 2000 to 2003 could have been influenced by socioeconomic or instructional or other educational changes that took place anywhere from the mid-1980s to 2003. Likewise, PISA score changes from 2003 to 2006 could have been influenced by socioeconomic or instructional changes that took place anywhere from the late 1980s to 2006. And PISA score changes from 2006 to 2009 could have been influenced by socioeconomic or instructional changes that took place anywhere from the mid-1990s to 2009.\n\nIn this report, we are unable to attribute causes to trends in scores; we can only describe them. We review trends in reading and math for the United States and each of the six comparison countries in the discussion and tables that follow.\n\nAs was the case when we examined comparative score levels in 2009, our main conclusion from this review is that there are few consistent patterns in these score trends that can be used to inspire policy. Simplistic judgments based on selective or overly generalized data can (and do) mask critical aspects of U.S. relative performance, and they can support policy changes that can undermine U.S. sources of strength and exacerbate U.S. sources of weakness.\n\nAs in the previous section of this report, we focus on trends by social class group, because changes over time in the composition of a country’s test takers by social class can affect a country’s average score while masking real changes (or lack of change) in the performance of that country’s students. Composition effects can distort changes over time as well as comparisons between countries at a given time.\n\nIn fact, the proportion of students sampled in different social class groups from 2000 to 2009 in the United States and in the six comparison countries has changed, and these shifts influence changes in the overall average score of each country over time.\n\nIt is made somewhat more difficult to understand these changes because PISA modified its books-in-the-home (BH) group definitions after the 2000 assessment. Table 7 displays these changed definitions.\n\nTable 7 PISA group definitions by books in the home Number of books in home 2000 2003 and after Group 0 0 – Group 1 1 – 10 0–10 Group 2 11–50 11–25 Group 3 51–100 26–100 Group 4 101–250 101–200 Group 5 251–500 201–500 Group 6 >500 >500 Source: OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009 databases Share on Facebook Tweet this chart Embed Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website.

The share of students from homes with only 11-100 books also increased in the United States and in Canada as well. Correspondingly, the share of students whose homes had more than 100 books increased in Finland and Korea, but declined everywhere else, with the largest decline in the United States. By these measures of change in the sample proportions of students from homes with fewer and more books, U.S. students’ average social class declined more than the average social class of any of the comparison countries from 2000 to 2009, with the United Kingdom a close second. Finland and Korea’s average social class increased.\n\nBecause the BH categories remained consistent from 2003 onward, Table 8B shows how the distribution of test takers by social class in these countries changed from 2003 to 2009.\n\nTable 8B Changes in PISA sample social class composition by books-in-the-home group, U.S. and six comparison countries, 2003–2009 (percentage points) Canada Finland Korea France Germany U.K. U.S. Group 1 (Lowest) +2 +1 -1 +6 +5 +5 +7 Group 2 +2 -2 -2 +1 0 +2 +2 Group 3 +1 -3 -2 -3 -1 -1 -3 Group 4 -1 +1 -2 -2 -2 0 -3 Group 5 -1 +4 +4 0 -1 -3 -2 Group 6 (Highest) -3 0 +3 -1 -2 -2 -2 Disadvantaged (Groups 1 and 2) +4 -1 -3 +6 +5 +7 +10 Middle class (Groups 3 and 4) 0 -2 -4 -5 -3 -1 -6 Advantaged (Groups 5 and 6) -4 +3 +6 -1 -3 -5 -4 Source: Authors' analysis of OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000 and 2009 databases for each country, with authors' interpolations for 2000 social class composition to match 2009 books-in-the-home groupings Share on Facebook Tweet this chart Embed Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website. Download image\n\nWe can see from Table 8B that, during the six-year period 2003–2009, the average social class of the test-taking samples in Canada, in the three similar post-industrial countries (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom), and in the United States declined, with the U.S. decline larger than in any of the comparison countries.\n\nBecause of such social class compositional changes, comparisons of test score trends over time by social class group provide more useful information to policymakers than comparisons of total average test scores at one point in time or even of changes in total average test scores over time.\n\nFor reading and math, we examine trends in the United States by BH categories compared to the six comparison countries for the 2000 to 2009 period. The paths by which performance changed from 2000 to 2009 varied by country, so an investigation of why these 2000 to 2009 changes occurred in specific countries should also examine disaggregated scores. For the United States, because no data are available for reading in 2006, such an investigation should disaggregate the reading trends by examining the 2000 to 2003 and 2003 to 2009 periods separately. For mathematics, a similar investigation would be appropriate, with the addition of disaggregating trends for the 2003 to 2006 and 2006 to 2009 periods.\n\nIn the next series of tables, we show how, for each social class group, PISA achievement in reading and math changed in the United States and in each of the comparison countries from 2000 to 2009. Because, as noted above, PISA changed its books-in-the-home categories in 2003, social class groups in 2000 do not exactly match the categories in 2009. Thus, to make an estimate of average social class group score changes from 2000 to 2009, we interpolate average scores for books-in-the-home categories in 2000 in order to create average test scores by social class groups that are comparable to those in 2009. We use these estimates to calculate test score differences by social class groups from 2000 to 2009.\n\nReading, 2000–2009\n\nTable 9A displays how reading achievement changed from 2000 to 2009 in the United States and the three similar post-industrial countries.\n\nTable 9A Reading score changes, scale scores by social class group for U.S. and similar post-industrial countries, PISA 2000–2009 France Germany U.K. U.S. 2000 2009 Change 2000 2009 Change 2000 2009 Change 2000 2009 Change Group 1 (Lowest) 430 403 -27 361 413 52 440 424 -17 418 442 23 Group 2 464 458 -7 404 455 52 470 455 -16 455 471 15 Group 3 503 498 -5 465 496 31 508 490 -19 499 504 5 Group 4 526 533 8 502 523 21 539 522 -17 528 529 1 Group 5 553 559 6 536 555 19 565 555 -10 556 563 7 Group 6 (Highest) 548 573 26 549 551 1 577 562 -15 560 563 3 National average reading score 505 496 -9 484 497 13 523 494 -29 504 500 -5 Source: Authors' analysis of OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000 database, with authors' interpolations of average test scores; Tables 1 and 4 for 2009 data Share on Facebook Tweet this chart Embed Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website.

Thus, whereas in 2000 U.S. disadvantaged social class (Groups 1-2) students performed below comparable French students, in 2009 these students in the United States performed better than disadvantaged students in France and, in the case of the lowest social class (Group 1) students, substantially better. Whereas in 2000 the highest social class (Group 6) students in the United States performed better than comparable French students, in 2009 they performed worse. Middle and higher social class students (Groups 3-5) in the United States and France performed at about the same level in both years.\n\nIn Germany, reading scores were mostly unchanged from 2000 to 2009 for the highest social class (Group 6) students but improved substantially for other social class (Groups 1-5) students. There were extraordinarily large gains—half a standard deviation—for disadvantaged social class group (Groups 1-2) students. Thus, although U.S. students still had higher reading scores than German students in each social class group in 2009 (except for upper-middle social class [Group 4] students, who scored about the same in the two countries in 2009), and although the lowest social class (Group 1) students in the United States continued to perform substantially better than comparable German students, German students closed the gap in all social class groups (except for Group 6) from 2000 to 2009.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, reading scores declined in every social class group, with substantial declines for lower-middle social class (Group 3) students. Thus, whereas in 2000 U.S. students performed worse than U.K. students in each social class group, by 2009 the lowest social class (Group 1) students in the United States performed substantially better than comparable students in the United Kingdom, and lower, lower-middle, and higher social class (Groups 2, 3, and 5) students in the United States performed better than comparable social class students in the United Kingdom. Upper-middle and the highest social class (Groups 4 and 6) students in the United States performed about the same in 2009 as comparable social class students in the United Kingdom.\n\nTable 10A displays how reading achievement changed from 2000 to 2009 in the United States and the three top-scoring countries.\n\nTable 10A Reading score changes, scale scores by social class group for U.S. and top-scoring countries, PISA 2000–2009 Canada Finland Korea U.S. 2000 2009 Change 2000 2009 Change 2000 2009 Change 2000 2009 Change Group 1 (Lowest) 467 459 -8 497 466 -31 464 461 -3 418 442 23 Group 2 490 492 1 514 495 -19 490 501 11 455 471 15 Group 3 522 518 -5 534 523 -11 518 529 11 499 504 5 Group 4 542 543 1 558 552 -6 532 546 14 528 529 1 Group 5 560 561 1 575 571 -4 546 564 19 556 563 7 Group 6 (Highest) 563 567 4 581 572 -9 556 581 25 560 563 3 National average reading score 534 524 -10 546 536 -11 525 539 15 504 500 -5 Source: Authors' analysis of OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), 2000 database, with authors' interpolations of average test scores; Tables 1 and 5 for 2009 data Share on Facebook Tweet this chart Embed Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website.

Thus, while the lowest social class (Group 1) students in the United States still performed below comparable social class students in Canada, the gap between these U.S. and Canadian students was cut by two-thirds during this period. Gaps were also narrowed for lower- and lower-middle-class (Groups 2 and 3) students, while for upper-middle and advantaged social class (Groups 4-6) students, the gap was mostly unchanged from 2000 to 2009.\n\nIn Finland, reading scores declined for disadvantaged, lower-middle, and the highest social class (Groups 1-3 and 6) students, with substantial declines for disadvantaged social class (Groups 1-2) students. Reading scores for upper-middle and higher social class (Group 4 and 5) students were about the same in both years. U.S. disadvantaged and middle social class (Groups 1-4) students still scored substantially below comparable students in Finland in 2009. The highest social class (Group 6) students also scored below comparable students in Finland, but higher social class (Group 5) students now scored about the same in the United States and Finland. The U.S.-Finland reading gap was cut by about two-thirds for disadvantaged social class (Groups 1 and 2) students, was cut in half for lower-middle and advantaged social class (Groups 3, 5, and 6) students, and by about a third for upper-middle social class (Group 4) students from 2000 to 2009.\n\nIn Korea, reading scores improved for lower and middle social class (Groups 2-4) students and improved substantially for advantaged social class (Groups 5-6) students. Korean reading scores remained the same for lowest social class (Group 1) students. U.S. lowest social class (Group 1) students narrowed substantially (but did not eliminate) their negative performance gap relative to comparable students in Korea, but the U.S. negative performance gap grew for upper-middle and advantaged social class (Groups 4-6) students, with a substantial growth in this gap for the highest social class (Group 6) students. While U.S. higher social class (Group 5) students outperformed comparable social class students in Korea in 2000, by 2009 this social class group performed about the same in the two countries.\n\nThus, although U.S. students still scored below each of the three top-scoring countries in reading in almost all social class groups, U.S. students narrowed the gap in many groups from 2000 to 2009. Of particular note is the substantial gap closing between the lowest social class (Group 1) students in the United States and in each top-scoring country.\n\nThe 2000 to 2009 trends just described are not always (indeed, rarely) linear. For each social class group in each country, performance may have risen and then fallen during the period, making an understanding of the causes of these trends even more difficult. Figures B1 and B2 illustrate reading trends in the United States and the six comparison countries from 2000 to 2003 to 2006 to 2009.\n\nTo make the figures easier to understand, we display trends for disadvantaged social class (Groups 1 and 2) students and advantaged social class (Groups 5 and 6) students only. As the previous discussion has made clear, it would not be accurate to assume that the trends for middle social class (Groups 3 and 4) students, not shown, in each case parallel the trends for advantaged and disadvantaged students.\n\nBefore reasonable policy conclusions can be based on PISA reading score trends from 2000 to 2009, we should attempt to understand why, in the lowest (Group 1) social class group, reading scores improved substantially for U.S. and German students but declined for U.K. and Canadian students and declined substantially for students in France and Finland. Likewise, we should attempt to understand why reading scores for U.S., German, and Canadian students in the highest (Group 6) social class group were unchanged but improved substantially for comparable social class students in France and Korea and declined for students in Finland and the United Kingdom. We should understand why there was a collapse in reading performance across all social class groups in the United Kingdom, and we should understand why in Korea there was improvement for upper-middle and advantaged social class (Groups 4-6) students only. We are not aware of differing socioeconomic trends or changes in instructional or educational policies that can help to explain these disparate reading results, and so are not persuaded by policymakers who draw conclusions from these test score trends. Simple and seemingly obvious explanations cannot account for these complex results. If curricular or instructional changes are responsible, why should they have affected different social class groups within a country differently? If (in the case of Finland, for example) immigration of less literate families explains the drop in Group 1 scores, how does this explain why Group 6 scores fell as well?\n\nFigure B1 Reading scores, by social class group, U.S. compared with similar post-industrial countries, PISA 2000–2009 Note: U.S. data for 2006 are unavailable and therefore linearly interpolated.

Complicating matters further, average scores for countries, or for separate social class groups, did not trend in a straight line from 2000 to 2009. In some cases an overall increase was the consequence of a drop during one interim period but a larger gain in another. Attempting to explain changes in performance over interim periods, however, would be even more difficult than attempting to explain them over the full nine years.\n\nMathematics, 2000–2009\n\nTable 11A displays how math achievement changed from 2000 to 2009 in the United States and the three similar post-industrial countries.\n\nTable 11A Mathematics score changes, scale scores by social class group for U.S. and similar post-industrial countries, PISA 2000–2009 France Germany U.K. U.S. 2000 2009 Change 2000 2009 Change 2000 2009 Change 2000 2009 Change Group 1 (Lowest) 458 413 -45 381 433 52 458 435 -23 416 434 18 Group 2 484 460 -24 418 466 49 483 455 -29 446 464 17 Group 3 517 498 -19 471 509 39 519 487 -32 490 491 1 Group 4 537 529 -8 500 535 36 540 517 -23 510 510 0 Group 5 558 562 4 537 571 34 563 547 -16 543 548 4 Group 6 (Highest) 544 569 24 550 570 20 579 551 -29 554 548 -6 National average math score 517 497 -20 490 513 23 529 492 -37 493 487 -6 Source: Authors' analysis of OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2000 database, with authors' interpolations of average test scores, and Tables 1 and 4 for 2009 data Share on Facebook Tweet this chart Embed Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website.

These changes are very similar to the changes described above for reading from 2000 to 2009 (Table 9A); in the case of both reading and math, the gains for Group 1 improved substantially and by a similar amount.\n\nConsidering the three similar post-industrial countries in this full 2000 to 2009 period:\n\nIn France, math scores declined substantially for disadvantaged and for lower-middle-class students (Groups 1-3), declined for upper-middle-class students (Group 4), were stagnant for higher social class students (Group 5), and improved substantially for the highest social class students (Group 6). Overall, these changes in French math performance from 2000 to 2009 were similar in direction to the changes in reading performance over the same period, although in the bottom social classes the deterioration in math performance was much more severe than in reading performance. Also similar to reading, although disadvantaged social class (Groups 1-2) students in the United States scored substantially worse than comparable social class French students in math in 2000, by 2009 these U.S. students scored better than their French social class counterparts and substantially better in the lowest social class (Group 1). However, and again as in reading, whereas in 2000 U.S. students from the highest social class (Group 6) scored above French students, by 2009 these students scored below their French social class counterparts.\n\nIn Germany, math scores improved substantially in every social class group, with especially large gains for the lowest social class (Group 1) students. As in France, these trends in math were very similar to the changes described in reading (Table 9A), the only exception being that German reading scores for the highest social class (Group 6) students were unchanged from 2000 and 2009, but in math these students made large gains, nearly as large as those made by German students in other social class groups.

These include:\n\nVirtual Machines: Preview Portal Support as well as SharePoint Farm Creation\n\nPreview Portal Support as well as SharePoint Farm Creation Machine Learning: Public preview of the new Azure Machine Learning service\n\nPublic preview of the new Azure Machine Learning service Event Hub: Public preview of new Azure Event Ingestion Service\n\nPublic preview of new Azure Event Ingestion Service Mobile Services : General Availability of .NET support, SignalR support\n\n: General Availability of .NET support, SignalR support Notification Hubs: Price Reductions and New Features\n\nPrice Reductions and New Features SQL Database: New Geo-Restore, Geo-Replication and Auditing support\n\nNew Geo-Restore, Geo-Replication and Auditing support Redis Cache: Larger Cache Sizes\n\nLarger Cache Sizes Storage: Support for Zone Redundant Storage\n\nSupport for Zone Redundant Storage SDK: Tons of great VS and SDK improvements\n\nAll of these improvements are now available to use immediately (note that some features are still in preview). Below are more details about them:\n\nVirtual Machines: Support in the new Azure Preview portal\n\nWe previewed the new Azure Preview Portal at the //Build conference earlier this year. It brings together all of your Azure resources in a single management portal, and makes it easy to build cloud applications on the Azure platform using our new Azure Resource Manager (which enables you to manage multiple Azure resources as a single application). The initial preview of the portal supported Web Sites, SQL Databases, Storage, and Visual Studio Online resources.\n\nThis past month we’ve extended the preview portal to also now support Virtual Machines. You can create standalone VMs using the portal, or group multiple VMs (and PaaS services) together into a Resource Group and manage them as a single logical entity. You can use the preview portal to get deep insights into billing and monitoring of these resources, and customize the portal to view the data however you want. If you are an existing Azure customer you can start using the new portal today: http://portal.azure.com.\n\nBelow is a screen-shot of the new portal in action. The service dashboard showing service/region health can be seen in the top-left of the portal, along with billing data about my subscriptions – both make it really easy for you to see the health and usage of your services in Azure. In the screen-shot below I have a single VM running named “scottguvstest” – and clicking the tile for it displays a “blade” of additional details about it to the right – including integrated performance monitoring usage data:\n\nThe initial “blade” for a VM provides a summary view of common metrics about it. You can click any of the titles to get even more detailed information as well.\n\nFor example, below I’ve clicked the CPU monitoring title in my VM, which brought up a Metric blade with even more details about CPU utilization over the last few days. I’ve then clicked the “Add Alert” command within it to setup an automatic alert that will trigger (and send an email to me) any time the CPU of the VM goes above 95%:\n\nIn the screen-shot below, I’ve clicked the “Usage” tile within the VM blade, which displays details about the different VM sizes available – and what each VM size provides in terms of CPU, memory, disk IOPS and other capabilities. Changing the size of the VM being used is as simple as clicking another of the pricing tiles within the portal – no redeployment of the VM required:\n\nSharePoint Farm support via the Azure Gallery\n\nBuilt-into the Azure Preview Portal is a new “Azure Gallery” that provides an easy way to deploy a wide variety of VM images and online services. VM images in the Azure Gallery include Windows Server, SQL Server, SharePoint Server, Ubuntu, Oracle, Baracuda images.\n\nLast month, we also enabled a new “SharePoint Server Farm” gallery item. It enables you to easily configure and deploy a highly-available SharePoint Server Farm consisting of multiple VM images (databases, web servers, domain controllers, etc) in only minutes. It provides the easiest way to create and configure SharePoint farms anywhere:\n\nOver the next few months you’ll see even more items show up in the gallery – enabling a variety of additional new scenarios. Try out the ones in the gallery today by visiting the new Azure portal: http://portal.azure.com/\n\nMachine Learning: Preview of new Machine Learning Service for Azure\n\nLast month we delivered the public preview of our new Microsoft Azure Machine Learning service, a game changing service that enables your applications and systems to significantly improve your organization’s understanding across vast amounts of data. Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) is a fully managed cloud service with no software to install, no hardware to manage, and no OS versions or development environments to grapple with. Armed with nothing but a browser, data scientists can log into Azure and start developing Machine Learning models from any location, and from any device.\n\nML Studio, an integrated development environment for Machine Learning, lets you set up experiments as simple data flow graphs, with an easy to use drag, drop and connect paradigm. Data scientists can use it to avoid programming a large number of common tasks, allowing them to focus on experiment design and iteration. A collection of best of breed algorithms developed by Microsoft Research comes built-in, as is support for custom R code – and over 350 open source R packages can be used securely within Azure ML today.\n\nAzure ML also makes it simple to create production deployments at scale in the cloud. Pre-trained Machine Learning models can be incorporated into a scoring workflow and, with a few clicks, a new cloud-hosted REST API can be created.\n\nAzure ML makes the incredible potential of Machine Learning accessible both to startups and large enterprises. Startups are now able to immediately apply machine learning to their applications. Larger enterprises are able to unleash the latent value in their big data to generate significantly more revenue and efficiencies. Above all, the speed of iteration and experimentation that is now possible will allow for rapid innovation and pave the way for intelligence in cloud-connected devices all around us.\n\nGetting Started\n\nGetting started with the Azure Machine Learning Service is easy. Within the current Azure Portal simply choose New->Data Services->Machine Learning to create your first ML service today:\n\nSubscribe to the Machine Learning Team Blog to learn more about the Azure Machine Learning service. And visit our Azure Machine Learning documentation center to watch videos and explore tutorials on how to get started immediately.\n\nEvent Hub: Preview of new Azure Event Ingestion Service\n\nToday’s connected world is defined by big data. Big data may originate from connected cars and thermostats that produce telemetry data every few minutes, application performance counters that generate events every second or mobile apps that capture telemetry for every user’s individual action. The rapid proliferation of connected devices raises challenges due to the variety of platforms and protocols involved. Connecting these disparate data sources while handling the scale of the aggregate stream is a significant challenge.\n\nI’m happy to announce the public preview of a significant new Azure service: Event Hub. Event Hub is a highly scalable pub-sub ingestor capable of elastic scale to handle millions of events per second from millions of connected devices so that you can process and analyze the massive amounts of data produced by your connected devices and applications. With this new service, we now provide an easy way for you to provision capacity for ingesting events from a variety of sources, and over a variety of protocols in a secure manner. Event Hub supports a variety of partitioning modes to enable parallelism and scale in your downstream processing tier while preserving the order of events on a per device basis.\n\nCreating an Event Hub\n\nYou can easily create a new instance of Event Hub from the Azure Management Portal by clicking New->App Services->Service Bus->Event Hub. During the Preview, Event Hub service is available in a limited number of regions (East US 2, West Europe, Southeast Asia) and requires that you first create a new Service Bus Namespace:\n\nLearn More\n\nTry out the new Event Hub service and give us your feedback!

  "latent_18965": "(CNN) North Korea said it hit the button on its fifth and potentially most powerful nuclear test Friday morning, claiming to have successfully detonated a nuclear warhead that could be mounted on ballistic rockets.\n\nState media said the test would enable North Korea to produce \"a variety of smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike power.\"\n\n\"It's hard for us to verify their claim. My deep fear is that they will launch a live nuclear weapon on one of their missiles, but that would be extremely dangerous as that could trigger a war,\" said Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies\n\n\"The members of the Security Council also recalled that they have previously expressed their determination to take further significant measures in the event of another Democratic People's Republic of Korea nuclear test,\" the Security Council statement said. \"In line with this commitment and the gravity of this violation, the members of the Security Council will begin to work immediately on appropriate measures. ...\"\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama warned North Korea that it will face \"consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.\"\n\nObama said he spoke to the leaders of South Korea and Japan by phone, and that they agreed to \"take additional significant steps, including new sanctions.\"\n\n\"To be clear, the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state,\" Obama said in a statement.\n\nThe blast, detected about 9 a.m. local time (8:30 p.m. ET) in the area of North Korea's Punggye-ri underground test site, is estimated to have had the explosive power of 10 kilotons, almost twice as large as the most recent test in January , said Kim Nam-wook of South Korea's Meteorological Administration.\n\nThe test comes on North Korea's national day, and six months after it claimed it had miniaturized nuclear warheads to fit on ballistic missiles . At the same time, South Korea is negotiating an expected deployment of a US missile defense system -- a plan that Pyongyang has decried as provocative.\n\n'Fanatically reckless'\n\nSouth Korean President Park Geun-hye called Kim Jong Un's regime \"fanatically reckless.\"\n\n\"The only thing that (the) Kim Jong Un regime can gain from the nuclear tests is stronger sanctions from the international community and its isolation. Such provocation will eventually hasten its path to self-destruction,\" she said in a statement.\n\nSanctions against the regime, including ones targeting the North Korean leader personally, have had little effect.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that it was \"absolutely unacceptable\" if North Korea had conducted another nuclear test.\n\nObama, who just returned from Asia , called the test a grave threat to international security. He said he reaffirmed to Park and Abe the \"unshakeable US commitment to take necessary steps to defend our allies in the region,\" including through the planned deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD , anti-missile system in South Korea.\n\nSame location as other tests\n\nthe underground site used in the other four tests Seismic activity was detected near Punggye-ri,the underground siteused in the other four tests . The US Geological Survey reported a 5.3-magnitude earthquake but later termed it an explosion.\n\n\"We are currently analyzing whether it was a successful test,\" a South Korean National Defense Ministry official told CNN.\n\nSatellite images had shown new activity at the test site in recent weeks, according to North Korea monitoring site 38North . A small number of mining carts could be seen, as well as a new canopy designed to hide activity to the site, analysts said.\n\nHow close is North Korea to mounting a nuclear warhead?\n\nNorth Korea has continued to improve its nuclear and missile capabilities, but it has yet to pair the two successfully. However, concern has been growing that the country is testing weapons at an unprecedented pace this year, CNN international correspondent Paula Hancocks said.\n\nSouth Korea worries that Pyongyang is progressing toward its goal of mounting a nuclear warhead to ballistic missiles \"faster than previously estimated,\" a South Korean lawmaker told reporters.\n\nKim Byung-kee of the opposition Minjoo Party made the remark after attending a meeting with South Korean intelligence officials.\n\nReporters asked him whether the test means North Korea can now mount a nuclear warhead.\n\n\"It doesn't appear to be the case,\" Kim said. \"Even if they can mount it (on a missile), the technology for weaponizing it is a separate issue. It doesn't appear they will be able to complete (this) in the next one or two years, but the intelligence authorities said it may be able to be weaponized sooner than expected.\"\n\nEarlier tests and sanctions\n\nIn January, North Korea claimed it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, a move the Security Council condemned and that led to punitive sanctions on the North Korean regime. But a U.S. official directly familiar with an assessment of the test said in February there may have been a partial, failed test of some type of components associated with a hydrogen bomb.\n\nRecent satellite images of the North Korea test site show movement, monitoring site 38North says.\n\nA hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear bomb, can be hundreds of times more powerful than an atomic bomb, like the one dropped on Hiroshima during World War II. While the Hiroshima explosion produced the equivalent of about 15,000 tons of TNT, the world's first thermonuclear test, conducted by the United States in the Marshall Islands in 1952, yielded the equivalent of 10.4 million tons of TNT, a blast 700 times more powerful.\n\nJUST WATCHED North Korea's nuclear tests: A timeline Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH North Korea's nuclear tests: A timeline 01:21\n\nPrevious Security Council resolutions prohibit North Korea from conducting nuclear tests and launching ballistic missiles. After North Korea's test in January, the council imposed a round of sanctions two months later.\n\nThe sanctions included banning Pyongyang from exporting most of its natural resources, prohibiting the supply of aviation fuel and the sale of small arms to North Korea, and requiring the inspection of all North Korean planes and ships carrying cargo abroad.",

The student thought the weapon was fake and tried to reach for it before being shot during the scuffle, Moore said.\n\nLuigi Loizzo, a junior at Loyola, had taken an organic class with Rauf over the summer. He lives just 200 feet where the incident took place, the Sun-Times reports.\n\n“It’s pretty scary that I have to look over my shoulder every time I walk outside,” said Loizzo, 20, of Addison.\n\nLate Saturday morning, a 9-year-old boy was unintended victim of a shooting on the Near West Side, according to police.\n\nThe boy was walking with his father at 11:35 a.m. in the 2500 block of West Adams when a gunman opened fire on a passing black four-door car. The boy was struck “inadvertently” in the lower right leg, police said.\n\nHe was taken to Stroger Hospital in good condition. Police said the shooting likely is gang-related.\n\nThe most recent nonfatal shooting happened early Sunday in the Englewood neighborhood on the South Side.\n\nThe 29-year-old man’s thigh was grazed by a bullet about 4:30 a.m. in the 7500 block of South Union, police said, citing preliminary information. He was treated at the scene.\n\nAbout 12:50 a.m., a woman was shot while driving away from her suspected shooters in the Austin neighborhood on the West Side.\n\nThe woman, 22, was in the driver’s seat of a parked vehicle in the 100 block of North Leclaire when two males–one armed with a gun–approached her about 12:50 a.m., police said.\n\nThe pair told the woman to get out of the vehicle. When she refused and drove off, one of them fired several shots in her direction and struck her in the arm, police said.\n\nShe drove about a half-mile to a gas station near Madison and Cicero, where she called police.\n\nThe woman was taken to Mount Sinai, where her condition had stabilized.\n\nAt least 11 others were injured in shootings since Friday night.\n\nAdditionally, a male was shot and critically wounded by police late Saturday in the Back of the Yards neighborhood on the South Side.\n\nPolice responded to the 4700 block of South Ada for a gang disturbance about 10:50 p.m., said Deputy Chief Carlos Velez, citing preliminary information. Officers saw several people, including a male armed with a handgun, Velez said.\n\nWhen police responded to the scene, one man from the group began running, said Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden. One officer then exited the passenger seat of his squad car and started chasing the man, who is thought to be in his 20s, Camden said.\n\n“The officer repeatedly told him to drop his gun,” Camden said. “Instead, he turns with the gun and points it at the officer. He had no choice but to defend himself. And the officer opened fire.”\n\nThe male was shot three times, Velez said. A handgun was also recovered from the scene, according to Velez.\n\nHe was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he is listed in critical condition, Velez said.\n\n(Source: Sun-Times Media Wire © Chicago Sun-Times 2014.

  "latent_19234": "Republicans in the West Virginia legislature overrode the governor's veto of a contentious right-to-work bill on Friday, delivering another major legislative setback to organized labor.\n\nThe swift override means that a majority of U.S. states now have right-to-work laws, with West Virginia becoming the 26th. Despised by unions, these laws give workers the option to stop paying fees to unions that must still represent them.\n\nDemocrats in the statehouse, as well as Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin (D), opposed the measure. But Republicans control the state legislature and were able to override Tomblin's veto with a simple majority, voting 18-16 in the Senate and 55-43 in the House along party lines. The law will go into effect in May.\n\nThe conservative National Right to Work Committee, which has been instrumental in passing such laws around the country, said it was symbolically important that right-to-work legislation now exists in 26 states.\n\n“While this is a good day, it is not the end of the work to be done,\" the group said in a statement. \"We hope West Virginia’s embrace of workplace freedom will help spur other states to join the Right to Work ranks.\"\n\nNobody in the U.S. can be forced to be a member of a labor union. But where local law allows it, workers in unionized workplaces can be required to pay their union what are known as agency fees, which cover the costs of collective bargaining but not political activities. Since unions must represent all the workers in a unit -- even those who may not want representation -- unions say it's only fair that all workers contribute to the bargaining expenses. (Read The Huffington Post's full explainer on right-to-work laws here.)\n\nBut the rapid spread of right-to-work laws is giving more workers the prerogative to opt out of funding the unions that represent them. First passed in the late 1940s, such laws were long relegated to the South and West, but Republicans have recently managed to get right-to-work laws on the books even in the union-dense Midwest. West Virginia is the fourth state to pass such a law in as many years, following Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nThe blow to West Virginia labor unions on Friday wasn't limited to the right-to-work bill. Republicans also overrode a veto of a bill to repeal the state's prevailing wage law. Long championed by unions, prevailing wage laws require companies bidding on public projects to pay certain minimum wages to the workers they'll employ.\n\nState Sen. Jeffrey Kessler (D), leader of the senate minority, called the pair of moves a \"double-barreled attack\" on West Virginia workers on a \"horrific\" day. Kenny Perdue, president of the West Virginia AFL-CIO union federation, thanked Tomblin for his opposition to the measures in a statement. Perdue said the federation would \"remind\" voters \"which legislators failed them\" come November.\n\nThe percentage of unionized workers in the U.S. has tumbled in recent decades, from more than 30 percent in the 1950s to just 11.1 percent last year. Union density in West Virginia is slightly higher than the national average, at 12.4 percent -- at least for now.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:",
  "latent_19376": "Our cocktail rolodex at The Daily and Saxon + Parole might be the most valuable training tool I’ve ever implemented in a bar. I should admit the idea came from my time working at the Pegu Club where Audrey Saunders had one proudly sitting behind the bar. It was one of those ones you twist around in a circular motion. People were intrigued. I was intrigued. It was brilliant and I remember wondering why more bars didn’t have this incredible tool at their disposal.\n\nThe rolodex doesn’t have to take the form of an actual rolodex. That said, I do enjoy watching our bartenders frantically flicking through each insert on a busy Saturday night, looking for that perfect recipe to recommend to someone looking for a ‘dealer’s choice.’ And this was part of the reason why I implemented this tool, so if someone wanted something ‘off menu,’ we could make something really special and unique.\n\nMy good friend Jeffrey Morgenthaler from Portland’s Clyde Common has something similar but in a book form, with all the house recipes from now and years yonder. He, too, swears by its power and you can indeed read about him raving about this very topic here on his own eponymous website. Every bar in the world should have their house recipes written down somewhere, whether it be in a binder, in a book or in a rolodex. I went the latter route and boy did it take some time.\n\nSure, the sheer banality and tediousness of actually physically cutting out and gluing every single drink is perhaps enough to drive anyone crazy. Where are my minions when I need them? But I chipped away at the task slowly yet consistently on a daily basis. It took a few weeks but what I now have is a lifetime (or at least a career’s worth) of diverse recipes that first and foremost ensures that every one of our bartenders are making drinks to exactly the same specs. Nothing matters to me more than consistency. It’s literally in my job description.\n\nI researched every single classic drink in the rolodex. Some of this was done online, scouring every drinks website and cocktail chat room I could find. I read and re-read dozens of vintage cocktail books. I spoke with other bartenders I respect. I tested and re-tested every drink. At several stages along the way, I wondered if this project would ever actually come to fruition. It was a frustrating yet very worthwhile experience. I learnt a lot.\n\nThis fastidious approach was indeed why it took so long to complete but perhaps why I’m also so proud and protective of it. At the bottom of each recipe is a short one liner on the history of the drink or perhaps what book it was first mentioned in. This at least gives each bartender a small talking point should someone inquire. I also list some tasting notes, where applicable, so again our bartenders can articulate the flavor profile to any guest who asks.\n\nThere still sadly exists those fools out there that like to stump the bartender with their cocktail prowess. Some are bartenders, others are cocktail nerds and budding self-taught home mixologists. The rolodex was in some ways also created to appease these people so that my bartenders were equipped to make almost drink thrown at them. Of course the rolodex doesn’t contain every drink in existence. Far from it and that would be impossible anyway.\n\nIt is very comprehensive, however, and contains a continually growing number of drinks that sits at about 600 right now. When we opened The Daily in April of 2012, people thought I was crazy when I suggested we have a cocktail menu that changes every single day. The rolodex would become the very foundation of our daily operations but also the tool that would uphold our concept of being a bar firmly rooted in obscure classic cocktails.\n\nQuite simply, compiling the cocktail menu at The Daily would be a very time consuming exercise without the rolodex. In that venue, most people now know they can come in and get almost any classic cocktail they ask for. If it’s not in the rolodex (heaven forbid!), then I’ll make sure to find out more about said drink, type up a recipe and make sure it’s in there the next time they’re in.\n\nOur rolodex is constantly evolving and right now I’m actually reviewing every drink, updating or adjusting some specs, adding new drinks and now comes the unenviable task of cutting out each individual drink again and implementing a rolodex into all of our properties. I want people to know that they can walk into any one of our Avroko Hospitality Group venues at any time of night and get a perfectly made drink, no matter how esoteric. Or if they want a drink from one of our past menus, we have a record of it. This is the job of the rolodex.\n\nThese recipes in our rolodex are not definitive and every bartender on earth has ‘their’ way of making a Mojito or Manhattan or Mint Julep. But for those bartenders that work for us, this is the way we do it at our properties, period. If anything, these recipes are the culmination of a career dedicated to making the very best drinks I can. As an example, I’ve tried a Mojito in myriad ways in countless cities. The recipe I have settled on now is one I learnt from Audrey Saunders at the Pegu Club and until anyone makes me a better one, then I’m happy to go through the rest of my life propagating her recipe. Cheers Audrey.\n\nAny customer is welcome to flick through the rolodex whenever they want. I certainly encourage this kind of dialogue. This way they feel like they’re having a drink crafted just for them. Bespoke cocktails if you will. To ensure the rolodex is actually being used by the staff and not sitting there gathering dust, I have one bartender choose a ‘drink of the week’ from the rolodex. We write this in the bar diary on a Monday and have every bartender make that drink at least once over that week, either for a guest or for themselves as their ‘shift’ drink. It just keeps our crew constantly learning. And for me, that constant thirst for knowledge is what keeps many of us inspired every day.\n\nRead more from Hospitality.",
  "latent_19445": "To hear Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton tell it last week, she and her husband have had dirt under their nails and sweat dripping off their collective brow for decades. On the flip side, Mrs. Clinton strongly implied that Donald Trump’s gains were handouts and even ill-gotten.\n\nIn the recent debate, she bagged on The Donald by saying that “he started his business with $14 million borrowed from his father.” At a Tuesday rally, she said, “Bill and I have been blessed. We didn’t come from millionaire families.”\n\nThe potshots beg for a rejoinder and here’s a good place to start: Why is success in America, and passing along that success to your offspring, now so deplorable? Furthermore, when is the last time Mrs. Clinton wasn’t stockpiling money courtesy of the taxpayers?\n\nEd Morrissey of HotAir.com got it right. “Trump made his money in the private sector and built that inheritance into a much larger fortune, even if it’s still a matter of opinion just how large it actually is. Trump built skyscrapers and carried payrolls, employing tens of thousands of people, a point which even those critical of Trump’s business practices would have to concede.”\n\nAnd how, exactly, did the Clintons amass a net worth exceeding $100 million?\n\n“In contrast, Bill and Hillary Clinton have spent decades in the public sector — at the state level since the late 1970s, and at the federal level ever since. One or the other held high federal office from 1993 to 2013, a remarkable 20-year run — and that’s the same period when they made their wealth. Both benefited from astronomical book advances, but their real money came while Hillary served as secretary of state.”\n\nIndeed, from 2009-2012, the couple earned $57.5 million, which as Mr. Morrissey noted was largely due to Mr. Clinton’s speaking endeavors at events tied to entities with business before the State Department.\n\nBut the Clintons’ ability to trade on their public power to grab big paychecks started long before then. Recall that in just 10 months of trading cattle futures in 1978-79, a period that overlapped Mr. Clinton becoming governor of Arkansas, Mrs. Clinton supposedly turned $1,000 into nearly $100,000, despite little trading experience. Nearly 40 years later, that cattle trading still doesn’t pass the smell test.\n\nMrs. Clinton’s insinuation that her own family’s wealth was righteously achieved, while Mr. Trump’s fortune is illegitimate is ridiculous. Directly and indirectly, the Clintons have thrived off taxpayers since the 1970s.\n\nPerhaps Mrs. Clinton should brush up on the whole “glass houses, stone-throwing” idiom.",

  "latent_19825": "It wasn't fancy fancy -- I hadn't exactly been sent a limo -- but for South Korean esports standards, I might as well have arrived by private jet. With half of the greater Gangnam area sprawled underneath me, I looked across Seoul from the 30th floor of the Marriott, sipping a cappuccino from the lavish coffee machine in the Executive Lounge. I was hardly a stranger to interviews with team owners, but most of them were held outside of a small café over $2 cups of takeout Americanos.\n\nBut perhaps for Silicon Valley standards, this place was pretty cheap. I was here to meet Kevin Chou, after all, the owner of KSV eSports who had just bought the world's best Overwatch team: Lunatic-Hai.\n\n\"Kevin is an oddly down-to-earth man,\" Erica from KSV's PR agency had briefed me. \"He travels everywhere by subway and often sticks to cup noodles for meals.\"\n\nWhile I didn't get to verify how frugal he was or what he usually has for dinner, Kevin indeed was less stuffy than most high-ranking executives. We dispensed almost immediately with the business pleasantries and started talking about Overwatch. And although our interview was booked for an hour, it took me only a few minutes to recognize him as a kindred spirit, as a diehard esports fan.\n\n[This interview has been edited for clarity.]\n\nYoung Jae Jeon: Many Western esports organizations have a colorful owner or CEO who is very visible to the public, whereas the opposite is true for South Korean organizations. Will you be at the forefront or in the background of the Overwatch League Seoul team?\n\nKevin Chou: It will change over time. Right now, KSV is only a few months old -- we actually started the company after negotiating the deal with Blizzard. We thought, 'If we land this deal with Blizzard, fantastic, we can jump into esports right now -- if we don't, we can just keep watching the market and jump in when the timing is right.' So when we got the Seoul spot, we put together the company very quickly by calling up a number of people from Kabam and asking them if they would be interested in joining. This is why I need to be at the forefront at this point in time. I'm very, very hands-on on all aspects of business right now.\n\nAs I explained when I first got here, I was very much interested in putting together a strong Korean management team that will be based here in Seoul and play a very public role. So once the hires are made, it will look like I'm playing less of a role. But I'll still be very involved. As I said in my speech [at the launch event], I'm very passionate about this -- I grew up playing video games competitively, and I'm still a player myself, although not a very good one -- so this is a dream come true for me. I like doing what I'm doing right now.\n\nYJJ: Korea and Silicon Valley sounds like a rosy combination on paper, but I don't think this concept was ever really explained in detail. How exactly is KSV planning to bring together the best of these two worlds?\n\nKC: I think the best things in Korea are the coaches, the players, the training programs, and the entire culture around the love and passion for games. I actually was a bit shocked when I learned of the social stigma against games here. Koreans have been the best in the world at esports for a very long time. From my perspective, that's something that a country can be very proud of.\n\nBut I was a bit surprised at how the Korean sports and esports industries weren't really run as businesses. Most teams here aren't aiming to be a world class business like Manchester United or the Yankees or the Warriors or the Lakers. Part of that is because they don't have the right amount of capital, logistics and capability to really build up a global fanbase.\n\nI think the smaller organizations have really done a fantastic job in staying very competitive with a minimal set of resources, but it has always been difficult for them to expand beyond Korea and get global sponsors and build a brand. So that's where we want to bring in the Silicon Valley resources and use it to build a truly global esports company to represent Seoul and Korea.\n\nYJJ: Have you considered other buy-in locations for Overwatch League besides Seoul?\n\nKC: After we finished our city-by-city analysis of all options, I would say that the decision was actually very easy. Everyone on the team settled on Seoul as our No. 1 choice. We did briefly look at several cities in North America, and then considered China for a while, as their market is very large and esports is booming there. But I think it's a bit difficult for Americans to run a business in China. We felt Korea was a much friendlier place to do business in.\n\nYJJ: Was Lunatic-Hai a no-brainer pickup, or were many teams seriously considered?\n\nKC: We did consider several other teams seriously. Having watched a lot of APEX games, I was really impressed by the level of talent in the market overall even before coming to Seoul. But when I got here, I was also really impressed by the different coaching strategies. I expected that the teams would have more or less have the same type of overall philosophy and just differ in terms of in-game strategy and execution. But there were vastly different philosophies across teams regarding how to strategize, how to assemble a roster, how to recruit players -- for example, whether to pick specialists into specific positions or to pick flexible players who can fill multiple roles -- and I was very impressed by all of those different ideas.\n\nI ultimately settled on Lunatic-Hai because I loved their teamwork. When you're building or rebuilding a sports team, it often takes 2+ years to put together a championship roster, even if you start out with a great set of players, because teams need time to work together. Some teams find that magic very quickly, but other teams take a really long time to develop it. And what I found with Lunatic-Hai was a group of very talented players who truly enjoy playing with each other, and a coach who was already working really well with those players.\n\nWhile Lunatic-Hai's championship victories were considered, it wasn't like, 'Oh, we're just going to pick up the championship team.' We strongly considered other teams that hadn't won big trophies. In fact, we went to Lunatic-Hai before the Season 3 finals, and told them that even if they don't win the finals, we would still want to make a deal.\n\nYJJ: Were there any other players or staff you wanted to bring in along with the first six?\n\nKC: No, and we're taking our time at the moment. We're being diligent in thinking about both the strengths and the weaknesses of the core Lunatic-Hai roster that we picked up. There are still weaknesses that we are very aware of, and both the coaches and the owners are having lots of discussions about how we want to build the rest of the roster. Of course, we are also making various adjustments with the team we currently have, and we're eager to see how those work out in our future APEX matches.\n\nYJJ: Should the fans be expecting backups or superstars for the second six?\n\nKC: Overwatch League will have a number of things different from APEX. The most obvious one is that all teams can have up to 12 people on their roster. And it's likely that there will be more substitutions allowed throughout a match compared to what happens in APEX. So all this changes how we think about things. You could literally put together two full rosters.\n\nRight now, every owner will be thinking about whether to put two full teams together and have them train for different maps and scenarios. A team might be really good defending against dive comps, whereas another might be really good playing dive comps. And we have to think about control point maps too -- it's not a secret that we lost all of the control point maps in the APEX finals. And the DPS meta is changing rapidly with the recent patches. So we're thinking about all of these things in the context of what the OWL match structure will be. It's going to be a lot of work, but we're going to put together a good plan.\n\nYJJ: It definitely sounds like you know exactly what you're talking about.\n\nKC: [laughs] I'm telling you, I'm not lying when I say that I'm really, really into it!\n\nYJJ: You also acquired one of the largest fanbases in South Korean esports. What can the fans expect in terms of fan engagement and content?\n\nKC: I know that a lot of players in Korea stream long hours of ranked play because the pay structure in the scene isn't that great and they need supplemental income from their stream. But Overwatch League is going to change that. Even the league's minimum wage allows for a reasonable living, so there will be less pressure to stream for money. I also honestly think that streaming ranked play doesn't really help the player's competitive chances -- it's basically anti-training in several ways. So we're going to make sure that players don't need to stream for money, but still can regularly connect with their fans. I believe that we may do more [in real life] streams, particularly when the team moves halfway across the world.\n\nWe will be producing a lot of shoulder content. The whole team is going to live in another country for a few months representing Seoul -- a lot of moments and stories will come out from that alone. There will be different types of shoulder content, and in general there will be much more content about the team, the players, and their personalities. We're also working very closely with the fan club, which has been supporting Lunatic-Hai long before we joined forces. They gave us a lot of good ideas about how we could connect with the fans. It's going to be fun. We're going to try out a lot of things and try to tell a lot of stories.\n\nYJJ: Lunatic-Hai also commands a huge number of anti-fans, and many of your players have previously professed frustration towards the constant hate. What's your perspective on this issue?\n\nKC: What I've told the players and coaches is that every champion team is going to have anti-fans. The whole point of sports is that there are many people who compete at a world-class level but only one team that wins. And anybody that wins is going to make all of the other teams' fans unhappy. So it's very natural to have anti-fans. If you win a championship, a bunch of people are not going to like you -- that's a fact of life -- and if you read all of that stuff and get emotional about it, you can drive yourself crazy. The easiest way to deal with that is to not pay attention to it and just focus on competition and sportsmanship.\n\nWe will have to deal with that at even higher levels once we start competing in the OWL because it's an international championship. So we need to get into the right mindset right now. And I believe our players are responding well to this challenge.\n\nYJJ: Many fans of competitive Overwatch are concerned for its future. Global viewership has not been too impressive recently, and in Korea, the game itself is rapidly losing ground.\n\nKC: Contenders is going on right now, as is the World Cup, but these events aren't really established, regular competitive circuits -- apart from the unique exception of APEX, there simply isn't any \"real\" formalized competition in Overwatch right now. So I don't think the numbers right now tell us that much about how Overwatch League will do, nor do I think how Overwatch is doing in Korea is representative of how Overwatch is doing across the world.\n\nBlizzard has been putting so much focus on preparing for Overwatch League, and an amazing amount of marketing resources will go into the league. I'm looking forward to how it will generate interest in the game and the scene worldwide. It's also important to remember that competitive Overwatch is still very young and all the storylines are just starting to develop.\n\nYJJ: How do you foresee the future of APEX? As the Korean scene will most likely hemorrhage at least two dozen top players to various teams in the Overwatch League, many domestic viewers are concerned that APEX will turn into a shadow of its former self.\n\nKC: So from a big-picture perspective, I think esports in the past -- and even today for many games -- has been a bottom-up, grassroots thing. You started playing by yourself, then with a friend, then with people of your skill level online, then maybe you won a qualifier, then a tournament, and if you were still doing well, you would think about turning it into an actual career.\n\nBut what Overwatch League represents is a top-down structure -- you have a very successful game, so you find team owners willing to invest in entire ecosystems and build up organizations fully equipped for the long term. And this top-down system can only really work when there's a really strong grassroots scene underneath, like baseball or soccer or football or basketball, where the ladders below the professional level stretch from collegiate sports all the way to little league.\n\nI would love to see APEX become something like what collegiate football is in America -- a real revenue generator with top-tier athletes. I am actually looking forward to investing in APEX and working with many of its teams so that it can continue to be very successful.\n\nYJJ: Do you have any final words for your fans?\n\nKC: Well, I hope that I don't have any fans. [laughs] My job is to put together a great organization for the long term, to build a business that's sustainable, to put together a championship roster, and to invest in the infrastructure they need to succeed. And I hope that people like what I do, but I certainly hope that the fans will be fans of the players, not me. The players are the ones who have to go through all the training and competition. They are the true heroes of what we're doing.\n\nI hope everyone understands how hard the players' jobs are. Every team will go through rough patches every now and then. I hope the fans accept that. As great as a team we're going to put together, we're not going to win every single game. We may not even win the championship even though that's exactly what we're trying to do. But we will do everything we can to represent Seoul well and bring home the global championship.",

  "latent_20153": "Gruesome scenes played out Wednesday morning in footage of the overcrowded hospitals of Arbeen, a suburb east of Damascus. People writhe on the floor screaming, as more and more dead fill the hallways. Doctors and nurses try to revive the victims with onion juice and garlic. They rub onion halves on their skin, pour cold water over them as they twitch uncontrollably.\n\n\"What else can we do? We don't have anything else,\" says Abu Ahmad, a pharmacist who lives in Arbeen. The area has been under the control of the rebels since the beginning of the year and, for the past few months, almost entirely cut off from the outside world by the military forces under Syrian autocrat Bashar Assad. Some 10,000 people still live there.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the death toll in Arbeen was 63. But if what the opposition is reporting turns out to be true, that is only a small sliver of the carnage: Up to 1,300 people were allegedly killed in a toxic gas attack by the Syrian army that day.\n\nShocking videos have been uploaded to YouTube. In them, children are seen to make up a large percentage of the dead. The videos have already had political consequences, as governments around the world reacted with horror. On Wednesday evening, the UN Security Council announced the need for \"clarity\" about the reported use of chemical weapons, but they didn't reach agreement about launching an investigation.\n\nLittle Doubt of Chemical Attack\n\nThe Syrian government has rejected the allegations. But experts agree that the sheer number of photos, videos and eyewitness accounts leave little reasonable doubt that a chemical weapons attack took place. The images out of Syria are \"terrible\" and \"extremely distressing,\" said Alastair Hay of the University of Leeds. Though it's not possible from available footage to confirm exactly what chemical weapons were used, Hays said that the visible symptoms, such as nasal secretions, pronounced difficulty breathing and profuse sweating were consistent with organophosphoric exposure -- \"and nerve agents are potent organophosphates.\"\n\nStefan Mogl, a chemical weapons expert with Spiez Laboratory of the Swiss Federal Office for Civil Protection, says that after viewing the videos he is left with little doubt: \"The combination of symptoms indicates a nerve agent,\" he told SPIEGEL ONLINE (see interview here). Pupil constriction was recognizable on one child, for instance, which is among the first symptoms of nerve gas poisoning, Mogl explains. Then, a certain sequence of symptoms is observable, he continues, \"the way their muscles cramp up, first in various parts of the body, then eventually the entire body starts twitching -- that's a so-called tremor.\" Such a thing would be very difficult to simulate, Mogl says. What's more, many of the victims were children, making it even less likely the scenario could be faked. And the number of people affected by the attack also seems hard to explain by anything other than by the use of chemical weapons.\n\nRegime Likely Behind the Attacks\n\n\"I was in the hospital for hours,\" says pharmacist Abu Ahmad. \"But we had practically nothing to treat the people with -- no more Atropin, which helped in previous situations. Those who don't die immediately are overcome by cramping, and most foam at the mouth. Their eyes roll back in their heads. The skin of the dead turns gray.\"\n\nThere were attempts to use the few remaining smuggling routes to bring Atropin to Arbeen from the outside world, but they were unsuccessful until early afternoon. Atropin is often used as an antidote to nerve agents like Sarin or VX, internationally condemned chemical weapons that the Syrian army is believed to have stored in one of the world's largest arsenals of such substances.\n\nIf eyewitnesses in Arbeen are to be believed, there is much to suggest that regime troops carried out the attack. Pharmacist Abu Ahmad, who is also an Arbeen councilman and volunteer at the emergency hospital, recalls that the first thing he heard on Wednesday morning was a \"boom at the door.\" Outside, someone screamed: \"Get yourselves to safety!\" People panicked because they didn't know where to hide, he says.\n\nAround 5 a.m. the mosques warned that there had been a gas attack, telling people to keep their windows and doors closed. \"At the same time I was called to the hospital,\" Ahmad says. \"The streets were full of smoke because people had lit fires everywhere in hopes of neutralizing the gas -- tires, wood, anything.\" When he arrived at the hospital, some 20 bodies had already been moved aside to make room for other patients. \"Ten others were being treated, mainly children,\" he says.\n\nMaking a Mockery of the West\n\nWitnesses told SPIEGEL ONLINE that the missiles began hitting a number of places northeast of Damascus around 3:45 a.m., with Harasta, Zamalka, Arbeen and smaller villages among them. The missiles were reportedly fired by twos, and one witness in Zamalka counted more than 20 hitting the city.\n\nThe cities of Muadhamija and Darayya, from which the army has been largely driven out, were reportedly among the hardest hit areas in the southwest. The attacks there are believed to have been launched around 5 a.m. from the army's 4th division posts.\n\nIt seems odd that, of all times, the attacks were launched just two days after United Nations chemical weapons experts had arrived to determine whether such weapons had been used in the country. But for Riad Kahwaji, head of the Institute for Near East & Gulf Military Analysis (INEGMA) in Beirut, it comes as no surprise. \"With this timing the Syrian government is sending the opposition a clear signal: 'You're alone and we can do with you what we want.'\"\n\nThe use of chemical weapons in the presence of the UN team also makes a mockery of the international community. Even so, Kahwaji doubts there will be a decisive response from the West. \"The Syrian regime will remain immune to this as long as it is protected by the Russians on the UN Security Council,\" he says.\n\nFurthermore, the UN inspectors have a weak mandate. \"They are only allowed to visit locations chosen by the regime,\" Kahwaji told SPIEGEL ONLINE. \"And they are merely determining whether chemical weapons have been used -- but not who deployed them.\"",
  "latent_20202": "For decades now the SNP have thirsted for the moment when they can be ‘relevant’ to the outcome of a Westminster general election. Well, they have that relevance now. Never before has the launch of their manifesto attracted this kind of attention. Then again, never before has the SNP had realistic hopes of becoming the third largest party in the House of Commons.\n\nBut strength is often just weakness disguised and, once again, more than one thing can be true at the same time. And the truth is that the SNP’s position is both remarkably strong and much weaker than many people assume.\n\nI still don’t believe that the nationalists will win 50 of the 59 seats they are contesting but I concede that my faith in this belief is a little weaker than it was a fortnight ago. It has to be reckoned possible even if not yet probable. I still suspect that the SNP will win a majority of Scottish seats but Labour will cling on to more constituencies than the polls currently suggest.\n\nAs election results go, this one has the potential to be shattering. But, curiously, it may have rather less impact on the next government than is commonly assumed.\n\nEqually unusually, this is an election in which, though they won’t tell you so, the parties actually agree on more than they are letting on. That is, a vote for the SNP is, in the end, a vote for a Labour government. Albeit a vote once-removed. This is the SNP’s great victory in this contest. The only people disputing this are the Scottish Labour party and their reasons for doing so should be obvious to anyone who has paid any attention to this election.\n\nTheir southron colleagues would obviously prefer to see Labour hold on to as many of their Scottish seats as possible but they also recognise, surely, that they may well be able to govern without the presence of many Scottish MPs.\n\nThe Tories, of course, have been playing a double-game, raising the spectre of a Labor government propped-up by SNP support to rile English voters while, at the same time, chuckling about Labour’s Caledonian difficulties because, well, there’s nothing so cheering as your opponent’s distress.\n\nAs for the SNP, well, their entire campaign is based upon their desire to avoid the traditional Westminster squeeze that has limited their gains in the past. They need to defeat the Labour mantra that a vote for the SNP is, in the end, a kind of vote for a Tory government. Persuading voters that this is ultimately a choice between Ed Miliband and David Cameron remains Labour’s best, if these days discounted, card.\n\nWhich, of course, is why Nicola Sturgeon has been so determined to make it clear that a vote for the SNP is a vote for a Labour government, albeit, in some sense, a better Labour government than might otherwise be on offer. (She’s also, of course, pinching as many Labour policies as she can.)\n\nDoubtless it is but the SNP don’t actually want to be in government in London. They want to avoid that complication. For doing so will allow them to run against London in next year’s Scottish parliamentary elections (elections which are, in a constitutional sense, more important than this election).\n\nTrident? Full fiscal autonomy? These are demands that are not supposed to be met. They are, instead, issues designed to give the SNP the opportunity to claim no-one else will ‘stand up for Scotland’. Only the nationalists have the national interest at heart, you see, and it’s just such a damned shame the Unionist parties won’t give Scotland what she wants.\n\nI asked a senior SNP strategist about this recently. What, I wondered, would you do if, say, the Tories offered you full fiscal autonomy? Could you really walk away from that kind of deal? Ah, he said, but if the Tories did that they wouldn’t be behaving like Tories so the problem does not arise because the Tories can’t and won’t do anything of the sort. Besides, they’re the Tories, you see.\n\nIt’s true that this remains an improbable offer, not least because it would have to be made over Ruth Davidson’s head. Nevertheless it also demonstrates the peculiar post-election weakness of the SNP. Because the party has put itself in a position from which it actually has very few options. It has to support Labour.\n\nSure, they SNP will snipe and grumble and try to extract concessions and where these are made they will be happy even as they move on to complain about what Labour aren’t offering. But, still, in the end, they have nowhere else to go.\n\nThey can’t bring down a Labour government. So why should Labour offer them anything at all? After all, even as Labour try to hug the SNP close in Scotland (Patriotic Labour!), so the SNP move to limit their policy differences with Labour. The nationalists want to increase taxes too, now.\n\nLabour can get what they want from the SNP because the Nats have willingly given themselves no other options. At the same time, the SNP can make impossible demands knowing that even though they cannot and will not destroy a Labour government doing so will, in the longer-term, strengthen the SNP’s strategic interests in Scotland.\n\nIt suits both parties, in other words and makes it more clear than ever that David Cameron’s days as Prime Minister are most probably drawing to an end. That’s been evident for some time, however, and, curiously, does not actually depend very much upon the election result north of the border.\n\nAnd if something turns up to keep the Tories in power? Well, in that event the SNP will give a very convincing impersonation of a lachrymose crocodile. What a glorious disaster that will be for their cause.",
  "latent_20269": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R) is coming under fire from the advisers of incoming Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick (R) who insist that a bipartisan effort to improve the state's preschool and kindergarten programs represents a \"socialist\" attempt to expose children to a \"Godless environment,\" MSNBC's Steve Benen reports.\n\nDuring his campaign, Gov. Abbott promised to push hard for state-funded preschool programs, claiming that years of cuts had led to Texas students being behind their peers in other states from the get-go. Democrats like state Representative Justin Rodriguez agreed, telling the San Antonio Express-News' Maria Luisa Cesar that \"I think we're getting past the point where we have to convince folks of the importance of pre-K.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe only issue, Rep. Rodriguez said, would be who exactly would pay for the program. Advisers for newly elected Lt. Gov. Patrick -- who represented themselves as a \"grassroots advisory\" committee -- clearly indicated that they do not believe it should be the tax payers.\n\n\"We are experimenting,\" they wrote, \"at great cost to taxpayers with a program that removes our young children from homes and half-day religious preschools and mothers' day out programs to a Godless environment with only evidence showing absolutely NO LONG-TERM BENEFITS beyond the 1st grade.\"\n\nAny attempt to institute a program, be it initiated by Democrats in the state legislature or Republicans from the governor's office, would be considered \"interference by the state\" -- a \"trampling\" of parental rights. \"The early removal of children from parents' care is historically promoted in socialistic countries, not free societies which respect parental rights.\"\n\nLt. Gov. Patrick did not respond directly, but his spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, told the Associated Press that \"the letter in question was unsolicited and expresses the individual viewpoints of Texas citizens\" -- even if those citizens do work as advisers to Lt. Gov. Patrick.\n\nAs for the governor, his spokeswoman Amelia Chasse said that Gov. Abbott's plan is \"a conservative antidote to ineffective pre-K programs\" and not, as the \"grassroots\" letter suggested, an attempt to indoctrinate impressionable children into a secular, socialist ideology.",
  "latent_20428": "Good news for Kevin Spacey lovers, baseball fans, and Pokémaniacs: cards are the way of the future.\n\nTinder matches users based on a minimal, photo-centric profile (Android, iOS)\n\nIf you’re one of the teeming millions using the dating app Tinder (Android, iOS), then you’re already intimately familiar with the card-swiping system. Interaction with user profiles is as simple as a swipe right for yes, left for no. Would-be suitors fly off the screen akin to flipping through a stack of Polaroids. According to Tinder co-founder and CEO Sean Rad, inspiration for Tinder’s format did in fact come from piles of photos and playing cards.\n\nThe card-based UI updates the classic way in which we’ve always interacted with physical cards. When you think about it, cards are nothing more than bite-size presentations of concrete information. They’re the natural evolution of the newsfeed, which is useful for reading stories but not for making decisions.\n\nThe problem with newsfeeds is one of information overload. When scrolling through an endless list of options, it’s impossible to reach the end. Since there’s no way to review all the possibilities, it robs the user of a sense of finality.\n\nInstead of infinite content rendered useless by its very vastness, cards connect with users via offering only the best possible content, one piece at a time. It’s the ideal UI for making a decision about now.\n\nTinder is far from the only app to make use of a card-swiping interface. Jelly (Android, iOS) uses cards to ask and answer quick queries via your Twitter/Facebook networks. Swell uses cards to personalize streaming audio feeds. Weotta’s card stack is full of activities based on your friend circles. Google Now also uses cards to display information based on what it knows about users’ contexts and profiles.\n\nWe’ve come a long way, baby\n\nCard-swiping: It’s all in the thumb\n\nLooking at data one piece at a time is more efficient when you consider people you might want to date, restaurants, streaming music, or local events you might want to check out.\n\nServices like Netflix (Android, iOS) and iTunes persist in organizing their apps as though they were brick-and-mortar stores. It’s confusing, and there’s far too much crammed into a miniature screen.\n\nWhen you want to watch a movie, you’re likely in the mood for something specific. You might be with other people with their own tastes and movie-watching history. You don’t need to see the entire available selection; you need to see the options that match your current context. Considering them one at a time would let you either eliminate them from the pool of possibilities or file them into a maybe list.\n\nThere are many reasons why this makes for a better user experience:\n\nCognitively, you can only evaluate one option at a time. Seeing all the options laid out in front of you at once is just noisy and distracting, since you’ll have to consider each one in turn anyway. Making swipe-happy snap judgements allows you to make better choices, faster. See Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking for much more on the adaptive unconscious. You can do it one handed.\n\nIt’s all in the thumb.\n\nThat last point is more important than you think. It’s all in the thumb, says mobile expert Luke Wroblewski. Mobile devices are frequently used on-the-go, which drastically increases the probability that you’ll attempt to navigate apps using just one hand, with the key digit being the mighty thumb.\n\nInstead of browsing endless lists for the hidden perfect piece of data — be it the right music for the moment, what to do tonight, or your next potential hookup — card-swiping turns decision making into a highly engaging Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game.\n\nBuilding a better Tinder with Small Data\n\nThe CYOA analogy is an apt one: just like the paper-based gamebooks, every single interaction with card-swiping apps can affect the outcome.\n\nWe can call it small data. Imagine if every time you made a yes or no decision on Tinder, the app learned what kind of profiles you tended to like, and it showed you profiles based on this information in the future.\n\n“With swipes on Tinder, the act of navigating through content is merged with inputting an action on that content,” says Rad. That means that every time a user browses profiles, it generates personal behavioral data.\n\nAt the time of publication of this article, Tinder gets over 800 million swipes per day. That’s more than a few trips through The Cave of Time.\n\nA book is worth 1000 stories (okay, maybe more like 30 or so)\n\nIt isn’t about big data this time, although Tinder and its ilk could certainly draw up interesting speculations based on trends across their userbases. Rather, it’s about using profiles of individual users to cater to their specific preferences based on the ways they use the app.\n\n“Every listen/swipe interaction offers a signal to the algorithm” says Swell co-founder and CEO Ram Ramkumar. “Aggregated across users, the signals form the basis for collaborative filtering.”\n\nIn Swell’s case, it’s filtering news radio stations. Tinder’s dating profiles provide a spicier example.\n\nMaybe it’s as simple as a general preference towards, say, redheads, in which case you’d start seeing a higher percentage of them in the cards. It could easily be more complex: perhaps your matches are similar to another user’s, in which case the app could conclude that you’d probably be interested in the rest of the other person’s matches as well.\n\nIt could even be that you tend to prefer a certain kind of profile at noon, and a wholly different one at night (preppy team captain in the sunshine, badass motopunk at midnight?). This is easy to track, since Tinder reports that many of its users check the app five or six times daily.\n\nHow to fix Foursquare: Anticipatory Computing\n\nPerhaps no app better embodies the question “What should I do right now?” than Foursquare (Android, iOS).\n\nShall I visit the Post-It? Maybe the trophy would make for a better afternoon jaunt\n\nUsers consult Foursquare with queries like “romantic,” “Thai,” or “mojitos.” The app crawls data that’s been entered by its scores of users to match nearby places to your search term, which is a highly useful function in and of itself.\n\nBut how do you discover that tiny boutique around the corner if you don’t know it’s there? How do you and your diverse group of friends find the nearby Irish bar with an enormous beer selection when you’re not sure what to look up in the first place?\n\nTwo words: anticipatory computing.\n\nThat your device can predict what you want to do better than you can might seem like futuristic fantasy, but Foursquare already does this.\n\n“We know about the shapes of places,” says Dennis Crowley, co-founder and CEO of Foursquare. “We know which places are interesting in the morning versus the afternoon, and the seasonality of them. Are they trending up or down? Is it less popular on Wednesdays or Saturdays? What are the brunch places in this neighborhood that your friend has been to that none of your other friends have been to? It’s a really powerful data set.”\n\nThe app harnesses this data to make recommendations to you based on your current context, including location, time of day, and what your friends are up to.\n\nThe logical next step is a card-swiping interface.\n\nThe problems with the Foursquare app will be immediately familiar to its users:\n\nSearch results show up in miniature, displaying little more than a name and rating. Crucial information like location, opening hours, and user comments is hidden from view.\n\nOnce you’ve made your evaluation, you have to navigate back to the long list of search results to continue browsing.\n\nThere is no way to bookmark possibilities during your search.\n\nNow envision a card-swiping system for Foursquare. Actually, you don’t have to: Steven Lehrburger did an incredible job complete with mock-up sketches in his blog.\n\nSay you’re looking for a Japanese place. Imagine the app shows you one place at a time via card format, including all the information you need to make a decision. If it appeals you swipe right to sort it into the maybe pile; if not, you discard it from the list.\n\nYou might have only entered the search term “Japanese,” but with every decision you make, the app learns more about what you are looking for right now. It combines that data with what it knows about your user profile from previous searches or check-ins, and thus gives you more and more relevant cards as you go through the possibilities.\n\nDecision-making is about to get much more impulsive\n\nCard-swiping: Beyond Pokémon\n\nCard-swiping is not quite zero-UI, as predicted in The Future of Listening to Music — but it is streamlined, organized, high engagement interaction that generates meaningful data that is useful, immediately. A card-swiping interface not only means an improved user experience, but also that apps can collect massive amounts of small data.\n\nYour results are about to become more tailored to you over time. Maybe then you’ll finally find that ideal redhead on Tinder.",

Due to the overwhelming amount of choices and story paths, I can only put ONE kind of flow that makes the whole story, while the rest of the scripts should be explored by yourself; I don't really have THAT much of a free time -- and honestly -- I can't figure out an effective way to chart out the all-confusing \"SCUMM\" story system as to make it an easy read.

Guybrush : Hi! My name's Guybrush Threepwood, and I want to be a pirate! Old Man : Yikes! Don't sneak up on me like that! Guybrush : Er... I'm over this way. Old Man : Ah! Well, then, Triftweed-- Guybrush : THREEPWOOD. Guybrush THREEPWOOD. Old Man : I see. So, you want to be a pirate, eh? You look more like a flooring inspector. But if you're serious about pirating, go talk to the pirate leaders. You'll find them in the Scumm Bar. Guybrush : Gosh, thanks! I'll do that! Bye, now. I'm off to seek my fortune. Old Man : Good luck. Guybrush : (walks away, but suddenly stops) Um... Where did you say those pirate leaders were? Old Man : The SCUMM BAR. Guybrush : Right. Thanks. (leaves the screen) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Part One: The Three Trials ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Guybrush walks down the dock. Eventually, he finds the Scumm Bar and enters. Then he talks to the pirate nearby the door. Pirate : Ahoy there, stranger. New in town? Guybrush : My name's Guybrush Threepwood. I'm new in town. Pirate : Guybrush Threepwood? Ha ha ha!!! That's the stupidest name I've ever heard! Guybrush : I don't know... I kind of like 'Guybrush.' Pirate : But it's not even a name! Guybrush : Well, what's YOUR name? Pirate : My name is Mancomb Seepgood. So, what brings you to Mêlée Island anyway? Guybrush : I want to be a pirate! Mancomb : Oh, really? You should go talk to the important-looking pirates in the next room. They're pretty much in charge around here. They can tell you where to go and what to do. Guybrush : Where can I find the Governor? Mancomb : Governor Marley? Her mansion is on the other side of town. But pirates aren't as welcome around her place as they used to be. Guybrush : Why not? Mancomb : Well, the last time she had a pirate over for dinner, he fell in love with her. It's made things rather uncomfortable for everybody. Guybrush : How's that? Mancomb : Well, there's a whole big story about what happened next... But I don't believe a word of it. Estevan over there at the other table might tell you about it. He takes the whole thing seriously. VERY seriously. Uh-oh, it looks like my grog is going flat, so you'll have to excuse me. Nice talking to you. Have fun on Mêlée Island. Guybrush walks off and talks to Estevan, who has a scar on his face. Estevan : What are you looking at me for? Guybrush : I'd like to introduce myself... my name's Guybrush. Estevan : Yeah, so what? Guybrush : Who's this pirate that's bugging the Governor? Estevan : LeChuck? He's the guy that went to the Governor's for dinner and never wanted to leave. He fell for her in a big way, but she told him to drop dead. So he did. Then things really got ugly. Guybrush : What's so scary about this LeChuck guy? Estevan : LeChuck was a fearsome pirate. He tried to impress the Governor by sailing off to find the Secret of Monkey Island™. But a mysterious came up and sank his ship, leaving no survivors. We thought that was the end of the fearsome pirate LeChuck. We were wrong. Guybrush : What happened then? Estevan : He still sails the waters between here and Monkey Island™. His ghost ship is an unholy terror upon the sea. That's why we're all in here and not out pirating. Guybrush : What happened to your eye? Estevan : Well, I was putting in my contact lens when--Hey, wait a second! That's none of your business! Guybrush : Excuse me, but I'm looking for the dart board. Estevan : Dart board? We don't have one anymore. There was a horrible accident. Drinking and darts don't mix. Guybrush : Where can I get a drink? Estevan : A drink? You could wait for the cook to notice you... but that could take all day. Just find a mug and sneak into the kitchen. That's what we all do. Look, this whole LeChuck thing has me pretty shaken up. So if you don't mind... Guybrush leaves and talks to another pirate, a bald one with funny hat. The pirate has an \"Ask me about LOOM\" badge on his clothes. Pirate : Aye! Guybrush : Aye, yourself. Pirate : Aye. Guybrush : Nice hat. Pirate : Aye. Guybrush : So, tell me about LOOM. Pirate : (Face brightens) (\"<ADVERTISEMENT>\" text blinks down the screen) You mean the latest masterpiece of fantasy storytelling from Lucasfilm's™ Brian Moriarty™? Why it's an extraordinary adventure with an interface on magic... stunning, high-resolution, 3D landscapes... sophisticated score and musical effects. Not to mention the detailed animation and special effects, elegant point 'n' click control of characters, objects, and magic spells. Beat the rush! Go out and buy Loom™ today! Guybrush : Geeze, what an obvious sales pitch. Pirate : Sorry, but on some topics I just get carried away. Guybrush : Nice talking to you. Pirate : Aye. Guybrush approaches a dog and, whew, talks to it too. Dog : Grrrrrrrr. Guybrush : Woof. Dog : WOOF? Aruff roof! Woof-woof arf woof... ...warroof, Mêlée Island™! ...a-roof wuf: ...LeChuck! Grrrrrrr! Guybrush : Wuf, 'LeChuck?' Dog : Worf woof woof ruff-ruff... Wor-roof wuf? Ruff arf-arf, bow-ruff... ...Governor Marley! A-OOOOOOO! A-OOOOOOO! (ruff ruff ruff) Bow-roo wuf rowwf-- --Arrooof-- --LeChuck! GRRRRRRRRR! Arf, oof-oof, Monkey Island™! *sniff* *sniff* Guybrush leaves to the next screen and talks to the important-looking pirates. Green P. : What be ye wantin' boy? Guybrush : I want to be a fireman. Blue P. : Get lost, boy, you bother us. Guybrush : I mean to kill you all! Blue P. : Get lost, boy, you bother us. Guybrush : I want to be a pirate. Blue P. : So what? Green P. : Why bother us? Black P. : Hey, don't forget we're short on help because of this whole LeChuck thing. Blue P. : So? Black P. : So, no pirates means no swag, and no swag means no grog, and we're getting dangerously low on grog... Blue P. : Hmm... Do you have any special skills? Guybrush : I can hold my breath for ten minutes! Blue P. : Well... All right, but you don't become a pirate just by ASKING. Black P. : You'll have to go through... All : The three trials! Guybrush : Er... What three trials are those? Green P. : There are three trials every pirate must pass. Blue P. : You must master the sword... Green P. : ...and the art of thievery... Black P. : ...and the quest. Green P. : The what? Black P. : Treasure huntin', ya sea urchin! Green P. : Right. You must prove yourself in each of these three areas: swordplay, thievery, and, er, treasure huntery; then return with proof that you've done it. Blue P. : And then ye must drink grog with us!! All : GROG!!! Guybrush : Tell me more about mastering the sword. Blue P. : First, get ye a sword. You must seek out and defeat the Sword Master. Someone in town can probably direct you. Oh! You'll want to find someone to train you first. Black P. : Ha ha. Imagine trying to take on the Sword Master without any training! All : Har Har Har Guybrush : Tell me more about mastering the art of thievery. Green P. : We want you to procure a small item for us... Blue P. : The Idol of Many Hands... Black P. : In the Governor's Mansion! Green P. : The Governor keeps the Idol o' Many Hands in a display case in the mansion outside the town. Blue P. : You'll have to get past the guards, naturally. Black P. : The tricky part will be getting past the dogs outside. Blue P. : They're a particularly vicious breed... ...you might be able to drug them or something. Guybrush : Tell me more about treasure hunting. Black P. : Legend has it that there's a treasure buried here on the island... Blue P. : All you must do is find the Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island™ and bring it back here. Guybrush : Should I have a map or something? Blue P. : Ye can hardly expect to find a treasure without a map! Green P. : ...and don't forget: X marks the spot! All : Har Har Har Guybrush : You're a bunch of foul-smelling, grog-swilling pigs! Blue P. : To be a pirate ye must also be a foul-smelling, grog-swilling pig. Guybrush : What's in that grog stuff, anyway? Green P. : Grog is a secret mixture which contains one or more of the following: Blue P. : kerosene Green P. : propylene glycol Black P. : artificial sweeteners Blue P. : sulphuric acid Green P. : rum Black P. : acetone Blue P. : red dye #2 Green P. : scumm Black P. : axle grease Blue P. : battery acid Green P. : and/or pepperoni As you can probably imagine, it's one of the most caustic, volatile substances known to man. Blue P. : The stuff eats right through these mugs and the cook is losing a fortune replacing them. All : Har Har Har Guybrush : I'll just be running along now. Blue P. : Leave us to our grog. Green P. : Come back later and tell us how ye're doing. Ready for the first quest on swordmastery, Guybrush sneaks into the kitchen while the cook is busy serving the pirates and doesn't notice. In there, he picks a hunk of meat, a pot, and a fish after tricking out a bird who's also interested with the poor creature. He puts the meat into the pot o' stew and picks up a stewed meat. Having nothing else to plunder, Guybrush goes outside the bar and into the town. Meanwhile... Deep beneath Monkey Island, the ghost pirate LeChuck's ship lies anchored in a river of lava. LeChuck is standing on his room while a bone pirate approaches. Bone : Captain LeChuck...sir...I... LeChuck : Ah... There's nothin' like the hot winds of hell blowin' in your face. Bone : No sir... Nothing like it... Ah... Sir... I... LeChuck : (turns around) It's days like this that makes you glad to be dead. Bone : Oh yes sir...glad to be dead... LeChuck : Ye are glad to be dead, RIGHT? Bone : Oh yes sir. I feel so lucky that you happened to capture my ship, then murdered me and everyone on board... ...yes sir... lucky. LeChuck : Glad to hear it. Now what was it you disturbed me for? Bone : Ah...yes sir...well, you see, we might have a problem on Mêlée Island™. LeChuck : PROBLEM?!? What possible problem could there be!? I've got those sissy pirates so scared of the sea they're afraid to take a bath! Bone : Well... There seems to be a new pirate in town. Actually, he's a pirate wannabe. Young. Inexperienced. Probably nothing to worry 'bout. Don't know why I bothered you with it. I'll have him taken care of myself. (about to leave) LeChuck : Wait! I'll handle this personally. My plans are too important to be messed up by amateurs. Bone : Yes sir. The screen switches back to Guybrush, who walks through the archway and talks to the Citizen of Mêlée. Citizen : Excuse me, but do you have a cousing named Sven? Guybrush : No, but I once had a barber named Dominique. Citizen : Close enough. Let's talk business. You want to buy a map to the Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island™? Only one in existence. Rare. Very rare. Only 100 pieces of eight... Guybrush : No thanks. I don't have enough money. Citizen : Well then, buzz off kid, it's bad for business. Guybrush then approaches the gang of pirates on the other corner. They are the pirate sitting on a barrel, a fat one, and a tall one. There's a rat in front of them. Guybrush : Hey, nice rat! Barrel P.: Do you like rats? Guybrush : Yes, I love rats! Barrel P.: They're very intelligent creatures! Fat P. : Ha ha ha ha!! Tall P. : (hits Fat P. on the head) Fat P. : -- dpk -- Barrel P.: More intelligent than HIM. Why, there's a story around these parts that a bunch of rats actually crewed a ship here from fabled Monkey Island™. Tall P. : No, that's not right. It was actually a group of monkeys. Guybrush : That's amazing! Tall P. : But true. When they arrived, they sold the ship for a pretty penny. Only time I've seen anyone get the better of ol' Stan in a deal. Barrel P.: I thought it was rats... Guybrush : Do you guys know the sneaky-looking man on the opposite corner? Tall P. : Wanna buy a map, eh? OUR maps are top quality, not like the birdcage liners you get from that clown across the street. (looks around) Fat P. : (laughs) Tall P. : No, just kidding. These are actually copies of the minutes of the last meeting of the Mêlée Island™ PTA. Can't even GIVE them away. (hits Fat Pirate on the head) Fat P. : -- tdk -- Tall P. : Want one? Guybrush : No, but I'll take one if you give me two pieces of eight. Tall P. : OK, that's fair. Guybrush receives the minutes and 2 pieces of eight. Guybrush : Say, are you guys pirates? Tall P. : No, we're a wandering circus troupe. Fat P. : (Laughs) Barrel P.: But this rat scared away the elephant. Tall P. : Shut up! (hits Fat Pirate on the head) Fat P. : -- yqk -- Tall P. : Of course we're pirates! You can't buy clothes like these off the rack! Barrel P.: What do you want? Guybrush : What's in the keg? Tall P. : Jam Barrel P. : Rum Tall P : Rum Barrel P. : Jam Tall P. : Er... rum and jam. It's an old pirate favorite, everybody knows that. Guybrush : I'm really interested in this pirating thing. Barrel P.: What do you want? Guybrush : How come you're on this street corner and not on a ship, looting, pillaging, sacking, that sort of thing? Tall P. : Well, pirating hasn't been panning out so well for us... Barrel P.: There are some UNNATURALLY talented pirates in the area right now... Tall P. : Operating out of Monkey Island™. Barrel P.: So we've been pursuing alternate means of self-support. We're trying to start up a circus. Tall P. : It was working out well, until the rat scared off the elephant. (looking around, nobody laughs) Now you've depressed us. Go home. As Guybrush enters a house, he picks up a chicken thing from the table. Guybrush : Maybe no one will miss just this one thing. Then, he goes in and meets with the Voodoo Lady. Lady : What may I help you with, son? Guybrush : (How much for this keen-looking chicken?) Lady : Aah... I sense the guilt of stealing my chicken grows. Take it. It's yours. Guybrush : Why don't you want it? Is it jinxed with an ancient voodoo curse? Lady : No... the pulley squeaks. Guybrush : (My name is Guybrush Threepwood and I'm a mighty pirate.) Lady : Wait... ...don't say anything. I can sense your name is... ...is... ...Guybrush... ...Guybrush Nosehair. No... ...Threepwood. Guybrush Threepwood. Am I not right? Guybrush : Lucky guess. Half the people I know are named Guybrush. Lady : I suggest you open your mind. It will help you in your coming journey. Guybrush : Journey? What can you tell me about my journey? Lady : I am getting a vision... ...I see you taking a voyage, a long voyage. I see you captaining a ship. Guybrush : Yeah! Lady : I see... Guybrush : What? See what? Lady : I see a giant monkey. Guybrush : Yikes! Lady : I see you inside the giant monkey. Guybrush : Gross. Lady : Wait... it is all becoming clear. Your journey will have many parts. You will see things better left unseen. You will hear things better left unheard. You will learn things better left unlearned. Guybrush : What kind of things? I hate surprises. Lady : NO! The time is not right to know. When you know your purpose, come see me... ...I will let you know then. (suddenly disappears) Guybrush : Yikes! As he explores to the next town part, a weird whisper is heard. Whisper : Pssssst. Guybrush walks into the alley, from which the whisper seems to come. Guybrush : Hello? Anybody in here? HELLO??? Person : (sneaking up from behind) You know, bad things could happen to a person in a dark, deserted alley like this one. And at this time of night, nobody would be around to see it. Guybrush : Yeah, and bad things happen to people who sneak up on other people from behind. Person : So, you're going to give me a little attitude, eh? I'd better get your name. Guybrush : I'm Guybrush Threepwood, and I'm a mighty pirate. Person : Listen Peepwood-- Guybrush : Threepwood! Guybrush Threepwood! Person : Whatever your name is, listen: I'm the sheriff around here. Sheriff Fester Shinetop. Take it from me--This is a bad time to be visiting Mêlée Island™. A very BAD time. My advice to you is to find somewhere else to take your vacation. (walks away) Somewhere safer. (leaves) Guybrush : Boy, I feel much better knowing there's an officer of the law around. Guybrush walks into what seemed to be the town's jail. He talks to a man held in one of the cell. Man : You gotta get me out of here! I'm a victim of society. Guybrush : Not to mention halitosis. (walks away) Yuck! Man : Hey, it's hard to keep my breath minty-fresh when there's nothing to eat in here but rats. Next, Guybrush attempts to do something with the death-breath prisoner, so he walks to the shop to find something that may be of a help. Strkeeper: Ahoy there, fancy pants. Waddya want? Guybrush : I could really use a breath mint. Strkeeper: You're telling me! Here take one... ...please. Take a whole roll! That'll be one piece of eight. Guybrush : (gives the money) Strkeeper: What else do you want? Guybrush : I think I'd just like to browse. Strkeeper: Okay, but don't put your lips on anything. Guybrush returns to the prisoner and hands the breath mints. Man : Ooooh! Grog-o-Mint! How refreshing! Thanks. So, have you come to release me? Guybrush : Who are you? Man : My name is Otis. At least, I think it is. I've been in here so long I can hardly remember. You've got to get me out of here before I lose my mind completely! Can't you see I'm innocent? Guybrush : But why are you in jail, if you're innocent? Otis : I was framed! I didn't touch the stupid flowers! Guybrush : What flowers? Otis : The yellow Caniche Endormi flowers in the forest--It's against the law to pick them. Guybrush : Can I get you anything? Otis : Yes... YOU CAN GET ME OUT OF HERE! Actually, something to get rid of these rats would be nice. I'd trade you this carrot cake my Aunt Tillie made. I hate carrot cake. Guybrush : So, how's the food in there? Otis : Oh, you know, the usual... Slop, grog, gruel... Rats, bugs, and body lice if I can catch them. I have a carrot cake my Aunt Tillie made, even though she knows I detest carrot cake. Actually, the cook at the bar is an old friend of mine, and sometimes he sneaks me food. Like pork trimmings--mostly feet and lips--but once in a while... ...he brings this really odd rump roast... Guybrush : What was so odd about the rump roast? Otis : Well, it's the only rump roast I've ever seen with a prehensile tail. Guybrush : Sheriff Shinetop sure is a jerk, isn't he? Otis : No kidding. Fester Shinetop is the meanest man on Mêlée Island™. Luckily, the Governor keeps him in check most of the time. We used to have a fair, decent man for a sheriff--but he recently died under mysterious circumstances. If you aske me, I think the new sheriff had something to do with it. Suddenly, the sheriff appears. Sheriff : I think you've said enough, Otis! Otis : Whoops. (leaves) Sheriff : I hope you haven't been taking this filthy vagrant too seriously. He'd say anything to avoid paying his debt to society. Guybrush : He IS filthy. And he smells bad too. Otis : Hey, thanks a lot. Sheriff : You've got a lot of nerve coming into this town and passing judgement on the locals. If there's something you don't like about the way we smell, you're welcome to leave anytime. Guybrush : Sorry. Sheriff : Look, I don't know what you're up to... ...but whatever it is, it's probably illegal. So forget it. (leaves) Wherever you go on Mêlée™, I'll be watching. And if you try any monkey business, you'll end up in here for good. The Sheriff leaves. Otis : Man, is he a pill or what. You see what I have to put up with? You'd better go before you get us both in trouble. Guybrush leaves completely off of the town and wanders to a place in the map called a \"clearing\". There appears to be a circus tent down there, and he attempts to enter. Inside... Man 1 : I'd get in the cannon, but the gunpowder makes me sneeze. Man 2 : Well, I can't do it, I hurt my hand taming the lion last week. Man 1 : I hardly think that little scratch compares to my chronic allergy. You get in the cannon. Man 2 : You don't have any allergies, you faker. YOU get in the cannon. Man 1 : No, YOU get in the cannon! Man 2 : No, YOU get in the cannon! Man 1 : Slacker! Man 2 : Loser! Man 1 : Ruffian! Man 2 : Fop! Man 1 : Weasel! Man 2 : Weevil! Man 1 : Miscreant! Man 2 : Toady! Man 1 : Ne'er-do-well! Man 2 : Scofflaw! Man 1 : Mullet-head! Man 2 : Millet-head! Man 1 : Pencil-head! Man 2 : Half-head! Man 1 : Cheese-head! Man 2 : Harpy! Man 1 : What? Man 2 : Just get in the cannon! Man 1 : No, YOU get in the cannon! Man 2 : No, YOU get in the cannon! Man 1 : Your mother wears combat slippers! Man 2 : Leave our mother out of it! Get in the cannon! Man 1 : No, YOU get in the cannon! Man 2 : No, YOU get in the cannon! Man 1 : You're a chicken! Man 2 : You're a dead chicken! Man 1 : Well, you're a dead chicken with a pulley in the middle! Man 2 : What? Man 1 : Just get in the cannon. Man 2 : No, YOU get in the cannon! Man 1 : No, YOU get in the cannon! Guybrush : (interrupts) Why are you guys dressed up in those ridiculous outfits? The two men suddenly approaches in an amazing pace. Man 1 : Say there, son, how'd you like a chance-- Man 2 : --A once in a lifetime chance-- Man 1 : --To perform an amazing feat-- Man 2 : --A death-defying feat-- Man 1 : --Well, not so death-defying, really-- Man 2 : --A dangerous feat-- Man 1 : --No, not dangerous at all-- Man 2 : --An easy feat-- Man 1 : --But exciting!-- Man 2 : --With the Amazing-- Man 1 : --Adventurous, Acrobatic-- Man 2 : --And Exceedingly Well-Known-- Man 1 : --Fabulous, Flying-- Man 2 : --Fettucini Brothers! Man 1 : That's us. Man 2 : My brother Alfredo... Alfredo : And my brother Bill. Bill : Sound good? Alfredo : Good. Bill : It's very simple, really. Alfredo : See that cannon over there? All you have to do-- Bill : --Is get in the cannon-- Alfredo : --And we'll shoot you out of it-- Bill : --Across the room-- Alfredo : --Quite safe, actually-- Bill : --So, what do you say? Guybrush : How much will you pay me? Alfredo : How about 478 pieces of eight? Guybrush : OK, sounds good. Alfredo : Have you got a helmet? Guybrush : Er... no, I don't have a helmet. Will I need one? Bill : No helmet? Alfredo : Oh, you've got to have a helmet-- Bill : --Can't do the cannon trick without a helmet-- Alfredo : --Nosiree! Bill : Go get a helmet, and then we can do the trick. Guybrush leaves, but returns again as he actually does have some sort of, euh, helm-thing in his inventory. Alfredo : Have you got a helmet? Guybrush : Of course I have a helmet. What sort of idiot do you take me for? Bill : Well, let's have it. Alfredo : We want to be sure-- Bill : --That it's safe-- Alfredo : --Wouldn't want you hurt-- Bill : --Nosiree! Guybrush shows the brothers the pot he acquired earlier from the bar. Bill : Ah, that will work as a helmet! Alfredo : Now we can do the trick. Bill : Step right over here, son. They all walk to the cannon. Alfredo : Now, put on your helmet-- Bill : --and get in the cannon-- Alfredo : --and we'll take care of the rest. Guybrush : (talks into the cannon) ECHO echo (wears the helmet and gets into the cannon) In a second, the cannon bursts, throwing Guybrush across the room--smacking him right onto the wooden pillar supporting the tent from the inside. Alfredo : It works! Bill : I'm so relieved! The two brothers approach the still-upside-down Guybrush. Alfredo : Hey... Bill : Are you OK? Guybrush : (written--err, spoken--in upside-down words) I'm Bobbin. Are you my mother? Alfredo : He's all right! Bill : Hooray! We are spared an embarassing and financially debilitating lawsuit! Alfredo : Here's your money, sir. Bill : Just recompense for aiding us. We just need to change the aim a bit. Alfredo : I'll try it next! Bill : No, I'LL do it next! Alfredo : No, me! Bill : No, ME! Alfredo : Slacker! Bill : Loser! Alfredo : Ruffian! Bill : Fop! Guybrush leaves the circus. Now, with the money in hand, he returns to the shop to get some stuff. Strkeeper: Ahoy there, fancy pants. Guybrush : (Picks the sword and the shovel) Strkeeper: Are you waiting for me to fall asleep or something? Guybrush : (Approaches the storekeeper) Strkeeper: Waddya want? Guybrush : About this sword... Strkeeper: What about it? Guybrush : How much is it? Strkeeper: That's 100 pieces of eight. Take it or leave it. Guybrush : I'll take it. Strkeeper: Great. Best 100 pieces of eight you ever spent. What else do you want? Guybrush : I'd like some rat repellent, please. Strkeeper: Hah! I'll bet you would. But I haven't got any. What else do you want? Guybrush : About this shovel... Strkeeper: What about it? Guybrush : How much is it? Strkeeper: Another would-be treasure hunter, eh? That'll cost you 75 pieces of eight. Guybrush : I'll take it. Strkeeper: Great. It'll pay for itself, believe me. You'll dig up 75 pieces of eight in no time. But hey, save some treasure for the rest of us, would ya? Ha ha ha! What else do you want? Guybrush : I think I'd just like to browse. Strkeeper: Be my guest, fancy pants. Having the sword in hand, Guybrush seeks some form of training that would prepare him against the Sword Master. He goes out of the town and to the bridge. There, he sees a Troll guarding the bridge. Troll : NONE SHALL PASS!! Guybrush talks to it. Troll : STOP!! You must pay a toll! Guybrush : Look behind you! A mouse! Troll : I'm not falling for that! Scuttle along, you scurvy sea slug! Guybrush talks to it again. Troll : You can't pass until you pay the toll! Guybrush : Stand aside, troll, I'm a mighty pirate. Troll : You're no pirate! Why, the town drunk could out-insult you on his back. (...and probably would.) Guybrush : I can out-insult anybody, you brainless clay doppelganger! Troll : I once owned a dog that was smarter than you. Take THAT and stick it in your repertoire! Guybrush talks to it, again. Troll : You can't pass until you pay the toll! Guybrush : Oh, please, can't I pass? Troll : Boy, do you sound like a wimp. I don't like wimps. Guybrush talks to it, yet again. Troll : You can't pass until you pay the toll! Guybrush : How much is the toll? Troll : Well, what have you got? Guybrush : A rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle? Troll : I want something that will attract attention, but have no real importance. Guybrush : My old moss-covered three-handled family credenza? Troll : Don't be silly. You have three chances to give me what I want. Then... ...I eat ya! Guybrush talks to it again. Troll : You can't pass until you pay the toll! Guybrush : How much did you say the toll was? Troll : I want something that will attract attention, but have no real importance. Guybrush picks up the fish he recently grabbed and gives it to the troll. Troll : Ah! A red herring! Pass. Guybrush : (walks through the bridge) When Guybrush isn't looking, the troll throws its club and opens up its head-- it appears to be a costume worn by someone looking real close to that of George Lucas. The man eats the fish and puts his mask back again, right before Guybrush turns around. Guybrush walks to a house by the end of the island. He looks at the sign. Guybrush : Captain Smirk's Big Body Pirate Gym Prices: Sword Training 30 pieces o' eight Cannon Firing 160 pieces o' eight (balls extra) Grappling Hook 130 pieces o' eight (hook extra) Realizing this should be the place to get the training thing, Guybrush goes to the door. Guybrush : I think I'll knock. It'd only be polite. The door opens, and some tough-looking guy appears. Guy : What do you want, you wimpy little spineless maggot? Guybrush : Um, could you please put out that cigar? It's not good for your health, and it smells terrible. Guy : Sure, I'd love to put it out... ...in your face! Guybrush : Uh... ...maybe I'll just leave instead. Guy : Good idea. The guy goes into the door, but Guybrush knocks it again. Captain Smirk appears again. Smirk : What do you want? Guybrush : Do you know where the Sword Master lives? Smirk : Forget it, kid. She'd cut your head clean off. Unless, of course, you got some training first... Guybrush : Can we step inside? It's a little chilly out here. Smirk : What did you say? Guybrush : I said it's a little chilly out here! Smirk : Hmmm... You're right. I could catch a cold. The guy returns back into the house. Guybrush calls him up again. Smirk : What do you want? Guybrush : Could you train me to be better than the Sword Master? Smirk : Better than the Sword Master? You? Ha ha ha! You could never be HALF the sword fighter Carla is. Even with hours of hard work and sweatin' blood. I remember fighting side-by-side with Carla at Port Royal... ...the local constabulary had us cornered! It looked like we were done for, but then she said-- --but I digress... You just don't have what it takes. Guybrush : I do so have what it takes! Smirk : You do not! Guybrush : I do so! Smirk : You do not! Guybrush : I do so! Smirk : I like your spirit. I'll do what I can. Of course... ...it'll cost you. What have you got? Guybrush : All I have is this dead chicken. Smirk : That isn't one of those rubber chickens with a pulley in the middle is it? I've already got one. What ELSE have you got? Guybrush : I figured you'd do it for free. Smirk : Well, you figured wrong. What ELSE have you got? Guybrush : I've got 30 pieces of eight. Smirk : Say no more, say no more. Let's see your sword. Guybrush : I do have this deadly-looking chicken. Smirk : Yes, swinging a rubber chicken with big metal pulley in it can be quite dangerous... ...BUT IT'S NOT A SWORD!!! Let's see your sword. Guybrush : OK, check it out. (shows the sword) Smirk : Yes, this is a nice one. Let's get to it. They both enter the house, to what seems to be a training room. Smirk : OK, ya maggot... ...why don't you whip that sword out and let's see what you can do with it. Guybrush funnily swings the sword here and away. Smirk : Boy! You fight like a dairy farmer! I usually don't waste my time with vermin like yourself. But seeing as this LeChuck thing has put a cramp on business, I've got no choice... ...I need the money. Guybrush : (still swinging the sword) Smirk : Yes... ...I can see this is going to take some special measures. Just want you to know... ...I don't do this with everyone. It's only because I feel that special... ...student/mentor/pieces-of-eight bonding... ...that I'm going to these lengths. I'm going to put you up against... ...THE MACHINE. Guybrush : Machine? Is this going to hurt? Captain Smirk walks away, only to return with his odd looking machine. Guybrush : Yikes! Smirk : Come at me. Don't be afraid, you won't hurt me. Use your forte against the foible. Distance, distance! No, beat first, then lunge. Use your forte against the foible. Hours later... Smirk : You're starting to get the hang of it. More hours later... Smirk : Not bad. You've got good form. Now I'm gonna let you in on the true secret of sword fighting. Sword fighting is kinda like making love. It's not always what you do, but what you say. Any fool pirate can swing a sharp piece of metal around and hope to cut something... ...but the pros... ...they know just when to cut their opponent with an insult... ...one that catches 'em off guard. You see, kid, your wit's got to be twice as sharp as your sword. Let's try a couple of insults out, shall we? Okay... ...imagine this: We're fighting up a storm... ...just like Carla and I were doing at Port Royal. There's a sudden break in the fighting and I say to you... ...'You fight like a dairy farmer.' You respond with? Guybrush : You must be thinking of someone else, I am not a farmer. Smirk : I can see we've got a lot of work to do here. You should have responded with something like... ...'How appropriate. You fight like a cow.' You see... It's razor-sharp wit like that that wins fights. Let's try another. Imagine this: You're trapped up against a wall... ...my sword just slashed two cuts into your face. I say... ...'Soon you'll be wearing my sword like a shish-kabob!' You respond with? Guybrush : How appropriate. You fight like a cow. Smirk : No! No! No! That was the response from the last insult. <sigh> A correct response to... ...'Soon you'll be wearing my sword like a shish-kabob!'... ...would have been something like... ...'First you'd better stop waving it around like a feather-duster.' See... ...razor-sharp! Now I suggest you go out there and learn some insults. Outside... Guybrush : I can't help but feel like I've been ripped off. I'm sure you're feeling something similar. So, now Guybrush takes the chance to halt some pirates and challenges them into an insult-sword fight. Pirate : Aye! This better be importan'. Guybrush : Nice night we're having, isn't it? Pirate : I sure hopes ya had sumpting more importan' ta stop me for? Guybrush : How do you guys talk so funny? Pirate : Pirate Lingo! It's how everybody talked back then. Come on Guybrush, play along. Guybrush : My name is Guybrush Threepwood. Prepare to die! After some other fights... Pirate : Aye! This better be importan'. Guybrush : Ever notice how all these roads start to look the same? Pirate : Yeah! Now that you mention it, they do. It's probably just that we're tired. Guybrush : My name is Guybrush Threepwood. Prepare to die! Eventually, our hero learns a whole bunch of insults and their counters, and manages to defeat the lesser pirates. Pirate : Wow! You're good enough to fight the Sword Master. Now that he is strong enough, Guybrush goes to the shop in the village, where the storekeeper seems to know a bit more about the mysterious Sword Master. Strkeeper: Ahoy there, fancy pants. Waddya want? Guybrush : I'm looking for the Sword Master of Mêlée Island™. Strkeeper: The Sword Master of Mêlée Island™? Hmmm... I don't know... Nobody knows the whereabouts of her secret hideout... ...nobody except me. I'd have to go and ask her if it's okay to show you the way. Hmmm... I guess I could hike all the way over there... ...ONCE. (puts a notice on the desk) Be right back. (stops by the door) AND DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING! The storekeeper leaves. However, Guybrush follows him from behind. Leaving the village, and into the fork that leads into the confusing paths inside the forest; while he's at it, he finds a weird, yellow flower blooms and picks it up. He also meets a red flower in the way, but he digress. Guybrush : I don't think strolling through the forest picking flowers is very good practice for being a pirate. Eventually, he follows the storekeeper to the secret house inside the forest where Sword Master lives. The storekeeper approaches the Sword Master. Guybrush : I better just stay back here and eavesdrop. Strkeeper: Hello again, Carla. Carla : I thought I told you to get lost. Strkeeper: Actually, I'm here on business. This kid came into my store, see... Carla : Face it, you crusty old letch... ...you'd make any excuse just to come out here and bother me. Strkeeper: Yeah, I guess so. Carla : Well, cut it out. I'm sick of it. Take a hike and don't come out here again. Someone might follow you, and then I'd become another Mêlée Island tourist attraction. Strkeeper: Hey, it's your loss, baby. Carla : Yeah, right. Now SCRAM. The storekeeper leaves, and Guybrush decides it's the time to challenge Carla the Sword Master. Carla : How dare you approach the Sword Master without permission... Which I surely didn't give you. Guybrush : Hi, I'm selling these fine leather jackets. Carla : Do you have one in size 3? Of course you don't! Because you're not really a jacket salesman! Let's be honest: you're here to prove yourself to the Pirate Leaders, in hopes of one day being as immoral as they are. Guybrush : Yep, nailed right on the head... gee, you're smart. Carla : I can tell by the sarcastic expression on your face that you've been fully trained by Captain Smirk. Let's get this over with. So, it begins. Carla : My wisest enemies run away at the first sight of me! Guybrush : Even BEFORE they smell your breath? Carla : Every word you say to me is stupid. Guybrush : I wanted to make sure you'd feel comfortable with me. Carla : No one will ever catch ME fighting as badly as you do. Guybrush : You run THAT fast? Carla : I've got a long, sharp lesson for you to learn today. Guybrush : And I've got a little TIP for you. Get the POINT? Carla : My sword is famous all over Caribbean! Guybrush : Too bad no one's ever heard of YOU at all. Carla : Only once have I met such coward! Guybrush : He must have taught you everything you know. Carla : Now I know what filth and stupidity really are. Guybrush : I'm glad to hear you attended your family reunion. Carla : OK, you win. Well, I hope you're happy. You can go back and brag to all your friends about how you beat the Sword Master. You'll need proof... Here, this should convince them. Guybrush acquires 100% cotton T-shirt, one that says 'I beat the Sword Master' at that. So he goes to the three important-looking pirates and show them the T-shirt. Green P. : Well, if it isn't the boy who wants to be a pirate. How do you fare on your quests? Guybrush : I'm the deadliest scalawag what ever swung a sword! Blue P. : Well, defeated the Sword Master, did ye? Ye're a strong fellow! Ye may keep the stylish T-shirt. We have enough. Guybrush : I'll just be running along now. Blue P. : Leave us to our grog. Green P. : Come back later and tell us how ye're doing. So, the next quest is to get into the Governor's Mansion, the place Guybrush visits only to find out that it is guarded by deadly piranha poodles. He wants to use the sword, but no. Guybrush : On those helpless dogs? Somehow, he figures to add the yellow petal from the flower he picked up earlier with the stewed meat he carries along since sneaking into the kitchen. That gives him a meat with condiment. As he throws it to the dogs, they appear to like it, and suddenly fall off. __________________________________________ | IMPORTANT NOTICE | | These dogs are not | | dead, they are only | | SLEEPING . | | No animals were harmed | | during the production | | of this game. | |__________________________________________| After getting into the now-unguarded mansion, Guybrush takes a priceless Ming. After that, he enters the door next to it. Suddenly, Sheriff Shinetop appears. Sheriff : This looks like a job for Fester Shinetop. Then, he also enters the door. After that: ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Author's note: ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// the following scene is not directly shown on-screen, as it happens behind the walls of the present room scenery players are given.

Otis : Hey, this might work on the rats! Thanks! Here's the cake. Guybrush uses the carrot cake and... Guybrush : There's a file in it! So, with the file in hand, he returns into the mansion. Guybrush : I've got the file.

Guybrush : Phew! That was a close one. At least I got the idol. Sheriff : (appears from behind the door) But I'm not done with you yet! Guybrush : Uh-oh. Sheriff : Thought you could get out of here with the Idol of Many Hands, did you? Guybrush : Look, I can explain... Sheriff : So can I-- You poisoned the Governor's pet poodles... Guybrush : They're just sleeping! Sheriff : ...broke into her house... Guybrush : The door was unlocked! Sheriff : ...and stole one of her most valuable pieces of art! Guybrush : No, you've got it all wrong! Sheriff : Oh really? Well, let's hear your explanation. Guybrush : The pirate leaders told me to do it! Sheriff : Ha! Suddenly, the Governor appears. Governor : What's going on here? Sheriff : I caught this hoodlum making off with your idol, Governor. He says the pirate leaders told him to do it! Governor : Then he's not the first decent person they've led astray! Sheriff : What? Governor : You heard me, Fester. The real question is, how did he get in here while you were on guard? Sheriff : I... Uh... Governor : Just go away, Fester. I can handle this. Sheriff : Hmpf! (leaves, then talks to Guybrush) I'll deal with you later. Governor : Sorry about him. He's new. I'm Governor Marley... Governor Elaine Marley. So, the pirate leaders made you do it, eh? Guybrush : Gee... Governor : Relax, Mr. Threepwood. I know why you're here. Believe me, you're not the first who's tried. Although, I have to admit, not as many get as far as you have. Guybrush : Jeepers... Governor : My lookout told me of your arrival. I've wanted to meet you ever since I heard your fascinating name. Tell me, Guybrush, why do you want to be a pirate? You don't look like one. Your face is too... ...sweet. Guybrush : Grlpyt... Governor : I see... Well, you're obviously not in the mood for idle chitchat, are you? I suppose you've got many more exciting things to do. I won't take up any more of your time, Mr. Threepwood. (leaves) Guybrush : Bgglw! Mfrnkf? Dmnkly... --sigh-- I really wish I knew how to talk to women. Now as Guybrush tries to get out of the mansion... Sheriff : Where do you think you're going, Threeword? Guybrush : I'm going to go put this idol in my safe-deposit box. Sheriff : Oh really? I know a really safe locker you could put it in... Davey Jones' Locker!!! Hand over your sword. Guybrush : Uh-oh. The scene shifts with both of them on the walkway in the middle of the village. The idol is tied down with a rope to Guybrush's feet, as it appears that the sheriff wants to drown him down the sea. Sheriff : This is the end of the road, my little pantalooned pal. Your troublemaking days on Mêlée Island™ are over. My plans for the Governor are far too important... ...and much too near completion... ...to rish letting a would-be pirate like you get in the way. So long, Mr. Spicecake, or Droopface, or whatever your name is. The Sheriff kicks the idol down, and Guybrush is pulled down into the sea. Sheriff : Hmmm... This might actually turn out to be a pretty good day. (leaves) Down the sea, Guybrush survives thanks to his ability to hold his breath for 10 minutes. However, he is tied with short rope as not to be able to pick up any dangerous looking weapons nearby him that may be of use to cut off the tie and save himself up. Guybrush : I can't reach that from here. After a while, two guys come and talk to each other on the walkway above Guybrush. Guy 1 : Hey, Nick, I just committed a felony! Nick : Did it involve that big knife you've got there? Guy 1 : Yeah! What should I do with it? Nick : Get rid of it! Guy 1 : I'll throw it in the water! Nick : No, don't do that! Guy 1 : Why not? I need to ditch it! Nick : It might wash up somewhere! Guy 1 : What do I care? MY prints won't be on it! I'm throwing it in! (a brief pause) ...naaaah. I might need it. See you. Nick : See you. The two guys leave. After some quite long while... Guybrush : Gee, I don't know how much longer I can hold my breath... Realizing the time is running out, Guybrush suddenly gets a glimpse of idea. He picks up the Idol, somehow keeps in behind his clothes, and voila, he's free. Guybrush : I guess I'll be needing a sword. This one will do. (picks a sword and climbs up the ladder) Well, that wasn't so hard. Now all I have to do is show this stupid idol to the pirate leaders and-- Suddenly, Governor Marley arrives. Governor : You're alive! Guybrush : Governor! Governor : Hey, you can talk! Who'd have known? Guybrush : What are YOU doing here? Come to finish the job? Governor : No, I came down here to save your life. Fester wasn't acting on MY orders when he threw you in there. Guybrush : You came down here to rescue me? I didn't even think you liked me. Governor : Well, our first meeting was a little awkward... You seemed to have trouble forming complete sentences. But, then again, so do most of my citizens. Guybrush : But I'm not one of your citizens... ...I'm just a drifter, a nobody, a would-be pirate. Governor : (comes closer) Guybrush : Who would have known, or even cared, if you'd let me drown? Governor : I would have, Guybrush. Guybrush : (walks away) Oh, Governor... Governor : (comes closer) Oh, Threepwood... Guybrush : (comes closer) Oh, Elaine! Governor : (comes closer) Oh, Guybrush! Guybrush : (comes closer) Love muffin! Governor : (comes closer) Sugar boots! Guybrush : (comes closer) Honey pumpkin! Governor : (comes closer) Plunder bunny! Guybrush : Kiss me! Governor : (turns away) No! We mustn't! Guybrush : What? Governor : Not here, where everyone can see us. Guybrush : Why, are you ashamed of me? Governor : No, no, it's not that at all... It's just that many of these pirates have made advances toward me. And to avoid hurting their feelings, I've always told them that my father made me promise never to fall in love with a pirate. If they see us together, they'll know I was lying. Guybrush : Okay then, let's go to your place. Governor : Okay. (take some steps) But finish your trials first. I don't want you to be... ...preoccupied. Guybrush : But... Governor : (walks away) Guybrush : I feel this sudden urge to complete the trials... ...quickly. Guybrush returns to SCUMM bar and reports about the idol. Green P. : How do you fare, swordsman? Guybrush : I'm the sneakiest footpad in these isles! Blue P. : Ah, the Idol of Many Hands! Ye're a brave lad! And thank ye for stealing it for us. Guybrush : I'll just be running along now. Blue P. : Leave us to our grog. Green P. : Come back later and tell us how ye're doing. The last trial for Guybrush is the Lost Treasure. Having bought a shovel already, now what he needs is a map. He goes to the Mêlée Island™ citizen who sells one. Citizen : Excuse me, but do-- Oh, it's only you again. Come back for the map to the Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island, eh? I hope you brought enough money this time. Guybrush : I'll take it. It'll make a swell gift. Citizen : (gives the map) There ya go. You've made a wise decision. Now get lost. But as Guybrush checks the map... Guybrush : I think I've been had! This is no map! It looks like... ...dancing lessons! __________________________________________ | DO THE MONKEY!!! | | | | Back! Two-three-four! | | Left! Two-three-four! | | Right! Two-three-four! | | | | Left!

Cha-cha-cha! | |__________________________________________| Naturally, he complains... Citizen : Excuse me, but do-- Oh, it's only you again. I told you there was only ONE in existence. Now get lost. However, looking at the direction clue from the map, Guybrush goes to the fork and into the forest anyway, and indeed, he finds the strange place... With a plaque that says: Guybrush : 'The Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island™' This carefuly reproduced piece of Mêlée Island™ history has delighted thousands of would-be pirates and their families for generations. Remember, there are other pirates on this island, SO GO EASY ON THE TREASURE. Leave some for the next person. He also checks a marker... Guybrush : Here lies treasure of such unimaginable wealth... ...well, you'll just have to dig it up to believe it. (Paid for by the Mêlée Island™ Chamber of Commerce.) Finally, he draws out the shovel and works with the X mark right below his feet... Guybrush : This shouldn't take too long. Hours pass... Guybrush : Hey, I think I hit something! (ducks) Oh boy! It's a T-shirt! Not my size, but a nice one nonetheless. Well, I guess I should put all this dirt back now. (returns to work) More hours pass... ...and the hole is gone. Now with the treasure in hand, Guybrush returns to the village, just to see the creepy scenery of a ghost ship leaving the island towards who knows where. Guybrush : What was that? I'm so confused. Old man : (suddenly comes) Hey, what are you doing just standing around? The Governor's been kidnapped! Guybrush : What? By whom? Old man : LeChuck's got her on that ship that just sailed off. I'm afraid we've seen the last of her. Guybrush : So where were you this whole time? Sleeping? Old man : Hey, I'm a lookout, not a bodyguard. Guybrush : I'll go get a crew and a ship and go rescue her! Old man : That's not going to be easy, you know. LeChuck's taken the Governor back to his hideout on Monkey Island™. I'm afraid that no pirate on this island is brave enough to follow him there. But, hey, good luck. (walks away) Oh yeah, I almost forgot... They left this note. Guybrush : (takes the note) Old man : You can have it, but I don't think you'll like what it says. (goes away) When Guybrush checks the note... Guybrush : Attention, pirates of Mêlée: Your governor is alive and well and by my side as she was always meant to be. If you try to find us you will only meet with horrifying disaster. Yours truly, Captain LeChuck. Not knowing much more about which direction to go, Guybrush decides to go to the voodoo lady again. Guybrush : Hey! I'm back and I'm ready to know more about the future. Lady : (magically appears) Guybrush : Yikes! Lady : So, you have returned to learn future. You must first find others to help in your cause. (magically draws up the skeleton pot) Guybrush : I really hate that flashing, it makes me see spots. Lady : Quiet! I am getting another vision. You must... Guybrush : Must what? Lady : You must go to Monkey Island™. Once there, you will search for the Ghost Pirate LeChuck. He hides deep... ...deep beneath Monkey Island™. There is only one thing powerful enough to destroy LeChuck. Guybrush : What? Lady : It's an ancient root. Once prepared, the root can destroy a ghost with one touch. Guybrush : Yeah! Lady : I'm getting more... ...more vision. Guybrush : Spill it! Lady : I see the Cannibals that live on the Island™. They... ...are helping you... ...or eating you... ...I can't tell, the vision isn't coming in clear anymore. Guybrush : Great. Lady : Now go and find the one that loves you. But be warned... Guybrush : Don't worry, I'll watch out for LeChuck. Lady : Not of LeChuck... of yourself and what you will find. What you will find out about yourself and your world. It will terrify you. Then, the lady suddenly disappears again. Now, in an attempt to get some crew, Guybrush talks to the Men of Low Moral Fiber (pirates). Guybrush : Did you know the Governor's been kidnapped? Barrel P.: Er... Tall P. : Well yes, we knew about that. Guybrush : Can I interest you in a dream vacation to Monkey Island™? Because of this sudden change in local government, I'm prepared to offer you a once-in-a-lifetime price on a cruise to that scenic wonderland... ...Monkey Island™! And the amazing thing about this offer IS the price: Absolutely free! All you have to do is help me crew the ship, and island paradise can be yours... FREE!! (...and we might just rescue the Governor while we're at it.) Barrel P.: Uh... Tall P. : Well... Barrel P.: The Governor can probably take care of herself... Tall P. : And we are sort of busy here... Barrel P.: - yeah - Tall P. : ...and we've got the circus to think of... Barrel P.: ...we've got to find the elephant... Tall P. : ...and get rid of these minutes... All P. : (look at each other) Tall P. : I'm sorry, we simply CAN'T go at this time. Guybrush seeks another help from the pirates in the SCUMM bar, only to find that the place is empty; only empty mugs (which he collects) are seen, until he find the cook crying down the next room... Guybrush : Where are all the pirates? Cook : The Governor is gone! LeChuck and his spectral crew came and got her! They put her on the ghost ship and spirited her away! She was so good to me... ...always conveniently losing those Health Board reports... ...for a small consideration, of course. (cries again) What will become of my business? Oh, woe is me. Guybrush : What can I do to save her? Cook : You must get a ship and go after her! The ghost pirate's lair is on Monkey Island™, everybody knows that. (Don't ask me how...) All you need to do is find a way there. Guybrush : Why should I do that? Cook : Why, for love, my boy! Don't deny it, it's written all over your face. A dark red 'LOVE' letter is written on Guybrush's face. Guybrush : Where can I get a ship? Cook : Why, at Smilin' Stan's Used Shipyard, same as everybody else. Tell him I sent you, we're old friends. Guybrush : Will you join me? Cook : Er. . .alas, I cannot go to sea. And old war injury. I'm sure you understand. Guybrush : Get me a drink! Cook : Get your own drink. Guybrush : Right! I'm off! Cook : Good luck! Be sure and wear your mittens. And your galoshes. (cries) And don't forget to write. Bye now. Guybrush decides that Otis might want to join as his crew; then again, Otis is locked in his cell, so he should get around this problem first. Knowing that he has given the permission to get himself the grog, that ever-dangerous drink, Guybrush thinks that it may just be the key to free Otis. So, he goes to the kitchen and uses one of the mug to get the grog from the barrel. Guybrush : This stuff is eating right through the mug! Yes, and the grog might just eats right through the jail's bar as well. The mug can't survive the grog for long enough time, though, so Guybrush has to alternate the liquid from one mug to another until he can reach the jail. There, he pours the grog to the cell's lock. Otis : Hey, great, a drink! I'm real thirsty. Guybrush : (pours the grog) Otis : Yiiikes! The lock melts. Otis : Wow. And to think I used to drink that stuff... (walks out of the cell) I'm free! Oh yeah, thanks. If there's anything I can ever do for you-- Guybrush : Well, actually, there is something... I'm looking for brave people to join my crew and sail off to Monkey Island™ with me to rescue the Governor. She's been abducted by the fearsome pirate LeChuck, and is being held against her will somewhere in his secret hideout. Otis : I see... Well, yes, hmmm... LeChuck, you say? Well, yes. Yes, of course. We must sail to Monkey Island™ and--HEY! LOOK BEHIND YOU! A THREE-HEADED MONKEY! Guybrush : (turns around) Otis : (walks away off of the screen) Guybrush : (turns around again) I can't believe I fell for that. Pretty good trick, though. Meanwhile, (the scene shifts to LeChuck's ship) Having just returned from Mêlée, LeChuck and his crew find their old hiding place in the underground rivers of Monkey Island and drop anchor. Sheriff Fester stands in the room that used to be LeChuck's, and the bone pirate approaches. Bone : Captain, sir... I just stopped by to congratulate you on your kidnapping mission. Sheriff : (walks around) Bone : Captain? Sheriff's body is bloating weirdly. Bone : Captain? Are you all right? The sheriff magically turns his body into that of LeChuck's. LeChuck : NEVER FELT BETTER! And how fares our prisoner? Bone : Ah yes, the prisoner. We had a little trouble... LeChuck : TROUBLE! Bone : (walks away) Nothing to worry about, sir... ...everything's under control. She escaped a few times... ...but we've got her locked up in the brig. No one's getting in or out of there. LeChuck : For your sake I hope not. (walks to the window) With years of planning almost destroyed by my death, I'm not taking any chances now. Bone : You took care of Mr. Threepwood, then? LeChuck : Guybrush Threepwood will not be a problem. At this very moment, he's twenty feet under water... ...probably bloated up like a fattened pig. 'Is eyes being eaten out by crabs. Fish peckin' at his fingers. Kinda makes you wish you were there to watch. Bone : Ah...yessir... --yech-- ...sure does at that. LeChuck : Now go check on the root. Make sure it's locked up tight. Bone : Aye aye, captain. The scene returns back to Guybrush. Going out of the jail, he sees that someone is guarding the pathway to the Governor's Mansion. Man : May I help you? Guybrush : I'm here to loot the Governor's mansion. Man : And do you have reservations, sir? Guybrush : Reservations?!? For looting? Man : Oh yes, very popular when the Governor's away. Chaos would ensue if we didn't have a system. Now... ...unless you have reservations, you'll have to leave. Guybrush : Why, yes I do have reservations. Man : And what name would they be under? Guybrush : Threepwood, Guybrush Threepwood. Man : I'm sorry... ...I don't see your name here. ...we're booked solid for the next five hours. But I might be able to squeeze you in... ...around the two o'clock hour. Would that be OK? Guybrush : No thanks, I've got a ship to catch. Man : Next time, call ahead. Short for crew, Guybrush remembers the Sword Master and decides to give her a visit. Carla : You've already got the T-shirt... What do you want now? Guybrush : I want to embarass you at swordfighting again. Carla : Ha! I only let you win because I was sick of you coming around. I thought you'd stay away, but I guess I was wrong. Guybrush : I want us to make up and be friends. Carla : I want you to go away and leave me alone. Guybrush : The Governor's been KIDNAPPED! Carla : What? That's ridiculous. Guybrush : (shows the note from LeChuck) Carla : Oh, no. This looks bad. Very bad. Guybrush : I'm getting a ship and a crew together to rescue her. Carla : Hmmm... I have a feeling I'm going to regret this, but count me in. I'll meet you at the dock. Finally gets a crew, Guybrush finds a house by the northeast corner of the island. He goes there as well. The house is located at the so-called Hook Isle, the small island apart from the main Mêlée Island. There's no bridge connecting the two, but there is a long, stretched cable that connects two poles on both side, and Guybrush finally finds the real use of the chicken with pulley in the middle: to use it to hang over the cable and slide all the way to the Hook Isle. Entering the door, he is greeted by a tough-looking bald pirate with a skull tattoo on his chest and two meathooks replacing both his hands. Pirate : Hey! I don't like visitors! Who are you? Guybrush : I'm a pirate, cannonball-head. Who are you? Pirate : My name's Meathook... ...and I think you've got a little attitude problem. Guybrush : I'm sorry. I didn't mean to call you cannonball-head. Meathook : That's okay. I'd rather have a cannonball-head than a pony tail. Ha ha ha! Guybrush : I meant to call you chrome dome. Meathook : Why you... Guybrush is chased out of the house. Nevertheless, he comes in again. Meathook : I suppose you've come to invade my peaceful home and insult me again, eh? Guybrush : Excuse me, but the sign said there were restrooms in here? Meathook : Sorry, but that sign's a little out of date. I used to have a thriving tourist business here. I had animal acts, tattoo demonstrations, souvenirs... But there was a little accident with one of the trained animals... ...one of our guests was hurt very badly. So I was shut down, put out of business. And since then I've lived here all alone... ...and the only company I have is the same beast that mauled that unlucky tourist. The same beast that made me a hermit. A monster that, just by coincidence, is identical to one that attacked ME when I was just a child... ...and left me with these hooks instead of hands... ...a deformed man. Geeze, now I'm all depressed. Thanks a lot. Can't you just leave me alone now? Guybrush : What was your name again, cannonball-head? Meathook : Look, I told you not to call me that. My name's Meathook... and you still have a little attitude problem. Guybrush : I'm sorry, I didn't mean to call you cannonball-head. Meathook : That's okay. I'd rather have a cannonball-head than a pony tail. Ha ha ha! Guybrush : Ha ha ha. Meathook : Hey, you've got a pretty good sense of humor. Want to see something really funny? Guybrush : Yes, please show me, Mr. Meat. Meathook : Watch this! Say hello, Roger! Tattoo : Hello, Roger. Meathook : Pretty good eh? I got a whole routine, but I don't have the time to do it all right now... Maybe if we're ever on a long ocean voyage together... ...but until then, I'm a very busy man, so... Guybrush : The Governor's been KIDNAPPED! Meathook : What? That's preposterous! Guybrush : Oh really? (shows LeChuck's note) Take a look at this note they left. Meathook : Oh no. This is horrible! What are we going to do? Guybrush : We could get a crew together and sail off after them. Meathook : What an idea! Now, if only we had a captain... Guybrush : What about me? Meathook : YOU? HA HA HA HA! That's a good one. Guybrush : Hey, I'm serious. Meathook : Really? Guybrush : Really. Meathook : Okay, let's see you prove it. Walk this way. The both of them walk to a gigantic door. Meathook : There's something in here that I want to show you. ...something horrible. Something so horrible that I stay awake at night just thinking about it... But I don't mean to scare you. I'm sure a big, brave guy like yourself will have no problem facing this monster. After all, it's much smaller than the beast that bit off my hands so many years ago. (opens the door, only to reveal another steel door behind it) Let's just hope you're quicker than I was. (unlocks the steel door) Oh, I just remembered something... I never did get around to feeding him this week. Silly me. (opens the next door) I'll let you open this last door yourself. Just let me get out of your way. Guybrush : Wait! Meathook : Getting cold feet? Guybrush : No, I just don't know what I'm supposed to do. Meathook : You're supposed to open that little door... ...and, if you're brave enough... ...touch the beast inside. Guybrush : Oh, is that all? Meathook : (leaves) Okay. Go ahead... ...if you've got the guts. Guybrush opens the door. Meathook : AAAAAAIIIIIEEEEE!!! The beast behind the door, the one Meathook's been blabbering about, appears to be a... green parrot. Gubrush tickles the 'murderous winged devil'. Parrot : Braaaak! Meathook : (comes) I don't believe it. (closes the door) You are a brave man after all. You faced the beast I've feared all these years. You had the guts to do what I never could. I feel like such a coward. I'm not good enough to be on your crew. I'm not even good enough to swab your decks. Guybrush : Oh, come on, Meathook. You're a big, strong, good-looking guy with a talking tattoo. You can swab my decks any time! Meathook : Really? Guybrush : Sure. Meathook : I can still be on your crew? Guybrush : Just pack your stuff and meet me at the dock. Meathook : Oh, thank you, thank you! I won't let you down. Guybrush : (walks out of the house) Meathook : Hey, maybe I'll get the chance to show you my whole tattoo routine when we're at sea! Guybrush : Wow, this is sounding better and better all the time. Now that he's got another crew, next is to get a ship. Guybrush goes to the ever-glowing area in the island that appears to be a ship dealer place. Man : Howdy! I'm Stan of Stan's Previously Owned Vessels. ...and I'd stand on my head to make you a deal. What sort of craft are you looking for? Big? Little? Fast? Slow? You want it, I got it. And if I don't got it, I'll get it. I want to make you a deal that YOU'RE happy with. Because if YOU'RE not happy, I'M not happy. But I KNOW you're going to leave here happy today. How do I know? Just look at all these ships! I've got something for everyone! Come take a look around! They walk to the dock area. Stan : So tell me-- What are you interested in looking at today? Guybrush : Let me see the best ship you've got. Stan : Hey, it's nice to meet a man who appreciates quality. I've got JUST the boat for you! Walk this way. Now before them is a big, red ship. Stan : Now this... This is a ship fit for a king! I mean, we're talking fifteen staterooms--a fireplace in every one. We're talking two pools--one indoor, one outdoor. We're talking rotating ballroom. We're talking heated crow's nest. We're talking two hundred feet of ocean-going decadence. And all for one low price. Speaking of price... Let's talk about money--YOUR money. Guybrush : Money is no object! Stan : Well, it is with me. How much you got? Guybrush : All I have is this rubber chicken. Stan : Is it one of those rubber chickens with a pulley in the middle? I already got one of those. You wouldn't happen to have any OTHER means of finance, would you? Guybrush : Actually, I was hoping to get one on credit. Stan : Sorry, kid. Neither a borrower nor a lender be. That's just old Stan's philosophy. If you've got a job, the storekeeper in town might extend you some credit. Then we'd have something to talk about. Unless, of course, you've already got some other means of financing...? Guybrush : Oh... no more than 174 pieces of eight. Stan : I think we must be talking about completely different ships here. You've obviously been out of the ship market for quite some time. I doubt you're carrying enough cash on you for this transaction. You wouldn't happen to have any OTHER means of finance, would you? Guybrush : On second thought, this may not be the ship for me. Stan : Of course it isn't! You're looking for a much bigger boat, I can tell. So what else can I show you? Guybrush : Something not too expensive, but built to last. Stan : Affordable quality? Hey, that's my motto! I've got JUST the boat for you! Walk this way. Stan walks Guybrush to a viking sort of boat. Stan : Now I can see you're a no-frills kind of guy. But I can also tell that quality means a lot to you. I mean, just look at the way you dress. Rugged. Like this baby. She comes from a land far to the North... ...where the sea is as unforgiving as the men are tough and-- --hey, you wouldn't happen to be from there would you? You just seem to have a sort of Nordic quality about you... Anyway, we're talking about a real value here... Let's talk about money -- YOUR money. Guybrush : Oh... no more than 174 pieces of eight. Stan : I'm glad this ship doesn't have ears, my friend. Because if she did, she'd slap your face. I don't think you've got the cash for this transaction either. Yo do have SOME other means of payment... Don't you? Guybrush : On second thought, this may not be the ship for me. Stan : Okay, but I got five other guys coming to look at this baby today. Don't count on it being here if you change your mind. So what else can I show you? Guybrush : That spiffy blue one by your office looks nice. Stan : Of course it does. It's mine. And it's not for sale. What ELSE can I show you? Guybrush : I really don't have that much to spend. Stan : Have no fear! Every ship I sell is a bargain! But if you're looking for a real steal... I've got JUST the boat for you! Walk this way. They go to the furthest ship. Stan : This here is the famous \"Sea Monkey.\" --The only ship ever to make it to Monkey Island™... ...and come back with anyone aboard left alive. Or, should I say, anyTHING. You see, two previous owners of this ship were two adventurous pirates. They set off, like many before, to find the legendary Secret of Monkey Island™. And, like many before, they disappeared forever. Their fate--a mystery. Almost as mysterious as how this ship returned to Mêlée Island™ without a single human aboard. Some claim it was sailed back by a crew of chimps. Guybrush : Chimps? There aren't any chimps in the Caribbean! Stan : Oh, shut up. It makes a good story. Anyway, this baby's mine now... That is, until someone makes me an offer. How much would you like to spend? Guybrush : Oh... no more than 174 pieces of eight. Stan : Look... This is a very reasonably priced ship... but not that reasonable. I don't think you've got the cash for this transaction either. You do have SOME other means of payment... Don't you? Guybrush : On second thought, this may not be the ship for me. Stan : Well heck, I can understand that. Nothing wrong with being indecisive. Even if it is a waste of my time. So what else can I show you? Guybrush : Actually, I'd like to go think about it some more. Stan : Sure, sure. Think it over. I don't want you to feel pressured or anything. Bye now. Guybrush walks to leave the place, but suddenly... Stan : I forgot to give you my card. Guybrush : (receives the card) Stan : And here's something else to remember me by. Guybrush : A compass? Stan : An extra strong magnetic compass-- Guybrush : With your picture on it... Stan : That's right! It always points directly back here, so if you're looking for a good deal, you know where to go! I'll be right here when you come back, But I can't guarantee that any of these ships will! Guybrush : Right. (leaving) Stan : They're moving fast today! Yessiree... Can't hardly keep anything in stock. (a brief pause) He'll be back. Knowing that he has nearly any money to afford one of those ships, Guybrush decides to get the credit from the storekeeper. So he goes there. Strkeeper: Hey, where'd you go? I hike halfway across the island to try and get you a reservation with the Sword Master-- --who, by the way, says you can go jump in the lake-- --and when I come back, you're gone! See if I ever do you a favor again! Waddya want? Guybrush : I'm interested in procuring a note of credit. Strkeeper: You are, are you? Got a job? Guybrush : Yes, of course I do. Strkeeper: All right. I'll get one of my notes and we'll fill it out. The storekeeper walks to the upper floor and opens the locked safe. Meanwhile, Guybrush silently notifies the combinations needed to unlock it. The storekeeper grabs the note and walks back down. Strkeeper: Let's see here... What did you say your occupation was? Guybrush : I'm a grog-swilling, foul-smelling pirate. Strkeeper: Foul-smelling, yes... Grog-swilling, maybe... But a pirate? Don't make me laugh. Come back when you've got some tattoos or a pegleg or at least an eyepatch, for crying out loud. The storekeeper returns back the note. Strkeeper: What else do you want? Guybrush : I'm looking for the Sword Master of Mêlée Island™. Strkeeper: Look, I told you, she doesn't want to see you. Guybrush : Maybe if you asked her again? Hmmm... I guess I could hike all the way over there... ...AGAIN. Be right back. (leaves) AND DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING! Now that the storekeeper is gone, Guybrush is free to unlock the safe with the combinations he secretly took note earlier. Guybrush : Hmmm... There's nothing in here but this note. (grabs the storekeeper's note) With the note in hand, Guybrush returns to the Used Ship Emporium. Stan : Howdy! Great to see you again! I knew you'd come back! Everybody does! You know WHY they come back? Just look at all these ships! I've got something for everyone! Come take a look around! So what else can I show you? Guybrush : Uh... could I see that red one again? Stan : I knew it! I knew it! Just can't get her out of your mind, can you? Walk this way. Now here's a ship... ...that's definitely worth a second look. Let's talk about money--YOUR money. Guybrush : I got credit from the storekeeper. Will you take it? Stan : I'd love to. I really would. I USUALLY do. But not for the amount this baby's going to run you. Maybe one of the other ships would be more in your price range. So what else can I show you? Guybrush : Uh... could I see that Viking one again? Stan : Sure! No problemo! After all, I've got nothing better to do than haul my butt up and down this dock showing some guys like you the same ships over and over again all day long! Walk this way. Can't keep your eyes off her, can you? What kind of price range were you thinking of? Guybrush : I got credit from the storekeeper. Will you take it? Stan : I'd love to. I really would. I USUALLY do. But not for the amount this baby's going to run you. Maybe one of the other ships would be more in your price range. So what else can I show you? Guybrush : Uh... how much do you want for yours? Stan : I told you, it's not for sale! Geeze, you're annoying... But, hey! So am I, right? What ELSE can I show you? Guybrush : Uh, could I see that cheap one again? Stan : Why not? I got all day! Walk this way. Hard to stay away from a good mystery, isn't it? Just how much were you looking to spend today? Guybrush : I got credit from the storekeeper. Will you take it? Stan : Hey, of course! Your credit's always good at Stan's... It doesn't matter if you've had credit problems in the past... Divorce... Bankruptcy... Chronic gambling mishaps... I mean, who am I to judge, right? If the storekeeper trusts you enough to give you a letter of credit... ...then you must be a honest man with a steady income, right? Guybrush : Uh... right. Stan : Let's get down to brass tacks, shall we? I know you want it... ...you know you want it... ...and I know that you know that I want to sell it, so... Guybrush : Well, what do you think it's worth? Stan : You could sail this puppy away TODAY, for just 10000 pieces of eight. How does that sound to you? Guybrush : Let's talk extras. Stan : Extras? You want to talk extras? Great! This baby's LOADED with extras! For instance... Did I tell you about the porthole defoggers? Guybrush : I think I can live without that particular piece of junk. Stan : Okay, but don't blame me if you run into an iceberg or something. But wait, there's more! Did I tell you about the anti-lock anchor? Guybrush : I think I can live without that particular piece of junk. Stan : Sure, throw safety to the wind. But wait, there's more! Did I tell you about the rack-and-pinion rudder? Guybrush : I think I can live without that particular piece of junk. Stan : Well, I guess it'll float without it... ...barely. But wait, there's more! Did I tell you about the velour sail covers? Guybrush : I think I can live without that particular piece of junk. Stan : Hey, travel light, I can understand that, sure. Of course, mutiny is an ugly word... But wait, there's more! Did I tell you about the tack-o-meter? Guybrush : I think I can live without that particular piece of junk. Stan : Wow, does your wife know you're such a cheapskate? But wait, there's more! Did I tell you about the elevator made with wood from burgundy wine casks? Guybrush : I think I can live without that particular piece of junk. Stan : Yeah, I guess that IS kind of decadent, isn't it? But wait, there's more! Did I tell you about the simulated wood siding? Guybrush : I think I can live without that particular piece of junk. Stan : Okay, but I'm telling you: Barnacles HATE simulated wood. But wait, there's more! Did I tell you about the porthole defoggers? Guybrush : Enough about extras, already. Stan : Okay, where were we... Guybrush : Well, what do you think it's worth? Stan : You could sail this puppy away TODAY, for just 7300 pieces of eight. How does that sound to you? Guybrush : I'd like to make you an offer. Stan : Great! How much? Guybrush : I'd like to pay 2000 pieces of eight. Stan : Sure, I guess we can start out at the bottom. I got all day. I'm going to be getting a whole new shipment next week, so you got me over a barrel. I've GOT to sell this baby, even if it means losing my shirt. Guybrush : I'd like to make you an offer. Stan : Great! How much? Guybrush : How does 3000 pieces of eight sound? Stan : That's a little bit more like it... ...but not much. I know you can try harder than that. Just tell me, what would it take to get you to sail this ship away... TODAY? Guybrush : I'd like to make you an offer. Stan : Great! How much? Guybrush : Okay, okay. 4000 pieces of eight. Stan : That's a little bit more like it... ...but not much. I know you can try harder than that. You realize, don't you, that they just don't make them like this anymore. Guybrush : I'd like to make you an offer. Stan : Great! How much? Guybrush : All right! 5000! But that's my final offer! Stan : Five thousand pieces of eight?!? (brief pause) Okay! Okay! It's killing me, but okay! And I thought I was going to give my children Christmas presents this year... Just take it out of here. I'm GLAD to get rid of it. Oh yeah, do you have that note from the storekeeper with you? Guybrush : (gives the note) Stan : Thanks. ...I've got to run these numbers by my boss... ...he'll think I'm nuts, but I'll talk him into it. You meet me at the dock with your crew. I'll bring the ship and the papers. I just want to say that I really feel like we got to know each other today. I mean, I really felt some bonding here. And I don't just say that to everybody! It's been great doing business with you. Really. (walks away) (Sucker.) See you at the dock, and don't forget your crew. All three of them. Everything seems ready, so Guybrush heads to the dock area in the village, where Stan is already waiting with the Sea Monkey down the sea. Stan : Hey! It's a good thing you showed up. Ten people have offered to buy this baby off me while I've been standing here waiting for you. But I said, 'NO WAY.' 'I know a guy who's in love with this ship, and it would break his heart to lose it.' Am I right? Of course I am! I mean, just look at her! Sleek... ...aerodynamic... ...a buoyant, barnacle-covered beauty. A falling star shows behind the ship. Stan : I think we're having a real moment here. I've changed my mind. I can't give her up. You can have your money back. How could I sell something so dear? Suddenly, one of the Sea Monkey's pole is broken, drops off to the sea. Stan : Then again, a deal's a deal, right? Right. Catch you later. Good luck. Enjoy. I'm outta here. (leaves) Whoops! I almost forgot to give you this free seafaring literature. Guybrush : (accepts the brochures) Stan : My gift to you. Just remember where you got it. STAN'S!!! (leaves) Guybrush : Maybe I should have gotten that extended warranty after all. Otis comes. Otis : Hey, long time no see. Guybrush : Have you come to be on my crew? Otis : Hey, I could never pass up a chance to make some easy money. Carla appears. Guybrush : Money? Carla : Yeah, we are getting paid for this, right? Guybrush : How appropriate. You fight like a cow. Carla : You never did know when to use that one. (sees Sea Monkey) So what's that waterlogged wreck doing out there? How we are going to get our ship in here with that pile of scrap in the way? Meathook comes. Meathook : Where's the cabin boy? I need him to go back to my place and pick up my bags. Carla : What's going on here? Otis : Where's our ship? Meathook : Where's our crew? Guybrush : This isn't going to be as easy as I thought. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Part Two: The Journey ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Through the courageous leadership of Captain Freep -er- Threepwood, the Sea Monkey is finally underway. Undaunted by their lack of navigational equipment or expertise, the crew begins to plan their voyage. The scene shows everyone onboard. Guybrush : First of all... I'd like to say it's great to be working with such a fine crew. The voyage ahead is not going to be easy. It's going to take skill, endurance, and most of all... TEAMWORK. First I thought we'd assign some duties. Otis : What is it we were suckered into doing again? Guybrush : (shows a paper) I made a list. Carla : 'Suckered' is right. Otis : I don't see what the big deal is with rescuing the Governor. She can clearly take care of herself. The way I look at it... We've got this GREAT ship... ...well... ...we've got A ship. Why don't we kick back, tie a rope to the wheel and cruise for a while. I could use a little work on my tan. Meathook : Come to think of it, I've been a little stressed out lately. I could use a rest. Carla : Then it's decided... ...we cruise the Caribbean. Guybrush : --sigh-- Inside the captain's room. Guybrush : I'm doomed. Inside he picks up a feather pen and an ink bottle. He opens the drawer and finds a book there. Guybrush : It says: \"Captain's log, March 10th.\" \"First mate Toothrot and I have been searching for Monkey Island™ for over a month with no success.\" \"The directions we purchased on Mêlée proved to be a recipe, not a map as we had believed.\" \"Captain's log, March 12th.\" \"I wish Toothrot would take a bath.\" \"Captain's log, March 17th.\" \"I wish Toothrot would stop snoring.\" \"Captain's log, March 23rd.\" \"Toothrot is really starting to get on my nerves. I figure it's only a matter of time before we come to blows.\" \"Captain's log, April 2nd.\" \"As a gesture to restore our frienship, Toothrot offered to fix dinner tonight.\" \"Captain's log, April 3rd.\" \"I don't know how we did it, but we've arrived at Monkey Island™.\" \"Both Toothrot and I passed out from the soup he fixed last night. When we awoke, Monkey Island™ was sitting off the bow.\" \"Captain's log, April 4th.\" \"Toothrot and I filled the rowboat with supplies and are ready to set out to Monkey Island™.\" \"We are both excited at the prospect of being the first civilized people to learn the Secret of Monkey Island™.\" \"Captain' log, April 5th.\" \"We had to turn around and return to the ship. Toothrot forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.\" \"We'll set out again tomorrow.\" (turns around) That's the last entry. Guybrush walks out of the room, finds the rest of the crew having a little good time under the sun. Guybrush : Hey guys, what's happening? Otis : Beat it, Guybrush. Guybrush : Is there anything I can do to get you guys to help me? Meathook : Er, excuse me Guybrush... ...you're blocking the sun. Guybrush : I'm going to give you mutineers five seconds to come to your senses! Then I'm going to start kicking some butt! Meathook : Excuse me Guybrush... ...does the word 'keelhaul' mean anything to you? Guybrush : Keelhaul / Ke(e)l-hol 1: to haul under the keel of a ship as punishment or torture. I see your point, thanks. He still tries. Guybrush : I hear the weather's pretty nice over by Monkey Island™. Otis : Nice try, Guybrush, but no banana. Desperate with all his mutinous crew, Guybrush climbs the rope ladder to the crow's nest. There, he picks up the Jolly Roger, the official pirate's flag. He returns and then walks down the hatch, into another door to a kitchen of some sort. He opens the cupboard and see a whole set of cereal there. He picks one. Guybrush : Hmmmm.... I loved this stuff when I was a kid. I liked the way it chewed up the roof of your mouth. He opens the cereal. Guybrush : Crunch Crunch Crunch Crunch GREAT! A toy prize inside. He checks the prize. Guybrush : This is no prize! It's a small key with a finely engraved monkey on it. He picks a pot, then walks out of the kitchen and into another hatch. It seems to be a storeroom or something. He checks a chest and find a fine wine inside. He also picks a giant piece of rope. He opens a keg and finds gunpower inside, which he picks some. The rest of the things are locked, so he goes back to the captain's room. He uses the small key in the cabinet, and he picks the small chest inside. Guybrush : Man, that's heavy. Filled, no doubt, with gold and jewels. He opens it and picks the stuff inside. Guybrush : He look! A piece of paper. And some cinnamon sticks. The piece of paper reads: __________________________________________ | DIRECTION TO MONKEY ISLAND!!! | | | | Pre-heat pot to 450 degrees | | Add the following ingredients: | | | | 1 Cinnamon stick | | 4 Leaves of Mint | | 1 Human Skull (pressed) | | 1 squirt Squid Ink | | 2 pts Monkey Blood | | 1 Live Chicken | | 3 oz. Brimstone | | 1 or more of the following: | | pyridoxine hydrochloride, | | zinc oxide, yellow 8, | | mine mononitrate and BHA. | | | |Let bubble over low flame until thickened.| | Serves crew of four. | |__________________________________________| Guybrush decides to give the recipe a try and so off he go to the kitchen. First, the Cinnamon Stick into the cooking pot ('I love cinnamon.') Then, in place of the 4 leaves of mint, he puts down the breath mints ('Good thing I've got a million of these.') He definitely has no pressed human skull, but the Jolly Roger looks somehow like one, so he adds it anyway. Next, the ink from the captain room should serve well in place of Squid inks ('Just a drop.') There's no monkey blood around, but the fine wine might just be as red ('That should be enough.') Next is the time for the loyal rubber chicken (with pulley in the middle) to replace the Live chicken ('About time I got rid of this worthless artifact.'), and he gets the brimstone from the gunpowder. He throws in the additional minutes, the cotton shirt, staple remover, T-shirt, LeChuck's note, feather pen, the bookmark, cereal... Guybrush : (walks away seeing the pot's making weird green smoke) Yikes! I think I'm getting dizzy! Overcome by the fumes and stench, Guybrush quickly loses consciousness. Moments later the voodoo spell kicks in, turning the ship to an unknown heading and off on its mysterious voyage. Days pass... Guybrush : Fsspt. I feel awful. He walks out and gets surprised by the sight of an island nearby. Guybrush : Holy Monkey Bladders! It's Monkey Island™. Enjoying the sight ('WOW!!! This was well worth $59.95 + Tax'), he talks to his crew. Guybrush : Hey look... ...we've made it to Monkey Island™. Meathook : Let us know when you've found the Governor... ...we've got an extra chair she can use. Guybrush goes down the hatch and gets another gunpowder. Then he returns to the cannon. He puts the giant piece of rope with cannon, then the piece of rope with fuse. He returns to the kitchen and uses Stan's business card with the fire, so he gets himself something to trigger the cannon. He places some of the gunpowder into the cannon nozzle and uses the burning business card on the fuse. While the fire's at it, he wears the pot and quickly moves into the cannon, which blows him straight to the Monkey Island. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Part Three: Under Monkey Island ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Guybrush lands, somehow, on the beach of the island and a grey monkey appears. Monkey : ook ook ook ook eep eep eep Then comes a man. Man : Hi! I'm Herman Toothrot! Don't bother to say hello. I've only been waiting twenty years to talk to somebody civilized, I don't mind. (brief pause) Fine. By the way, you might want to think about putting out that fire. Someone could be hurt. Toothrot leaves, and Guybrush can finally stands up. He reads a note stuck on a banana tree. Guybrush : \"NOTICE OF PUBLIC MEETING\" \"There will be a meeting Wednesday evening to discuss the recent occupation of the Sacred Monkey Head by the ghost pirate LeChuck...\" \"...and the subsequent impact on the environment and the tourist trade.\" \"All Monkey Island™ cannibals are encouraged to attend.\" Guybrush picks a banana and walks to the jungle. There, he walks west to the western part of the island where the path ends on a fort. He enters. Guybrush : The trail ends here. He picks a spyglass, and he pushes the cannon until the cannonball comes out. Suddenly, Herman Toothrot comes. Herman : Hey, nice spyglass. Looks just like -- Say, where IS my spyglass? Oh, perfect. I'm gone five minutes and somebody comes in here and dumps gunpowder all over the floor. Naturally I don't think YOU had anything to do with it. I'm sure it's just a coincidence that you cam in here to prowl around right after some MYSTERIOUS person dirtied up my nice clean floor. Guybrush : Er, sorry. Herman : Um... I'm afraid I must be going now. Pressing business, you know. (looks at player) -- hee hee -- Herman leaves. Guybrush picks both the gunpowder and the cannonball, then leaves the fort as well. He then visits a beach to the south of the fort. There's nothing but a note there, which he reads. Guybrush : It's printed on letterhead! \"To the ghost pirate LeChuck:\" \"We must ask you once again to curtail your nightly activities in the Sacred Monkey Head area.\" \"Decent people are trying to sleep.\" \"Kindly keep the noise level down.\" \"--The Monkey Island™ Cannibals\" \"P.S.--\" \"We saw you taking that woman with the scarf down there!\" Suddenly Herman appears again. Herman : Look at that fabulous ship out there! Did you come in that? You're braver than you look. Actually, it looks a lot like a ship I used to own... Guybrush : I got taken by a guy named Stan... Herman : Stan of Stan's Used Ships? On Mêlée Island™? (looks at player) Heh heh heh heh Guybrush : Are you some kind of a castaway? Herman : What do I look like, the caretaker? (looks at player) Listen to this guy: Am I some kind of a castaway? Heh. Guybrush : Who are you talking to? Herman : Why, the people watching, of course. Guybrush : (looks at player) Um... sure. Herman : My name's Toothrot. Herman Toothrot. I live here. Well, not RIGHT here. In the fort on the volcano. Guybrush : Were you stranded? Herman : You think I stay here for my health? (looks at player) Hoo, boy. (leaves) Guybrush gets out of the beach and moves east to the previous area. Then, he goes north and to the river fork. Guybrush : Boy, it sure is HOT here. (checking at rock on top of note) I'm no geologist, but judging by these conchoidal fractures... ...I'd say this is a piece of flint! He picks both the flint and the note. Guybrush : \"To the Monkey Island™ Cannibals:\" \"I don't mind you worshipping in front of the Sacred Monkey Idol which doubles as my home and secret base of operations...\" \"...but could you please refrain from leaving messy sacrifices on my porch.\" \"Also, please DO NOT ENTER the Monkey Head.\" \"--G.P. LeChuck\" Guybrush leaves the river fork and goes to a pond where there lies another note, and a corpse of man hanging on the tree. He looks at the note. Guybrush : \"Herman--\" \"Please return our key to the Monkey Head.\" \"--the Cannibals\" Herman comes. Herman : This is an old friend of mine, the one I sailed here with. He's lost weight. Never looked better. Guybrush : He looks pretty bad... Herman : You never saw him when he was still alive! Guybrush : I'm Guybrush. I'm here to rescue someone. Herman : Well, here I am. Glad you came to rescue me-- --though you might have been earlier. The fine on that overdue library book should be pretty big by now. Let's go. Guybrush : Er... That's not exactly what I meant. I sailed here in pursuit of the Governor of Mêlée Island™, who's been kidnapped by a ghost. Herman : Oh fine, DON'T rescue me. I like it here. The rain on my head, the wind at my back... ...the bugs on my plate... Guybrush : Um... Well, perhaps I could take you back, too... ...but I've got to rescue the governor, first. I think she's on that ghost-ship underground. Herman : Oh, OK. Guybrush : What happened to your pants? Herman : What pants? Guybrush : How did you get stranded here? Herman : Well, I sailed here with a friend of mine twenty years ago. We hope to discover the Secret of Monkey Island™. But my friend met with a horrifying and tragic accident... ...which claimed his life... ...and I couldn't sail the ship back by myself. I trained a bunch of chimps to crew the ship and sail it back to Mêlée Island™. They were supposed to get help and come back for me... ...something must have happened. Guybrush : How come you didn't just go with the chimps? Herman : WEEKS on a boat full of monkeys. (looks at player) Oh, joy. Guybrush : You're the only one on the island? Herman : I'm the only CIVILIZED person on the island. There's a native tribe of hunter/gatherers-- --well, HEADhunter/gatherers, actually-- --but I don't talk to them. They ARE cannibals, but they're not dangerous... ...unless you lend them something. Guybrush : Did you lend something to the cannibals? Herman : I lent my banana picker to them, and they never gave it back. As collateral they gave me this enormous cotton swab. It opens the Monkey Head, see? Not like I ever need to go into the Monkey Head... ...but if they want it back, I've got to have my picker first. It's a matter of pride, you know. Guybrush : Why don't you just give me the key to the Monkey Head? Herman : No, I need it to get back my banana picker. Guybrush : Excuse me, I've got pressing business to attend to. Herman : Yes, me too. (looks at player) -- hee hee hee -- Guybrush goes back to the river fork. Realizing that the dam there is making the rest of the river dry, he decides to do something about it. He places a handful of gunpowder on the dam. Then, he opens the spyglass and finds a nifty lens inside it. He uses the lens, with the help of the sun, to burn the gunpowder... Suddenly the dam burst out and water starts flowing. Guybrush : AAA!!! He returns to the pond and finds out that it's now filled with water. The corpse is now on the ground, and he easily picks the rope from it. He returns to the river fork and climbs up the footholds. Uphill, he sees another note. Guybrush : \"To the Monkey Island™ Cannibals:\" \"Please stop moving this.\" \"It is delicately balanced.\" \"--Herman Toothrot\" He checks the 'primitive art' nearby. Guybrush : It's either an incisive representation of the futility of man... ...or it's a log and a couple of rocks. Guybrush walks up another foothold and finds himself on a high surface with the surrounding island scenery. Suddenly, Herman comes again. Herman : I never get tired of this view. Even if I HAVE been looking at it for twenty years now. Even if it is the ONLY view on the island. Guybrush : Yes, it IS a nice view. Excuse me, I've got pressing business to attend to. Herman : Yes, me too. (looks at player) -- hee hee hee -- Guybrush pushes the rock nearby and sees a huge rock floats and falls, and suddenly the rock is thrown right to the Sea Monkey far down the beach. The hit drowns the Sea Monkey. Guybrush : Whoops... He returns down and sees another note. Guybrush : \"Mr. Toothrot:\" \"Please remove this dangerous object.\" \"Lemonhead knocked a rock onto it from the cliff above and nearly injured someone who was putting up a swing on the banana tree on the south beach.\" \"--the Cannibals\" Guybrush pulls the 'primitive art' twice, changing its direction, and returns back up the foothold. He places another rock and pushes it. The rock hits the banana tree further down the beach. Guybrush : Wow! Looked like it hit the big banana tree on the beach! I bet the odd against that are incredible! Out of curiousity, Guybrush walks to the rightmost part of the platform. Suddenly, it breaks down! Guybrush falls down the mountain! +----------",

TITLE VII--ANTITERRORISM ASSISTANCE Sec. 701. Findings. Sec. 702. Antiterrorism assistance amendments. SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) The Congress finds and declares: (1) International terrorism remains a serious and deadly problem which threatens the interests of the United States both overseas and within its territory. States or organizations that practice terrorism or actively support it should not be allowed to do so without serious consequence. (2) International terrorism directed against United States interests must be confronted by the appropriate use of the full array of tools available to the President, including diplomatic, military, economic and prosecutive actions. (3) The Nation's security interests are seriously impacted by terrorist attacks carried out overseas against United States Government facilities, officials and other American citizens present in foreign countries. (4) United States foreign policy interests are profoundly affected by terrorist acts overseas especially those directed against friendly foreign governments and their people and those intended to undermine the peaceful resolution of disputes in the Middle East and other troubled regions. (5) Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, the peace initiative in the Middle East, and the fall of communism throughout Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, international terrorism has become a more complex problem, with new alliances emerging among terrorist organizations. (6) Violent crime is a pervasive international problem and is exacerbated by the free international movement of drugs, firearms, explosives and individuals dedicated to performing acts of international terrorism who travel using false or fraudulent documentation. (7) While international terrorists move freely from country to country, ordinary citizens and foreign visitors often fear to travel to or through certain parts of the world due to concern about terrorist violence. (8) In addition to the destruction of property and devastation to human life, the occurrence of an international terrorist event results in a decline of tourism and affects the marketplace, thereby having an adverse impact on interstate and foreign commerce and economies of friendly nations. (9) International terrorists, violating the sovereignty of foreign countries, attack dissidents and former colleagues living in foreign countries, including the United States. (10) International terrorists, both inside and outside the United States, carefully plan attacks and carry them out in foreign countries against innocent victims. (11) There are increasing intelligence indications of networking between different international terrorist organizations leading to their increased cooperation and sharing of information and resources in areas of common interest. (12) In response, increased international coordination of legal and enforcement issues is required, pursuant, for example, to the numerous multilateral conventions in force providing universal prosecutive jurisdiction over persons involved in a variety of terrorist acts, including hostage taking, murder of an internationally protected person, and aircraft piracy and sabotage. (13) Until recently, United States asylum processing procedures have been complicated and often duplicative, providing a powerful incentive for individuals, including terrorists, without a genuine claim, to apply for asylum and remain in the United States. (14) The United States Constitution grants Congress the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization and to make all laws necessary and proper thereto. (15) Part of that power authorizes the Congress to establish laws directly applicable to alien conduct within the United States that harms the foreign relations, domestic tranquility or national security of the United States. (16) While the vast majority of aliens justify the trust placed in them by United States immigration policies, an dangerous few utilized access to the United States to carry out their terrorist activity to the detriment of this Nation's national security and foreign policy interests. Accordingly, international terrorist organizations have been able to create significant infrastructures and cells in the United States among aliens who are in this country either temporarily or as permanent resident aliens. (17) International terrorist organizations, acting through affiliated groups and/or individuals, have been raising significant funds within the United States, often through misrepresentation of their purposes or subtle forms of extortion, or using the United States as a conduit for transferring funds among countries. (18) The provision of funds to organizations that engage in terrorism serves to facilitate their terrorist activities regardless of whether the funds, in whole or in part, are intended or claimed to be used for non-violent purposes. (19) Certain foreign governments and international terrorist organizations have directed their members or sympathizers residing in the United States to take measures in support of terrorist acts, either within or outside the United States. (20) Present Federal law does not adequately reach all terrorist activity likely to be engaged in by aliens within the United States. (21) Law enforcement officials have been hindered in using current immigration law to deport alien terrorists because the law fails to provide procedures to protect classified intelligence sources and information. Moreover, a few high ranking members of terrorist organizations have been naturalized as United States citizens because denial of such naturalizations would have necessitated public disclosure of highly classified sources and methods. Furthermore, deportation hearings frequently extend over several years, thus hampering the expeditious removal of aliens engaging in terrorist activity. (22) Present immigration law is inadequate to protect the United States from terrorist attacks by certain aliens. New procedures are needed to permit expeditious removal of alien terrorists from the United States, thereby reducing the threat that such aliens pose to the national security and other vital interests of the United States. (23) International terrorist organizations that have infrastructure support within the United States are believed to have been responsible for-- (A) conspiring in 1982 to bomb the Turkish Honorary Consulate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; (B) bombing the Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983; (C) holding Americans hostage in Lebanon from 1984- 1991; (D) hijacking in 1984 Kuwait Airlines Flight 221 during which two American employees of the Agency for International Development were murdered; (E) hijacking in 1985 TWA Flight 847 during which a United States Navy diver was murdered; (F) murdering in 1985 an American tourist aboard the Achille Lauro cruise liner; (G) hijacking in 1985 Egypt Air Flight 648 during which one American and one Israeli were killed; (H) murdering in 1985 four members of the United States Marine Corps in El Salvador; (I) attacking in December 1985 the Rome and Vienna airports resulting in the death of a young American girl; (J) hijacking in 1986 Pan Am Flight 73 in Karachi, Pakistan, in which 44 Americans were held hostage and two were killed; (K) conspiring in 1986 in New York City to bomb an Air India aircraft; (L) bombing in April 1988 the USO club in Naples, Italy, killing one American servicewoman and injuring four American servicemen; (M) attacking in 1988 the Greek cruise ship ``City of Poros''; (N) bombing in 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 resulting in 270 deaths; (O) bombing in 1989 UTA Flight 772 resulting in 171 deaths, including seven Americans; (P) murdering in 1989 a United States Marine Corps officer assigned to the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization in Lebanon; (Q) downing in January 1991 a United States military helicopter in El Salvador causing the death of a United States military crewman as a result of the crash and subsequently murdering its two surviving United States military crewmen; (R) bombing in February 1992 the United States Ambassador's residence in Lima, Peru; (S) bombing in February 1993 a cafe in Cairo, Egypt, which wounded two United States citizens; (T) bombing in February 1993 the World Trade Center in New York City, resulting in six deaths; (U) conspiring in the New York City area in 1993 to destroy several government buildings and tunnels; (V) wounding in October 1994 two United States citizens on a crowded street in Jerusalem, Israel; (W) kidnapping and subsequently murdering in October 1994 a dual citizen of the United States and Israel; and (X) numerous bombings and murders in Northern Ireland over the past decade. (24) Nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, can be used to create radioactive dispersal devices which are capable of causing serious bodily injury as well as substantial damage to property and the environment. (25) The potential use of nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, enhances the threat posed by terrorist activities and thereby has a greater effect on the security interests of the United States. (26) Due to the widespread hazards presented by the threat of nuclear contamination, as well as nuclear bombs, the United States has strong interest in assuring that persons who are engaged in the illegal acquisition and use of nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, are prosecuted for their offenses. (27) The threat that the nuclear materials will be obtained and used by terrorist and other criminal organizations has increased substantially due to international developments in the years since the enactment in 1982 of the legislation which implemented the Convention of the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, codified at section 831 of title 18, United States Code. (28) The successful effort to obtain agreements from other countries to dismantle and destroy nuclear weapons has resulted in increased packaging and transportation of nuclear materials, thereby creating more opportunities for their unlawful diversion or theft; (29) The illicit trafficking in the relatively more common, commercially available and useable nuclear and byproduct materials poses a potential to cause significant loss of life and/or environmental damage. (30) Reported trafficking incidents in the early 1990's suggest that the individuals involved in trafficking these materials from Eurasia and Eastern Europe frequently conducted their black market sales within the Federal Republic of Germany, the Baltic States, and to a lesser extent in the Middle European countries. (31) The international community has become increasingly concerned over the illegal possession of nuclear and nuclear byproduct materials. (32) The potentially disastrous ramifications of increased access by terrorists to nuclear and nuclear byproduct material pose such a significant future threat that the United States must use all lawful methods available to combat the illegal use of such materials. (33) The United States has an interest in encouraging United States corporations to do business in the countries which comprised the former Soviet Union, as well as in other developing democracies; protection of such corporations from threats created by the unlawful use of nuclear materials is important to encourage such business ventures, and to further the foreign relations and commerce of the United States. (34) The nature of nuclear contamination is such that it may affect the health, environment, and property of United States nationals even if the acts which constitute the illegal activity occur outside the territory of the United States, and are primarily directed toward non-nationals of the United States. (35) Plastic explosives were used by terrorists in the bombings of Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988 and UTA flight 772 in September 1989. (36) Plastic explosives currently can be used with little likelihood of detection for acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation, maritime navigation, and other modes of transportation. (37) The marking of plastic explosives for the purpose of detection would contribute significantly to the prevention and punishment of such unlawful acts. (38) In order to deter and detect the unlawful use of plastic explosives, the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for Purpose of Detection, done at Montreal on 1 March 1991, requires each contracting State to adopt appropriate measures to ensure that plastic explosives are duly marked and controlled. The Congress further finds: (39) Such international terrorist offenses place innocent lives in jeopardy, endanger national security, affect domestic tranquility, and gravely impact on interstate and foreign commerce. (40) Such international terrorist offenses involved international associations, communication, and mobility which can often be addressed effectively only at the Federal law enforcement level. (41) There previously has been no Federal criminal statute which provides a comprehensive basis for addressing acts of international terrorism carried out within the United States. (42) There previously has been no Federal provision that specifically prohibits fund raising within the United States on behalf of international terrorist organizations. (43) There previously has been no adequate procedure under the immigration law that permits the expeditious removal of resident and non-resident alien terrorists. (44) There previously has been no Federal criminal statute which provides adequate protection to United States interests from non-weapons grade, yet hazardous radioactive material, and from the illegal diversion of nuclear materials which are held for other than peaceful purposes. (45) There previously has been no Federal law that requires the marking of plastic explosives to improve their detectability. (46) Congress has the power under the interstate and foreign commerce clause, and other provisions of the Constitution, to enact the following measures against international terrorism in order to help ensure the integrity and safety of the Nation. (b) The purposes of this Act are to provide-- (1) Federal law enforcement the necessary tools and fullest possible basis allowed under the Constitution of the United States to address, pursuant to the rule of law, acts of international terrorism occurring within the United States, or directed against the United States or its nationals anywhere in the world; (2) the Federal Government the fullest possible basis, consistent with the Constitution, of the United States, to prevent persons and organizations within the jurisdiction of the United States from providing funds, directly or indirectly, to organizations, including subordinate or affiliated persons, designated by the President as engaging in terrorism, unless authorized under this Act; (3) procedures which, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness, will allow the government to deport resident and non-resident alien terrorists promptly without compromising intelligence sources and methods; (4) provide Federal law enforcement the necessary tools and fullest possible basis allowed under the Constitution of the United States to combat the threat of nuclear contamination and proliferation which may result from illegal possession and use of radioactive materials; and (5) fully implement the Convention on the Marking or Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, done at Montreal on 1 March 1991.

TITLE II--IMMIGRATION LAW IMPROVEMENTS SEC. 201. ALIEN TERRORIST REMOVAL PROCEDURES. (a) Findings and Purpose.-- (1) The Congress hereby finds that-- (A) international terrorism is a serious and deadly problem which threatens the interests of this Nation overseas and within our territory; (B) until recently, United States asylum processing procedures have been complicated and often duplicative, providing a powerful incentive for individuals, including terrorists, without a genuine claim, to apply for asylum and remain in the United States; (C) while most aliens justify the trust placed in them by our immigration policies, a dangerous few utilized access to the United States to create significant infrastructures and cells in the United States in order to carry out their terrorist activity to the detriment of the Nation's national security and foreign policy interests; (D) the bombing of the World Trade Center exemplifies the danger posed to the United States and its citizens by alien terrorists; (E) similarly, some foreign terrorist organizations utilize associated aliens within the United States to raise funds to facilitate their overseas terrorist acts against United States nationals as well as against foreign governments and their citizens; and (F) current immigration laws and procedures are not effective in addressing the alien terrorist problem, as they require the government to place sensitive intelligence sources and methods at risk and allow the alien to remain within the United States for the prolonged period necessary to pursue a deportation action. Moreover, under the current statutory framework a few high ranking members of terrorist organizations have been naturalized as United States citizens because denial of such naturalizations would have necessitated public disclosure of highly classified sources and methods. (2) The purpose of this section is to provide procedures which, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness, will allow the government to deport alien terrorists promptly without compromising intelligence sources and methods. (b) Alien Removal Procedures.--The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended-- (1) by adding at the end of the table of contents the following: ``TITLE V--ALIEN TERRORIST REMOVAL PROCEDURES ``Sec. 501. Applicability. ``Sec. 502. Special removal hearing. ``Sec. 503. Designation of judges. ``Sec. 504. Miscellaneous provisions.''; and (2) by adding at the end the following new title: ``TITLE V--ALIEN TERRORIST REMOVAL PROCEDURES ``Applicability ``Sec. 501. (a) The provisions of this title may be followed in the discretion of the Department of Justice whenever the Department of Justice has classified information that an alien described in paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), as amended, is subject to deportation because of such section. For purposes of this title, the terms `classified information' and `national security' shall have the meaning prescribed in section 1 of the Classified Information Procedures Act, 18 U.S.C. App. III 1. ``(b) Whenever an official of the Department of Justice files, under section 502, an application with the court established under section 503 for authorization to seek removal pursuant to the provisions of this title, the alien's rights regarding removal and expulsion shall be governed solely by the provisions of this title. Except as they are specifically referenced, no other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act shall be applicable. An alien subject to removal under these provisions shall have no right of discovery of information derived from electronic surveillance authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) or otherwise for national security purposes. Nor shall such alien have the right to seek suppression of evidence. Further, the government is authorized to use, in the removal proceedings, the fruits of electronic surveillance and/or unconsented physical searches authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act without regard to subsections 106(c), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of that Act. The provisions and requirements of section 3504 of title 18, United States Code, shall not apply to procedures under this title. ``(c) This title is enacted in response to findings of Congress that aliens described in paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), as amended, represent a unique threat to the security of the United States. It is the intention of Congress that such aliens be promptly removed from the United States following-- ``(1) a judicial determination of probable cause to believe that such person is such an alien; and ``(2) a judicial determination pursuant to the provisions of this title that an alien is removable on the grounds that he or she is an alien described in paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), as amended. The Congress furthers intends that, other than as provided by this title, such aliens shall not be given a deportation hearing and are ineligible for any discretionary relief from deportation or for relief under section 243(h). ``Special Removal Hearing ``Sec. 502. (a) Whenever removal of an alien is sought pursuant to the provisions of this title, a written application upon oath or affirmation shall be submitted in camera and ex parte to the court established under section 503 for an order authorizing such a procedure. Each application shall require the approval of the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General based upon his finding that it satisfies the criteria and requirements of such application as set forth in this title. Each application shall include-- ``(1) the identity of the Department of Justice attorney making the application; ``(2) the approval of the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General for the making of the application; ``(3) the identity of the alien for whom authorization for the special removal procedure is sought; and ``(4) a statement of the facts and circumstances relied on by the Department of Justice to establish that-- ``(A) the alien is an alien as described in paragraph 4(B) of section 214(a), as amended, and is physically present in the United States; and ``(B) with respect to such alien, adherence to the provisions of title II regarding the deportation of aliens would pose a risk to the national security of the United States. ``(b)(1) The application shall be filed under seal with the court established under section 503. The Attorney General may take into custody any alien with respect to whom such an application has been filed and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, may retain such an alien in custody in accordance with the procedures authorized by this title. ``(2) An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (hereafter referred to as resident alien) shall be entitled to a release hearing before the judge assigned to the special removal case pursuant to section 503(a). The resident alien shall be granted release pending the special removal hearing, upon such terms and conditions prescribed by the court (including the posting of any monetary amount), if the alien demonstrates to the court that the alien, if released, is not likely to flee and that the alien's release will not endanger national security or the safety of any person or the community. The judge may consider classified information submitted in camera and ex parte in making his determination. ``(c) In accordance with the rules of the court established under section 503, the judge shall consider the application and may consider other information, including classified information, presented under oath or affirmation at an in camera and ex parte hearing on the application. A verbatim record shall be maintained of such a hearing. The application and any other evidence shall be considered by a single judge of that court who shall enter an ex parte order as requested if he finds, on the basis of the facts submitted in the application and any other information provided by the Department of Justice at the in camera and ex parte hearing, there is probable cause to believe that-- ``(1) the alien who is the subject of the application has been correctly identified and is an alien as described in paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), as amended; and ``(2) adherence to the provisions of title II regarding the deportation of the identified alien would pose a risk to the national security of the United States. ``(d)(1) In any case in which the application for the order is denied, the judge shall prepare a written statement of his reasons for the denial and the Department of Justice may seek a review of the denial by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by notice of appeal which must be filed within twenty days. In such a case the entire record of the proceeding shall be transmitted to the Court of Appeals under seal and the Court of Appeals shall hear the matter ex parte. ``(2) If the Department of Justice does not seek review, the alien shall be released from custody, unless such alien may be arrested and taken into custody pursuant to title II as an alien subject to deportation, in which case such alien shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of this Act concerning the deportation of aliens. ``(3) If the application for the order is denied because the judge has not found probable cause to believe that the alien who is the subject of the application has been correctly identified or is an alien as described in paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), as amended, and the Department of Justice seeks review, the alien shall be released from custody unless such alien may be arrested and taken into custody pursuant to title II as an alien subject to deportation, in which case such alien shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of this Act concerning the deportation of aliens simultaneously with the application of this title. ``(4) If the application for the order is denied because, although the judge found probable cause to believe that the alien who is the subject of the application has been correctly identified and is an alien as described in paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), as amended, the judge has found that there is not probable cause to believe that adherence to the provisions of title II regarding the deportation of the identified alien would pose a risk to the national security of the United States, the judge shall release the alien from custody subject to the least restrictive condition or combination of conditions of release described in section 3142(b) and (c)(1)(B) (i) through (xiv) of title 18, United States Code, that will reasonably assure the appearance of the alien at any future proceeding pursuant to this title and will not endanger the safety of any other person or the Community; but if the judge finds no such condition or combination of conditions the alien shall remain in custody until the completion of any appeal authorized by this title. The provisions of sections 3145 through 3148 of title 18, United States Code, pertaining to review and appeal of a release or detention order, penalties for failure to appear, penalties for an offense committed while on release, and sanctions for violation of a release condition shall apply to an alien to whom the previous sentence applies and-- ``(A) for purposes of section 3145 of such title an appeal shall be taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit; and ``(B) for purposes of section 3146 of such title the alien shall be considered released in connection with a charge of an offense punishable by life imprisonment. ``(e)(1) In any case in which the application for the order authorizing the special procedures of this title is approved, the judge who granted the order shall consider each item of classified information the Department of Justice proposes to introduce in camera and ex parte at the special removal hearing and shall order the introduction of such information pursuant to subsection (j) if he determines the information to be relevant. The Department of Justice shall prepare a written summary of such classified information which does not pose a risk to national security and the judge shall approve the summary if he finds the summary is sufficient to inform the alien of the general nature of the evidence that he is an alien as described in paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), as amended, and to permit the alien to prepare a defense. The Department of Justice shall cause to be delivered to the alien a copy of the summary. ``(2) If the written summary is not approved by the court, the Department shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to correct the deficiencies identified by the court and submit a revised summary. Thereafter, if the written summary is not approved by the court, the special removal hearing shall be terminated unless the court issues a finding that-- ``(A) the continued presence of the alien in the United States, or ``(B) the provision of the required summary would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the national security or death or serious bodily injury to any person. If such finding is issued, the special removal hearing shall continue, the Department of Justice shall cause to be delivered to the alien a statement that no summary is possible, and the classified information submitted in camera and ex parte may be used pursuant to subsection (j). ``(3) The Department of Justice may take an interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit of-- ``(A) any determination by the judge pursuant to paragraph (1)-- ``(I) concerning whether an item of evidence may be introduced in camera and ex parte; or ``(II) concerning the contents of any summary of evidence to be introduced in camera and ex parte prepared pursuant to paragraph (1); or ``(B) the refusal of the court to make the finding permitted by paragraph (2); In any interlocutory appeal taken pursuant to this paragraph, the entire record, including any proposed order of the judge or summary of evidence, shall be transmitted to the Court of Appeals under seal and the matter shall be heard ex parte. The Court of Appeals shall consider the appeal as expeditiously as possible. ``(f) In any case in which the application for the order is approved, the special removal hearing authorized by this section shall be conducted for the purpose of determining if the alien to whom the order pertains should be removed from the United States on the grounds that he is an alien as described in paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), as amended. In accordance with subsection (e), the alien shall be given reasonable notice of the nature of the charges against him and a general account of the basis for the charges. The alien shall be given notice, reasonable under all the circumstances, of the time and place at which the hearing will be held. The hearing shall be held as expeditiously as possible. ``(g) The special removal hearing shall be held before the same judge who granted the order pursuant to subsection (e) unless that judge is deemed unavailable due to illness or disability by the chief judge of the court established pursuant to section 503, or has died, in which case the chief judge shall assign another judge to conduct the special removal hearing. A decision by the chief judge pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be subject to review by either the alien or the Department of Justice. ``(h) The special removal hearing shall be open to the public. The alien shall have a right to be present at such hearing and to be represented by counsel. Any alien financially unable to obtain counsel shall be entitled to have counsel assigned to represent him. Such counsel shall be appointed by the judge pursuant to the plan for furnishing representation for any person financially unable to obtain adequate representation for the district in which the hearing is conducted, as provided for in section 3006A of title 18, United States Code. All provisions of that section shall apply and, for purposes of determining the maximum amount of compensation, the matter shall be treated as if a felony was charged. The alien may be called as a witness by the Department of Justice. The alien shall have a right to introduce evidence on his own behalf. Except as provided in subsection (j), the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him and to cross-examine any witness. A verbatim record of the proceedings and of all testimony and evidence offered or produced at such a hearing shall be kept. The decision of the judge shall be based only on the evidence introduced at the hearing, including evidence introduced under subsection (j). ``(i) At any time prior to the conclusion of the special removal hearing, either the alien or the Department of Justice may request the judge to issue a subpoena for the presence of a named witness (which subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce books, papers, documents, or other objects designated therein) upon a satisfactory showing that the presence of the witness is necessary for the determination of any material matter. Such a request may be made ex parte except that the judge shall inform the Department of Justice of any request for a subpoena by the alien for a witness or material if compliance with such a subpoena would reveal evidence or the source of evidence which has been introduced, or which the Department of Justice has received permission to introduce, in camera and ex parte pursuant to subsection (j), and the Department of Justice shall be given a reasonable opportunity to oppose the issuance of such a subpoena. If an application for a subpoena by the alien also makes a showing that the alien is financially unable to pay for the attendance of a witness so requested, the court may order the costs incurred by the process and the fees of the witness so subpoenaed to be paid for from funds appropriated for the enforcement of title II. A subpoena under this subsection may be served anywhere in the United States. A witness subpoenaed under this subsection shall receive the same fees and expenses as a witness subpoenaed in connection with a civil proceeding in a court of the United States. Nothing in this subsection is intended to allow an alien to have access to classified information. ``(j) When classified information has been summarized pursuant to subsection (e)(1) or where a finding has been made under subsection (e)(2) that no summary is possible, classified information shall be introduced (either in writing or through testimony) in camera and ex parte and neither the alien nor the public shall be informed of such evidence or its sources other than through reference to the summary provided pursuant to subsection (e)(1). Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Department of Justice may, in its discretion and, in the case of classified information, after coordination with the originating agency, elect to introduce such evidence in open session. ``(k) Evidence introduced at the special removal hearing, either in open session or in camera and ex parte, may, in the discretion of the Department of Justice, include all or part of the information presented under subsections (a) through (c) used to obtain the order for the hearing under this section. ``(l) Following the receipt of evidence, the attorneys for the Department of Justice and for the alien shall be given fair opportunity to present argument as to whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the removal of the alien. The attorney for the Department of Justice shall open the argument. the attorney for the alien shall be permitted to reply. The attorney for the Department of Justice shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal. The judge may allow any part of the argument that refers to evidence received in camera and ex parte to be heard in camera and ex parte. ``(m) The Department of Justice has the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the alien is subject to removal because he is an alien as described in paragraph 4(B) of subsection 241(a) of this Act (8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(4)(B)), as amended. If the judge finds that the Department of Justice has met this burden, the judge shall order the alien removed and, if the alien is a resident alien who was released pending the special removal hearing, order the Attorney General to take the alien into custody. ``(n)(1) At the time of rendering a decision as to whether the alien shall be removed, the judge shall prepare a written order containing a statement of facts found and conclusions of law. Any portion of the order that would reveal the substance or source of information received in camera and ex parte pursuant to subsection (j) shall not be made available to the alien or the public. ``(2) The decision of the judge may be appealed by either the alien or the Department of Justice to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by notice of appeal which must be filed within twenty days, during which time such order shall not be executed.

The Court of Appeals shall consider the case as expeditiously as possible. ``(3) In an appeal to the Court of Appeals pursuant to either subsection (d) or (e) of this section, the Court of Appeals shall review questions of law de novo, but a prior finding on any question of fact shall not be set aside unless such finding was clearly erroneous. ``(o) If the judge decides pursuant to subsection (n) that the alien should not be removed, the alien shall be released from custody unless such alien may be arrested and taken into custody pursuant to title II of this Act as an alien subject to deportation, in which case, for purposes of detention, such alien may be treated in accordance with the provisions of this Act concerning the deportation of aliens. ``(p) Following a decision by the Court of Appeals pursuant to either subsection (d) or (n), either the alien or the Department of Justice may petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. In any such case, any information transmitted to the Court of Appeals under seal shall, if such information is also submitted to the Supreme Court, be transmitted under seal. Any order of removal shall not be stayed pending disposition of a writ of certiorari except as provided by the Court of Appeals or a Justice of the Supreme Court. ``(q) The Department of Justice retains the right to dismiss a removal action at any stage of the proceeding. ``(r) Nothing in this section shall prevent the United States from seeking protective orders and/or asserting privileges ordinarily available to the United States to protect against the disclosure of classified information, including the invocation of the military and state secrets privileges. ``Designation of Judges ``Sec. 503.

Any alien in custody pursuant to this subsection shall be released from custody solely at the discretion of the Attorney General and subject to such conditions as the Attorney General shall deem appropriate. The determinations and actions of the Attorney General pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to judicial review, including application for a writ of habeas corpus, except for a claim by the alien that continued detention violates his rights under the Constitution. Jurisdiction over any such challenge shall lie exclusively in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. ``(b)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the Attorney General may hold in abeyance the removal of an alien who has been ordered removed pursuant to this title to allow the trial of such alien on any Federal or State criminal charge and the service of any sentence of confinement resulting from such a trial. ``(2) Pending the commencement of any service of a sentence of confinement by an alien described in paragraph (1), such an alien shall remain in the custody of the Attorney General, unless the Attorney General determines that temporary release of the alien to the custody of State authorities for confinement in a State facility is appropriate and would not endanger national security or public safety. ``(3) Following the completion of a sentence of confinement by an alien described in paragraph (1) or following the completion of State criminal proceedings which do not result in a sentence of confinement of an alien released to the custody of State authorities pursuant to paragraph (2), such an alien shall be returned to the custody of the Attorney General who shall proceed to carry out the provisions of subsection (a) concerning removal of the alien. ``(c) For purposes of section 751 and 752 of title 18, United States Code, an alien in the custody of the Attorney General pursuant to this title shall be subject to the penalties provided by those sections in relation to a person committed to the custody of the Attorney General by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony. ``(d)(1) An alien in the custody of the Attorney General pursuant to this title shall be given reasonable opportunity to communicate with and receive visits from members of his family, and to contact, retain, and communicate with an attorney. ``(2) An alien in the custody of the Attorney General pursuant to this title shall have the right to contact an appropriate diplomatic or consular official of the alien's country of citizenship or nationality or of any country providing representation services therefor.

Following such an objection, the court shall take suitable action to determine whether the response is admissible and, in doing so, shall take precautions to guard against the compromise of any classified information. Such action may include permitting the United States to provide the court, ex parte, with a proffer of the witness's response to the question or line of inquiry, and requiring the defendant to provide the court with a proffer of the nature of the information he seeks to elicit. ``(C) Appeal.--If the court enters an order denying relief to the United States under this subsection, the United States may take an immediate interlocutory appeal in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection. ``(3) Interlocutory appeal.-- ``(A) An interlocutory appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order of a district court authorizing the disclosure of classified information, imposing sanctions for nondisclosure of classified information, or refusing a protective order sought by the United States to prevent the disclosure of classified information. ``(B) An appeal taken pursuant to this section either before or during trial shall be expedited by the court of appeals.

The company confirmed that the PAC was incorporated on Monday after it was reported that it had registered the Internet domains for Fbpac.org and Fbpac.us.\n\nFacebook has steadily increased its presence in Washington as it has grown.

  "latent_20673": "Toronto’s leading class warrior is a millionaire businessman who drives a luxury SUV, vacations in Europe, owns properties in Florida, counted the late Conservative finance minister as a personal friend, and inherited his company from his politician father. Doug Ford, wealthy and privileged mayoral candidate, has launched his last-minute campaign with a withering attack on the wealth and privilege of frontrunner John Tory.\n\nDoug Ford's story has all the earmarks of a privileged background not unlike the one for which he criticizes John Tory. ( DAVID COOPER / TORONTO STAR )\n\nOver the course of three days, he has said Tory is “from a whole different world,” called Tory a “downtown elite” who is “out of touch,” referred to a Tory “chauffeur,” argued that Tory is accustomed to a “silver platter,” and suggested Tory thinks he is superior to people who live in public housing. The rise of Rob Ford was fuelled by alienation and resentment among lower-income suburban voters. Doug Ford, his brother, is attempting to harness the same anti-establishment grievance to try to chip away at Tory’s high approval rating and substantial lead. Ford’s eyebrow-raising line of populist criticism has prompted howls of “hypocrisy!” — and wide-eyed laughter from Tory, who called Ford’s accusations “hilarious” at a debate on Tuesday.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nWhen Ford claimed Thursday that he, unlike Tory, built his wealth on his own, Andray Domise, who is running against Rob Ford for the Etobicoke council seat Doug Ford is vacating, wondered on Twitter if he was experiencing “real life.” Ford strenuously insists he is no hypocrite. Whenever reminded of his own riches, he argues that he is talking not about Tory’s wealth, precisely, but a certain brand of white-shoe sneer. He said Thursday: “I’ve been in thousands of factories, dealing with people, and that’s not the case with my competitors.” “I don’t think it’s that important that they have money or don’t have money — the notion that the Fords are rich,” said pollster and conservative strategist Dimitri Pantazopoulos. “It’s kind of like the difference between the Beverly Hillbillies and the Rockefellers. They want to be the Beverly Hillbillies, and say, ‘Look, we’re just like you except we have money, and Tory is like the Rockefellers.’” The cheap suit doesn’t fit Doug Ford like it fit Rob Ford in 2010. Rob Ford was known to be rich, too, but his rumpled jackets, beige minivan and just-folks manner lent the appearance of authenticity to the man-of-the-people narrative. Doug Ford’s slicker appearance, unconcealed taste for the finer things, and hard-edged personality make the pitch a tougher sell. “But it’s about all he’s got to play with, at this point, and you play your best card,” said Pantazopoulos, who did an internal poll for Rob Ford’s 2010 campaign and has worked with Tory aide Nick Kouvalis on a Liberal campaign in British Columbia.\n\nFord appears to be attempting to sway the lower-income voters Olivia Chow is also trying to secure. But it could be Chow who benefits. She can appear positive and above the fray as Ford does the Tory-tarnishing she might otherwise have had to run negative advertisements to achieve. And all the talk of family bequests may remind voters of her own early poverty.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n“I think where a person’s background comes from — I can just talk about myself, because I know what life is like when life is tough. The other two candidates may not know that,” she said when asked about Ford’s attacks Thursday. Tory, keen to project confidence and calm, has declined to directly engage in a no-win tit-for-tat with Ford on the subject of money. His spokeswoman, Amanda Galbraith, said Thursday that he, unlike Ford, has used his privilege to help the city. “There are different ways to look at advantages that you’re given in life, and how you respond,” she said. “And I think John has responded by giving an immense amount of his time to charity and back into the Toronto community. And I think we should take a good look at the Fords, who arguably had similar advantages, and what Doug has done with his time — which is dividing, calling people names, going on council and calling people ‘monkeys.’” Ford maintains the issue is not about advantages at all — just attitude. In an interview in August, he defined “elites” as people who “look at you like they are better than you, their nose up in the air, like they’ve never done anything wrong.” “It has nothing to do with money,” he said. “Our thing with the elites has nothing to do with money.” With files from Betsy Powell and David Rider\n\nRead more about:",
  "latent_20720": "The revolution of blockchain is upon us, with the smartest and brightest minds in the world trying to work out its implications and its application. So far its widely-known application has been on Bitcoin, the crypto currency created in 2009 by a person using the alias 'Satoshi Nakamoto'. Bitcoin enables decentralised transactions without any credit card or central bank intervention. It allows users to transfer currency with the help of the Internet, and blockchain is the underlying technology that helps clearing transactions and supports the process of mining and pricing bitcoins.\n\nIt is critical to secure bitcoin wallets from hackers. Bitcoin transactions are not reversible and are anonymous with a two-factor authentication, thereby making it safe. But the backup location should also be protected,” says Rajashekara V. Maiya, AVP and Head – Finacle Product Strategy, EdgeVerve.\n\nEvery time a transaction happens, it needs to be verified and validated between the members of a network. The process of verification is carried out by ‘miners’ who create a ‘block’ of all the transactions occurring over the bitcoin network in every few minutes. The banks/ members of the network only are privy to the transactions performed, under blockchain technology.\n\nBlockchain technology is a distributed ledger technology that allows banks to modernise legacy processes, reduce costs, enhance operational efficiencies and provide authenticity of transaction data. However, it should be remembered that blockchain-based applications cannot be used by a bank in isolation. A network of banks should be in agreement to leverage this technology. It dissuades the need for any central authority.\n\nWhy India needs Bitcoin?\n\nGiven that 60 percent of the population in India is unbanked, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Reserve Bank of India uphold financial inclusion as top priority. Therefore, India is viewed by many to have significant potential for Bitcoin usage and adoption. The primary ways to obtain Bitcoin are buying on an exchange, mining new ones and accepting them for goods and services.\n\nA financial infrastructure based on Bitcoin and its underlying technology blockchain is likely to herald a revolution like Internet did. The stored currency notes can be stolen easily but one can recover Bitcoin wallet at any point of time by locating wallet words or wallet backup folder. Bitcon was fundamentally created to solve the problem of creating a digital property such a decentralised digital ledger, keeping track of all transactions and retaining the accuracy of the data. Currently, the value of one Bitcoin is Rs 44,254.66.\n\nVery similar to the Internet, Bitcoin is a free-to-join, open-source decentralised network. Just like mobile phones helped India skip the landline generation in connecting a billion Indians, embracing Bitcoins can help India skip the current generation of financial infrastructure and move India directly to the future of finance,” says Saurabh Agrawal, Co-Founder, Zebpay, a mobile Bitcoin company.\n\nZebpay has over 65,000 users, who use the app to buy, sell, store and spend bitcoins. With around 15,000 users are added every month, the company aims at adding one lakh users by end of 2016. On an average, more than 5,000 transactions are done on Zebpay per day. The startup did Rs 250 crore trade turnover in last one year. It did more than 120,000 transactions in the month of June. This year, the startup has raised $1 million in Series-A funding.\n\nWorld Bank's annual report stated that India was the world's largest remittance recipient in 2015, despite experiencing a $1-billion drop from the previous year, the first decline in its remittances since 2009. India retained its top spot in 2015, attracting about $69 billion in remittances, down from $70 billion in 2014.\n\n“In India, which happens to be the biggest market for remittance at over $70 billion, the highest transaction amount is as low as $200. Even for such amounts, users pay about 15 percent fees to the banks or other intermediaries. Once implemented, blockchain can allow the remitters to save about $7 billion. As compared to China, which does over Rs 10,000 crore per day, India is still at a nascent stage for adoption of blockchain,” says Rajashekara.\n\nState of Bitcoin adoption in India\n\nBitcoin witnessed a slow beginning in India. However, banks are now acknowledging its advantages. According to an analyst, Bitcoin trade in the country has grown rapidly, at an estimated Rs 500 crore per year, with 50,000 Bitcoin wallets and over 700-800 Bitcoins being operated every day.\n\n“The global Bitcoin trade is skyrocketing, touching $35 billion per month in December 2015. Billion-dollar companies like Dell, Expedia, Overstock, Rakuten (Japan’s Flipkart) have started accepting Bitcoins on their websites. Bitcoin companies raised almost $1 billion in VC funding in 2015,” says Saurabh.\n\nMohit Kalra, Founder and CEO of Coinsecure, is of the view that 2016 will also witness a growth of use of Bitcoin for services such as remittance, charitable donations and international payment gateways. Delhi-based Coinsecure offers an algorithmic trading bitcoin exchange, a blockchain explorer, free APIs for all their products. Recently, it raised over $1.2 million from angel investors.\n\nSupply and demand of Bitcoin\n\nSince the mining industry is not as strong in India as it is globally, the country has witnessed a huge demand. Owing to the dearth of supply, Bitcoin prices sometimes go up to 3-4 percent, as compared to global exchanges such as Bitstamp or BTC-E. The need of the hour is to develop a strong Bitcoin industry in India, to bridge the demand-supply gap and prevent users from relying on global sources.\n\nThe supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million units and approximately 15 million are already in circulation, as per various reports. Until mid- 2016, the Bitcoin mining reward was 25 bitcoins per block (approximately every ten minutes) and is scheduled to halve to 12.5 Bitcoins per block for four years. On July 9, the Bitcoin mining reward dropped by 50 percent and has been reduced to 12.5 BTC, which may have significant impact on the miners.\n\nLegality of Bitcoin in India\n\nIn 2013, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India ruled out the adoption of Bitcoin, making a statement that RBI had no plans to regulate it. The concept of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin is still in its nascent stage in India and does not have regulatory clarity.\n\nAccording to Nishith Desai, Founder of law firm Nishith Desai Associates, Bitcoin are not illegal in India and this is in consonance with an international approach.\n\nA proper regulatory framework around Bitcoin will automatically increase the adoption rate among merchants and consumers in India. RBI governor Raghuram Rajan had noted in a statement that digital currencies such as Bitcoin would be helpful in the transition towards a cashless society.\n\nThe white paper by Nishith Desai Associates on Bitcoin stated that the recent past has seen an enormous growth in Bitcoin as a form of payment. This is because the fee charged in case of making payments with the use of Bitcoin is lower than the general 2-3 percent interest imposed by credit card processors.\n\nThe RBI, which has not yet come out with an ultimate verdict, has issued a press release cautioning users, holders and traders of virtual currencies about the potential financial, operational, legal and security related risks.\n\nTop cities in terms of trading over the past six months are Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Chennai,” says Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-founder, Unocoin. a bitcoin service provider which has more than 80,000 users and its web traffic has increased to more than 1,000 per cent over the last one year. Unocoin offers people Rs 200 for free on signing up.\n\nPropelling the future of business\n\nRecently, Infosys launched a blockchain framework at Finacle to allow customers to overhaul and simplify complex, transaction-driven services. This is a permitted ledger, which will help banks deploy blockchain-based services for various business areas. It also offers support to international, cross-border transactional business and enables secure, peer-to-peer transactions that can be verified without any centralised authority.\n\nOur blockchain solutions development is undertaken in R&D centres in India and Ireland. We have over 40 employees certified in this technology from Blockchain University in US. Further, it can be applied across several industries, in addition to the financial sector and enable the company to co-innovate with clients,” says Rajashekara.\n\nIBM in its recent study on blockchain revealed that financial services, supply chains, Internet of Things (IoT), risk management, digital rights management and healthcare are some of the areas that are poised for dramatic change using blockchain networks. With its open source contributions and resources for blockchain software developers, IBM is advancing the science of blockchain to remove complexity, making it more accessible.",

It took over five years of legal battle to see the case to its logical end, scaling right up to the country’s apex court. Not stopping at that, Gaikwad, who was a deputy director with the state agriculture department,, at the time, sought compensation from the lady and has now been awarded Rs 10 lakh as damages.The case dates back to November 2008. Sunanda Kurhade, also a deputy director in the agriculture department, filed a complaint against Gaikwad alleging that he had molested her while they were travelling together in an official car on November 5, 2008. Five days later, she filed an internal complaint with the commissioner of the department and on November 19 an FIR with the cops. Back then,was in her 30s while Gaikwad was 57, only a few months away from his retirement in May 2009.A day after the FIR, Gaikwad was arrested and released on bail. He proceeded on leave and contemplated voluntary retirement. He even left his Pune house, choosing to move to his wife’s village. While on the one hand he had to appear for an internal inquiry, regular appearances in court were required as cops had filed a chargesheet. All along, he pleaded innocence, arguing that Kurhade was in the race for the same post as he was.In April 2010, the additional chief judicial magistrate acquitted him. “It can be inferred that the complainant in order to get appointment for the post of coordinator, implicated the accused in a false, frivolous complaint,”ordered on April 28, 2010. The cops appealed in higher courts but were not successful. Kurhade, too, approached thebut in vain. Lastly she filed a special leave petition in, which was also dismissed in 2014, leaving no doubt that Gaikwad was innocent and that he had been falsely implicated.The internal inquiry, however found him guilty. Gaikwad challenged the inquiry report before the Governor and was declared innocent. It was found that the driver of the official vehicle in which the alleged incident took place was never questioned in the internal inquiry.Having cleared his name at all levels, Gaikwad filed a defamation case against Kurhade in Pune’sin June 2012. He sought Rs 60 lakhs from her — Rs 50 lakhs is what he claimed he would have earned had he notched the coordinator’s job, and Rs 10 lakhs for loss of reputation. On January 6, 2017, Magistrate CPordered that Kurhade has to pay damages to the tune of Rs 10 lakhs to Gaikwad within two months. “On failure to pay the amount within aforesaid time, defendant (Kurhade) shall pay six per cent per annum interest on Rs 10 lakhs till the realisation of amount,” the order stated.While Gaikwad is yet to get the money, he is a happy man. A full time farmer on a farm owned by his wife invillage, 30 kms from Pune, he said that he can sleep peacefully now. “For years I couldn’t sleep properly. Everyone around me knew that the complaint was false and yet only a few stood by me. I was caught between trips to the department and courts in Pune, Mumbai and even Delhi. It took a lot for me to prove my innocence. I had made up my mind that I won’t give up ever,” said Gaikwad.He explained that once he had been given a clean chit by HC, he decided to sue his former colleague, whom he treated “like a daughter”.“My reputation had been dented. From being a straight forward deputy director in the agriculture department with not a single blot on my career of 35 years, I had become this monster who had apparently molested a lady much younger than him. Some of my close associates and friends gave up on me. Fortunately, my wife and two kids stood by me. Now I feel so much better.

  "latent_21252": "Israel’s Netanyahu boasts about making fools of Americans\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has boasted about how he has defied the United States by building Jewish squatter colonies “in a smart way, in a quiet way”, +972 Magazine’s Noam Sheizaf reports.\n\nAddressing young Likud supporters, Netanyahu said: “I was threatened in Washington: ‘not one brick’ [of Jewish squatter colony construction]… after five years, we built a little more than one brick…”\n\nAsked “about peace talks with the Palestinians”, Netanyahu joked: “about the – what?” to which the audience responded by breaking out into laughter.\n\nAccording to Sheizaf, Netanyahu’s quotes were posted online by Akiva Lamm, a Likud member from Kiryat Arba, a Jewish squatter colony near Hebron. Sheizaf reports that Lamm had asked Netanyahu a question on the lack of new construction in his home squatter colony, and on Israel’s prisoner releases during the American-led negotiations with the Palestinians. This was Netanyahu’s reply – as translated by Sheizaf:\n\nWhen I entered the Prime Minister’s Office for my second term, I was summoned to Washington. “Not one brick,” they told me [referring to squatter colony construction in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem]. I was threatened specifically: “Not one brick.” The pressure from the international community and the Americans was enormous. I don’t think anyone in Israel was under such pressure. And still, after five years on the job, we built a little more than “one brick”. But the important thing is to do it in a smart way, in a quiet way, without inflammatory statements. Do you think it’s a problem for me to say, “I am a hero, I am strong, I don’t care about anything, what do I care what the world says?’” I don’t have any problem saying that, but it would be a lie. Whoever tells you that doesn’t deserve to be prime minister; he is a populist. This is not a feature leader. A leader knows to stand up to international pressure by manoeuvring. Imagine yourself standing on a hill overlooking the whole valley. You get to see all the obstacles below from above – some from the right and some from the left – and then when you walk down, you know exactly where to go in order to avoid the obstacles. What matters is that we continue to head straight toward our goal, even if one time we walk right and another time walk left.\n\nSheizaf relates that Netanyahu then went on to speak about how important US support is, and how well his speeches were received by the US Congress. This, he said, reminded Lamm of similar remarks Netanyahu made 10 years ago, when he explained how he was able to manipulate the Clinton administration and debunk the Oslo accords.\n\nWhat will it take for the American people to wake up and realize that Israel is not only devouring their hard-earned tax dollars to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity, but, for gratitude, is spitting in their faces and boasting about taking the US for a ride?",

Related Links Expedition Six Video Gallery Expedition Six Crew Answers Ask the Expert Space Research International Space Station Payload Information Source International Space Station Science Operation News Science at NASA Science at NASA Space Station Astrophotography Saturday Morning Science Strange Clouds Expedition Six\n\nSpace Chronicles #13 < Previous | Next > By: ISS Science Officer Don Pettit Growing Plants in Zero-G Growing plants in the weightless environment of an orbiting spacecraft is much harder than meets the eye. Having a supply of tomato and basil seeds I tried my hand at growing them with results proving that it is not as easy as the first time I tried this for science class in second grade. I do not have the necessary ingredients to grow healthy plants to fruition. We have no dirt on space station. I have no soil or soil substitute and no fertilizer to supply the necessary macro and micronutrients throughhydroponics. However, it is possible to investigate sprouting where the new plant structures live off the nutrients from their seed starch. The best I could expect is to have healthy seedlings for a few days and then have them turn yellow, wither, and die as they starve for the lack of potassium, fixed nitrogen compounds, and all the other micronutrients. With this end in mind, I set out to construct a 0g sprouter. Lacking soil, you need some sort of substrate that will retain both seeds and water. I considered using an old shirt or sock but decided the Russian supplied toilet paper was best. This toilet paper is not like what you normally think of as toilet paper. It consisted of two layers of coarsely woven gauze, 4 by 6 inches in dimension sewn together at the edges with a layer of brown tissue sandwiched in-between. It works very well for its intended purpose. It also makes a wonderful sprouter. It retains water well and the seeds can be anchored under the gauze weft. My first thoughts were to arrange the seeds in little rows on the rectilinear squares of toilet paper. Only then did it occur to me that being on space station could offer new possibilities. Why not a spherical planter? Every direction is the same as the rest and a sphere would offer some interesting possibilities. The limited lighting, both from window and artificial sources, can be shared by the spherical surface if the sphere is attached to a string and allowed to freely rotate in the air currents. It will then be constantly moving and bobbing around like a helium balloon on a string and thus share the lighting with all its surfaces. The plants can enjoy the 1/R^2 potential given by spherical geometry. A spherical geometry gives increasing surface area as the plants radially expand, surface area needed for leaves and photosynthesis. They will not have to partake in foliage fights like plants do when grown on a rectilinear flat plane where surface area for foliage becomes limited as the plants grow upwards. It also allows one small spherical volume in which to circulate hydroponics via capillary action. A spherical geometry for growing plants in limited volume makes good sense if you have weightlessness. To construct my planter, a spherical core is needed. An old pair of underwear worked well. We have supplies on station sufficient to change our underwear perhaps once every three to four days so I figured there might be a few nutrients in there as well. An old pair of underwear was folded into a sphere and held in place with a few well-placed stitches using needle and thread from our sewing kit. The toilet paper was sewn to the outer surface. A drinking straw was sewn so that its opening was in contact with the fabric and could thus be connected to a drink bag to provide a continuous water drip via capillary action. Seeds were planted with a pair of tweezers by carefully working each seed between the weft of the gauze. The sphere was initially watered and then attached to the water bag by a long thin plastic tube, which also functioned as a string and hung by a light in the node. It bobbed around in the air currents. I became concerned, when after a few days, no sign of sprouting had occurred. The water bag was working well in keeping the sphere moist and was consuming about 100 ml a day. I touched the sphere. It was cold. The cabin air temperature was warm at 28 degrees centigrade. I measured the sphere at 18 C. Evaporative cooling was acting like a refrigerator and slowing germination. A plastic enclosure was constructed out of plastic bags that made the planter sphere into a miniature greenhouse. A few holes were poked through the side for ventilation just like you did in the jar lid when you were in second grade. The plastic enclosure slowed the rate of evaporation and resulted in temperatures around 30 C. Within two days there were sprouts. However, not all was well on the planter sphere. Gravity plays an important role in sending roots down and stems up. Without gravity, every direction is the same. Roots and stems were exiting the seed and growing in any direction within the plane of the spherical surface. The lighting provided an outward growing cue however its effects were small compared to the effects of capillary forces. Capillary forces, subtle in nature and derived from the water interface on the damp layers of gauze, convinced the sprouts to ignore the outward direction of the light and to grow in the surface plane of the sphere. Each sprout had deployed its cotyledons, two miniature leaves that jump-start photosynthesis and provide for the growth of its real leaves. Cotyledons are the drogue chute equivalent before the main canopy is deployed in a parachute system. The capillary forces were overpowering the effect from the outward direction of light. Without gravity's direction, it was as if the sprouts were lazy and decided to give into the subtle capillary forces instead of standing upright to light's beckoning. The cotyledons, constantly covered with a warm layer of water, rapidly molded and withered. Without a drogue chute, the main canopy will not deploy and you will have a hard landing. Without cotyledons, the sprouts died. It is imperative to make the sprouting leaves grow through the water film as quickly as possible, thus surrounding them with fresh air. It was too late to save this batch of sprouts so a new batch was started. This time, as each sprout deployed its cotyledons they were carefully pulled by hand out from the grips of surface tension and allowed to freely spread their leaves in the surrounding air. This batch of sprouts did as well as you could expect having only their starchy seedpod as a source of nutrients. After an inch or so of growth with budding main leaves forming, they turned yellow and died. When you live inside of a metal can filled with machines and electronics, a small splash of growing green is a pleasant reminder from where we came; we all have our roots. I could not help but feel a small sadness for these living creatures that were giving me so much delight while I was powerless to help them grow strong.",

There are millions of players who can beat me anytime. But since Half Life is the first 3D shoot'em up which I really like (no, I don't like Quake) I started playing some deathmatches too. I first started out as a real loser, I got pinned to the wall every single time. After playing several deathmatches, I managed to take a step up from total loser to a 'medium' player. This guide simply points out how I tried to improve myself, there are probably lots of other tactics but these are the ones I used. (Anyone who has additional tips can mail them to me any time!) If you really want to become a Half Life deathmatch hot-shot, I can give but one advice: practice. The more you play, the better you get! (And I need a lot of extra practice ;) Additions ========= This is where I put the info which is related to new versions of the guide, but since this is version 1.0 ... I prefer to be mailed if you have some additional hints & strategies, but if you want to make an addition to this guide put your information here (in the same way mentioned below): Version 1.01 (01/04/99) - Jack Spath fire-tiger@iname.com Extra weapons info Version 1.02 (06/08/99) - Indigo vymmout118@iol.cz Extra weapons info Version 1.03 (06/06/00) - Updated Legal Information This will allow me to contact the persons who made additions, so I can re-write the guide if I want to (giving credit to the original authors of course). Before You Start ================ When you play an on-line game (not LAN) the lag might interfere with gameplay. A latency of 200 and less usu works once you hit the 300 mark or higher half life becomes unplayable (at least on my computer). You know: you see another guy standing at the other side of the room and the next frame you are lying on the ground and he's dancing on your head. Remember that it's better to drop a few graphic details (like the decals) to improve speed over the net than to have a lot of lag (esp. if you want to win). Are there ways to lower latency? Yes there are! You can make specific files which make sure you don't load decals and other stuff which lower latency! I suggest you look on the internet for additional info. There are several files you can download like lowping.zip which are a lot of help. The Controls ============ First of all I would like to say that you'll have to learn to play the game combining the mouse and keyboard controls. Sometimes you see people playing the game on their keyboard only, crunching their fingers in all kinds of impossible ways. The combination of mouse and keyboard is the best and most easy way to play. Don't use the default controls of half life! In single player you can do everything at a slow, relaxed pace. In multiplayer, this will get you killed! eg. the 'R' button to reload is to far away from your other controls, by the time you have pressed the button, you'll be perforated with bullets. These are the controls I use: Mouse --} to aim * Left mouse button: Fire 1 * Right mouse button: Fire 2 * Wheel: Scroll through weapons (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - If you don't have a wheel mouse) Keyboard (AZERTY): * Z: Run forward (W for Qwerty) * D: Run backwards * Q: Strafe left (A for Qwerty) * D: Strafe right * C: Crawl * E: Use Item * SPACE: Jump * LEFT SHIFT: Reload The other buttons don't really matter that much, unless you don't have a wheel mouse. If you don't have it, the buttons for the selection of your weapons are important too. Assign quick keys to the weapons you use the most (and that doesn't always have to be the gluon gun). Personally, I don't use the strafe button that much, but it sometimes comes in handy when you try to dodge the opponent. However ... continually jumping and crawling tends to be more confusing to the other players than a simple strafe movement, so I prefer this tactic. (Although I must admit, that sometimes I simply forget to do it, result --} My head gets blown off). The best thing you can do off course is to combine the 3 tactics: strafing, jumping and crawling at the same time. If you can pull this off and still aim you'll be one of the better players around. Like I already said, these are the controls I use while playing half life. If you feel more comfortable using other controls, use them instead of these. This is just some advice for the rookies out there, who haven't considered the use of alternatice keys. General Tactics =============== Actually, there is nothing like a 'general tactic' in a game like half life. Your strategy (if you would have any) highly depends on the kind of map you are playing. eg. it is not wise to be camping if you have a large, open map! Maps ---- I urge you to explore the map before you go into battle (a tournament). If you don't you'll get fried. Of course, you can't know all the maps, but most half life servers support a range of good to excellent maps which will return quite often. Try to learn the positions which might give you an edge over your opponent. This exploring can be done off-line if you want too but it might be more beneficial to start playing right away and to experience what good positions are. Some spots may seem excellent when you are off-line, but it might turn out otherwisewhen you are on-line, because it's too obvious or some other reason. If your ass gets blown off several times, you'll know that it's a poor spot (believe me)! It's also important to know where the good guns are on the map. You don't want to be running around with your 9mm gun all the time, sooner or later you'll get fragged. A good gun doesn't necessarily mean the gluon gun. This also depends on the map you're playing on. Long range guns might be applied on large, open maps (like crossfire), while short range guns are better to use in small, fast paced maps. If you don't know the map you're playing you should try to remember both of the things mentioned above (positions, guns) as soon as possible. Also try to get an advantage by listening, if you hear someone reloading a gun, you know you should be careful. Too many people (including myself) tend to forget about this! Players tend to be fixed on their screen, not on the sounds that surrounds them. Camping ------- Camping, in general, isn't a good tactic. You might snipe a few other players, but as soon as they know where you are you're fried. Even worse, they can see you, but you don't see them in time. Camping should only be done from dark (preferably higher) positions. If it isn't dark, don't start camping, you'll be spotted fairly easy and it only takes a good RPG rocketto take you out. Furthermore, camping should only be done if you have the right weapons. If you don't have a crossbow or the RPG rocket launcher, camping on a sniping position doesn't have any use! If you are camping in a small bunker, make sure you have a powerfull short range gun (eg. shot gun). If you don't have the appropriate weapons get the hell out of there. But even if you have the right weapons and in a dark spot, camping is not advised ... you are a sitting duck. Keep on moving, the more you move, the harder it is to hit you. Dodging ------- Dodging is another word for acting like a nut. Which is good since you can't predict what a nut is going to do. What does this actually mean when you are in a multi-player game: Don't walk/run in straight lines, it's very easy to hit someone if he walks straight, even snipers can take you out. If you walk, try walking from the left to the right and the other way around. This will make it more difficult for snipers to hit you. When you are in a direct confrontation with someone try to move around. It's harder for you to aim too (but that just takes some practice) but the other player will be having difficulties hitting you too. Like I said before you can strafe, but if you really want to be confusing try jumping around in combination with some crawling. The first time I saw someone do this, I thought he was crazy, but he fragged me before I could even hit him. This also takes a bit of practice, not so much for better aim, but rather to \"not forget\" to do all these crazy things. I recently started applying this technique and it does work, I die less (which means that the others don't have as many kills ;)) but I also tend to forget to jump around sometimes, which usually results into death. Techniques ---------- This sounds fancier than it really is. What do I mean by techniques? You probably do know all the basics of jumping and crawling. But there are some additional moves that might prove to be beneficial. First of all, don't risk your life to get it ... only if it's up for grabs. Once you have it try the combination of crawling and jumping. This will give you a huge boost in terms of speed ... excellent to cross wide, open spaces. Secondly the famous 'Gauss jump'. All you need is: a gauss gun and a place to land (but that doesn't tend to be a problem). All you have to do is charge the gauss gun, point it to the ground and release the charge. You'll be flying high into the air. This is usefull if there are maps with high elevations which you want to reach quickly but it can also be applied in emergencies (read: dead threatening situations). Make sure you land on an elevated position, since you'll lose hit points if you don't. You can also do this using the rocket launcher, but this is not advised since it does involve a \"health risk\" ;). This takes me to the concept of 'falling'. In most MP games realistic damage is turned off, resulting in a loss of 10 HP when you fall. If this is the case, fall ahead I would say. 10 HP is nothing, especially if you have to go a long way down in open positions (I'm not talking about tunnels or anything). You shouldn't worry about the 10 HP because it can cost you a lot more if you climb down. Retreating ---------- I can be pretty short on this one. If you do have to retreat, always try to walk backwards. Ok, there is a chance that you run into a trip mine, but it's pretty low. Why do you have to run backwards? Simple, to beat the hell out of the person you are running away from. If you just run away, you will be shot in the back. However if you run backwards there still might be chance that you send the guy to fraggy heaven before he whacks you. Target ------ I mean 2 things by this: First of all you have to target someone to kill! This doesn't mean shooting some rounds in the air, nope you need to aim. Aim is an important aspect of the game and it isn't easy! If you can't aim, you can't kill ... if you can't kill, well ... you get the idea. Once you can aim properly, you can beat anyone. If you have the chance to hit the competitor in the head, do so ... he'll get more damage. Secondly, if you target someone, keep a 'lock' on him. Don't start shooting multiple targets, try to concentrate on 1 target, finish him off and then proceed to the next. If you take on too many targets at once, the impact will be limited. Ok, you'll wound the guy, but he can heal himself or even worse, it's easier for your competitors to take him out! This is something you don't want to do, always go for the kill! Medical/HEV stations -------------------- Whenever you are using one of these, make sure the area is clear of enemies. Also when using it try to face it in a way that you can see a large portion of the field. Try to avoid turning your back to the playing field. But even if you use this technique, these reloading stations are still dangerous spots. Only use them if you really need them or when they are at a more covered spot. The Weapons =========== Ok, now for the fun part: the machines of death, fragging devices, ... in short weapons. Every weapon has it's own advantages and disadvantages and it's crucial to know which they are. A guy with a crowbar can frag someone with a gluon gun if he plays it smart! Once again, the weapon you choose to use depends on the map you're playing! Another thing to keep in mind is the reload time (and linked with that, the size of your ammo clip). A long reload time automatically results in death during a fight. So preferably use a gun with a large ammo clip (like the MP-5 machine gun) or with short reload times (like the gauss and gluon gun). When you get a chance to reload, do so, don't hesitate, you might not get a second chance. I based this part on my own experiences with the weapons in combination with the weapons guide asmaul@halflifehq.com wrote (he sure knows how to use satchels ;)). Range: this is the range at which the weapon most efficient, not the range it can be used at! Fire 1: what does the first fire option do Fire 2: what does the second fire option do Reload: the reload time Crowbar ------- Range: Short Fire 1: Swing Fire 2: / Reload: / Although some might find it useless because it's useless at long range, I do tend to use it from time to time. The reason is obvious: a good hit with this little thingy does do a lot of damage! Some people even prefer it over the standard AP9mm gun! So if you are in a cramped map or surrounded by competitors it's not such a bad choice to use the crowbar. If you have to use the crowbar (because you don't have any ammo), change your tactics too, since you're dealing with a short range weapon. Basically it comes down to this: if you see someone with a nice big gun in his hand and you don't have any way to escape try running straight at him (esp. if he has a rocket launcher). If he has a normal gun, use the dodging techniques mentioned above to get close to him. Glock gun 9mm ------------- Range: Medium Fire 1: Controlled shot Fire 2: Fast firing Reload: Medium/Fast This is your standard gun and as a standard gun it sucks! Ok, you can take someone out but it really lacks punch. You only have one good reason to use it and that's when you don't have any other alternatives (at the start of a game or when you run out of ammo for your other guns). If you do have to use it, use it wisely. If you are in a stressfull situation it's best to use the fire 2 option, resulting in a less accurate but faster rate of fire. The fire 1 option should be used when you try to take someone out from a longer distance or when you have to be precise. The gun can be used as a sniping gun when you fire in this way but you have to be a good shot, because you'll easily miss. It has a reasonable ammo clip (17) with a fast reload time. .375 Magnum ----------- Range: Medium (1) / Long (2) Fire 1: Normal shot Fire 2: Sniper mode Reload: Slow What can I say about this gun ... if you have a good aim this is one of the guns you should use. It has its drawbacks of course: slow reload time, small ammo clip and slow firing rate. On the other hand, it's very powerful: 2 good shots with this baby and the other player (without armor) will be splattered against the wall. The sniping mode is also pretty good, although there are better alternatives for this. Because of it's drawbacks, it's not recommended that players with not such a good aim use the gun. The reason is obvious, if you miss too much, you're a goner ... if you have to reload, you're a goner. Shotgun ------- Range: Short Fire 1: Single barrel Fire 2: Double barrel Reload: Slow This gun does have it's advantages in maps with smaller rooms. It does have enough impact to blow someone away, at close range, with it's double shot function. This double shot does have some drawbacks though: the firing rate is slower and your limited ammo will be wasted twice as fast. Also keep in mind that the shotgun is a \"DO NOT USE\" in open spaces! Don't try it, you'll loose. Even a glock gun 9mm has more punch from long range. Another drawback is the long reload time (5 sec. for full reload). You might get the impression that it's a bad gun, well ... it's not. It just has a limited use but if you use it in the right circumstances (=in small corridors and rooms) you'll get a maximum return (=fragging your opponents). MP-5 Submachine Gun ------------------- Range: Medium Fire 1: Rapid 9mm bullets Fire 2: Fragmentation grenades Reload: Fast This should be everyones standard weapon in a MP game. It has a lot of advantages, fast reload time and a high firing rate. In combination with the fragmentation grenades it's extremely lethal. You can drop a grenade and then finish the players off with a nice rain of bullets. Doesn't it have any drawbacks? Of course, you'll get whooped if someone starts using the shotgun at a short range (even the high firing rate of the MP5 doesn't compensate). Furthermore it's also a gun not to use at long range the bullets disperse too much (try it out on a wall, you'll see). I also suggest not to use the grenades as a long range weapon, they are much too valuable to be wasted like that. It's better to use them at a shorter range, when you have a sure hit. Also keep in mind that the grenades are never lethal when used on a player with full health. Crossbow -------- Range: Medium (1) / Long (2) Fire 1: Bolt with explosive tip Fire 2: Sniper mode Reload: Slow This is THE sniper weapon to have. It's first firing mode is practically never used, the reason is simple: only direct hits really do some damage since the blast radius is small. The reload time of the crossbow also stresses out the fact that it is a sniper weapon, in other words it's slow, too slow for intense fights. I suggest you only use the crossbow in sniper mode; you can't beat the feeling you get when you hear a \"thump\" and then you see a guy falling to the ground. Yep, that's right, one hit is lethal in sniper mode. When you are in sniper mode however, it's easy for someone to sneak up from behind. So watch your back! Rocket Launcher (RPG) --------------------- Range: Long Fire 1: Launch rocket Fire 2: Laser guidance on/off Reload: Slow This little baby does have an impact your opponents won't forget. Do not target it directly at a player though, try to let the rocket explode in front of his feet (or at a wall close to him), the blast radius is big and damaging enough to frag him. If you aim directly at the player a simple strafing movement is enough to completely miss the target. Why is this so problematic? The reload time of the rocket launcher is extremely slow. When you are using the laser guidance it's even worse. This brings us to the use of the laser guidance. It does have one obvious advantage: you can redirect the path of the rocket. It does also have some drawbacks: the reload time is even slower when you use the laser guidance. Furthermore, the red dot of the laser guidance might give away your position and all the other players will run like hell when they see it! Another drawback of the rocket launcher is the smoke trail the rockets leave behind; it points directly to it's point of origin ... you. So once you fire your rocket get the hell out of there! Oh yeah, one more thing: if a player charges you while holding a rocket launcher, try to switch to another weapon. Chances are that you'll trigger the rocket launcher from a short distance, usually blowing yourself up too. Gauss Gun --------- Range: Medium Fire 1: Single energy beam Fire 2: Charged energy beam Reload: Continuous Probably not an all time favorite, since I don't see a lot of players using it. Why? I sometimes wonder myself. The gun has no reload time and it's pretty powerful. It has some drawbacks though: it's hard to aim this baby at long range, furthermore it eats ammo like candy and last but not least, the charged energy beam has a huge kick back. (this kick back is used to do a gauss jump (see techniques)). Another less pleasant feature is that you have to release the charge in a reasonable time span, otherwise it will blow up in your face. It can aslo shoot through walls though, but I've never seen the benefit of this option. You might as well be shooting with a blind fold on your head. Maybe, there's an expansion pack planned for half life which includes IR goggles or something :-). Am I saying not to use this gun? Nope, I tend to use it regularly when I get my hands on it ... it's fast firing rate (without reload times) can easily compensate the drawbacks. Hornet Gun ---------- Range: Medium / Long Fire 1: Homing hornets Fire 2: Non-homing hornets (more powerful/faster reload?) Reload: Recharges automatically (moderate) The biggest advantage of the hive hand is the homing feature of the hornets. If you know someone is hiding behind a wall or in a room, just send in the hornets ... he'll come out sooner or later. The second fire mode is hardly ever used in a MP game, but it shouldn't be forgotten. Alhtough the hornets loose their homing capabilities, it does more damage or reload faster (I think). The hornet does have a lot of drawbacks too. Don't use it in direct confrontations. The hornets don't do a lot of damage and you'll surely loose if you do use it in this way. Gluon Gun --------- Range: Medium Fire 1: Gluon beam Fire 2: To activate press: primary fire & hold it then press secondary fire & release the primary This does no damage & takes no energy but nobody is so stupid to step there Reload: Continuous Who doesn't know this gun. The most powerful gun around (except for the crossbow in sniper mode). If you can get it, use it. You can't do much if someone starts shooting with one of these at you. Even dodging is of little help. There is one drawback (but it applies to the gauss gun too, which is also an energy weapon), it consumes ammo. So don't start showing off with your gluon gun ... use it effeciently to get the most out of it! Grenades -------- Grenades are seldomly used in MP games. The reason is obvious: it's hard to aim and if you do have a good aim, you always depend on the timing. This makes the grenade one of the more difficult weapons to use in MP. The only time you should be considering the use of a grenade is to smoke out/fry a camper or to clear out a corner you are unsure of. Trip Mines ---------- Trip mines can be quite usefull at some maps. MP games are usually fast paced ... with lots of moving. The player usually detonates a trip mine before he even noticed it was there, giving you some extra kills. Don't spend a lot of time on the placement of the mines though. Placing them with great care is one thing, but while you are placing it you are an open target waiting to be shot. Try to learn how to make quick placements of the mines and place them at strategic points eg. in a tunnel, under water, ... There's absolutely no use in placing it in a large room. You can also place trip mine at places where people respawn. Although this is highly efficient, I wouldn't recommend doing it! Why? First of all, it takes the fun out of the game, kills like this aren't worth mentioning. Secondly, you'll risk getting a bunch of angry players after you and frankly I don't blame them for doing so! Snarks ------ These little critters can be a pain in the @ss. Preferably drop them from an elevated position, so they can't come back and hunt you down. They don't only kill other players for you, they also tend to add a little confusion. Make use of this confusion to take your target out. Snarks also work well in bunkers (when you are not in them). eg. someone calls an air strike, but the door to the bunker is already too close for you to get in ... grab out those snarks and send them into the bunker. This tactic usually results in a kill, since the other players can't run away. Satchel Charges --------------- Fire 1: Drop first satchel/detonate Fire 2: Drop any next satchel These also have a limited use in MP games. Again the reason is obvious: you have to drop the satchel and wait for someone to walk into the proximity of it and then you can detonate it. Basically this is camping ... you are waiting for someone to pass over the satchel. The only way you can use the satchels is when you are retreating from the enemy. If they follow you, just drop one of these (in combination with the retreating technique) and detonate if they walk over it! This should kill the target. It can also be used to scare some of the other players ... if they see a satchel charge they just might turn back from where they came from, because someone might be around to blow it! Specific Map Info ================= This section wants to provide you with map-specific info. This includes techniques you can and can't use on a specific map. I also try to specify the location of some great guns. What I am not going to tell is what kind of strategy I tend to use at a specific map. If I would give that info away, I would get fragged more often since you would know my 'playing technique' for that specific map. Frenzy ------ A small map, so generally I wouldn't suggest camping. I also see lots of players camping on the spot where you can find the RPG Rocket Launcher, shooting from that floor to the bottom. DON'T! Just get the rocket launcher and get out of there! People respawn at that spot and once you're aiming that RPG you won't notice anyone coming from behind. One of the more popular spots on this map is the place where the MP-5 submachine gun is located. (the one on the ground floor, not on the 1st floor at the T-intersection) That's because this map is excellent for using the MP-5 in combination with some fragmentation grenades. Trip mines can also be used quite efficiently on this map. You can find lots of them on the 1st level. Legal notice ============ This document is © Copyright to Tim \"PhoenixT\" Wuyts.

Fiercely competitive certainly but with far too occasional flashes of sublime skill, which is what fans want to see and where quality marquees can make the difference.\"\n\nColosimo, a former A-League player with Perth Glory, Sydney FC and Melbourne Heart, wants A-League clubs to target younger marquee players that they can build a club around.\n\n\"When there's a longer-term [focus] and you can build around [the player] for a period of time then I'm all for it,\" he told Goal Australia.\n\n\"But if it's for the sake of a 10-game stint to get a little spike in revenues, how does it cascade it beyond that?\"\n\nSocceroos critical to marquee plan\n\nColosimo would like to see A-League clubs and FFA utilise the marquee fund to attract Socceroos back to Australia.\n\nSince Ange Postecoglou took over as Socceroos coach, many A-League-based players have enjoyed success with Australia's national team.\n\nMelbourne City playmaker Aaron Mooy is the current A-League poster-boy for the Socceroos, with the 25-year-old having scored 11 goals and notched 18 assists this season.\n\nWhile many Australian football fans hope to see Mooy progress and play at a higher level in Europe, Colosimo reckons the A-League would benefit greatly from keeping him and other Socceroos in the domestic competition.\n\n\"When a young fan sees an Aussie player and gets to see him through his career and follows that club for that player for a long period is vital [to the A-League's future],\" Colosimo said.",

You know: standard classic Star Trek stuff. Star Trek just wasn't Star Trek if Kirk wasn't being goaded by an alien god into some sort of sexual harassment. But when it came time to shoot that scene, the director and some NBC suits got uncomfortable -- not because of the weird consent issues (this was the '60s, after all; slapping a woman was considered foreplay), but because Nichols is black. Up until that point, scripted interracial kisses on television just weren't done. The actors wanted to shoot the scene as it was, but since they weren't in charge, there was only one thing they could do: sabotage.\n\nNBC\n\nNo, not by blowing up the studio. They didn't have the budget.\n\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\n\nShow creator Gene Roddenberry had suggested a compromise: they'd shoot two versions of the scene, one with the kiss, and one with a hug, and use whichever worked better. Everyone knew which version NBC was going to want to use, but luckily Shatner had a plan. See, a director can't see exactly what the camera is picking up -- only the camera operator can. So while they were shooting the versions of the scene that would preserve the purity of the white race, Shatner positioned himself so that the director couldn't see his face, stared right into the camera, and made a bunch of stupid faces.",

  "latent_21859": "Public option health insurance is generally praised by the political left, and disdained by the right.\n\nUpdated Feb. 8, 2017 | Posted Jan. 24, 2017\n\nGov. Mark Dayton is proposing a public option to address skyrocketing premiums for people who buy their own individual and family health insurance.\n\nThe basic idea is that the state would sell health insurance to the general public. In Dayton's plan, anyone interested could buy coverage under the MinnesotaCare program, which currently offers subsidized insurance to qualified low- and moderate income Minnesotans.\n\nThe MinnesotaCare public option would likely be another choice on the MNsure health insurance market where it would compete with plans sold by the state's big health insurers like Medica and HealthPartners.\n\nAs MPR News's Brian Bakst reported, eliminating the income cap on eligibility could double enrollment to about 200,000 people.\n\nHere's how things might shake out:\n\nWhat coverage could I get?\n\nDayton said his proposal \"could offer better benefits than many policies presently on commercial markets; more options for people to keep their doctors and clinics; and less expensive coverage than what is available today.\"\n\nThe MinnesotaCare public option would offer two new choices that are comparable to the \"Silver\" and \"Gold\" plans sold on MNsure, according to Department of Human Services Commissioner Emily Piper.\n\nThe silver plan would pay 70 percent of a person's expected health expenditures, and gold plan would cover 80 percent. The policy holder would be responsible for the remaining costs through a combination of deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance.\n\nIt's difficult to gauge the total out-of-pocket cost for any individual, but here's an aggregate approximation using data from 2013, the most recent we could find. Spending on health care in Minnesota was $7,552 per person that year.\n\nAssuming that level of spending for an individual, the consumer's 30 percent share under a theoretical MinnesotaCare public option silver plan that year would have been $2,266; $1510 under the gold, 20 percent option.\n\nOfficials with the Minnesota Department of Human Services say they assume that the Affordable Care Act rules governing cost-sharing and affordability would apply to the new public option offerings. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets the out-of-pocket maximum every year. For 2017 there's a maximum of $7,150 for individuals and $14,300 for family coverage.\n\nWhat would it cost?\n\n• For consumers: The Department of Human Services estimates the statewide average monthly premiums for the public option next year would be $469 per month, or, for the full year, $840 less than the average cost of commercial insurance this year.\n\nThe average statewide silver premium would be $451 per month, and the gold would be $513 a month.\n\nThe Dayton administration says the public option can bring down premiums \"because it leverages the buying power of more than 1 million Minnesotans enrolled in public plans.\"\n\n• For the public: State government, which administers Medicaid and MinnesotaCare programs, pays for services from medical providers all over the state.\n\nExpanding MinnesotaCare would include a one-time startup cost of $12 million, Dayton said — a tiny fraction of the cost to build MNsure.\n\nConsumers would cover the cost of the program's operations through their premium and out-of-pocket payments.\n\nWill this actually pass?\n\nDayton's proposal involves several aspects the Republicans in control of the Legislature are unlikely to approve.\n\n• The state would compete with commercial insurers to sell coverage on the individual market.\n\n• Continuation of a tax on medical providers that is currently scheduled to end after December 2019.\n\nThe proposal would also require federal approval, which seems unlikely under the Trump administration.\n\nTrump's campaign website says a public option would drive away private insurers, \"leaving Americans with fewer options and eventually no choices but a government run plan.\"\n\nEditor's note: This FAQ has been updated with new information on out-of-pocket expenses and to clarify that the MinnesotaCare public option would offer two new choices that are not available now.",

To the extent that boring correlates with responsible, adult, and steady, Obama wins. And with Obama’s poll numbers looking the way they are, that appears to be a correlation worth betting on.\n\nI think I’d take this even further, addressing Ross Douthat’s surprise that Obama won last week’s debate at the same time. The key insight is this: lots of ordinary viewers enjoy a bit of policy wonkishness. We political junkies, even those of us who enjoy policy discussions, don’t. We’ve heard it a million times before.\n\nBut most viewers haven’t, and they find it kind of interesting, the same way they mostly liked Bill Clinton’s endless laundry list State of the Union addresses. They don’t hear this kind of thing very often, and when they do it’s a nice change of pace from the daily soundbites on the evening news, which are hard to put together into a coherent understanding of what each candidate stands for. Hearing it all in one piece is a bit of a revelation.\n\nNeedless to say, this can be overdone. And a financial crisis is an unusually good time for a sober, wonky address to the voters.

  "latent_22156": "I like to think of client-side applications as empty shells that get populated with data and where the source of that data can be anything: an object in your javascript code, an HTTP request, a JSON file, …\n\nMaking sure this data flows correctly through your application is one hell of a job. As your application grows it becomes harder and harder to manage the different data sources and how they are used to display content on the screens of your users.\n\nThis blog post is filled with examples. The syntax used is ES7. You can use Babel to compile it.\n\nState vs. Props\n\nOn the last couple of projects we’ve been using React to build interactive user interfaces. React components have the concept of props and state to respectively pass data down to child components or manage data internally. Here’s a simple component:\n\n// index.js import React, {Component} from 'react'; import {render} from 'react-dom'; class Counter extends Component { static defaultProps = { increase: 1 } state = { count: 0 } handleClick() { this.setState({ count: this.state.count + this.props.increase, }); } render() { return ( <div> <p>The button has been clicked {this.state.count} times.</p> <button onClick={::this.handleClick}>+{this.props.increase}</button> </div> ); } } // Usage render(<Counter />, document.getElementById('app'));\n\nWhenever we click the button it will increase the counter by 1. The Counter component has a count state which keeps a record of the amount of times the button has been clicked. This state is internal, if I add 2 Counter components on a page each counter will start at 0 and they will increase separately.\n\nThis Counter component also contains a prop called increase . This allows us to set different increment values for each instance.\n\n<Counter increase={2} />\n\nThe easiest way to think of props vs state is that the former can be seen as the initial configuration of a component, while the later is used to mutate the component over time.\n\nA prop can be anything, in our Counter component we have a <button> with an onClick prop which contains a reference to Counter.handleClick .\n\nFlux\n\nFor small applications you can rely on props and state, but once those applications start getting complex you might feel the need for a more structured approach. This is where Flux comes in.\n\nFlux is a pattern designed by Facebook, it favors a uni-directional data flow and one-way data bindings.\n\nWith Flux all data of a particular domain is kept in a store. A store has to register itself with the dispatcher. When an action is triggered by the dispatcher a callback will be executed on the store. The store makes the view aware of the new data by using an onChange event. The view then updates it’s own internal state which causes a re-render of the child views.\n\nThere are a lot of implementations of this pattern. Our favorite is Redux, which isn’t really considered an implementation of the Flux pattern. It took the best parts of Flux and elm.\n\nFor instance: Redux does not have the concept of a dispatcher, instead it relies on pure functions which brings it closer to a functional programming style. A second important difference is that Redux assumes your data is immutable, meaning you are always returning a new object or array.\n\nRedux still uses actions to pass data from your components to your store, but we still need a way to define the changes happening to our state. This is where the reducer comes into play.\n\nA reducer is a function that receives the previous state and the triggered action, and returns the next state.\n\nThere are a couple of things to keep in mind when writing a reducer:\n\nYou should never mutate the arguments\n\nAdd new data through an API call.\n\nAdd a certain randomness (using Math.random() or Date.now() )\n\nThe rule of thumb for a reducer should be Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises\n\nThe following steps are very similar to a typical Flux implementation. The store updates a controller view which then propagates the new state to its child components.\n\nDumb vs. Smart components\n\nBoth Redux and Flux have the concept of dumb and smart components.\n\nSmart components are wrappers around dumb components, they are also called controller views. These components are aware of Redux and subscribe to a store. A smart component generally does not output any DOM.\n\nDumb components are not aware of Redux at all. They receive their data trough props via smart components and do output DOM.\n\nThe creator of Redux wrote a very nice article about how he handles smart and dumb components.\n\nIf you know something about design patterns this might sound familiar to you. Flux shares similarities with the commander pattern. Each action can be considered as a command and a reducer is the command handler.\n\nIn practice\n\nLet’s rewrite our earlier counter example to a Redux application step by step.\n\nSetup\n\nRedux requires some boilerplate setup:\n\nnpm install --save redux react-redux redux-thunk\n\nThe first thing we will do is create our reducer:\n\n// Reducers/Counter.js export default function counter(state = 0, action) { return state; }\n\nOur initial reducer is very simple. It’s just a function that receives a state and action . For now we will let the reducer return the state. We also define a default state of 0.\n\n// Reducers/index.js import {combineReducers} from 'redux'; import counter from './Counter'; export default combineReducers({ counter });\n\nThis is some boilerplate Redux code. Typically each store will have its own reducers, but do note that an action will get passed down to every reducer. This allows you to handle a certain action differently. A good example would be a search component. You can manage the filtering of the results based on the query in one reducer, and update the search input in another.\n\nThe next step is creating our store:\n\n// Stores/index.js import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'; import thunk from 'redux-thunk'; import reducers from '../Reducers'; const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware( thunk )(createStore); export default function store(initialState) { return createStoreWithMiddleware(reducers, initialState); }\n\nAgain, this is some boilerplate code. In this step we’re essentially linking our store with our reducer.\n\nMiddlewares can be used for logging. By adding a logging middleware to all reducers, one can log all your application’s actions. Another example is a middleware for error reporting.\n\nWe’re also adding the redux-thunk middleware. This package allows you to execute async actions. If for some reason we decide to sync our counter to the server over an API we will need to make use of this.\n\nA more advanced use-case of async actions is to dispatch other actions in another one. For example, when performing an API request our UI needs to be updated with a loading indicator before the request is started.\n\nWe also need to create our controller view:\n\n// Containers/App.js import React, {Component} from 'react'; import Counter from '../components/Counter'; export default class App extends Component { render() { return ( <Counter /> ); } }\n\nAnd then finally we modify our bootstrap file so that it renders the App top level component instead of the Counter component.\n\n// index.js import React from 'react'; import {render} from 'react-dom'; import {Provider} from 'react-redux'; import createStore from './Stores'; import App from './Containers/App'; const store = createStore(); render( <Provider store={store}> <App /> </Provider>, document.getElementById('app'));\n\nOur structure after setup looks like this:\n\n├── Components │ └── Counter.js ├── Containers │ └── App.js ├── Reducers │ ├── Counter.js │ └── index.js ├── Stores │ └── index.js └── index.js\n\nConnecting to a store\n\nYou might be wondering how we can connect our App top level component to our store. There’s two ways to do this, both very simple:\n\n// Containers/App.js import React, {Component} from 'react'; import {connect } from 'react-redux'; import Counter from '../components/Counter'; @connect(state => ({ count: state.counter })) export default class App extends Component { render() { return ( <Counter count={this.props.count} /> ); } }\n\nIn this example we wrap our top level component with a connect decorator. We pass a callback that receives the state , this state is an object that contains the previously created Counter reducer. We return an object in which we map the reducer’s state to a count value. Our App component will receive this count via its props, which we can then pass to our “dumb” Counter component.\n\nNow that our Counter component is using the data in our store we can make some changes to it:\n\n// Components/Counter.js import React, {Component} from 'react'; export default class Counter extends Component { static defaultProps = { increase: 1 } render() { const {count, increase} = this.props; return ( <div> <p>The button has been clicked {count} times.</p> <button>+{increase}</button> </div> ); } }\n\nWe got rid of the internally managed state and are now using the count passed via the props.\n\nAdding interactivity\n\nOur last step is to add interactivity to our counter. Like I mentioned before Flux (and Redux): use actions to modify the state. An action is a simple javascript object. So for our counter it could be as simple as this:\n\n{ type: 'increment', amount: 1, };\n\nNow obviously this is kind of static and we can’t really do much with it yet, we need to have a way to trigger these actions. This is where action creators come in. These are simply functions that return an action. Like this:\n\n// Actions/Counter.js import Api from '../Api'; export function increment(amount = 1) { return { type: 'increment', amount, }; }; export function sync(count) { return dispatch => { Api.sync(count).then(() => { dispatch({ type: 'sync', }); }); }; }\n\nThen we need to make our application aware of the action. We can do that like this:\n\n// Containers/App.js import React, {Component} from 'react'; import {connect } from 'react-redux'; import Counter from '../components/Counter'; import {increment} from '../Actions/Counter'; @connect(state => ({ count: state.counter })) export default class App extends Component { render() { const {dispatch} = this.props; return ( <Counter count={this.props.count} increment={amount => dispatch(increment(amount)) } /> ); } }\n\nFor small apps this works fine, but imagine having a lot of actions. Managing that would become a nightmare. Luckily Redux has a helper that solves this for us, called bindActionCreators .\n\nimport React, {Component} from 'react'; import {bindActionCreators} from 'redux'; import {connect } from 'react-redux'; import Counter from '../components/Counter'; import * as actions from '../actions/counter'; @connect(state => ({ count: state.counter })) export default class App extends Component { render() { return ( <Counter count={this.props.count} actions={bindActionCreators(actions, this.props.dispatch)}/> ); } }\n\nThis will bind all our action creators to the dispatcher and expose them via an object. Our Counter component will now receive an actions object via it’s props containing the increment action creator. Now all that is left to do is trigger the action when clicking the button:\n\n// Components/Counter.js import React, {Component} from 'react'; export default class Counter extends Component { static defaultProps = { increase: 1 } render() { const {count, increase, actions: {increment}} = this.props; return ( <div> <p>The button has been clicked {count} times.</p> <button onClick={() => increment(increase)}>+{increase}</button> </div> ); } }\n\nAnd then finally we need to add this action to our reducer:\n\n// Reducers/Counter.js export default function counter(state = 0, action) { switch(action.type) { case 'increment': return state + action.amount; default: return state; } }\n\nAnd that’s it, we now have an application where the state is kept in a single source that can only be mutated by triggering actions.\n\nBenefits of Redux\n\nBecause we use Redux we can now use some very nice tools that improve our development.\n\nRedux devtools\n\nOne of those tools is redux-devtools which gives you a visual overview of all the actions happening in your application. Adding it to our application requires some minor changes:\n\nnpm install --save-dev redux-devtools\n\nFirst of all we need to adapt our store:\n\n// Stores/index.js import {compose, createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'; import thunk from 'redux-thunk'; import {devTools} from 'redux-devtools'; import reducers from '../Reducers'; export default function store(initialState) { let middlewares = [ applyMiddleware(thunk), devTools(), ]; const store = compose(...middlewares)(createStore); return store(reducers, initialState); }\n\nYou can see how we added the devTools middleware to our stack.\n\nThe devtools come with their own React component which we can include, we will create a new top level component for this.\n\n// Containers/ReduxDevtools import React from 'react'; import {DevTools, DebugPanel, LogMonitor} from 'redux-devtools/lib/react'; export default function devtools(store) { const stateSelector = state => state; return ( <DebugPanel top right bottom key=\"devtools\"> <DevTools select={stateSelector} store={store} monitor={LogMonitor} /> </DebugPanel> ); }\n\nAnd finally we need to render the devtools in our browser:\n\n// index.js import React from 'react'; import {render} from 'react-dom'; import {Provider} from 'react-redux'; import createStore from './Stores'; import App from './Containers/App'; import devtools from './Containers/ReduxDevtools'; const store = createStore(); render( <div> <Provider store={store}> <App /> </Provider> {devtools(store)} </div>, document.getElementById('app'));\n\nThe result looks like this:\n\nWe can now track all the actions with their payloads and how they affect the state in this monitor. Do note that you should disable this in your production environment, since it impacts the performance. Our favorite way of doing this is by using environment variables with webpack.\n\nAll of the above examples are available on Github:",
  "latent_22236": "by Brett Stevens on November 6, 2017\n\nIn every Netflix queue, somewhere a documentary appears and in weak moments, one is tempted to watch it. Such was the case with 11/8/16, the second project of this nature from its director, which set sixteen directors to work following individuals on the morning of the election which transferred power to Donald J. Trump.\n\nIf this documentary has a theme, it consists of two parts: first, that “a five minute conversation with the average voter” will shock and horrify anyone expecting logic or sense, and second, that America is so fundamentally divided and its identity politics have become so narcissistic that there is no way that the center can hold. This nation-state is coming apart.\n\nThe various camera streams follow a Sikh cab driver in New York, an independent businessman in Massachusetts, a politically-active Mormon lady in Utah, a squeaky low-testosterone Irish union leader, a political consultant for the Clinton campaign and an editor at the Los Angeles Times, among others. Each of these reveal entirely polarizing views that are part of their personal identities, to the point that giving up those views would lead to existential distress.\n\nMore intensely, the cameras reveal how few of these views are based in fact, and how much self-interest comes into play, which sets the varying groups against each other. The Leftists who make their money in Leftist businesses oppose any power to anyone else; the construction union seems to care only about what government projects will bring it money; the small businessman is interested in his bottom line.\n\nThis is where the five-minute conversation with the average voter is most poignant: there is a lack of awareness of any larger issues, or any future past the immediate, that makes one see why democracy destroys civilizations. No one is watching the world ahead, but instead they are reacting to a self-referential system, trying to make what already exists work in the short term, instead of redesigning it for the long term.\n\nAs with most documentaries, this one is boring and maudlin, mainly because the density of information is quite low as we watch Americans have relatively unscripted conversations about issues they have no hope of understanding. But it reveals the basis of identity politics in America, which is not so much the group, but the benefit to the individual from acts that benefit the group.\n\nWhile you might fall asleep watching this, memorable moments of clash between cultures and worlds show us the future of America, which is not unity nor strength through disunity, but fragmentation into groups which want to support themselves and are willing to do so at the expense of all others.\n\nIn this, finally, we see some honesty about the prospects of democracy: where each vote represents self-interest, people become more self-interested, and then form little gangs of those like them to enforce this self-interest against other groups. This film about a contentious election serves to reveal the source of the contention that culminated in the election more than any sense of group participation.\n\nThrough that we see that America has finished itself off the way ancient Greece and Rome did, which is by creating an emphasis on individualism that works through a self-referential system, with the needs of the many steadily driving any conversation about reality out the window. The runaway train chases a phantom, and no one will be paying attention when it runs off the rails.\n\nTags: america, balkanization, documentary\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

  "latent_22298": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of RT on QoL, SoC, and DS, as well as to compare the possible effects of different training frequencies on those variables. After a 3-month training period, there was an intervention effect on environmental dimension of QoL. From month-3 to month-9, environmental QoL decreased among those who trained once a week compared to higher training frequencies. Throughout the 9-month intervention, participants who trained twice a week improved their environmental QoL compared to all other groups and SoC compared to CG and to RT3. Therefore, our hypothesis regarding the positive effect of RT on psychological outcomes was partly supported.\n\nWe found an intervention effect on environmental QoL after 3 months of training. This is a novel finding, partly because the environmental dimension of QoL is not part of commonly used health-related QoL measurements (e.g., RAND-36/SF-36). Bonganha et al. [22] used the same WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire, and did not observe any changes in environmental QoL after a 16-week 3-times-a-week RT program, but their participants were younger (post-menopausal women) than in the present study. The environmental QoL reflects how satisfied individuals are with their environment and with their access to different services. In the present study, the change in environmental QoL during the first 3 months correlated positively with changes in maximum strength, so it is possible that initial improvements in strength contributed to the participants’ abilities to use their environment. Environmental dimension of QoL includes questions related to home environmental, physical safety, but also (importantly in the context of the present study) the individual’s possibility to access leisure activities, health services, and public transport [1]. It is possible that this dimension measures partly similar concepts related to improved functional capacity as the physical dimension, which was borderline statistically significant after 3 months of training. While there was a positive relationship between changes in environmental QoL and strength, the relationship was weak (r 2 = 0.04), and no relationships were noted for changes in functional capacity. Consequently, the satisfaction of one’s own capabilities in relation to the environment seems not entirely dependent on actual physical changes.\n\nRegarding SoC, the results suggest that SoC improved in the training group after 3 months of training, but the change was not statistically significant compared to CG. However, when comparing the change from baseline to month-9, SoC improved among RT2 compared to CG and RT3. According to these results, it seems that changes in SoC develop slowly, and that the RT intervention needs to be longer than 3 months. SoC is described to be stable and enduring, but not an unchangeable life orientation [6, 40, 41]. Exercise is one of the resources contributing to good SoC [6, 42, 43]: it seems that physical activity can contribute to SoC, but it has to be regular and continuous, part of a lifestyle, to bring about a change. Both SoC and environmental QoL are important health-promoting resources and closely related to overall well-being of older adults [1, 8]. As the results of the present study indicate that RT is a potential way to improve these relative stable constructs, the importance of RT in promoting both physical and psychological health should be better taken into account.\n\nPreviously, two studies observed no differences in the change in QoL between RT frequencies [28, 29]. The results of the present study showed that training twice a week was the most effective frequency to increase environmental QoL and SoC, which were not measured in those previous studies. It seems that improvements in environmental QoL and SoC could not be solely due to improvements in physical functioning and strength; otherwise, also RT3 should have improved during the 9-month period. One explanation for this could be that among previously sedentary older adults, three high-intensive RT sessions per week were too much for their psychological functioning: for example, meta-analysis by Arent et al. [44] showed that exercise interventions with training frequency less than three times a week were more beneficial to older adults’ mood than interventions with three or more session per week. Another explanation could be regularity and continuity: perhaps continuing with the same training frequency throughout the intervention was the key element for improvements in RT2. It is possible that a reduced training frequency for the last 6 months have led to the feeling of the loss of benefits, whereas increasing training frequency may have been perceived as too much. It could be speculated that continuing RT with the same frequency over 9 months may have offered a sufficient feeling of continuity. In future, studies investigating the effect of different training frequencies on different areas of psychological functioning should start the intervention directly with different frequencies to determine possible between-group differences from the initiation. In addition, it would be important to investigate the effect of changes in training frequency in relation to psychological functioning, because it is quite common in practice to have, e.g., seasonal variation in training [45].\n\nDuring the initial 3 months of RT, physical and psychological QoL increased and DS decreased in the training group, and in psychological QoL and DS these changes remained to the end of the intervention. These findings are in line with some previous studies, where both shorter (≤ 3 months) [18, 19, 46, 47, 48] and longer (≥ 6 months) [20, 25, 49] RT interventions have had positive effects on physical and psychological QoL and DS. On the other hand, RT does not affect QoL according to some previous studies [21, 22, 23]. The inconsistent results regarding QoL may be due to differences between studies: for instance, in studies where no intervention effect on QoL occurred [21, 22, 23], participants where younger than in those studies where improvements were observed [18, 19, 20, 25, 46, 47, 48, 49]. Damush and Damush [23] observed that both training and control group seemed to improve in health-related QoL measurements, possibly because the control group was also allocated to social interaction. In the present study, CG was not allocated to social interaction, but they increased their aerobic exercise despite the instructions not to change their lifestyle. These findings may indicate that the participants in the present study were all motivated to improve their health/well-being and may have influenced the findings. For instance, a decrease in DS occurred also in CG. Although the GEE analyses were adjusted by the amount of aerobic training, this lifestyle change may explain why there were no intervention effects on these variables.\n\nThese results also suggest that apart from SoC, the largest changes in QoL and DS seemed to occur in the beginning of RT. This is in line with the results of two meta-analyses showing that shorter exercise programs are more effective for psychological functioning than longer ones among older adults [14, 44]. It is possible that individuals perceive physical benefits of exercise even after short-term training and these improvements in turn contribute to better psychological functioning [14]. This would seem logical given that the largest gains in physical function occur at the beginning of a training intervention and these gains plateau after some months [12], as was also the case in this intervention [31, 32]. In the present intervention, correlations indicate that improvements in strength are slightly associated with psychological functioning after 3 months of intervention, but not after 9 months. It seems that, especially longitudinally, the relationship between exercise and psychological functioning is more complicated; in addition to improvements in physical functioning, there are many other possible mediators that could explain the relationship [17]. Social interaction, master experiences and self-efficacy, stress-removal, and hormonal changes are possible mediators [14, 17]. These mechanisms between RT and psychological functioning may be a fruitful area for future research, since they are not well understood. There is evidence that psychological improvements return to baseline after an intervention, especially among those participants who do not continue RT after the intervention [19, 50]. Therefore, it is important to encourage older adults to participate in RT after the intervention to maintain improvements in psychological functioning also.\n\nThe results of this study show that RT influences some areas of psychological functioning but not all. It is also possible that high baseline scores have produced a ceiling effect. At baseline, the QoL domain scores were higher than average in the corresponding age group [2], SoC scores were in the upper part of a range found in a systematic review [35], and the amount of DS was low in the present study with only 2% scoring over 13 (threshold for mild depression [36]). It is probable that individuals with normal levels of functioning and high baseline health-related QoL scores may not benefit from exercise as much as those with lower baseline scores [13]. In addition, this was a secondary analysis of randomized controlled trial and the power analyses were based on muscle strength and functional capacity, so it is also possible that the trial was unpowered to detect changes in psychological functioning. Nevertheless, previous studies have found significant changes in psychological functioning with similar or even smaller sample sizes [13, 28]. Despite these possible limitations, we still observed changes in environmental QoL and SoC, which gives confidence that these observations reflect true phenomena derived from the RT intervention of the present study. The high baseline scores may also indicate that the present study sample consisted largely of older adults with good psychological functioning and motivation to start training. It is not clear why those with low QoL, weak SoC, and DS did not register to participate in the RT intervention of the present study. In addition, the sample consisted of healthy older adults aged 65–75; hence, the results should be replicated among participants with a wider age range and different patient groups.\n\nIn conclusion, the key observation of this study is that, in addition to well-known physical benefits for aged populations, RT is beneficial for environmental QoL and SoC. Future studies should investigate the cause(s) of these improvements in psychological functioning; for instance, are they consequences of changes in physical characteristics or other psychological constructs? Future trials should also consider training frequency and duration in relation to RT and psychological functioning: identifying when the changes occur, and the appropriate intervention duration and quantity needed to gain the benefits.",

  "latent_22541": "After September 11, neoconservatives began using the neologism ‘ Islamofascism’ to gin up support for American intervention in the Middle East. As fighting the fascists in World War II was the one “good war” in popular imagination , calling Muslims “fascists” was expedient propaganda\n\nNow that Islamic terrorism is an almost regular event in Europe, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic has taken the tactic a step further. He argues that “Renewed vitriol among right-wing fascists and new threats from radicalized Islamists have created a crisis” for European Jews, who should consider fleeing the Continent to avoid the impending pogroms. [Is It Time for the Jews to Leave Europe? April 2015]\n\nYet Goldberg [Email him] fails to produce much evidence of a fascist threat. In fact, he fails to document a single incident of right-wing anti-Semitic violence in Europe—or even an anti-Semitic statement.\n\nNonetheless, Goldberg implies that the rise of the National Front in France represents a threat to the Jews. After all, one Jew he interviews states, without any examples or evidence, that he does not “trust [Marine] Le Pen. “\n\nGoldberg actually interviews Le Pen, whom he acknowledges has promoted a philo-Semitic National Front. Yet, despite her assurances that “Jews have nothing to fear from the National Front,” Le Pen is still suspect for Goldberg because she has not denounced her father, Jean Marie Le Pen, whom we are told led a National Front that was “openly anti-Semitic,” filled with “thugs in leather jackets,” and made “public expressions of longing for Vichy.”\n\nGoldberg did not bother to provide evidence for any of these claims, probably because none exists. (Space constraints can’t be his excuse: the piece was over 11,000 words!)\n\nThe sole facts he used to document the Front National’s extremism: its former leader Jean Marie Le Pen was filled with “Holocaust obsessiveness.” The basis for this charge? In 1987, Le Pen said: “I ask myself several questions. I’m not saying the gas chambers didn’t exist. I haven’t seen them myself…But I believe it’s just a detail in the history of World War II.”[Frenchman Fined For Remark, Sarasota Herald-Tribune, May 23, 1990]\n\nIf you have to go back nearly 28 years in the past and 15 years before Le Pen’s political peak to find a controversial statement on the topic, I’d say it doesn’t quite qualify as “obsessiveness.” Nor, for that matter, did Le Pen “deny” the Holocaust—it just appears he did not ascribe sufficient gravity to the event. But even Winston Churchill did not mention the Holocaust once in his six-volume history of World War II—and only mentioned Nazi anti-Semitism in one footnote.\n\nIn fairness, Goldberg does acknowledge that the “chief propagators of contemporary European anti-Semitism” are Muslims. But he somehow manages to still blame the Right. Still, the only alleged concrete connection between Islamists and the Far Right he can dig up is that they both opposed French president François Hollande, and that French-Cameroonian comedian Dieudonné and idiosyncratic intellectual Alain Soral have an “ideological partnership”—\n\n[T]he new anti-Semitism flourishing in corners of the European Muslim community would be impoverished without the incorporation of European fascist tropes. Dieudonné M’bala, a comedian of French Cameroonian descent who specializes in Holocaust revisionism and gas-chamber humor, is the inventor of the quenelle, widely understood as an inverted Nazi salute. His followers have taken to photographing themselves making the quenelle in front of synagogues, Holocaust memorials, and sites of past anti-Jewish terrorist attacks. Dieudonné has built an ideological partnership with Alain Soral, the anti-Jewish conspiracy theorist and 9/11 “truther” who was for several years a member of the National Front’s central committee. Soral was photographed not long ago making the quenelle in front of Berlin’s Holocaust memorial.\n\nBut Goldberg fails to note that neither man is right-wing or a Muslim. Dieudonné is a Catholic , who had previously campaigned against the National Front’s alleged racism. And as Goldberg begrudgingly acknowledges, much of his “anti-Semitism” is largely for shock humor in the same vein as Charlie Hebdo , but attacking a different sacred cow. Dieudonné eventually became friends with Jean Marie Le Pen, but never indicated any sympathy for his politics.\n\nSoral spent most of his career as a Marxist, but began to identify with the National Front on some cultural issues. However, he still considers himself a man of the Left. And he quit the party in 2009 specifically because he believed it was anti-Islam [The online politics of Alain Soral, by Evelyne Pieller, Le Monde Diplomatique, November 2013].\n\nWhy two idiosyncratic non-Muslim Leftists becoming friends signifies a union between Muslims and fascists is beyond me.\n\nGoldberg also blames Europeans for Muslim anti-Semitism and support for terrorism because the “failure of Europe to integrate Muslim immigrants has contributed to their exploitation by anti-Semitic propagandists and by recruiters for such radical projects as the Islamic State, or ISIS.”\n\nEven if this were true, if Europe had listened to the “Far Right” and not let millions of Muslims into the continent in the first place, there wouldn’t be any potential for them to be radicalized.\n\nYet wherever Goldberg looks, he sees Nazis somehow responsible for making Muslims hate Jews. Thus he quotes British-Jewish activist David Rich:\n\nThose British Muslims who verbally abuse British Jews on the street are more likely to shout “Heil Hitler” than “Allahu Akbar” when they do so. This is despite the fact that their parents and grandparents were probably chased through the very same streets by gangs of neo-Nazi skinheads shouting similar slogans.\n\nPutting aside Rich’s absurd claim that neo-Nazi violence was ubiquitous in post-World War II Britain, when mass immigration began, Muslims surely yell “Heil Hitler” when attacking Jews because they know it upsets Jews—not because they read Mein Kampf. Moreover, Goldberg does not explain why Jews should be more concerned about Muslims yelling “Heil Hitler” instead of “Allahu Akbar” when attacking them.\n\nThe underlying reason: many Jews are still emotionally preoccupied with the supposed threat from Nazism. As Marine Le Pen attempted to explain to Goldberg:\n\n“The reality is that there exist in France associations that are supposedly representative of French Jews, which have stuck with a software that came out of the Second World War,” she said, meaning that members of the Jewish leadership are still preoccupied with the threat of Nazi-like fascism. “For decades they have continued to fight against an anti-Semitism that no longer exists in France, for reasons of—how should I say this?—intellectual laziness. And by a form of submission to the Politically Correct. And while they were doing this, while they were fighting against an enemy that no longer existed, an anti-Semitism was gaining force in France stemming notably from the development of fundamentalist Islamist thought.\n\nYet Le Pen’s point is lost on Goldberg.\n\nHe also interviews Wisconsin-born Barbara Spectre [Email her] founding director of something called Paideia, the European Institute for Jewish Studies in Sweden, who tells him Jews “are not naive people, and they are not suicidal. They grew up with a full understanding of the Holocaust and its implications.”\n\nBut if anything, current events in Europe show this Jewish obsession with stopping “the next Hitler” is incredibly naïve, simplistic, and short-sighted. Although Goldberg is apparently unaware of this, Barbara Spectre has gained worldwide notoriety with her videotaped comment:\n\nI think there's a resurgence of anti-Semitism because at this point in time Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural, and I think we're gonna be part of the throes of that transformation, which must take place. Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies that they once were in the last century. Jews are going to be at the center of that. It's a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode, and Jews will be resented because of our leading role. But without that leading role, and without that transformation, Europe will not survive. [Paul Austin Murphy, That Barbara Spectre Video, American Thinker, December 28, 2013]\n\nI believe that, contrary to Specter’s self-congratulation, her views reflect an almost perfect misinterpretation of the Holocaust and its lessons. Because of paranoia that homogenous European countries would inevitably lead to a Nazi resurgence, Jews like Spectre have promoted Open Borders and the admission of Muslim immigrants who actually were anti-Semitic.\n\nShe is likely correct that promoting open borders and multiculturalism could lead to a backlash against Jews. But a backlash against such destructive views—regardless of who propagates them—is justified.\n\nIn the first lines of his 1995 Immigration book Alien Nation: Common Sense About America’s Immigration Disaster, VDARE.com editor Peter Brimelow described mass immigration as Hitler’s posthumous revenge on America. The same can be said about Jews in Europe. By promoting mass immigration, Jews such as Spectre are helping Muslims finish the job that Hitler failed to do.\n\nAnd that’s the closest we get to anything we can call a genuine “Islamofascism.”\n\nCharles Bloch (email him) considers himself an unhyphenated American.",

If you search the hashtag #LFC on Twitter and ask it to only show you tweets that have received 10 or more retweets, loads of them are full of snide.\n\nTweets like:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Scouse_Analysis/status/613107589992316928\n\nand\n\nThe fact that Joe Allen has not once been linked with a move away worries me. Just simply not good enough for a club like Liverpool. #lfc — The Anfield Chat (@TheAnfieldChat) June 21, 2015\n\nPeople that claim to be Liverpool fans are seemingly desperate for Rodgers to fail or even for deals for good players to fall through just so they can say, “I told you so”; just so that they can be right. Positively-minded pieces don’t appeal to the masses, they want confirmation of their bias and their current feeling of misery towards the manager and those that run the club.\n\nI’m not one to tell other people how they should support the club, but I do always find myself desperate to ask the question: What’s the point? Seriously, what’s the fucking point? What do you get out of wanting things to go wrong? There will be fans, genuine LFC fans, who want Liverpool to lose their first seven away games next season so that Rodgers is sacked and Klopp is brought in. I ask again, what’s the fucking point? Wouldn’t it be better if we won those seven games? Wouldn’t it be ace if for once in recent years we could all get behind the manager and spend the money we’d have to give him in compensation for firing him on another player like Firmino?\n\nOf course their response would be that Rodgers doesn’t have what it takes to be Liverpool manager and they want him to fail for the good of the club. “He didn’t win a trophy in his first three years, he’s as bad as Hodgson!” they’ll cry. They’re wrong, of course, but arguing with them is like trying to convince a fool of something he’ll never be able to understand.\n\nEven the rumours about Liverpool trying to sign Benteke are met with derision and disgust. I understand the view that he doesn’t seem like the right type of striker for a Brendan Rodgers Liverpool team, but why not wait and see what happens before throwing toys out of the pram? If you’re dead set against Benteke coming to the club, if you’re calling him every name under the sun before he’s even so much as had his balls groped by the club doctor, what chance has the lad got? He could come in and score 20 goals next season and you’d just be fuming about the ones he missed. I’ll be honest, I didn’t think Peter Crouch was a “Rafa signing” before we got him, and it took the lad over 24 hours of playing time to put the ball into the back of the net, yet it all turned out alright in the end, didn’t it?\n\nThere’s a chance to put the last year to bed now, though. With the signing of Bobby Firmino from Hoffenheim it looks as thought the Liverpool hierarchy could have got their act together and decided to get the club going in the right direction. Wouldn’t it be brilliant if all of the fans could get on board with that too?\n\nFirmino’s capture does several things. The obvious one is that it improves our playing squad heading into next season. But it also shows that FSG are willing to spend the big bucks to bring the right player to the club, splashing out a rumoured £29 million for him, plus another £3.5 million a year in wages over the course of his five-year contract. On top of that it dismisses the notion that good players won’t sign if Brendan Rodgers is the manager.\n\nBut the other thing it could do is give the fans a reason to cheer the fuck up. Just take a moment to go on YouTube and have a look at the compilation videos of his skills that Man United fans have kindly put together for us. Have a think about what he could do with Coutinho, Sturridge and Jordan Henderson buzzing around him.\n\nNow take that smile you’ve got and remember how much fun it was at the end of the 2013-2014 season when people were lining the streets of Anfield to welcome to the team bus into the ground. Remember what it was like to not only watch but also sing about the “poetry in motion”. Being a football supporter isn’t a one-way street. It isn’t a matter of you turning up and being entertained and if you’re not then you can boo and complain. The clue’s in the title: you’re there to support. If you do that, if you cheer and sing and jump around and make a racket then the sky is the limit. Christ, we won a Champion’s League final from 3-0 down because the supporters inspired the players to victory. But you can’t just do it when United or Chelsea come to town. The players need you when it’s Stoke and Norwich, too.\n\nThe irony is, of course, that the people who agree with me don’t need to be told, and the ones that don’t will have loads of arguments as to why they’re right and I’m wrong. I don’t like telling people how to be football supporters, but I’ll tell you now: if you think you can convince me that wanting Rodgers to fail and Liverpool to lose is in any way a good think for the football club then you’re wrong. It isn’t a good thing, and you’ll never convince me it is.\n\nIf you’re one of those whinging bastards that loves to complain then why not decide to change your tune? Why not alter your mantra from “I told you I was right” to “thankfully I was wrong”? Christian Benteke seems like a bad fit to me, and I’d rather we looked elsewhere. But if we bring him in I’ll be the happiest lad in Anfield if he proves me wrong. I’ll be the first to admit I was wrong when I see him lift up the Premier League trophy.\n\nDespite not winning the league in 25 years, Liverpool Football Club are still a big deal. It’s time for each and every fan to stop behaving small time and remember we’re the dog’s bollocks. If you think I’m wrong that’s fair enough. But I don’t want to know you. So tweet me all you want, write angry comments below this piece until the cows come home. I’ll just block you and ignore you. I’d like to reply, but I’m out on the lash singing about Bobby Firmino, Phil Coutinho and the boys from Brazil.\n\nIt wasn’t that I didn’t have anything to say when Gareth asked me, it was that I couldn’t be bothered saying it. Well I can be bothered now. Fuck off out the way, misery guts: The Reds are coming up the hill, and by God they’re mustard.\n\nPics: David Rawcliffe-Propaganda-Photo\n\nLike The Anfield Wrap on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nSubscribe to TAW Player: http://www.theanfieldwrap.com/player/subscribe",
  "latent_23012": "It’s fair to say that Wi-Fi has become a pretty indispensable part of modern-day life, but it seems the technology can do a heck of a lot more than just stream data to and from our digital devices.\n\nResearchers in the US have developed a system called RF Capture that uses wireless signals to detect and track human motion throughout a building, even when people are behind walls or furniture, or are in rooms at the opposite end of the building.\n\nIn a paper that will be presented at the SIGGRAPH Asia 2015 conference next month, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) describe how RF Capture can identify particular persons in another room, and trace their body motion to detect how they’re moving – including walking, tracing hand gestures in the air, and even registering the rise and fall of a breathing person’s chest.\n\n“The possibilities are vast,” said Fadel Adib, lead author of the paper. “We’re just at the beginning of thinking about the different ways to use these technologies.”\n\nThe device works like a specialised kind of Wi-Fi router, transmitting wireless signals and analysing signal reflections as they are directed back to the transmitter. However, up until now, wireless signals bouncing off different people (and different body parts) effectively all looked the same, which poses a problem if you’re trying to make sense of them.\n\n“The data you get back from these reflections are very minimal,” said Dina Katabi, a professor in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL). “However, we can extract meaningful signals through a series of algorithms we developed that minimise the random noise produced by the reflections.”\n\nThe algorithms track variations in movements in 3D space, and once trained on a particular person, can stitch together a virtual silhouette for each individual in a room, recognising them by height and body shape.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the applications for this kind of body tracking could have an impact on everything from the motion capture used in Hollywood movies to smart home capabilities for consumers, helping people run their houses with greater efficiency and safety.\n\n“We’re working to turn this technology into an in-home device that can call 911 if it detects that a family member has fallen unconscious,” said Katabi. “You could also imagine it being used to operate your lights and TVs, or to adjust your heating by monitoring where you are in the house.”",
  "latent_23178": "SEVERAL HUNDRED ADDISON Northeast Supervisory Union voters attended the ANeSU board meeting at Lincoln Community School on Tuesday evening. Many voiced support for a petition that calls for the firing of Superintendent David Adams. Independent photo/Zach Despart\n\nLINCOLN — For 26 seconds, applause rocked the walls of Lincoln Community School’s tiny gymnasium Tuesday evening. The cause of the ovation was not, as one might suspect, a game-winning basket or conclusion of a musical performance.\n\nRather, a local resident asked her supervisory union board to fire the superintendent.\n\nDuring visitors’ business of the Addison Northeast Supervisory Union board meeting, Koran Cousino of Starksboro presented a petition signed by hundreds of voters who support the dismissal of ANeSU Superintendent David Adams.\n\n“Given the overwhelming community support represented by this petition, we respectfully ask this board … to take swift action in consideration of our request that David Adams be excused from his position as superintendent of the ANeSU,” Cousino read from a prepared statement.\n\nHer comments were met with a roar of applause from the audience, about half of whom were forced to stand because there was nowhere to sit. A sign on a gym wall indicated a maximum occupancy of 200, but far more people turned up to the meeting. They filled the aisles of the gym and spilled into the hallway. Unable to fit into the school’s parking lot, their cars lined the narrow shoulder of River Road for a hundred yards.\n\nThey came to voice a litany of concerns about the running of the supervisory union, which encompasses Mount Abraham Union High School and elementary schools in the towns of Lincoln, Starksboro, Bristol, Monkton and New Haven. Many were angry; most spoke in favor of dismissing Adams. They charged that he is a poor leader, has not laid out a clear vision for the supervisory union and has fostered a culture of intimidation throughout the six ANeSU schools that has left faculty and staff afraid to speak out. However, they offered no first-hand evidence to support that claim during the meeting.\n\nCousino was the first resident to hold the floor, and said the petition bears 550 signatures, including 23 from out of state and 13 from Vermonters outside the five-town area. She said she does not believe Adams is fit to continue leading the supervisory union.\n\n“A leader does not rule on high, talk down to colleagues and community members and justify actions that are unjustifiable,” Cousino said.\n\nAfter the applause subsided, Cousino delivered a binder containing the petition to ANeSU board chair Dawn Griswold. Griswold said the board will review it and respond at a later date.\n\nThe petition won’t be the only reading material for the board to mull in coming months. Immediately before Cousino spoke, the ANeSU teachers’ union delivered to the board news that by a 163-1 margin its members supported a vote of no confidence in Adams, accompanied by the results of a climate survey of staff indicating poor reviews of administrators (see accompanying story).\n\nAfter Cousino delivered the citizen petition, other residents raised their hands to speak in favor of it, or raise concerns about Adams.\n\nJen Oldham of Lincoln said she used to serve on the town school board, but resigned last year because she did not feel that the school boards received enough information to effectively evaluate the superintendent. She said there must be something wrong with the governance structure of the school boards if members find no fault in Adams’ job performance, while residents and teachers want him fired.\n\n“I’m told that Mr. Adams, by the policies by which he is evaluated, is successful by all measures, and yet here we stand with a full house, with hundreds of signatures calling for his removal,” she said. “That makes me think something is really amiss.”\n\nKate McGowan of Lincoln also criticized the governance policies of the supervisory union, arguing that they are too vague to effectively evaluate administrators and articulate a vision for the schools. She charged that the policies lack clear language that details how administrators may or may not interact with faculty and staff.\n\n“There’s nothing in there about treatment of staff, in your executive constraints,” McGowan said, drawing applause from the crowd.\n\nMcGowan added that she believes that the supervisory union policies give the board grounds to fire Adams, reading a policy that notes that the superintendent should not endanger the supervisory union’s public image, its credibility or its ability to accomplish its mission.\n\n“Hello? There’s a whole bunch of public image stuff going on right now,” McGowan said. “There are grounds for some amount of review and disciplinary action, and change in course.”\n\nJohn McNerney of Monkton, who also serves on that town’s selectboard, said current and former teachers have told him faculty fear discipline if they share concerns with administrators.\n\n“My primary concern now is that there’s an atmosphere of fear and retribution, a fear of even raising a question, let alone a statement that disagrees with the superintendent,” McNerney said. “I’ve never seen a business that devalues its human resources so thoroughly as what is going on.”\n\nHe noted the mass exodus of teachers from Monkton Central School in 2013, where about half of the faculty resigned at the close of the school year, citing a variety of reasons. McNerney said while teachers may have not publicly criticized the ANeSU, in private they shared with him stories of being threatened and intimidated by administrators.\n\nAdams, who was present at the meeting, sat silent and expressionless, his hands folded in his lap, as speaker after speaker expressed disappointment in his performance and the board’s perceived failure to address it. He was not available for comment Wednesday.\n\nADDISON NORTHEAST SUPERVISORY Union Superintendent David Adams, left, at a Tuesday evening meeting at Lincoln Community School listens to residents explain why they support a petition calling for his firing.Independent photo/Zach Despart\n\nADAMS SUPPORTERS\n\nBut Adams was not without some supporters Tuesday evening. Patrick Hartnett, who is retiring as principal of Robinson Elementary School at the end of this year, praised Adams’ leadership and said he was a mentor.\n\n“I’ve found working for David to be very enjoyable. He’s incredibly supportive and very knowledgeable,” Hartnett said.\n\nBristol resident Sheri Bannister noted that while the majority of the residents at the meeting supported the petition to remove Adams, they represent only a fraction of the voters in the supervisory union. Bannister said she believes many residents who didn’t attend the meeting support Adams.\n\n“There are certainly a large portion of people who support the board, who support the superintendent and who support the administrators,” Bannister said. “Let’s be sure we hear from them, too.”\n\nOne of the last comments about the petition drew the largest applause of the evening. Julie Olson, who for several years worked at Beeman Elementary School in New Haven, said there were more important issues for the community to consider than possible legal consequences for firing Adams.\n\n“Can we go back to thinking about our children?” she said.\n\nThe crowd roared in approval.\n\nZach Despart is at [email protected].

  "latent_23219": "The Houston Rockets, winners of 9 straight, travel north for the second game of a back-to-back to face off against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The red-hot Rockets sit tied for 3rd in the Western Conference, while the disappointing Timberwolves sit in the bottom of the standings with the second worst record in the Western Conference. This should be an interesting match up as the Rockets are the 3rd best team in terms of offensive efficiency, while the Timberwolves are the 4th worst team in defensive efficiency.\n\nThe Timberwolves were projected to be a team to look out for this season as many thought the young team could make a leap into the playoff picture with a new coach and young studs Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins. Wins have been a rare commodity as they have not put together back-to-back wins this season. The problems for the Timberwolves have been on the defensive end as they allow 108.9 points per game, which ranks 4th worst in the league.\n\nThe Rockets can win this game if they exploit the Timberwolves defensive weaknesses, and use their high pace to force the young Timberwolves to make mistakes. The focus of the Rockets defensive efforts should lie in stopping defending Rookie of the Year Karl Anthony-Towns. Towns has averaged 21.8 points and 10.4 rebounds this season, and should be a tough task for Ryan Anderson and Clint Capela. The Rockets are good enough to not let this become a “letdown spot” and shouldn’t let their guard down against a young team desperate for wins.\n\n7pm, Root Sports Southwest\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_23283": "A private investment firm, Weston Presidio, controls nearly half of the company and has been looking for an exit. It pushed to take Fender public in March, to howls in the guitar-o-sphere that Fender was selling out. But, to Fender’s embarrassment, investors balked. They were worried about the lofty price and, even more, about how Fender can keep growing.\n\nAnd that, really, is the crux of the matter. Times have changed, and so has music. In the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s, electric guitars powered rock and pop. Today, turntable rigs, drum machines and sampler synthesizers drive music like hip-hop. Electric guitars, huge as they are, have lost some of their old magic in this era of Jay-Z, Kanye West and “The Voice.”\n\nGames like Guitar Hero have helped underpin sales, but teenagers who once might have hankered after guitars now get by making music on laptops. It’s worth remembering that the accordion was once the most popular instrument in America.\n\nGranted, Fender is such a powerful brand that it can ride out the lean times. But sales of all kinds of musical instruments plunged during the recession, and they still haven’t recovered fully. Sales of all instruments in the United States totaled $6.5 billion last year, down roughly 13 percent from their peak in 2005, according to Music Trades, which tracks the industry.\n\nMany of the guitars that are selling these days are cheap ones made in places like China — ones that cost a small fraction of, say, a $1,599 Fender Artist “Eric Clapton” Strat. Fender has been making its own lines of inexpensive guitars overseas for years, but the question is how the company can keep growing and compete profitably in a fast-moving, global marketplace. Its margins are already under pressure.\n\n“What possible niche is left unexploited by Fender?” asks Jeffrey Bronchick, founder of Cove Street Capital, an investment advisory firm in El Segundo, Calif., and the owner of some 40 guitars, including four Fenders.\n\nAnother big player on the American music scene, Guitar Center, has already had financial strains. Like Fender, Guitar Center, the world’s largest chain of instrument retailers, is also involved with private equity. It’s controlled by Bain Capital, Mitt Romney’s old firm.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnalysts say Guitar Center is crucial to Fender, accounting for roughly a sixth of Fender’s sales — and the ties between the two run deep. Fender’s chief executive, Larry Thomas, used to be the chief of Guitar Center. He sold the company to Bain at the top of the market in 2007 for $2.1 billion, including debt.\n\nGuitar Center has been losing money since. Moody’s issued a junk rating of B2 on Guitar Center’s debt in October 2007, and has since downgraded the company two more times, most recently in November 2010, to Caa1.\n\nPhoto\n\nTHE change in American music is evident on West 48th Street — the “Music Row” of Manhattan. The block just east of Times Square was once home to dozens of music stores, practice studios and instrument repair shops. It was the place to go to buy a Fender in New York.\n\nNow Music Row is being hollowed out by high rents and competition on the Web. Even Sam Ash, which has been there since the 1920s, is moving to West 34th Street.\n\nFender, too, has had to contend with changing tastes and markets. Once it looked like the Pan Am of guitars, a storied name that might simply vanish. Leo Fender sold his company to CBS for $13 million in 1965, but Fender struggled in the ensuing years to maintain its identity inside a big corporation. Analysts said that Fender, under pressure to meet quarterly earnings numbers, made a series of cost cuts that caused quality to suffer and sales to nosedive.\n\nYamaha of Japan, meanwhile, began grabbing market share with inexpensive, high-quality guitars. In 1980, the problems came to a head when Fender posted a $10 million loss on only $40 million in sales.\n\n“In 1970, nobody wanted a Yamaha musical instrument, but by 1980 they were beginning to dominate, along with many other Japanese companies,” says Bill Mendello, the former chief of Fender and today a member of its board. “And they were, frankly, better made and a lot cheaper than U.S. manufacturing.”\n\nIn the 1980s, Mr. Mendello, then a top executive in CBS’s musical instruments division, and Bill Shultz, then president of Fender, developed a plan to save Fender. To make it happen, they had to take on William S. Paley, the feared head of CBS. Their plan called for CBS to invest heavily — about $50 million over five years — in Fender and to revamp marketing. Mr. Paley signed off.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut three years into the plan, Mr. Paley was out and new management decided to sell the music division. With Fender losing money, there were few buyers. CBS considered liquidating the company. Instead, Mr. Schultz and Mr. Mendello engineered a $12.5 million leveraged buyout. Before long, Fender was back in the black.\n\nFender gradually clawed its way back up in the ’80s and ’90s, beefing up quality, training and oversight, and, for the first time, starting to manufacture guitars internationally, especially in Japan and South Korea. Restoring quality was crucial, Mr. Mendello says. Artists like Mr. Clapton, who had modified his Strat “Blackie,” were impressed with Fender’s craftsmanship. Leo Fender died in 1991 at the age of 82; in 2001, Weston swooped in, buying a 43 percent stake of Fender for $58 million.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMr. Mendello says the recent recession was tougher on Fender than past downturns.\n\n“Fender and the whole music industry got hit pretty hard,” he says. “People were afraid to buy anything or do anything. They didn’t know if they’d have a job.”\n\nMany in the industry praise Fender for branching out into other areas, including making and selling steel-string acoustic guitars and cutting deals with various other brands like Gretsch guitars and drums and Sabian cymbals. But one of the biggest competitors for new Fender guitars is old Fender guitars. Many players believe — rightly or wrongly — that the Fenders of the 1950s, the ’60s and even the ’70s, when analysts say quality suffered, have a special something. A vintage Fender won’t make a novice sound like a Hendrix. But many pros say that at their level, the equipment matters. Prices of vintage Fenders have soared accordingly.\n\nRick Barrio Dill, the bassist for the soul and rock band Vintage Trouble, was frantic when his customized Fender Reissue Precision bass guitar was stolen while his group was touring with the Cranberries last May. Playing another brand was out of the question.\n\n“It put a feeling in my stomach like someone had just died — I was a complete wreck,” Mr. Dill remembers.\n\nHe alerted his fans via Twitter, and before long the story reached the Gibson Guitar Corporation, Fender’s big competitor, which offered a replacement. Mr. Dill turned it down. Then Fender made a similar offer — and Mr. Dill pounced.\n\n“I kind of bleed Fender,” he says.\n\nHe, too, is chasing vintage Fenders. He bought a 1969 Tobacco Sunburst Fender Jazz Bass in 1999 for $1,200 and sold it four years later for $2,500. “I’m trying to buy the exact bass now, and it’s selling for $6,500 or $7,000,” he says.\n\nVideo\n\nDUFF McKAGAN, the former bassist for Guns N’ Roses and Velvet Revolver, grew up listening to Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith and the Clash. He used to drop by the Guitar Center branch on Hollywood’s Sunset Strip, when that company was independent, and dream about buying a Fender bass.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“I’m sure they got sick and tired of me coming in,” Mr. McKagan says. He still plays the 1985 Fender Jazz Special he bought after Guns N’ Roses landed its first record deal.\n\nHe can attest to the durability of Fenders. Once he tried to imitate Paul Simonon of the Clash by smashing his bass at the end of a show.\n\n“I took a full swing and brought it down on this metal grate stage — and nothing happened,” Mr. McKagan recalls. After 20 or so tries, one shard of wood came loose. “That was enough for me,” he says, adding that he never tried to smash a Fender again.\n\nSuch testimonials aside, the question is where Fender will go from here. It has been hurt by the economic slump in Europe, a region that accounts for 27 percent of net sales, and the situation there could hang over Fender for years.\n\nThe company has also been criticized by Wall Street analysts for acquiring the Kaman Music Corporation, a distributor of musical instruments and accessories, in 2008 for $117 million. The company, which it renamed KMC Music, is a low-margin business and has squeezed Fender’s overall profit margins.\n\nFender filed to go public in an initial stock offering in March, in a deal that would have valued the company at as much as $396 million. That is a pittance by Facebook standards. But the price was high for a company of Fender’s size.\n\nBankers and investors scoffed. Fender, they said, was trying to go public as a “growth” company when its sales were declining.\n\n“It made no sense,” says Arnold Ursaner, president of CJS Securities in White Plains.\n\nThe talk on Wall Street was that Weston Presidio was pushing to sell at a high price. Weston executives declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“They saw a window and said let’s try to hit it and maybe no one will pay attention to the negative sales trends,” Mr. Ursaner says. “It was banking at its worst.”\n\nIn documents filed in connection with the proposed initial public offering, Fender outlined avenues that it contended would bolster growth, such as sales to emerging markets like China and India, the addition of more licensing and co-branding deals, and strategic acquisitions.\n\nMr. Bronchick, the analyst, speculates that investment bankers didn’t wanted to take the offer at such a high valuation.\n\n“Nobody wants to be embarrassed like Facebook,” he says.\n\nAT Fender, Mr. Mendello doesn’t rule out a future public offering. Fender might try again sooner rather than later, because about $237 million of its $246 million in long-term debt will be due in 2014.\n\nMr. Mendello, who owns 4.8 percent of Fender, says he isn’t looking to cash out personally. Neither are the company’s other shareholders, he says.\n\n“I love Fender — it’s the greatest company in the world,” he says. “We’re here for the long-term, and we’re going to do what’s right for Fender.”",
  "latent_23449": "Rising wealth and income inequality is a threat to democracy, Hillary Clinton said in an interview published Tuesday in the magazine Der Spiegel. Clinton was responding to a question about the recent best-selling tome \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century,\" written by French author Thomas Piketty and translated into English.\n\nPiketty argues that over time capital has grown faster than income from labor, which Clinton translated as society devaluing work. Clinton said she hasn't yet read the book but has read \"long essays about it\" and understand the thesis.\n\n\"I think he makes a very strong case that we have unbalanced our economy too much towards favoring capital and away from labor,\" she said. \"And I agree with his principal concern, which is that we have devalued labor.\"\n\nThe German magazine noted to Clinton that \"Piketty argues that the growing gap between the rich and the poor is threatening democracy.\"\n\nClinton seconded the notion. \"I do agree with that,\" she said. \"We've had this huge experiment known as America that was a diversity of populations, and we have held it together because we had a democracy that slowly over time included everybody. Even during the Great Depression people in the streets believed that they could make it and they would be better off. Now the relative wealth is much higher, but the disparity makes people believe that they're stuck. They no longer believe that things are going to get any better, no matter how hard they work. People have lost trust in each other and the political system and I think that's very threatening to democracy.\"\n\nAt the recent Aspen Ideas Festival, Clinton hit on a similar theme, arguing that if people don't believe they have a stake in the future of the country, they lose trust in the political system.\n\nClinton, a former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state, is mulling a bid for president.

To make the experience more seamless, go into your preferences and activate “Tap to click” and “Secondary click,” which will allow you to tap the trackpad with two fingers simultaneously to trigger a right click. It may sound odd, but it takes only a few minutes to get used to. You can also just hold two fingers down on the trackpad and click the physical mouse button to get the same effect. Of course, plugging a two-button mouse into a Mac is another way to get your right-click back.\n\nTweak Mouse-Tracking Speed\n\nThe mouse tracking on a Mac feels quite different from that of Windows because it does not accelerate. This can be partly alleviated by turning the tracking speed all the way up. But if you really pine for that Windows feel, you can try SteerMouse, albeit for $20.\n\nTurn Off Screen-Dimming\n\nWhile some people want their screen to dim after a period of inactivity, it can quickly become annoying for others. This feature can be turned off in the preferences under the options for “Energy saver.”\n\nTurn on the Firewall\n\nMacs include two firewalls: a packet-filtering firewall called IPFW that filters traffic based on type, port number, origin and destination, and a socket-filter firewall (new in Leopard) that filters based on the application making the request. While the socket-filter firewall in OS X is disabled by default, you can go into “Preferences > Security > Firewall” to enable it. IPFW is short on configuration options, but that can be remedied by downloading either NoobProof or WaterRoof, which give you more security options.\n\nLog-In Items\n\nSetting applications to start upon logging in is actually quite simple on a Mac. If the application you want to start at log-in is on your dock, simply right-click its icon and choose “Open at log-in.” You can also go into “Preferences > Accounts > [your account] > Log-in items” and add applications manually there. Keep in mind that the more applications you set to open at log-in, the longer your systems will take to boot.\n\nYou can also change the background for the main log-in screen on your Mac. This handy little piece of freeware takes whatever your desktop background is and mirrors it onto your log-in screen. Or you can use the following command in your terminal to change it to any image you want:\n\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow DesktopPicture “/Library/path_to_your_pic/your_pic.jpg”\n\nHot Corners\n\nHot corners allow you to set up each corner of your screen to be a hot spot that triggers an event whenever you mouse over it, such as shuffling active windows to off screen to show the desktop or displaying widgets. This gets interesting when combined with the “Expose” and “Spaces” features.\n\nExpose spreads your windows out on the screen so that you can focus on a new one. Once you get used to it, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it. To make it really useful, set up a hot corner to activate it. Additionally, Spaces allows you to display multiple desktops from a bird’s-eye view. Add this to another corner and you’ve got something really special. You’ll be able to show the desktop, drag a file, switch to a different space, find a window that’s hidden behind several others and drop the file into that window, all with one mouse click. Check it out in the video below:\n\nPlay around with different hot corner configurations to find the one that best suits you. I recommend using three of the four for the “Expose All Windows” and “Show Desktop” functions and Spaces. If you have a laptop, setting one of the corners to put the display to sleep is handy because no button or key does that otherwise.\n\nConfigure Spaces\n\nHaving multiple desktops to work from can be a boon to productivity. Spaces allows you to create up to 16 different desktops, enough to satisfy even the most spastic multi-tasker. Along with these desktops, you can specify that certain applications only open in certain spaces, as well as specify that some apps display no matter which desktop you’re working in. Here are a few applications we suggest displaying in all spaces: Chat applications (Adium, iChat, IRC), movie players (VLC, QuickTime, DVD player), Twitter clients and any application useful in more than one context. I have a space for general Web browsing, iTunes and iPhoto, email and communications, Photoshop and design, coding and development, Windows virtualization, notes and reminders and one that I keep clean just in case.\n\nAdd Activity Monitor to the Dock\n\nActivity monitor is the equivalent of the task manager in Windows. Certain items, when added to the Dock, take on a few extra behaviors. In the case of the activity monitor, those items can display helpful information instead of their icons while sitting in the dock: such as a pie chart showing how much memory is being used, a live graph of processor activity and more. While you can always pop up a window and hit Command + Option + Esc (your new Ctrl + Alt + Delete) to force quit an application, you don’t get any information about programs that are running. Clicking on the activity monitor gives you the force quit option and a wealth of information about your processes.\n\nA Smarter Finder\n\nFinder is a file explorer that people either love or loath. You can do a few things to make it more useful, though. Right-click on the top part of the finder window, much like you would to edit a toolbar in the browser, and you’ll see that you can configure the buttons in the finder window. Choose “Customize Toobar” and add the “Path,” “Delete,” and “New Folder” buttons, along with any others you desire.\n\nIn the left sidebar of the finder, you’ll see a list of favorites, including your home folder, main disk drives, any attached drives and the most used folders (photos, music, sites, etc.). You can customize this list by dragging folders and other items onto the sidebar. You can also add “smart folders” (File > New smart folder) that filter files based on a set of rules. For instance, one smart folder I keep in my sidebar is a list of all files over 100 MB, in case I need to free up some hard drive space. If you want to add separators to the sidebar, there’s a neat little guide on how to do that here.\n\nYou can download toolbar scripts for even more functionality. For instance, you can add a button that opens the terminal in whatever folder you are currently browsing. Check them out here. Of course, if you end up hating the finder, you can try an alternative, like Cocoatech’s Path Finder\n\nHacks\n\nWidgets on Your Desktop\n\nWidgets are Apple’s version of Konfabulator (now Yahoo! Widgets), but unlike Konfabulator, they are doomed to exile in the dashboard (a “second desktop” that pops up when you hit the right keys or hot corner). The problem with Dashboard is that the more widgets you have running, the longer they all take to pop up the first time you activate it after a restart. If you prefer to have your widgets available on demand on the desktop, enter the following command into your Mac terminal:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES\n\nTo place a widget on the desktop, open up Dashboard, start dragging the widget and close the dashboard. Unfortunately, widgets will stay on top of all your windows. Frustratingly, the only way to override this behavior is to get a paid application called Amnesty Widgets, which makes OS X’s widgets more like Yahoo Widgets. Of course, you could just use Yahoo! Widgets and forget OS X’s widgets altogether.\n\nChange Command to Control\n\nThis is an adequate configuration for most, but an absolute lifesaver for some. It took me a while to get used to using Command instead of Control, but I eventually broke the old habit. Some people have been known to give up on the platform because of this issue. For those of you who have a hard time adjusting, simply map the Command key to Control. doublecommand and fKeys are popular utilities that let you do all sorts of custom mapping to make your switch easier.\n\nMaximize Your Zoom\n\nOne of the weirdest quirks to get used to when switching to the Mac is the behavior of the “Zoom” button on windows (the green button in the top-left corner of all windows). Instead of sticking the four sides of the window to the very edges of the screen, Zoom will simply expand the size of the window to fit the screen but the window will remain draggable. Often it doesn’t even do this and instead changes the size of the window in unexpected and frustrating ways. Luckily you can download a handy little plug-in to force Zoom to use the window’s maximize function. Other than using this plug-in, you’ll have to get used to dragging the bottom-right corner of the window to force it.\n\nHidden Applications, Hidden Files\n\nIf you ever need to find files that are hidden by default, type this into the terminal:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\n\nYou can hide windows by hitting Command + h, but you get no indication that a window is hidden once it’s gone. To make the application icon more transparent in the dock when it is hidden, type this into the terminal:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock showhidden -bool YES killall Dock\n\nQuick Look Expanded\n\nQuick Look can save you precious seconds by showing you a preview of a file before opening it in its default program. Simply hit the space bar on a file to activate it. This is limited to certain files, but a few handy plug-ins out there give you Quick Look functionality for folders, Zip files and more. theAppleBlog.com has compiled a great list of fours such plug-ins.\n\nSafari Debugger\n\nSafari offers a great browsing experience, despite what you may have heard. It’s quick, clean and powerful, although not that easy to customize. You can apply a few neat hacks to make it a little more useful though. To enable the surprisingly rich Web development debugger tool, type this into your terminal:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeDebugMenu YES\n\nFor a wealth of Safari hacks and plug-ins, check out Safari Hacks and Pimp My Safari. SAFT is a great extension for Safari that provides a lot of great functionality for $12.\n\nCustomize Your Dock\n\nApple has very definite feelings about how the Dock should look because it does not give you many means of customization. To mess with the look and feel of the Dock, you can try Mirage, which removes all styling, Candybar, which gives you a variety of styling options, and Leopard Docks, a website dedicated to custom Dock stylings.\n\nWhen the Dock is on the left or right side of your screen, it goes from a 3-D look to 2-D. If you prefer the 2-D and bottom-screen configuration, type this into your terminal:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES killall Dock\n\nAs far as the Dock’s behavior goes, here’s a must-have hack you can apply. Add a “Recent files” stack to the Dock by entering the following in your terminal:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array-add ‘{ “tile-data” = { “list-type” = 1; }; “tile-type” = “recents-tile”; }’ killall Dock\n\nOpen-With Defaults\n\nIf you want a certain file to open in a certain program, right-click on a file of that file type and select “Get info,” which will bring up a box with all sorts of information about the file. We’re interested here in the “Open with” section, where you can choose its default program. Once you’ve selected the proper program, click the “Change All” button to make it the default program for all files of that file type. One suggestion: make TextEdit your default program for .doc and .docx files: it opens them much faster than Word or OpenOffice.\n\nSoftware\n\nWhile the software library on the Mac pales in comparison to the one on Windows in terms of sheer volume, it does have quite a bit of polish. This polish, however, often doesn’t come without a price. Free software for the Mac does exist out there, but it’s not nearly as widely available as you’re probably used to with Windows. That being said, there are quite a few apps, both free and paid, that you should install on your Mac to make the experience much more enjoyable and productive. Here are a few to get you started:\n\nMultimedia\n\nFlip4Mac Install the free version to play WMV with QuickTime.\n\nPerian Every codec you’ll ever need for QuickTime.\n\nVLC The de facto media player for the Mac. Not only does it eliminate the need for the two pieces of software mentioned above, it provides more features than you’ll probably ever care to use. Use VLC instead of the built-in DVD player as well. VLC integrates nicely with OS X, and you can even use your Apple remote with it. Just download it.\n\nConnect360 If you want to stream movies, pictures and music to your Xbox 360, this is a great solution for the Mac; some claim it works better than Microsoft’s implementation.\n\nTransmission A very lightweight and solid bit torrent client for the Mac. It fits in very well with OS X, style-wise.\n\nSongbird Not everyone wants to use iTunes to manage their music collection. Many prefer Songbird, the much-loved open-source alternative.\n\nSystem and General Purpose\n\nGrowl If having uniform system-wide notifications for all your applications sounds intriguing, you’ll want to check out Growl. It works with a vast array of software and is extremely customizable. Some notifications you’ll receive let you know when new email, instant messages or Twitter messages arrive, when your downloads are complete, when your computer has been unplugged and when a new song is playing on Last.fm (complete with artist and details). Growl has a myriad of useful plug-ins and uses. Take, for instance, the growl notification that tells you when your tests have passed in your Web application: a must for any Mac user.\n\nUnplugged http://unplugged.en.softonic.com/mac/download (unplugged)\n\nQuicksilver While OS X does have the “Spotlight” feature, which allows you to quickly find files and launch applications, it pales in comparison to the snappiness and customizability of the application-launcher Quicksilver, which is very similar to Firefox’s Ubiquity. Much like Growl, you can install tons of useful plugins to tailor the experience to your needs. When you start using Quicksilver regularly, you’ll find yourself going to the Dock less and less to launch and interact with your applications. It’s lightening fast and quite powerful. Imagine hitting a keyboard shortcut, typing “email,” “tab,” “compose,” , and “enter” to send a quick email to somebody. Another must have.\n\nFluid If you’re anything like me, you spend a lot of your computer time interacting with Web applications rather than client-side applications. You may miss the neatness of applications existing independently of your Web browser, too. If you do, then Fluid is the solution. It takes any Web page you specify and contains it within its own Mac application, complete with icon and windowing preferences. Imagine having a dedicated app for your Google documents, Facebook, your favorite Twitter client, your Web analytics and more. It draws on the same idea that Adobe is pushing with Air. Fluid is as extensible and customizable as Growl and Quicksilver.\n\nThe Unarchiver You’re going to want a program that can handle StuffIt, RAR, ZIP and other compression file types with ease, and the Unarchiver is it. Free and straightforward.\n\nsmcFanControl Macs tend to be a bit more of a walled garden than other computers, but that doesn’t mean they have to be. With the right amount of research, you can usually find a piece of software or terminal hack that bends the Mac to your will. smcFanControl is one such application, made for those who want to control just how hot their laptops get.\n\nCarbon Copy Cloner If you ever need to transfer your hard drive to another machine, and you will, Carbon Copy Cloner is truly the best solution to the problem. It’s rock solid, simple to use and makes the whole process extremely pain free.\n\nCommunications\n\nAdium Adium is the de facto chat client for the majority of high-end Mac users out there. It covers more networks than are worth listing here. This is another must-have app.\n\nColloquy Probably the best IRC client for the Mac. Well designed and extremely extensible.\n\nThunderbird A great alternative to the default Mail application.\n\nProductivity\n\nGimp Because the Mac doesn’t come with built-in image editing software of any kind, Gimp, the open-source alternative to Photoshop, is a handy install.\n\nTextmate Probably the most popular text editor for the Mac. It’s a hefty $50 but worth every penny.\n\nSketchbox An improvement to OS X’s Stickies.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, there you have it, some configurations, hacks and applications that will make your transition easier. As you make your way on your journey switching over, remember to seek out other Mac users, specifically other switchers, when you have questions or need advice. And as always, check Smashing Magazine regularly for more helfpul Mac guides, articles and resources.",
  "latent_23700": "WASHINGTON - Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch today recognized a team from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, the FBI’s Washington Field Office, and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for its exceptional work against child exploitation and human trafficking in the Washington, D.C. area.\n\nThe team members were among 376 Justice Department employees and 47 individuals outside of the department to receive Attorney General Awards at a ceremony in Washington, D.C. Today’s 64th annual ceremony recognized individuals for their outstanding service and dedication to carrying out the missions of the Department of Justice.\n\nThe Washington Metro Child Exploitation Task Force was honored with the award for Distinguished Service, one of the Justice Department’s highest honors. The task force, consisting of members from the FBI’s Washington Field Office, MPD, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, has played an instrumental role in identifying, disrupting and dismantling the most egregious perpetrators in child exploitation and human trafficking within the greater Washington, D.C., metropolitan area and beyond its area of responsibilities. The team has demonstrated a history of success in penetrating the secret and often reclusive cyber world of child predators.\n\n“The Attorney General’s Awards provide us with a rare opportunity to honor the efforts of outstanding department employees and our invaluable partners across the federal government and at the state and local levels,” said Attorney General Lynch. “Their work has made our nation – and our world – stronger, safer and more just, and I am proud of and inspired by each and every one of them.”\n\n“These awards are a fitting tribute for a longstanding task force whose members literally work around the clock to rescue children from sexual abuse and exploitation,” said U.S. Attorney Channing D. Phillips. “The selfless teamwork and unwavering dedication displayed by the Child Exploitation Task Force are emblematic of the tremendous and critical work being done each day by law enforcement to protect vulnerable victims from dangerous predators who lurk in cyberspace and our community.”\n\n“The members of the Washington Metro Child Exploitation Task Force have done exemplary work in protecting the most vulnerable members of our society,” said Assistant Director in Charge Abbate. “These agents, analysts, and task force officers have worked tirelessly and skillfully to investigate, disrupt, and bring to justice those who exploit and abuse children. Every day, they are faced with some of the most challenging and critical work in law enforcement, and today they have been honored for their truly heroic work.”\n\n“Through collaboration with our partners and an unwavering dedication of each agency to make the Internet safer for children, we will continue to ensure the safety of our children as a top priority,” said Peter Newsham, Interim Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nThe Distinguished Service Award is one of the Justice Department’s highest honors for employee performance. Recipients exemplify the highest commitment to the Justice Department’s mission. The team members who were honored today include Cyber Division Supervisory Special Agent Brenda K. Born, Supervisory Special Agent Andrew Patrick Leithead, Special Agents Sean P. Clark, Jenny M. Cutalo-Patterson, Tonya Sturgill Griffith, Alicia M. McShane and Jennifer N. Edwards and Intelligence Analyst Heather L. Gordon Ph.D., all from the FBI’s Washington Field Office; Detectives Jonathan K. Andrews Sr. and Timothy R. Palchak, from the Metropolitan Police Department; and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrea L. Hertzfeld, Cassidy M. Pinegar, Ari B. Redbord and Lindsay J. Suttenberg and Computer Forensic Examiner John E. Marsh, from the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the District of Columbia.\n\nIn announcing the award, the Justice Department commended the task force for its extraordinary dedication, innovative techniques and commitment in identifying and prosecuting these predatory offenders. During 2014 and 2015, the work of the recipients resulted in the rescue of numerous children who were victims of ongoing abuse and exploitation. Undercover officers act swiftly when they learn of victims of sexual abuse and child pornography, and their work has led to arrests of defendants in Ohio, North Carolina, Indiana, Texas, Pennsylvania, and other locations. The task force also assisted in identifying and locating more than 60 victims of sexual abuse and child pornography.",
  "latent_23723": "I’ve always been a sleeper. My father is a musician and a night owl. He usually woke up after lunch time and began a workday that would last until 6am. I guess I took after him because I’ve never been a morning person, at least not the way most people are. The only thing I do when the sun comes up is go to sleep.\n\nI’ve tried to adjust my schedule a million times. I tried resetting my clock by staying awake a whole day then going to sleep at a reasonable time. I’ve tried taking a sleeping pill at a normal hour that way I would wake up with the rest of the world. Unfortunately, my stubborn internal clock would always reset itself to it’s unusual hours after a couple of days of normalcy.\n\nDepression has not really helped the situation. I find myself wanting to stay asleep longer to avoid dealing with the day. If I sleep, I don’t have to do chores, or talk to people, or entertain myself, or deal with any daily responsibilities. I use dreams as an escape from reality. When I close my eyes, I can be who I want. I can imagine myself as a successful individual with a lucrative career in architecture or writing. I can be married with children, or be a successful single mom who can take on the world, or I can be a desirable bachelorette living in a fun penthouse.\n\nWhen the real dreams come, they can be hit or miss. Sometimes I dream about my ex, but those dreams are never good. He is usually with someone else and taunting me emotionally. Sometimes I dream about traveling. I love to travel. I think if I was in a new country every month I would be happy for the rest of my life. Sometimes I dream about food, especially when I’m dieting. I have a lot of nightmares; I’m sure that has to do with my anxieties. A major portion of them contain bugs. I am afraid of insects, but I don’t really understand why I always dream about them.\n\nI tend to sleep 10-12 hours a day. That is pretty much half of my day, everyday. As great as I feel when I sleep, the feeling of uselessness I experience when I’m finally up and about is not worth the dreams. I always tell myself this when I’m in bed, refusing to get up, but for some reason the guilt is not motivation enough to get up. I think maybe it has to do with the fact that I live alone. I have no one to wake up to. Not in a romantic way, but in a “Hey, Noemi, what the hell are you still doing in bed, it’s four in the afternoon!” way. Making a good impression on someone would motivate me to wake up, eat breakfast, and begin my day.\n\nAnybody want to move in? :p\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_23788": "Military commanders in Iraq are drafting plans for U.S. troops to accompany Iraqi brigades as they move to retake Mosul from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, according to two U.S. defense officials.\n\nIf the plans are approved, it would be a significant change for U.S. troops, who would be able to get much closer to the front lines of what is expected to be a fierce battle for Iraq's second largest city.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nU.S. forces are working with Iraqi security forces at the division-level or above with a few exceptions. President Obama has said U.S. forces will be kept out of combat.\n\nThe new plan would see small US. teams of about 15 troops embedded with Iraqi brigades as they move closer to Mosul and establish headquarters in preparation for the pending battle.\n\nIt would stop short of combat operations, but would put troops closer to harm’s way.\n\nIraqi commanders estimate the Mosul offensive will take between eight to 12 brigades — which would mean approximately 180 U.S. troops could take part.\n\nThe teams would work with Iraqi brigade commanders to order airstrikes, and provide intelligence, logistics, tactics, and fire support.\n\nOfficials said having U.S. troops work at this level with Iraqi troops would greatly help the Iraqi Army, which was routed by ISIS when the terrorist group’s fighters took Mosul.\n\n“It would make a massive difference,” said Michael Knights, Iraq expert and the Lafer fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nOther countries are already partnered at lower levels with Iraqi forces, officials say.\n\nRetired Army Col. Peter Mansoor, who served as retired Army Gen. David Petraeus' executive officer during the Iraq surge, said he’s actually heard calls for U.S. troops to partner with Iraqi forces at the battalion-level, which is even lower.\n\n“These train, advise and assist missions at the brigade and division level are really important, I just don't think they go down far enough,” said Mansoor, who is currently the General Raymond E. Mason Jr. Chair of Military History at the Ohio State University.\n\nStill, it would almost certainly expose U.S. troops to more risk.\n\n“The risk is you move off these protected forward operating bases and these troops could be, not just killed, but kidnapped,” said Mansoor. “There are plenty of Shiite militias that would be happy to take American service members captive.”\n\nThe headquarters for the Iraqi troops could be “pretty close to the battlefield,” said James F. Jeffrey, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and the Philip Solondz distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\n“The way the Iraqis do it...a brigade headquarters would get pretty close,” he said.\n\nOne U.S. defense official said the plan is still in the early phases, since the Mosul offensive has not begun.\n\nGen. Lloyd Austin, commander of U.S. Central Command, said earlier this week at a Senate hearing that he recently provided recommendations on how to retake Mosul and Raqqa, ISIS’s stronghold in Syria, to his leadership.\n\nA U.S. defense official said the recommendations have been submitted to the staffs of both Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, and will work their way up.\n\nAnother official said there are about 10 recommendations to accelerate the campaign, and they include the recommendation to advise, assist and accompany at the brigade level.\n\nAustin offered comments at the hearing that suggested additional U.S. troops would benefit the Mosul operation.\n\n“We could develop...better human intelligence. We could perhaps provide more advise and assist teams at various levels,” he said. “We could increase our assistance in terms of providing help with some logistical issues. And we could increase some elements of the special operations footprint.”\n\nJeffrey said he doubted the president would allow U.S. forces to get too close the battlefield, but Carter has spoken candidly of his — and the president’s — desire to do more to accelerate the fight against ISIS.\n\n“I don't think anybody's satisfied with the pace of the — that's why we're all looking to accelerate it. Certainly, the president isn’t,” Carter said on Feb. 9. “And so my instructions are very clear, from my president — he wants to get this done, and I think that that is widely shared.”\n\nIt's not clear yet exactly which forces would carry out the mission at the brigade level, since doing so has not even yet been approved, a U.S. defense official said.\n\nHowever, the official said the plan would envision some of them coming from within Iraq, and some from outside Iraq, which would raise the number of U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nThe official noted that U.S. forces have worked with Iraqi forces at the brigade level before, at Al-Taqqadum Air Base temporarily during the successful fight to retake Ramadi. They have also previously worked at the “team” level only one kilometer from the front lines in the effort to secure Mount Sinjar.\n\nBut experts and officials say the fight to retake Mosul is expected to be far more difficult than the fight for Ramadi.\n\nMosul is ten times larger than Ramadi, and ISIS fighters have been dug in at Mosul since June 2014, while ISIS held Ramadi for only six months.\n\n“Ramadi is a village compared with Mosul and so Mosul's going to be a tough nut to crack there's no doubt,” said Mansoor.\n\n“The bulk of the troops that were the cutting edge of the combat force [in Ramadi] were the Iraqi special operations forces, not their regular Army units,” he added. \"We are banking on the Iraq army to be a lot more effective in the battle for Mosul than it has proven to be in the past.”",

  "latent_23909": "CLOSE President Trump says his administration will replace the travel ban stalled by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nPresident Trump signs executive orders, including a temporary travel ban against people from seven majority-Muslim countries, at the Pentagon in Arlington, Va., on Jan. 27, 2017. (Photo: Olivier Douliery, EPA)\n\nPresident Trump plans to issue a revised version of his temporary travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries as early as Tuesday, with a likely focus on fewer people so it will survive legal challenges.\n\nThe new order, according to a draft obtained by the Associated Press, would focus on the same seven countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — but would only bar entry to those without a visa and who have never entered the United States before. Unlike the original order, people from those countries who already have permanent U.S. residency (green cards) or visas would not face any restrictions.\n\nTrump's first attempt to institute the ban last month led to widespread chaos around the world, as foreigners with green cards and visas were detained at U.S. airports and barred from boarding U.S. flights. That executive order was blocked by several federal judges, who ruled it may have violated constitutional protections for legal immigrants.\n\nTrump said last week that while he disagreed with the rulings from a federal judge in Seattle and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, his revised order would be \"very much tailored\" to those rulings.\n\nThe Jan. 27 order barred citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and Syrian citizens indefinitely. The revised order would not impose an indefinite ban on Syrians, according to the AP.\n\nOn Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the administration will not rescind the old order. Instead, the Department of Justice will conduct a \"dual-track\" system where it continues defending the old order while fighting off expected challenges to the upcoming one.\n\nTrump said a temporary ban is necessary to give his agencies time to develop \"extreme vetting\" procedures from those terror-prone countries to ensure that terrorists don't enter the country.\n\nLegal experts said Trump's new approach will be more difficult to beat in court. \"It definitely seems like he'd be on much stronger ground,\" said Andrew Hessick, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who co-signed a federal court brief arguing against Trump's executive order. \"It's very hard to say there's a due process claim for people who are outside the country.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nStill, attorneys who led the charge against Trump's first executive order remain confident they'll prevail in court again because the second version has the same \"core problem.\"\n\n\"We do not think that religious discrimination will automatically be removed simply by tweaking the wording of the executive order,\" said Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney who won a stay of the order in New York. \"We're certainly pleased if certain groups are exempted, like legal permanent residents and existing visa holders. But that will not cure all the legal defects.\"\n\nBy focusing a new executive order on foreigners who have never been in the U.S., the Trump administration also makes it difficult for anyone to even initiate a lawsuit.\n\nWashington state and Minnesota won suits against the order because it limited the rights of foreign-born, legal residents living in those states and hurt state universities that have foreigners from those countries working as employees and paying tuition as students. If those people are allowed to travel freely under the new ban, Washington and Minnesota would have to find a new approach.\n\nEven under the revised order, some legal experts say states could still argue that their residents and universities are illegally hurt. For example, a state university could say it cannot recruit students or faculty from Somalia. Or permanent residents from Yemen could say their rights to sponsor relatives living back home for a visa have been taken away without due process.\n\n\"With the right plaintiffs, there remains the possibility that the constitutional claim could be brought,\" said Robert Chang, a law professor at the Seattle University School of Law and executive director of the Fred T. Korematsu Center for Law and Equality.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2loslAw",

  "latent_24472": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Saudi-backed Syrian opposition ruled out even indirect negotiations with Damascus before steps including a halt to Russian air strikes, contradicting U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s insistence that talks will begin next week.\n\nGeorge Sabra, a veteran Christian opposition figure, attends a meeting in Istanbul July 4, 2013. REUTERS/Murad Sezer/Files\n\nWith the five-year-old Syrian war showing no signs of ending, it looks increasingly uncertain that peace talks will begin as planned on Jan. 25 in Geneva, partly because of a dispute over the composition of the opposition delegation.\n\nPeace efforts face huge underlying challenges, among them disagreements over President Bashar al-Assad’s future and tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Russia on Friday denied a report that President Vladimir Putin had asked Assad to step down last year.\n\nThe Syrian government has said it is ready to take part in the Geneva talks on time. The office of U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura said he was still aiming “at rolling out the talks” on Jan. 25, and would be “assessing progress over the weekend”.\n\nRussia said the talks could be delayed until Jan. 27 or 28 because of the disagreement over who would represent the opposition.\n\nGeorge Sabra, a senior opposition official, said the obstacles to the talks were still there, reiterating demands for the lifting of blockades on populated areas and the release of detainees, measures set out in a Dec. 18 Security Council resolution that endorsed the peace process.\n\n“There must be a halt to the bombardment of civilians by Russian planes, and sieges of blockaded areas must be lifted,” said Sabra, who was this week named as a senior member of the opposition delegation to any talks. “The form of the talks does not concern us, but the conditions must be appropriate for the negotiations,” he told Reuters.\n\nSabra’s opposition council, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), was formed in Saudi Arabia last month. It groups Assad’s political and armed opponents, including rebel factions fighting Damascus in western Syria.\n\nThe west is the main theatre of the war between rebels and Damascus, whose military position has been bolstered since September by Russian warplanes and Iranian ground forces.\n\nRussian warplanes continued to bomb many parts of western and northern Syria on Friday, particularly Latakia province, where the government is pressing an offensive against rebels, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.\n\nPro-government forces captured a dam 10 km (6 miles) from the town of Salma, seized last week in one of the most significant gains since Russia intervened. “They’ve tightened their stranglehold on (rebel) fighters in the Latakia countryside,” Observatory director Rami Abdulrahman said.\n\nLater in the day they recaptured another five villages, all in hills overlooking insurgent positions, he said, describing it as a “strategic advance” towards the Turkish border.\n\nAir strikes also hit areas in the east near where government forces have been fighting against Islamic State, which controls most of the province. Raids believed to be either Russian or Syrian killed 30 civilians near Deir al-Zor city, the Observatory said.\n\nHIJAB TO MEET KERRY\n\nWhile rebels have received military support from Assad’s foreign enemies, states including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar and the United States, their calls for more effective weapons including anti-aircraft missiles have gone unanswered.\n\nOne of the biggest rebel factions in the HNC, Jaysh al-Islam, said the opposition was facing “many pressures” to make concessions but credited Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar for helping it to “overcome these pressures”.\n\nThe lead negotiator picked by the HNC for the hoped-for negotiations is a Jaysh al-Islam member, another potential complication facing the talks because Russia says it is a terrorist group.\n\nHNC chair Riad Hijab is due to meet Kerry on Saturday and “all the matters will be tabled clearly”, Sabra said.\n\nA senior U.S. State Department official confirmed Kerry was likely to meet Hijab to “check the tyres on the way forward (on talks)... that will hopefully kick off next week.”\n\nRussia views the HNC as a Saudi attempt to dictate who represents the opposition. The HNC has said it will not join any negotiations if a third party attends, rejecting Russia’s bid to expand the opposition delegation to include the Kurdish PYD and others.\n\nThe Kurds control vast areas of northern and northeastern Syria where they have set up an autonomous administration which they say should be a model for settling the Syrian conflict.\n\nThe opposition accuses the Kurds of cooperating with Damascus, a charge they deny. One opposition official said on Thursday the Kurds should attend on the government side.\n\nSyrian Kurdish leader Saleh Muslim told Reuters that the Syrian Kurds must be represented at peace talks or they will fail. He also accused Jaysh al-Islam of fostering the “same mentality” as al Qaeda and Islamic State.\n\n“If there are some parties that are effective in this Syria issue who are not at the table, it will be the same as what happened in Geneva 2,” Muslim, co-chair of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) told Reuters, referring to failed negotiations in 2014.\n\nJaysh al-Islam last year backed away from hardline Islamist rhetoric heard from it earlier in the conflict, saying Syrians should be free to pick their form of government and Alawites were part of the Syrian nation.\n\nThe Kremlin on Friday rejected a report that an envoy for Putin asked Assad to step down last year, TASS news agency reported.\n\nThe Financial Times had earlier reported that the head of Russian military intelligence agency travelled to Damascus at the end of last year to ask Assad to step down only to be angrily rebuffed.",

Richardson reportedly first worked out for the Ravens in early March.\n\nRichardson continued his offseason training to shed pounds before flying to Baltimore Sunday night for one final check-in before signing, according to Alabama Media Group.\n\nIt’s a new start for Richardson, who had a quick fall from the spotlight.\n\nRichardson spent last year out of the NFL after being the No. 3 overall pick of the Cleveland Browns in the 2012 NFL Draft. Two games into his second season, the Browns traded him to Indianapolis. Richardson spent two years there before becoming a free agent in 2015. He signed with Oakland that offseason but didn’t make the Raiders’ roster out of training camp, in part because of injuries.\n\nRichardson struggled to keep his weight down during his first four seasons, which played a part in his 3.3-yard rushing average.\n\nStill, he’s a very talented back who, if given the right motivation and training, could find his old form. As Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome is well aware of, Richardson had a stellar career at the University of Alabama, where he rushed for 3,243 yards and 35 touchdowns in three seasons.",
  "latent_24807": "The Canadian Health Department states that airborne transmission of Ebola is strongly suspected and the CDC admits that Ebola can be transmitted in situations where there is no physical contact between people, i.e.: via direct airborne inhalation into the lungs or into the eyes, or via contact with airborne fomites which adhere to nearby surfaces. That helps explain why 81 doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers have died in West Africa to date. These courageous healthcare providers use careful CDC-level barrier precautions such as gowns, gloves, and head cover, but it appears they have inadequate respiratory and eye protection. Dr. Michael V. Callahan , an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital who has worked in Africa during Ebola outbreaks said that minimum CDC level precautions\n\nThe public has been misinformed regarding human-to-human transmission of Ebola . Assurances that Ebola can be transmitted only through direct contact with bodily fluids need to be seriously scrutinized in the wake of the West Africa outbreak.\n\n“led to the infection of my nurses and physician co-workers who came in contact with body fluids.”\n\nCurrently the CDC advises healthcare workers to use goggles and simple face masks for respiratory and eye protection, and a fitted N-95 mask during aerosol-generating medical procedures. Since so many doctors and nurses are dying in West Africa, it is clear that this level of protection is inadequate. Full face respirators with P-100 (HEPA) replacement filters would provide greater airway and eye protection, and I believe this would save the lives of many doctors, nurses, and others who come into close contact with, or in proximity to, Ebola victims.\n\nThe United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases conducted a monkey to monkey Ebola study in December 1995, published in The Lancet, Vol. 346. (Here is a link to the abstract, but the entire article must be purchased.) Several Rhesus monkeys were infected with Zaire Ebola by intramuscular injection while three control Rhesus monkeys were kept in cages separated 10 feet from the infected monkeys. All of the injected monkeys died of Ebola by day 13 and 2 out of 3 control monkeys died of Ebola by 8 days after that. The authors of this study concluded that:\n\n\"The exact mode of transmission to the control monkeys cannot be absolutely determined, although the pattern of pulmonary antigen staining in one of the control monkeys was virtually identical to that reported in experimental Ebola virus aerosol infection in rhesus monkeys, suggesting airborne transmission of the disease via infectious droplets... Fomite or contact droplet transmission of the virus between cages was considered unlikely. Standard procedures in our BL4 containment laboratories have always been successful in the prevention of transmission of Ebola or Marburg virus to uninflected animals. Thus, pulmonary, nasopharyngeal, oral, or conjunctival exposure to airborne droplets of the virus had to be considered as the most likely mode of infection... Our present findings emphasize the advisability of at-risk personnel employing precautions to safeguard against ocular, oral, and nasopharyngeal exposure to the virus.\"\n\nAnother NHP to NHP (monkey-to-monkey) study was published in July of this year. Rhesus monkeys were infected with Ebola via intramuscular injection and they were terminated on day 6 after becoming unresponsive, but without developing vomiting, diarrhea, or apparent respiratory illness. Ebola virus was detected in their blood, and genetic fragments of Ebola were found in their nose, mouth, and rectum, but no intact infectious Ebola virus was found. Control Cynomolgus monkeys were caged 1 foot away from the infected Rhesus monkeys but did not become infected with Ebola. This experiment is not a helpful comparison in human to human Ebola infections which are characterized by GI (vomiting & diarrhea) and respiratory (cough and expectoration of sputum) shedding of the intact infectious virus. The monkeys in this year’s study simply died too fast, not allowing time for them to shed infectious Ebola particles. It goes without saying that monkeys which do not shed infectious Ebola particles cannot transmit Ebola to other monkeys. Had this year’s rhesus monkeys been infected by the nasal route, as was the case in a pig-to-monkey experiment in 2012, or if they had lived up to 13 days as in the 1995 study, allowing time for intact infectious Ebola virus to appear, and thus more closely matching human Ebola disease, then we may well have seen monkey-to-monkey airborne transmission of Ebola. The authors of this study concluded that:\n\n“NHPs [non-human primates such as monkeys] are known to be susceptible to lethal EBOV infection through the respiratory tract [just like humans] putting the onus of the transmission on the ability of the source to shed infectious particles.”\n\nWe know that airborne transmission of Ebola occurs from pigs to monkeys in experimental settings. We also know that healthcare workers like Dr. Kent Brantly are contracting Ebola in West Africa despite CDC-level barrier protection measures against physical contact with the bodies and body fluids of Ebola victims, so it only makes sense to conclude that some -- possibly many -- of these doctors, nurses, and ancillary healthcare workers are being infected via airborne transmission. It makes perfect sense that sick humans, as they vomit, have diarrhea, cough, and expectorate sputum, and as medical procedures are performed on them, have the ability to shed infectious Ebola particles into the air at a similar or higher level compared to Sus scrofa (wild boar) in the pig-to-monkey study.\n\nDr. Brantly acquired Ebola while strictly following CDC guidelines (simple mask, goggles, or face shield, gloves, gown, leg covering, shoe covers), so it is likely he became infected by inhaling contaminated droplet nuclei into his lungs or having them settle into his conjunctival (eye) sacs despite the use of CDC level protection against direct contact. Dr. Brantly apparently did not use a full-face respirator with P-100 filters, but rather a simple or N-95 face mask. An interviewer noted that\n\n“Brantly says he isn't sure how he got infected. He's certain he didn't violate any [CDC] safety guidelines.”\n\nIt is pretty clear from the current West African Ebola outbreak, particularly in the case of Dr. Kent Brantly and the doctors and nurses working with Dr. Callahan in previous Ebola epidemics, that Ebola-infected human beings are very good at shedding Ebola particles, particularly in the hospital setting. People gravely ill with Ebola are in no way comparable to the Ebola-infected monkeys described in this year’s experimental laboratory setting.\n\nAerosol-generating medical procedures such as surgical operations, endotracheal intubation, airway suctioning,and the operation of mechanical ventilators or BiPap devices place healthcare workers at very great risk, and I suspect even bathing patients is likely to generate infectious airborne droplets into the air. “Casual contact” or spending hours in the same room with Ebola patients also places medical personnel at significant risk, even with the CDC-recommended protective measures listed above. In retrospect it is clear that Dr. Brantly was not at “low risk”, as the CDC would have us believe. As Dr. Michael V. Callahan observed first-hand, and as the case of Dr. Brantly demonstrates, the current CDC guidelines are inadequate for preventing nosocomial transmission of Ebola from patients to medical workers.\n\nIt is not feasible for all medical workers in the United States to use \"spacesuits\" with a self-contained breathing apparatus air supply, as used in BL4 labs and at hospitals specially equipped for Ebola, but at a minimum, the American healthcare system should immediately upgrade respiratory / eye protection to full face mask respirators with P-100 filters for known or suspected cases of Ebola.\n\nThe primary mode of person-to-person Ebola transmission is through direct contact with the body or body fluids of Ebola victims, but it is unwise to ignore the airborne mode. Current evidence supports healthcare workers using a higher level of airway and eye protection than is currently recommended. Although less airborne than Influenza, it is reasonable to conclude that the West African strain of Ebola is at times spread by airborne means since over 170 medical workers have been infected to date, with 81 dead. These victims were using CDC level protective measures against direct contact with the bodies and body fluids of Ebola patients, leaving airborne transmission as the remaining alternative mode. Simple face masks, and N-95 masks as well, are not good enough to filter out Ebola contaminated airborne particles, and they do not have silicon rubber seals against the face to prevent entrainment (leaking) of contaminated room air in clinic and hospital settings. Likewise, goggles and face shields are inferior in eye protection compared to full face respirators with P-100 filters. Since CDC-level respiratory/eye precautions for Ebola are inadequate for healthcare workers in West Africa, I assume they will also be inadequate in the United States.\n\nIf Ebola comes here via infected individuals from affected overseas areas, and spreads from these cases to American medical personnel, the damage to our society would be greatly magnified. Not only would we lose doctors, nurses and other medical workers who could no longer provide care to Ebola victims (not to mention loss of care for the normal influx of patients), the medical team would its self become sources of Ebola transmission to others. Considering the deadly virulence of the Ebola virus, with a 50-90% death rate, it be behooves us to err on the side of safety rather than on the side of risk by increasing the level of respiratory and eye protection for our medical teams.",

  "latent_24898": "Right now, there are two bills filed in the Florida legislature that propose sweeping new restrictions on local governments. One (House Bill 17) would bar them from regulating “businesses, professions, and occupations,” the other (SB 1158), would expressly preempt “the regulation of matters relating to commerce, trade, and labor.” The broad language of the bills has local advocates up in arms and newspapers like the Naples Daily News asking whether “local regulations [are] a thing of the past.” The legislative session to discuss and advance the bills began March 7.\n\nThough egregious, what may be most noteworthy about the bills is how ordinary they actually are. Bills like them have become commonplace in the United States.\n\nLocal governments have become a battleground, and corporate interests seeking to dampen their influence have been proposing and passing bills like these for years. Countless local minimum wage hikes, worker protection bills, rent laws, police oversight initiatives, fossil fuel extraction bans and other progressive reforms have passed across the country since 2008. In Florida, local ordinances on wage theft, expanded paid leave, fracking, gun regulations and more have been central to the left’s platform. Now more than ever, going local has become a key way to make gains and resist — especially under Trump.\n\nIn response, corporate and right-wing interests have used their disproportionate (and often gerrymandered) control over state legislatures to pass “state preemption” bills like HB 17 and SB 1158 to quell local activism. Increasingly, the basic powers of local governments are becoming a keystone in the fight over a slew of issues, including the maintenance of democracy itself.\n\nAs “preemption” spreads and becomes all the more encompassing — or in other words, as more states remove specific or broad powers from local governments — it is beginning to smother basic elements of local democracy. “Home Rule,” which exists to safeguard an assumption of power for local governments, is being silently reversed.\n\nHome Rule powers for municipalities were won decades — and in some states, a century — ago through state constitutional amendments spearheaded by the “Progressive Era.” With Home Rule, localities enjoy a presumption of power, which means that if the state is silent on an issue, municipalities can fill the void. Without Home Rule, all their powers have to be explicitly granted to them by the state, as was the case in Florida, before voters approved a Home Rule amendment in 1968. Municipalities were wards of the state. Home Rule tried to reverse that.\n\nHowever, nothing in the Home Rule amendments placed a check on the state’s authority to unilaterally restrict and weaken Home Rule powers. For example, HB 17 and SB 1158, if passed, would rein in powers the 1968 Florida amendment won for municipalities. As the Florida League of Cities warns, “The bills would return Florida to a time when redress of local problems depended on a statewide body [the legislature] that took official action only once a year and from hundreds of miles away.”\n\nFor years this loophole has been exploited, across the country. Lobbies like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a leading force behind state preemption, and their allies have made it their business to chip away at Home Rule. Now, in 2017, the limits on Home Rule are becoming so far-reaching that Home Rule itself is at risk of being reversed. HB 17, for example, prohibits localities from regulating businesses, professions or occupations unless “expressly authorized by general law.”\n\nThis reversal of whose power enjoys the benefit of the doubt — the state’s power or local power — is a direct echo of a legal doctrine called “Dillon’s Rule,” which treats municipalities as “children” of the state. The 1907 US Supreme Court decision Hunter v. Pittsburgh gave credence and widespread legitimacy to the doctrine. “Municipal corporations,” the court wrote, “owe their origin to, and derive their powers and rights wholly from, the legislature. It breathes into them the breath of life, without which it cannot exist.” Under Dillon’s logic, the state enjoys the benefit of doubt.\n\nNot surprisingly, in January 2016 the American Legislative Exchange Council’s American City County Exchange (ACCE) — created to push local free-market reforms like municipal right-to-work — released a paper in defense of Dillon’s Rule. “Local governments,” they wrote, “are tenants of the state.”\n\nDespite the ramifications of Dillon’s Rule’s supremacy in fights like those raging in Florida and across the country, much of the left’s response to the doctrine remains largely stalled by a dated understanding of local authority. Often, the debate about how much power local governments should have leads to conversations about the dangers of total “local control” on the one hand, and the dangers of an unchecked federal or state government on the other. The conversation typically stalls there, and falls short of a more complex vision for local governments, where neither the municipality nor the state has total control. As a result, the left has largely clung to Home Rule, even as Home Rule itself has been subverted.\n\nACCE actually has a more accurate understanding of Home Rule — which might be one reason the left has been so ill-prepared in its response to state preemption. Although Home Rule gives localities authority to make a range of decisions and Dillon’s Rule creates a framework where local governments can only legislate when the state has explicitly allowed them to, ACCE understands that, “the two are not mutually exclusive.” Home Rule exists within Dillon’s Rule.\n\nAs we see in states across the country, Home Rule does not guard against state-imposed “emergency management,” or sweeping preemption bills that remove essential local powers. The material impacts are clear for millions of Americans fighting for higher wages and better living conditions. Unlike the left, however, ACCE understands how Home Rule is compatible with the dominant Dillon’s Rule, because there is no limit to the restrictions states can place on Home Rule.\n\nThe left’s responses to the attacks on local democracy have largely failed to address these structural realities. Moving beyond a (justified) outrage over preemption has proven difficult. Alternatives to the conditions that give rise to the preemption are largely neglected.\n\nThe best defense is a good offense. So, what might a strong offense look like for local governments?\n\nLocal self-determination has been a demand of Native nations, liberation struggles and neighborhoods for years, decades and centuries. Now, these dormant demands are gaining mainstream recognition. A central demand of the Standing Rock Sioux is self-determination and sovereignty. As Betsy DeVos takes the helm of the US Department of Education, state takeovers of elected school districts will likely spread, prompting education justice groups like the Journey for Justice Alliance to elevate age-old demands for “community control of schools.” In several states, the efforts of the Community Rights Movement to advance a new relationship between states and local residents, which takes into account basic protections for local self-governance, are similarly gaining recognition.\n\nBack in Florida, preemption is emerging as a core political issue. The new organization #DefendLocal, sparked by opposition to preemption of local gun control laws, is spearheading a coalition to “send a message to [their] state lawmakers that local communities want local solutions to local problems, not more heavy-handed state government.” The alliance spans a wide range of advocacy groups: SEIU Florida, Equality Florida, Florida Immigrant Coalition, The Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, Florida National Organization for Women, ReThink Energy Florida and others are all “partner organizations.”\n\nIt’s not clear what the coalition will turn into. What is clear, however, is the historic opportunity for the demand for local self-determination — both as an end and a means to unite the many movements currently restricted by the Dillon’s Rule paradigm.\n\nAcross the board, local self-determination is becoming a central demand of the grassroots and the American public in general. It is no secret that the centralization of political power is a root cause of broad political disillusionment. So it may not matter that the left as a whole currently lacks a clear, robust, alternative vision for local self-government in the 21st century. Calls for self-determination resonate with many people in the US and whispers of a vision for local self-determination are beginning to emerge and gain traction from the ground up.",
  "latent_24911": "BP plans to reduce payments to some 40,000 oil-spill claimants, potentially making life more difficult for individuals and businesses affected by the Gulf oil spill, a Louisiana official has said.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that Louisiana’s secretary for children and family services, Kristy Nichols, found “a significant cut in daily payments” during a recent review of claims against BP, which appears to be related to incomplete forms.\n\nIn a letter to Ken Feinberg, the federal administrator of the oil spill claims process, Nichols wrote that it was “rash” of BP to cut payments to 40,000 of the 99,000 claims filed so far.\n\nNichols wrote:\n\nIt is rash for BP to make this decision without consulting the State to determine if there are alternative methods for obtaining the documentation in State records. If not quickly rectified, the direct impact will be devastating to individuals surviving financially month-to-month. This action is irresponsible and in complete contrast to BP’s repeated promise that they will “make things right.” BP has negatively impacted these people’s livelihoods as a result of the oil spill and has not kept pace with their needs.\n\nNichols suggested that BP use government records, such as those held by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, to fill in missing information. She argued that claimants often don’t have access to the information required on the claim forms.\n\nNichols went on to say that BP is differentiating between claims made as a result of the oil spill and claims made as a result of the moratorium on deepwater drilling enacted by the Obama administration, and recently overturned by federal judge.\n\n“When the State asked BP how many claims fall into this category, representatives stated that the current design of their database does not allow them to identify that information,” Nichols wrote, adding that that amounts to “a significant flaw” in the system’s design.\n\n“The moratorium is the direct result of the oil disaster and people affected should be adequately, accurately and promptly compensated,” she wrote.\n\nNichols also suggested that BP’s willingness to pay claims may be correlated to the political pressure it’s feeling to respond to the oil spill.\n\n“Analysis has shown that BP issued the most claims checks in the middle of June, with a spike that came within a week of additional pressure placed on BP by the State. Payments to large loss claimants show the same type of spike immediately after the state pressured BP regarding those claims,” she wrote.",

I knew I had a great santa even before they sent off my gifts. :)\n\nSo, I got home late last night and noticed I had a package waiting for me at my door. At first I was confused since my latest online purchases weren't set to arrive for another couple of days. Then I saw it was from Sports Authority...I didn't order anything from there. Must be the first package to arrive from my SS!\n\nAs soon as I got inside, I had to open it. (I have no patience. What can I say.) Inside were 2 running shirts, which is perfect because I'm always in training for one race or another and some of my old shirts are definitely ready to retire to the trash can. These will definitely be put to good use and soon!\n\nThank you so much, Santa! I love them and Hunter the cat approves too! You've made me one very happy exchange participant! I can't believe there is more to come! :D\n\nHappy Holidays!!!\n\nUPDATE: I finally received my second package! USPS and I got into a little fight over the delivery (they left a notice, which I signed and left for them, but they didn't re-deliver so I had to drive out and pick it up myself...) but I got it!\n\nI was so excited I forgot to take pictures with my banana for scale...I will get this right at some point!\n\nAs soon as I got home from the post office with my package, I turned on my fireplace for a little ambiance and got right into the unwrapping.\n\nFirst thing right on top was a lovely card and a beautiful photo. I had mentioned in a comment that one of my current dream vacations was a safari, so my santa enclosed a stunning picture she took in Kenya to inspire me. :)\n\nOnce I peeled back the tissue paper, I finally saw all of the gifts to unwrap! They were each wrapped in brown paper packaging and tied up with strings. They also all had little punny cards to go with each theme. I went with the bag first and inside was a cute horseshoe bracelet (I can always use luck at the barn!).\n\nNext I opened up the \"Tea-riffic Australia\" to find a box of the most yummy smelling fruit tea. I immediately put a kettle on so I could try it. (Spoilers: it's delicious!) Then, I went for \"scrumptious Sydney\" which was a bag of chocolate non-pareils (one of my favorite types of chocolate, though I don't think I've ever mentioned that online, so that was amazingly psychic of you, Santa!) and a little chocolate Santa that barely made it through my photo shoot. (He too was delicious.) Iconicly Aussie was 2 packs of Tim Tams (YES!) which likely will not survive the weekend. And last but not least, I mentioned in my profile that I like cute and kitschy souvenirs. Santa surely delivered! I have a brand new Wattle Baby to put on my travel shelf.\n\nOverall, my santa wrangled up an AMAZING haul for me! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (Yes, that had to be shouted!) She put so much thought into every bit of the gift and I could not have asked for a better SS. :D",
  "latent_25070": "For a few hours on Saturday, on July 25, 78 percent of Germany's electricity was produced by wind and solar power.\n\nGermany hopes 80 percent of the country's energy will come from renewables by 2050.\n\nWhat caused the record-breaking numbers? According to Craig Morris, a writer for the German website Energiewende, it was the weather. Morris attributes the rise in wind power to a storm passing through the north of the country, where the majority of Germany's wind turbines stand. It also helped that it was a sunny day in southern Germany, home to most of the country's solar panels.\n\nThe infrastructure that allowed Germany to harness energy from this “perfect storm” has been in place for a few years now. Back in 2011 Germany's government announced plans to phase out nuclear power. Through a project called Energiewende, Germany hopes 80 percent of its energy will come from renewables by 2050.\n\nWhile the goal is lofty for an industrial nation of 80 million people, they've already hit some huge milestones. In 2014, more than 25 percent of Germany's annual energy came from renewables, an increase from 6 percent in 2000.\n\nEnergiewende will cost an estimated €200 billion by the time it's complete. But economists predict the renewable industry will create upwards of 80,000 jobs. And as the price of fossil fuels surpasses the price of other energies, investing in renewables may save Germany money in the long run.\n\nPart of the Energiewende initiative is an interactive tool that lets users see what sources Germany's electricity is coming from. Here is what it looked like last Saturday:\n\nImage from Energy Charts.\n\n\"It’s a significant milestone,\" said Osha Gray Davidson, author of Clean Break, a book that looks at how Germany is handling its energy transition and what America can learn from them.\n\n\"Even if it owes something to unusual weather. I’m always thrilled to see renewable energy records broken,\" Davidson told YES! in an email. \"These events offer hope in rather dark times.\"\n\nCorrection: The original text noted that 78 percent of Germany's power came from renewables on Saturday, July 25.

  "latent_25216": "Here are twenty powerful secrets that will help you form meaningful relationships with people:\n\nWhen two people meet, the prize always goes to the one with the most self-insight. He will be calmer, more confident, more at ease with the other. Never permit the behavior of other people to tell you how you feel. Pay little attention to what people say or do. Instead, try to see their innermost motive for speaking and acting. Any friendship requiring the submission of your original nature and dignity to another person is all wrong. Mystically speaking, there is no difference between you and another person. This is why we cannot hurt another without hurting ourselves, nor help another without helping ourselves. When we are free of all unnecessary desires toward other people, we can never be deceived or hurt. You take a giant step toward psychological maturity when you refuse to angrily defend yourself against unjust slander. For one thing, resistance disturbs your own peace of mind. You understand others to the exact degree that you really understand yourself. Work for more self-knowledge. Do not be afraid to fully experience everything that happens to you in your human relations, especially the pains and disappointments. Do this and everything becomes clear at last. The individual who really knows what it means to love has no anxiety when his love is unseen or rejected. If you painfully lose a valuable friend, do not rush out at once for a replacement. Such action prevents you from examining your heartache and breaking free of it. Do not be afraid to be a nobody in a social world. This is a deeper and richer truth than appears on the surface. Every unpleasant experience with another person is an opportunity to see people as they are, not as we mistakenly idealize them. The more unpleasant the other person is, the more he can teach you. You can be so wonderfully free from a sense of injury and injustice that you are surprised when you hear others complain of them. We cannot recognize a virtue in another person that we do not possess in ourselves. It takes a truly loving and patient person to recognize those virtues in another. Do not mistake desire for love. Desire leaves home in a frantic search for one gratification after another. Love is at home with itself. There are parts of you that want the loving life and parts that do not. Place yourself on the side of the positive forces: do all you can to aid and encourage them. You must stop living timidly from fixed fears of what others will think of you and of what you will think of yourself. Do not contrive to be a loving person: work to be a real person. Being real is being loving. The greatest love you could ever offer to another is to so transform your inner life that others are attracted to your genuine example of goodness.\n\nSource: “Twenty Special Secrets,” from ‘Mystic Path to Cosmic Power‘, by Vernon Howard\n\nPhoto courtesy of: Per Ola Wiberg\n\nOriginally featured on: theunboundedspirit.com",
  "latent_25244": "What is an existential risk? The general concept has been around for decades, but the term was coined by Nick Bostrom in his seminal 2002 paper, here. Like so many empirical concepts – from organism to gene to law of nature, all of which are still debated by philosophically-minded scientists and scientifically-minded philosophers – the notion of an existential risk turns out to be more difficult to define than one might at first think.\n\nIn his 2002 paper, Bostrom defines the term a couple of ways. The most prominent definition specifies an existential risk as “one where an adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential” (my italics). Bostrom provides a matrix to graphically represent this definition, Figure A, which comes from his 2008 co-edited book Global Catastrophic Risks. As you can see, an existential risk is defined as being transgenerational in scope and terminal in intensity.\n\nBy “transgenerational,” Bostrom means that it affects “not only the current world population but all generations that could come to exist in the future.” We’ll examine some problems with this term below. By “terminal,” Bostrom doesn’t mean “an end to our lineage,” as one might assume given the standard dictionary definition of the word. If this were the case, the conception of existential risks as transgenerational-terminal events would directly contradict the second part of the definition above, which counts certain survivable events as existential risks as long as they involve the permanent and drastic compromising of our potential. The idiosyncratic definition adopted by Bostrom characterizes “terminal” in terms of either “causing death or permanently and drastically reducing quality of life,” as he puts it. Essentially, “terminal” can also mean “endurable,” with some extra conditions. So the prima facie contradiction between these two definitions disappears by stipulation: a “terminal” event is one resulting in either death or a lasting reduction of life-quality. Let’s call this Definition #1.\n\nIn my reading of the literature, the term “existential risks” is more often used in a different way, as referring to scenarios in which our species kicks the bucket. For example, the Centre for the Study of Existential Risks states on its website that “an existential risk is one that threatens the existence of our entire species.” Bostrom himself gestures at this definition when he writes, in his 2002 paper, that “an existential risk is one where humankind as a whole is imperiled” (my italics).i Thus, this definition focuses on Homo sapiens in particular, rather than “Earth-originating intelligent life” more generally, which could include a multiplicity of beings in addition to humanity. Let’s call this Definition #2.\n\nNotice that Definition #2 has objective criteria, whereas Definition #1 is thoroughly normative. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it does introduce some complications. For example, what exactly does “intelligent life” mean? If humanityii dies out in a decades-long volcanic winter but chimpanzees survive, would this count as an existential risk? Chimps don’t perform as well as humans on IQ tests, but surely it would be wrong to claim they aren’t “intelligent.”\n\nOne might respond that the potential of earth-originating life would be severely compromised if chimps were to take over the planet. But as before, what exactly does “potential” mean? One answer comes from transhumanism: reaching our potential has something to do with becoming posthuman, with continuing a trend of ever-increasing productivity, efficiency, information processing, economic and population growth, and so on.iii But not everyone agrees with these measures of “progress.” The anarcho-primitivist, for instance, might assert that life will reach its full potential once humanity returns to nature, adopting the old hunter-gatherer mode of subsistence we abandoned 12,000 years ago. Others might argue, as Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway (implicitly) do in their book The Collapse of Western Civilization, that the relevant measure of progress shouldn’t be gross domestic product, but “the Bhutanian concept of gross domestic happiness.”\n\nWhile one can put forth more or less cogent arguments for these positions, the point is that there exist no “facts of the matter” at which one can point to settle disputes about what “potential” means. The same goes for “intelligent life”: where do we draw the line? Is counting human beings but not chimps as intelligent life too anthropocentric? These are non-trivial issues, as they call into question the core meaning of Definition #1.\n\n(One might also object that the word “permanent” is too strong. Why? Because it disqualifies scenarios in which human civilization is severely crippled for millions, even billions of years, but then recovers, from counting as existential risks. As long as the damage isn’t forever, the risk ain’t existential, even if it’s nearly forever. The further out one goes in time, the less plausible the word “permanent” appears.)\n\n***\n\nThere are more pressing issues, though: both Definition #1 and #2 are susceptible to Gettier-like counterexamples, or outcomes that quack like a duck but aren’t, and ones that don’t quack like a duck but are. Beginning with Definition #2, consider the fact that in evolutionary biology every state is an in-between state. There are no final forms, only transitional ones. This means that (even bracketing the phenomenon of cyborgization) Homo sapiens is not a permanent fixture of the biosphere: we are a mere link between the not-yet-extant and the already extinct.\n\nImagine for a moment that millions of years pass and natural selection drastically modifies our phenotypes. We become a new species, call it Gedanken experimentus. Imagine further that this species is more intelligent, wise, physically fit, and altruistic than we have ever been. For example, it figures out how to create dual use technologies that could destroy the universe, while also figuring out how to prevent them from ever being used this way. Gedanken experimentus is, in a word, better than us, relative to some non-controversial criteria of evaluation.\n\nThe problem is that if one equates an existential risk with human extinction, as Definition #2 does, the above situation counts as an existential risk, since the appearance of Gedanken experimentus millions of years from now through anagenesis (let’s say) would mean the extinction of Homo sapiens. Yet this scenario looks positively desirable. In fact, transhumanism explicitly promotes the extinction of our species; this is what the creation of posthumanity is all about. We “transcend” our current nature, which is “a work-in-progress, a half-baked beginning that we can learn to remold in desirable ways” (from Bostrom’s “Transhumanist Values”). Let’s call this the Problem of Good Extinction.iv\n\nAn exactly opposite issue arises for Definition #1. Consider this possible future: let’s say we successfully upload a conscious mind to a supercomputer. Because this mind supervenes upon a silicon (or carbon nanotube) substrate, it’s able to think orders of magnitude faster than we can. In addition, given the multiple realizability of cognitive systems, let’s say this mind clones itself to produce a large population of artificial intelligences (identical pasts, but unique futures). This new society of simulated brains, operating on a faster timescale than humanity, quickly takes over the task of creating a superintelligence, and through the positive feedback process of recursive self-improvement they rapidly become far more clever than us.\n\nSuddenly, then, humanity is confronted by superbeings that tower over us to the extent that we tower over the guinea pig, cognitively speaking. Here’s the catch, though: the first emulated brain – the one from which all the others were spawned – came from a religious extremist. Consequently, the entire population of superbeings inherited its radical beliefs about the way the world is and ought to be. This may seem implausible, but it’s perfectly consistent with Bostrom’s “orthogonality thesis,” according to which end goals and intelligence are not tightly coupled. In other words, a superintelligence could be combined with just about any set of aims and motivations, however strange, irrational, and dangerous they may appear to us.\n\nBecause of their religious extremism, then, these superbeings – which qualify as posthumans on Bostrom’s definitionv – quickly destroy humanity. Furthermore, because of their cleverness, they go on to realize all the marvels of technology, foment unprecedented economic growth, colonize the cosmos, and generally live happily ever after. (This gestures at some scenarios that I discuss in a recent IEET article, in which human annihilation by future AIs may actually be morally recommendable.)\n\nThe point is that we have a situation here in which Earth-originating intelligent life is neither annihilated, nor is its potential curtailed in a permanent and drastic way.vi It follows that no existential risk has occurred, even though our species – indeed, our entire lineage – has been violently destroyed. Bostrom himself counts this as an existential risk, and goes into great detail in his excellent book Superintelligence about how we can prevent our cognitive children from engaging in an act of parricide. Let’s call this the Problem of Bad Extinction.vii\n\nIt’s worth noting here that the appearance of “human extinction” in the top right box of Figure A is a bit misleading. While human extinction could constitute an existential catastrophe, this will only be the case if we are the only instance of “Earth-originating intelligent life.” This term is broader than us, though: it could include both Gedanken experimentus, as well as the technoprogressive (but malicious) posthumans mentioned above. Thus, subsequent depictions of this typology should make clear that the top right box includes but is not limited to human extinction scenarios.\n\n***\n\nFinally, there is a nontrivial problem with Bostrom’s typology of risks itself. Take a close look at the y-axis of Figure A. Bostrom divides the scope of an event’s consequences into personal, local, global, and transgenerational categories. These are presented as alternative possibilities, but not all of them are: the first three concern geography, so to speak, whereas the fourth concerns history. And different geographies can be mixed with different kinds of histories.\n\n​We can put it like this: just as a risk is defined as the probability of an event times its consequences, and the consequences of an event can be analyzed into scope and intensity, so too can the scope of an event’s consequences be analyzed into spatial and temporal components. Thus, we can ask: “For a given time slice, how many people has this event affected?” and “Over a given time segment, how many people has this event affected?” These are completely distinct questions, since the first concerns the spatial scope of a consequence, whereas the second concerns its temporal scope.\n\nFor example, a germline mutation could, if survivable, be classified as a personal-endurable risk. But because it affects the germ cells, it is transgenerational in (temporal) scope: in a given time slice it might affect only one person, but peering across time it could affect many people (namely that individual’s descendants). By contrast, a somatic mutation that results in cancer, if survivable, would be a personal-endurable risk that’s generational in scope, since it wouldn’t affect “all generations that could come to exist in the future” (within the relevant spatial scope). Moving up a level, the bombing of Hiroshima could be classified as a local-endurable event, since it caused significant harm but didn’t destroy the quality of life completely (to borrow Bostrom’s definition of “endurable”viii). And its effects have clearly been transgenerational – something dealt with by multiple generations. In contrast, Superstorm Sandy was a local-endurable event in New York City that was merely generational in (temporal) scope.\n\nOnce we get to the spatial category of “global,” the difference between generational and transgenerational is the difference between individuals in the population and the population itself. (Where a species is the largest population possible of a biological kind.) This makes sense of the phenomenon of aging, which prompted Bostrom to expand his typology between his 2002 and 2008 publications. On the present account, aging is unproblematic: it constitutes a global-terminal risk whose temporal scope is generational. That is to say, every individual is affected by death, but the population itself isn’t. A runaway greenhouse effect or grey-goo disaster, in contrast, would count as a global-terminal risk whose temporal scope is transgenerational: it affects everyone everywhere forever.\n\nAn existential risk can thus be redefined more precisely as any catastrophe that’s spatially global, temporally transgenerational, and terminal in intensity. This fixes the typology, but how does it deal with the two counterexamples above? To address these problems, we need to be specific about the particular population of beings affected by the existential event, since both problems derive from how “everyone everywhere” is construed. (In Definition #1 it’s too broad; in Definition #2 it’s too narrow.)\n\nPerhaps a solution is to specify the relevant group as either our current population or any future population that we care about.ix By defining the group affected in terms of what we value, the problems of good and bad extinction can be effectively solved: insofar as Gedanken experimentus is a desirable species to become, this scenario doesn’t count as an existential risk; and insofar as we don’t want our lineage to be destroyed by a race of superintelligent posthumans (however superior their moral status or aligned with transhumanist values of infinite progress), this scenario does constitute such a risk. Let’s call this Definition #3.\n\nThis offers a modified account both of what an existential risk’s consequences are, and of what the relevant group affected by these consequences is. I don’t put it forward only as a tentative idea – a point of departure for further discussion. I have argued that there are a number of problems with the two primary definitions currently being used in the literature – problems that, to my knowledge, no one hast yet pointed out. Perhaps Definition #3 is a small step in the right direction.\n\n(For more on this and a number of related issues, see my forthcoming book The End: What Religion and Science Tell Us About the Apocalypse.)\n\ni One finds this in other papers of his as well, as in the abstract of Bostrom’s “Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority.\n\nii Here I’ll use the non-anthropology sense of Homo sapiens specifically, rather than our entire genus.\n\niii See Bostrom’s “Transhumanist Values.” Search for “technological progress.”\n\niv Notice that Definition #1 handles this scenario perfectly well. It doesn’t count it as an existential risk, which seems right.\n\nv See “Why I Want to be a Posthuman When I Grow Up.”\n\nvi Accepting, say, transhumanism’s definition of “potential.”\n\nvii Notice that Definition #2 handles this scenario perfectly well. It counts it as an existential risk, which seems right. Also notice that if bad extinction weren’t a problem, the project of Friendly AI would be pointless.\n\nviii We could, alternatively, simply say that the risk was endured by the locality, which is, after all, the relevant (spatial) scope.",

Captured youkai can level up just like any other captured mob, but we'll expand upon that in the future, to where eventually you can equip your captives, converse with them, give them commands, distribute stat points when they gain in level, and if you really wanted to, develop a bond with them that might result in... well, science does odd things, and we'll just leave it at that, shall we~? The future for these uncivilized beings is going to be rough, but at least they'll be able to wear clothes soon. These mobs will not feature parts of canon characters - they're just mooks, and they contain the valuable drops mentioned above. There are loads of plans in store for these mobs, so watch for them in updates~!\n\nThe new mobs CAN be captured.

This... er... questionably-dressed fellow happens to belong to the \"Youkai\" pool. There are plans for several other pools, such as Yousei, Yurei, Bakemono, Tsukumogami, and a variety of others, each with their own pool of parts to pull from. There will be massive amounts of variety amongst these new pools, because they will have two to three times as many part categories to select from when building the mob. This first one is more or less the \"template\", and still needs a few tweaks here and there before we start mass-producing parts. We've borrowed assets from the Ningen Race Mod, which I highly recommend using alongside TouhouBound.\n\nI'm not sure how you'll feel about being chased by men with prim hair while wearing speedos, but while it currently doesn't look like much, this is the culmination of much hell in creating the first of several entirely new sets of randomly-generated mobs.

I hope that I can build this up into something lovely, but this really will be done in baby steps. I have been joined by Alnitak, whom has been collaborating with me to help code this mode and bring you a quality mod. We have a few contributing pixel artists, including Deliphin, Reiji Gazpacho, and Justice Wolf.\n\nNew Mob Drops!\n\nYou can start collecting familiar objects from slaying the new mobs! The drop rate needs to be fine-tuned still, but start collecting them now, while they're easy to get and you won't regret it later~! Yes, that means I'm telling you to abuse things while they're Easy Modo. These new drops will be used in crafting recipes, trading, quests, and probably a variety of other things in later updates, so make sure you keep well-stocked~\n\nA new crafting station!\n\nIt'll take a bit of effort, but soon you can create your Cosplay Corner, which will be your main hub for the first section of this mod's content - character cosplay items to wear while you traverse the stars! Most of what you'll need can be found on your starting world, but it's possible that you may have to find yourself a Human Penal Colony before you can find any of those archaic devices called \"light bulbs\" for your sewing lamp.\n\nTo build your Cosplay Corner:\n\nSome new crafting materials and recipes!\n\nMost of these will be important to the mod itself, but in some cases you'll find that they can be important for other things, too. For example, there is now a method to compress your fabric stocks into proper bolts of fabric, and then un-craft those bolts back down into the regular fabric items if you need them again. The mod will mostly use the bolts, though!\n\nThe first cosplays of many soon to come!\n\nYou can now don the garb of Gensokyo's two main protagonists, LARPing your way through the stars and taking care of incidents wherever they may arise! There will eventually be hundreds of other outfits to choose from and create on your Cosplay Corner, but they're all just \"cosplay versions\". I wonder how you'd get better ones...?\n\nYes, Reimubird made me giggle too.\n\nPlanned Features~!\n\nCosplays of ALL the Touhou cast - even some fanmade ones!\n\nThere will be vanity equips of all the faces you have seen and heard of - and many whom you haven't! If you want to dress as Youmu the Gardener, or Marisa the Ordinary Witch, you can do that~! Or maybe you want to dress as Youki in his wandering habits, or perhaps Old Man Unshou's plain kimono has your eye. Want to wear the garb of lesser-known characters, like Noroiko, Rengeteki, or Rin Satsuki? We'll have them at your disposal~! There will even be some lucky Touhou OCs who will get their garb featured~! It'll take us a while to get them all prepared, but we'll get caught up someday!\n\nA weird thing called a \"Mysterious Sukima\"!\n\nI could tell you what this is, but then it wouldn't be mysterious! I'll just tell you that it might not be advisable for you to throw things into it. Bad things might happen. But bad things sometimes lead to good things... or so I'm told.\n\nA collection of functional items and weapons!\n\nHas the thought of using a good 'ol Spark to make a flat spot for your base ever crossed your mind? Or maybe you wanted to shrink to half your size and get into those smaller spots for hard to reach ores and gems? Yes? Well start building up your power of love and get ready to be able to do exactly that! The Mini-Hakkero and the Miracle Mallet won't be the only things at your disposal at some point in TouhouBound, so look forward to what we have in store~!\n\nDungeons and structures to explore!\n\nStarbound will surely have a wider variety of things like this of their own in later updates, but wouldn't you like to find yourself wandering the streets of Abandoned Hell, or traipsing through Eientei? You never know what sorts of goodies you might come out the other side with, and many of them will be unique things added by this mod~!\n\nNPCs and beefed-up NPC interactions!\n\nThis won't be limited to just the NPCs introduced by TouhouBound. Vanilla NPC interactions are lackluster at the moment, and it wouldn't be fair if we overshadowed them with NPCs from our mod, so we'll be giving the same treatment to vanilla NPCs as well! Shop interfaces will be getting an overhaul once we find the right artist for the job - you'll actually get some nice face-time with the shopkeeper who's wares you're browsing, and the shop GUI will be themed around the race of the shop owner. I'm toying around with some ideas for developing relationships with NPCs, but I haven't settled on anything concrete yet. Keep an eye and an ear open for info on this~\n\nNew races!\n\nThis one's pretty straightforward, and I'm sure you can guess what this means. You'll get to play as all kinds of strange Gensokyo residents, and while they sometimes won't look very much different from the standard human race, they will all have special status adjustments, racial bonuses and detriments, and unique abilities~! For example, if you want to play as a yurei, you'll start off with a low-level version of a tech that allows you to drift through walls and blocks at the cost of energy.\n\nMore quests, codex entries, and wait for it.... storylines with immersive plot!\n\nThis is one I'm really excited for since I enjoy writing and will be very happy to tell a tale using this mod while giving the players a venue to play a role in that tale~! I also feel that the quest system is currently lacking, and could be fleshed out quite a lot with questlines that lead you down tech trees for the other races, so I'm going to see what I can do about that. In addition to the new quests and story, we're planning...\n\nCinematics, cutscenes, and mini-games!\n\nThese things will definitely be a long time coming, but when they arrive, hopefully they will be glorious! At key points in the game, such as when you advance a tier, you will be rewarded for your hard work with some story featuring moving pictures and text - and depending on how things roll, possibly some voice acting~!\n\nThere's thinking with portals going on!\n\nThis is an idea we're still just mulling over, but if it goes according to plan, we'll be abusing this primarily for story purposes. Try not to confuse a \"portal\" with a \"teleporter\" - the portals won't be usable for taking you to and from your favourite planets, though there's plans for that technology as well, stemming from reverse-engineering of the portals. These portals will actually take you to alternate planes of reality, which contain very special NPCs, dialogue, story, quests, and rewards!\n\n...and much more~!\n\nI'd be here all day listing all the stuff we can put in between these major things, but I think you have a clear enough idea of where this mod will be headed and hopefully that means you will enjoy making use of this mod and everything it has to offer~!\n\nInstall Method:\n\nBack up StarBound's [assets] folder and your [player] folder.\n\nUnzip the TouhouBound 3.0 file.\n\nMove the TouhouBound folder into your mods folder.\n\nLaunch Starbound, and commence hunting for mobs!\n\n(Keep backups in case you come across a bug, error, or incompatibility. Please mention any instances of a mod being incompatible with this mod, and I will see if I can't include some compatibility !)\n\n(There may be edits to the install method as new versions are released.)\n\n(Make sure that the mod isn't in a folder of itself! Your folder structure should look like \".../Starbound/mods/TouhouBound/items/...\", NOT \".../Starbound/mods/TouhouBound/TouhouBound/items/...\")\n\n(At the moment, I don't see any reason that you will lose collected drop items between updates, so please utilize this time to start collecting the new drops!! The items in other portions of the mod won't exactly be easy to obtain, so it's a good idea to start collecting the materials now~! Don't quote me on this though, so I strongly apologize if you lose your accumulated drop items in between mod updates!! Something that may help prevent the loss of your accumulated drops is to remember to keep them stored on your ship, and then back up your *.shipworld file prior to installing updates to this mod.)\n\nKnown Issues:\n\nThere is an issue with head equips that cause anything below the shoulders to be shown in front of the torso, but behind the foremost arm. There is an individual working on a Wig Mod that is having the same issue, so for now we'll borrow their idea of suggesting it be viewed as hair draped over the shoulder. Sorry if it's an inconvenience, but we will try to rectify this as soon as a solution becomes known!\n\nWe have uncovered a mod incompatibility that causes our recipes to disappear.

  "latent_25938": "The number of states from which Star Libraries hail has averaged 40 for the five LJI editions and remained the same in 2012 as in 2011, at 39 (see 2012 Stars in first map below, and the five-edition average in the second map below). Still, the list of specific states enjoying this distinction changes slightly each year. In this LJI edition, Louisiana and Nevada rejoined the group of Star Library states, eliminating Idaho and Florida from the tally. Throughout the five editions, the performance of two powerhouse states—New York and Ohio—has been constant and impressive. It is no overstatement to say that these two have dominated the ratings, with New York averaging nearly 36 Star Libraries per edition and Ohio, 34. Kansas is the next highest state with a per edition Star Library average of 18.\n\nTo date, no library from Delaware, Hawaii, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota, or Tennessee has received LJI Star awards. As we have noted in the past, certain factors contribute to an uneven distribution of Star Libraries among the states. Since the LJ Index groups are based on operating expenditures, states having fewer libraries, fewer and smaller metropolitan areas, and more rural communities tend to suffer a competitive disadvantage. Also, in most cases only libraries with exceptionally high per capita values make the cut into the top tiers of each expenditure category. These libraries may enjoy funding and demographic advantages, deliver services to recipients beyond their official population counts, or report higher per capita data due to decreasing populations. Statistically speaking, it is natural that these and related library characteristics would not automatically be distributed evenly across states and geographic regions.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nDec. 30, 2016, 10:13 AM GMT / Updated Dec. 30, 2016, 1:04 PM GMT By Bill Neely\n\nPart 5 in a Series\n\nDonald Trump was elected to president on a platform of politics not as usual, so it is fitting he inherits a world in flux. Post-World War II rules are dying, old alliances shifting and traditional roles shed. While Trump is a giant question mark on the world stage, NBC News’ Chief Global Correspondent Bill Neely looks at major international challenges the president-elect faces upon inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\nIraqi army soldiers celebrate as they hold an ISIS flag they captured during a military operation to regain control of a village outside Mosul on Nov. 29. Hadi Mizban / AP\n\nLONDON — Donald Trump could not have been clearer on the campaign trail: He will crush ISIS, and President Barack Obama’s war against the extremists is \"a disaster.\"\n\nBut it’s also clear the next president will have to face some hard facts about the world’s deadliest terror group.\n\nThe defeat of ISIS in Mosul, Iraq, by U.S.-backed forces will not spell the end of ISIS and destroy it throughout the Middle East.\n\nIt cannot stop followers in the U.S. and the rest of the West from trying to commit mass murder.\n\nIt also will not stop its fighters returning to the U.S. or Europe from carrying out atrocities.\n\nDefeating ISIS in Mosul and its Syrian stronghold of Raqqa certainly does not deal with what gave rise to the militant group in the first place — anger among millions of the world's Sunni Muslims.\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has warned extremists like ISIS may have an incentive to provoke a new president to a reaction that undermines America’s global position.\n\n\"They may make the assessment that Trump will react to a terror attack in a way that suits their purposes,\" he told The Atlantic magazine.\n\nSo the president-elect has a problem and ISIS is already planning.\n\nDiscontent and Resentment\n\nThe group has announced what it will do in the event that it loses Mosul where it is battling a U.S.-backed coalition — temporarily retreat into the desert. This is what its predecessor al Qaeda did after it was driven out of Iraqi cities during the U.S. surge in 2007.\n\nThe new president might be tempted to think ISIS has disappeared. But retreat is not defeat.\n\nIt was perhaps easier Obama to wage war on a group holding land, its so-called \"caliphate\" in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIt is harder to wage war on \"terror\" and on a death cult’s ideology that can inspire violence in New York City and New Delhi.\n\nThe most immediate challenge for Trump is the danger of blowback — the threat of a revenge ISIS strike on the U.S. As the phrase goes, \"if you take a bat to a beehive, prepare to be stung by the bees you don’t kill.\"\n\nThe medium-term challenge is to lance the boil of Sunni discontent and resentment so Muslims are never again attracted to beheading, mass slaughter and suicide bombings as a way of solving political issues.\n\nAnd in Iraq especially, the problems that created Sunni extremism have not gone away. ISIS sprung from the rage of Sunnis at the sectarian bias of Iraq’s Shiite-dominated government.\n\nSunnis may once again rise up against misrule from Baghdad, unless Trump helps forge a new order in Iraq. And the same is true of Syria, where the Arab Spring began with a Sunni revolt against the Alawite clan that surrounds the family of President Bashar al-Assad. Many, including the French Prime Minister Manual Vals, are convinced this struggle against militant Islamist extremists will last a generation.\n\nThe global challenge extends well beyond the Middle East, where ISIS has inspired loyalty from deadly terror groups like Boko Haram in West Africa and Abu Sayyaf in East Asia.\n\nIt has trained thousands of militants from the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia who may return home and bide their time until the moment they can wreak revenge for their dead caliphate. In short, the jihadi dream of a Muslim empire will most likely live on after ISIS disappears.\n\nWhile Trump and many policy makers have focused on ISIS, another old threat has not gone away: al Qaeda.\n\nThe group's leaders are still committed to attacking the West. AQAP (al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) remains a deadly threat. Al Qaeda's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, says the priority is still to strike America “until it bleeds, militarily and financially.”\n\nSo 15 years after al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Zawahiri continues to evade the Navy Seals who hunted down and killed his boss Osama bin Laden.\n\nAnd in the Middle East, its offshoot Jabhat Fatah al-Sham is still a player in the Syrian war.\n\nFinancial Support\n\nBeyond the immediate challenge of ISIS and al Qaeda, Donald Trump faces the diplomatic and policy dilemma of what to do about extremist groups' supporters in U.S. allies in the Gulf such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\n\nSunni Saudi Arabia and Shiite rival Iran have been at the heart of this problem by fueling proxy struggles that inflame sectarian struggles throughout the region. These conflicts only feed extremists like ISIS and al Qaeda.\n\nAmerica's ability to pull levers in Saudi Arabia, which has criminalized financial support for extremist groups while continuing to export a profoundly conservative version of Islam, has diminished as has its relationship with the kingdom.\n\nIts reliance on the Saudis for oil is shrinking by the month as shale production rises in the U.S. In 2015, the nuclear deal with Shiite Iran enraged Sunni Saudi Arabia, which was already angered by Obama's unwillingness to back the Syrian opposition and what they saw as Bush's disastrous invasion of Iraq.\n\nRelated: Young Prince Shakes Up Ultra-Conservative Saudi Arabia\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds U.S. soldiers are taking the fight to ISIS.\n\nWhen Trump takes office, there will officially be around 500 Special Operations personnel in Syria. Their job is described as \"support\" and \"training.\"\n\nAmerica’s Kurdish allies claim U.S. Special Forces are already on the front lines. But a few hundred U.S. boots on the ground alone won’t defeat the extremists.\n\nThe old order in the Middle East is collapsing as surely as the old borders of Iraq and Syria are disappearing. The new president needs to decide how much of America’s capital he is willing to invest in forging a new regional balance of power.\n\nWinning the peace in Iraq and Syria depends on a political settlement involving Russia and Iran and in the new American administration helping Sunnis believe in a future, in a government, that involves them.\n\nOtherwise the sons of ISIS will rise from the rubble of Mosul and plague this new president — and many more.\n\nEarlier in This Series\n\nPart 1: China Is Both Threat and Opportunity for Trump\n\nPart 2: Kim Jong Un's Nuclear Ambitions to Challenge Trump\n\nPart 3: Nobody Will Test Trump Administration More Than Putin\n\nPart 4: Can Trump Stop Syria War From Haunting U.S.?",

  "latent_26282": "They taught me that the more you love people, the more love you have to give.\n\nMy parents (to my knowledge at least) are about as monogamous as you can get. They met on the playground—11 years old, my mom turned to her friend and said “I’m going to marry him.” She did. And to this day my parents are best friends, lovers, companions, co-parents, who are socially, economically, spiritually, and politically tethered to each other.\n\nThough they’re left-leaning, and accepting of their anarchist, queer daughter—who’s thrown a lot of shit in their direction in the last 30 years—there’s still one place that we just can’t seem to come to an understanding about: my choice to be in polyamorous relationship structures.\n\nThey are kind enough to mostly stay silent about it. And I offer them more ease around this—I introduce them to one date, and not any of my other dates. They know I have them, but I don’t try to integrate it into my family life. It’s a compromise I feel comfortable with at least for now, and if that ever needs to change, I feel confident in our ability to navigate it.\n\nIn the conversations we’ve had about polyamory, what I take away from my parents is that their relationship has been a source of nourishment, protection, and is a loving container—and they want me to have those things—and can’t imagine a different structure doing that. Which, while I don’t agree with, I can understand—lived experience is powerful and not something to negate.\n\nRegardless of how you measure the success of a relationship, my mom and dad are winning at life. They are best friends, there is no one they would rather spend time with (well, with the exception of their grandchild maybe), they love each other, are attracted to each other, they have been married for 35 years, and in moments of struggle, crisis, joy, and celebration they always find each other.\n\nOften, when I hear people talk about couples who are in non-monogamous or polyamorous relationships I hear language like “Oh, couple X is really good at poly.” I’m not sure I know what “good at poly” means. But often, people tell me that I am “good at poly.” I’m always curious about this. I fight. I’m jealous. I ask unreasonable things of my dates. I’m insecure, and when my relationships shift or grow, there is a time of adjustment that often includes tears, tantrums, and lots and lots of processing. Through these moments my dates and I find each other.\n\nWhen I think about the two practices that I fall back on most often in my polyamorous relationships, all the credit goes to my monogamous superstar mom and dad:\n\nThe first practice: love multiplies love.\n\nGoing to sleep as a small child, when mom and dad would say to me “love you,” I’d respond with “love you more.” They would always reply “not possible” while kissing me on the head.\n\nOne night, I asked why it wasn’t possible. They told me that it was because with age comes more life experience—they had been able to love more people than I had in my six years. They said the more you love people, the more love you have to give. It was a simple love ritual between us every night. But it left a deep imprint in how I approach and view the world. I truly believe and trust that love multiples love.\n\nSo when my partners and sweeties and dates find new loves or deepen current loves, with all the hard feelings of insecurity, fear, and jealousy lives a backbone of trust—that this love in their life is creating a greater capacity for more love.\n\nIt’s easy for me to access this trust because of the simple love ritual my parents shared with me nightly, but as an adult I’ve also built trust in this practice—because when I fall in love, I walk through the world with my chest open. With more love in my heart for everyone in my life, I’m more generous, kind, and confident. And I fall even more in love with all my dates and partner—we find each other with hearts open, bursting in love.\n\nThe second practice: different kids, different rules.\n\nMy youngest sister and I couldn’t have been more different as kids. She was all earth and fire—physically focused with a bright fiery passion that filled every space she entered. Loud, crackling, and strong she knew how to play in a way I don’t think I ever have. My watery-air self would quietly sit at the grown up table listening. School classrooms were much more comfortable than the fields and playground.\n\nWhile we were not a rule-heavy house, I do remember that regularly when one of us would complain that it wasn’t fair that one of us was getting something the other one wasn’t, my parents would respond “different kids, different rules.” The meaning behind this was much greater than the four words and simple saying. They saw us. They knew we were different, and would need different boundaries, different support because of who we each were, what our struggles were, what our passions and interests and strengths were. Their expectation on our grades, friends and activities were different and tailored to each of us.\n\nI carry this with me. What I need to feel cared for and safe, to stretch and to grow, is usually pretty different than what my date needs (that whole, different people, different experiences thing). Instead of creating a set of rules that we both follow, I work with my sweeties to learn what care and love and safety feels like for them and together we come up with ways to have those things met. We find each other.\n\nSometimes that means that I disclose way more information to them about my other dates than I would ever want about theirs. Instead of us having to both disclose the same information about our dates to each other, we disclose what the other needs (with the consent of the other dates, of course). This has been particularly useful when jealousy is present for me. I often hear my kid voice in my head when I feel jealous saying things like “but that’s not fair!” I return to the lesson from my mom and dad, that fair isn’t the same, even when it comes to rules and expectations.\n\nI’m not sure I’m “good” at poly, but I am sure that many of the practices I fall back on are rooted in the love and security I was privileged enough to have in my family as a child. Because of this, I’ve been lucky that my loves (romantic and family) and I always find each other.\n\nLeah Henderson is a community activist living in Toronto, Canada.

  "latent_26290": "If you've been running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 on your computer, you're probably familiar with the \"Get Windows 10\" (GWX) app, which is constantly trying — sometimes aggressively — to lure you to upgrade to Windows 10. While this marketing campaign initially only included non-business computers, Microsoft has already announced its plans to continue expanding the operating system using the GWX app to small businesses and organizations.\n\nAlong with the new announcement, the software giant is finally offering officially documented instructions for IT administrators to stop qualifying computers running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 from installing Windows 10 and getting rid of the unpleasant notifications.\n\nMicrosoft is aiming the instructions for business computers joined to a domain network running Windows 7 Pro and Windows 8.1 Pro, but the steps will also work for devices that aren't joined to a domain, including the home versions of the operating system.\n\nPreviously, we described the steps to stop the \"Get Windows 10\" nags and prevent your computer from installing Windows 10 using the GWX Control Panel tool. But if installing a third-party software isn't your approach, and you are comfortable modifying the Windows Registry and Group Policy settings, you will want to use the following guide:\n\nDisabling the GWX app and stop the Windows 10 upgrade\n\nWarning: Before jumping into this guide, it's important to note that modifying the Windows Registry can be a dangerous game that can cause irreversible damage to your system if you don't do it correctly. It's highly recommended to make a full backup of your system before proceeding.\n\nYou have been warned!\n\nIf you're running Windows 7 Pro or Windows 8.1 Pro, you can stop the upgrade offer to Windows 10 and disable the \"Get Windows 10\" app following the steps below:\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo block the upgrade to Windows 10 through Windows Update, you'll need to have installed update KB3065987 in Windows 7 or KB3065988 in Windows 8.1 to make available the new Group Policy Object to perform the task.\n\nYou can download the updates using the links below:\n\nOnce you've downloaded the update for your current version of Windows, double-click the package to begin the installation, on the dialog box prompt click Yes to complete the install, and restart your computer.\n\nBlocking the Windows 10 upgrade offer using Group Policy\n\nAfter installing the required update follow these steps:\n\nUse the Windows Key + R keyboard shortcut to open the Run command, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter to open the Local Group Policy Editor. Browse the path Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update. In Windows Update, find and double-click the Turn off the upgrade to the latest version of Windows through Windows Update option. Click Enable, then Apply and finally click OK.\n\nBlocking the Windows 10 upgrade offer using the Registry Editor\n\nIf you're running a home version of the operating system, the Local Group Policy Editor won't be available to you, in which case you need to stop the Windows 10 upgrade using the registry.\n\nUse the Windows Key + R keyboard shortcut to open the Run command, type regedit, and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.\n\nCarefully browse the following path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate. On the right side, right-click, select New, create a new DWORD key and name it DisableOSUpgrade.\n\nDouble-click the DisableOSUpgrade key and change the value from 0 to 1.\n\nQuick Tip: If you don't see the WindowsUpdate key when browsing the path, right-click the Windows key, select New, then Key, and name the new key WindowsUpdate.\n\nDisabling the \"Get Windows 10\" nags\n\nThere is no Group Policy setting to disable the \"Get Windows 10\" app. As such, you will need to modify the Windows Registry in both the professional and home version of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.\n\nUse the Windows Key + R keyboard shortcut to open the Run command, type regedit, and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.\n\nCarefully browse the following path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Gwx. On the right side, right-click, select New, create a new DWORD key and name it DisableGwx.\n\nDouble-click the DisableGwx key and change the value from 0 to 1.\n\nQuick Tip: If you don't see the Gwx key when browsing the path, right-click the Windows key, select New, then Key, and name the new key Gwx.\n\nOnce you have completed these instructions, the last thing left to do is to restart your computer. After a reboot, you should no longer see the GWX app in the notification area, and Windows 10 will no longer try to install on your computer.\n\nRemember that through this process, you no longer have to remove the update KB3035583 that is known to prepare your computer for Windows 10. Microsoft says that your system will remain excluded until the changes are removed, which you can do with the steps shown below.\n\nReverting changes to get the Windows 10 upgrade\n\nIf later on you change your mind and feel that you're ready for Windows 10, you can undo the changes to re-enable the Windows 10 offer through Windows Update and the \"Get Windows 10\" app.\n\nOn Windows 7 Pro and Windows 8.1 Pro use the following steps to re-enable the upgrade offer:\n\nUse the Windows Key + R keyboard shortcut to open the Run command, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter to open the Local Group Policy Editor.\n\nBrowse the path Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update. Find and double-click the Turn off the upgrade to the latest version of Windows through Windows Update option.\n\nSelect the Not Configured option, click Apply and then click OK. This actions should also delete the WindowsUpdate and DisableOSUpgrade keys from the Registry.\n\nIf you're in Windows 7 Home or Windows 8.1 Home, you will have to manually and carefully delete the changes in the Registry.\n\nUse the Windows Key + R keyboard shortcut to open the Run command, type regedit, and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.\n\nCarefully browse the following path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows. Right-click the WindowsUpdate key, select Delete, and click Yes to confirm the deletion.\n\nFor all editions of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, you will need to re-enable the \"Get Windows 10\" app by deleting the keys you have previously created.\n\nWhile in the Windows Registry carefully browse the following path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows. Right-click the GWX key, select Delete, and click Yes to confirm the deletion.\n\nFinally, restart your computer to complete the process. Once done, your computer should be able to receive the free Windows 10 upgrade.\n\nIt's important to point out that Microsoft is only making available Windows 10 as a free upgrade within the first year of its official release. This limitation means that you only have until July 29, 2016, to upgrade your qualifying Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 with Update computer to Windows 10.\n\nMore resources\n\nFor more tips and tricks on Windows 10, and get the latest news, you can visit the following resources:\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links.

Descendants from each of these branches have made significant contributions to their fields, to their communities, to India, and to the global economy; they have been industrialists, government leaders, medical doctors, and scholars.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nLovji Nusserwanjee Wadia advanced the Wadia shipbuilding dynasty in 1736, when he obtained a contract from the British East India Company for building docks and ships in Bombay (present-day Mumbai). Although the Wadias would eventually come to be considered a Bombay family, many of them remained in Surat, where one branch of the family established a ship breaking yard (where ships are dismantled) that remains one of the largest of its kind in the world.[3]\n\nThe poem whose words would become the lyrics of The Star-Spangled Banner, the national anthem of the United States, were written in 1812 on board a Wadia-built British Royal Navy ship, HMS Minden by Francis Scott Key.[4]\n\nBy the 1840s, the family was one of the leading forces in the Indian shipbuilding industry. At that time they had built over a hundred warships for Britain, and had trading networks around the world.\n\nThe prominent women of the Wadia family, including Motlibai Maneckji Wadia, Jerbai Nusserwanji Wadia, and Lady Hirabai Cowasji Jehangir, were known for their philanthropy in providing financial support to Zoroastrian temples, establishing schools and hospitals, and supporting the arts in the 1800s.[5] More recently, Neville Wadia continued the philanthropic tradition of his family by continuing to establish hospitals and schools.[6]\n\nThe Wadia family has endowed Nowrosjee Wadia College in Pune. Lovji Nusserwanjee Wadia's great grandsons, JBH Wadia and Homi Wadia founded Wadia Movietone in 1933, which had its studios at Lovji Castle (Lovejee Castle) in Chembur, Mumbai, India. The company has a ship as its logo, honoring their family legacy.[7]\n\nThe family is related to Pakistan's politically prominent Jinnah family, through Neville Wadia, who was married to Dina Jinnah from 1938 to 1943, and had two children together, Diana and Nusli Wadia. Dina was the daughter of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Rattanbai Petit, the former is the founder of Pakistan, while the later was the daughter of Sylla Tata and Dinshaw Maneckji Petit.[8][9][2] Though Dina took divorce from Neville in 1943, she remained a prominent member of the Wadia family.[10][11] Pakistan\n\nNotable members [ edit ]",
  "latent_26386": "OTTAWA — Canada’s prisons are so jam-packed with inmates that many are forced to “double-bunk” in shared cells — even though corrections officials recognize this breeds violence and poses a risk to offenders and staff at the facilities.\n\nMoreover, although recent construction will resolve the over-crowding in the “short-term,” Correctional Service Canada (CSC) has failed to develop expansion plans for its penitentiaries to properly take into account the growing number of inmates, according to a report released Tuesday by Auditor General Michael Ferguson.\n\nDouble-bunking is, according to government policy, supposed to be a temporary measure. But it has grown and appears to have become a permanent fixture of the system.\n\nFerguson reported that the CSC policy states double bunking should only occur in approved areas and not exceed 20% of a prison’s population.\n\n“We found that 26% of offenders were being double bunked in the Ontario and Prairie regions in the 2012–13 fiscal year. That same year, we also found that double bunking was occurring in segregation cells and in cells smaller than 5 square meters, which is contrary to the intent of CSC policy. Even after the construction is completed, CSC officials expect double bunking to continue.”\n\nThis is occurring, Ferguson found, even though Correctional Services determined in 2009 that it wanted to “minimize” overcrowding in higher security jails.\n\n“At that time, CSC identified serious implications with double bunking, including increased levels of tension, aggression, and violence. It also identified increased safety and security concerns for staff and offenders, especially at maximum and medium security penitentiaries.”\n\nFerguson’s audit also found that as CSC expanded prisons in recent years, it failed to properly add sufficient segregation cells to isolate some offenders, and add health-care facilities for inmates at the jails.\n\nThe prisons are particularly overcrowded in Ontario and the prairie provinces, while jails in British Columbia and the Atlantic provinces have available space.\n\nThat has led to a costly consequence: prisoners are being transferred between facilities. In 2010–11, it cost $1.5 million to move 529 inmates. During the first nine months of 2013, costs had risen to $3.4 million to transfer 908 offenders.\n\n“CSC officials expect that the long-distance relocation of offenders, and the associated costs, will continue after the expansion of facilities is completed,” reported Ferguson.\n\nAnd although the government boasted its closure of three facilities — the Kingston Penitentiary, a regional treatment centre in Ontario, and the Leclerc Institution in Quebec — would save $120 million annually, the actual savings have been $86 million a year.\n\nIn recent years, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government introduced a law-and-order agenda that was expected to increase the inmate population.\n\nIn 2012–13, Correctional Services spent about $2 billion on prisons and inmate rehabilitation. This figure has grown by 17% in the past five years, driven in part by a rising offender population. In March 2013, there were 15,224 prisoners in 57 federal penitentiaries across Canada.\n\nIn recent years, Correctional Services has been on a construction spree — adding more than 2,700 cells to 37 facilities. When completed in 2015, prison officials expect that “these cells will alleviate much of the overcrowding experienced at the time of our audit,” reported Ferguson.\n\n“We concluded that CSC did not plan the expansions to its penitentiaries in a manner that took into account its accommodation needs in the long term.”\n\nAuditor general: Report at a glanceBy Christina Spencer Here are some findings of the Spring 2014 auditor general’s report: In the last three years, the federal government’s major pension funds had deficits of $6.5 billion, requiring special payments to cover the gap. No one appears responsible for carrying out a regular or systematic study of whether these government pension plans are sustainable over the long run. “Factors such as prolonged low interest rates, lower than expected returns on assets, and increasing longevity could have a significant impact on pension liabilities and on the financial position of the government,” the auditor general’s report warned. Correctional Service Canada, which runs federal penitentiaries, was on schedule to build 2,120 new cells by the end of the 2013-14 fiscal year with more promised in the current fiscal year, meeting the immediate needs of housing inmates. But Corrections “will again be at or over capacity within a few years of completing construction.” What the auditor general termed “capacity pressures” are highest in women’s institutions. The Canada Revenue Agency has some significant gaps in how it detects and fights so-called “aggressive” tax planning, including on high-risk business files, training of its auditors and monitoring of its programs. The First Nations Policing Program, originally created to address concerns about policing in aboriginal communities, “is not working as intended, and many issues persist,” according to the auditors. In Alberta and Manitoba, funding agreements for the program that were studied by the auditor general complied with provincial legislation and standards. Two agreements studies in Ontario, however, carried no clear requirement to comply with provincial standards. The federal government has been handing out millions in bonus payments to private companies that manage the buildings housing bureaucrats, often with little explanation for doling out the extra cash. Auditor General Michael Ferguson’s report looked back at almost 10 years of outsourcing contracts worth almost $6 billion, just as the government readies to sign new deals that could be worth $12 billion or more. A specific study of the 2009 contract award for the government’s Integrated Relocation Program – a plan meant to assist with employee moves by providing services such as providing realtors, home inspectors and marketing advice – found that decisions by government officials did not “encourage competition,” which led to only one service provider, Brookfield Global Relocation Services (formerly Royal LePage Relocations Services) bidding on the lucrative contract. But “we found no evidence to suggest that this was done intentionally,” the auditors concluded. The government spends hundreds of millions annually on the program.",

The proposal for the change will be made before the Central Committee for foreign workers on 11 November he told Arab News.\n\n“Undergoing the test will become mandatory for an estimated 289 health centers across the GCC if the Health Council approves the proposal of tighter controls on gender tests for migrant workers. More than 2 million expatriate workers underwent the new gender tests in 2012,” he said.\n\nDirector of the Public Health Department in Kuwait, Youssef Mendkar, confirmed that the proposals aim to prevent transgender migrants from working in GCC countries.\n\nThe test aims to determine the gender of the person at birth, as well as through the worker’s medical history.\n\nLGBT campaigner, Peter Tatchell, Director of the Peter Tatchell Foundation, said: “This proposal is unjust discrimination against transgender people. Excluding expat workers because of their gender identity is immoral and doesn’t make economic sense. People should be employed solely on the basis of their personal integrity and their ability to do the job. Trans people make perfectly good, reliable employees.\n\n“Banning trans persons from entering the country may deter some foreign investors and companies with trans staff. They won’t want to subject their employees to the humiliation of these intrusive gender tests.\n\n“FIFA says it opposes all discrimination. Yet the proposals to test and ban foreign trans employees from the Gulf Cooperation Countries will include Qatar and will penalise World Cup construction and hospitality staff from overseas who are trans.\n\n“If these plans get the go ahead, FIFA should cancel the 2022 World Cup contract on the grounds that Qatar has violated FIFA’s non-discrimination values. It should find a new host city for the 2022 tournament. Discrimination against trans people is incompatible with FIFA’s commitment to equality for all.”\n\nIt is illegal to be gay in all of the GCC member countries. These include Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nArticle 193 of the Penal Code in Kuwait punishes homosexuality between men, over the age of 21, with up to seven years imprisonment.

Kaepernick will play the No. 2 role ahead of Christian Ponder.\n\nIt comes as little surprise that Kaepernick made the club. He played relatively well in Thursday's preseason finale, guiding the team on a 16-play touchdown drive and showing better arm strength than the previous week. Gabbert, though, spent nearly the entire offseason running Kelly's attack while Kaepernick nursed multiple injuries.\n\nKaepernick's sparse on-field work has been completely overshadowed by his controversial decision to sit during the playing of the national anthem. Kelly, who has supported that decision from Kaepernick, could hardly afford to dump him with nothing more than an ineffective Ponder waiting in the wings.\n\nThe question going forward is how much playing time -- if any -- Kaepernick receives in 2016. As NFL Media's Mike Garafolo reported Friday on NFL Network, the quarterback's contract is a potential issue.\n\nKaepernick is already guaranteed $11.9 million and can earn another $2 million in roster bonuses depending on playing time. His deal also comes equipped with nearly $25 million in injury guarantees after this year.\n\n\"If they have those injury guarantees going forward,\" Garafolo said, \"you could see (a Robert Griffin III)-type situation where they don't let him do much because they're afraid of him getting injured.\"\n\nThat debate is for another day.

  "latent_26634": "CLOSE The Senate voted against an Obama-era FCC privacy regulation that gave consumers more power over who can access their information. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nHands typing on laptop keyboard. (Photo11: Getty Images/Ingram Publishing)\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives is set Tuesday to overturn buffed-up broadband privacy rules that the Federal Communications Commission approved just days before President Trump's election.\n\nWhy should you care? Well, depending on your position on the political spectrum, the repeal of these regulations reflect a double-cross of the previous administration's FCC to improve consumer privacy protections or a return to balance in the online marketing playing field.\n\nConsumer advocates are loudly voicing concerns that should the rules be overturned, Internet service providers (ISPs) such as Comcast and Verizon will \"have the right to track us while we are online and gather private information – including information about where we are, our finances, our health status, and much more – and sell it to marketers without our permission,\" said Robert Weissman, president of advocacy group Public Citizen, in a statement in advance of the vote.\n\nBut proponents of less government regulation contend that the FCC, then led by Democrat Tom Wheeler, overreached in passing rules that put ISPs at a disadvantage against Web sites and apps \"that, in fact, collect far more personal information,\" said Randolph May, president of The Free State Foundation, a free market think tank, after the Senate voted last week to nullify the rules.\n\nThose rules, passed Oct. 27, would have required ISPs to ask customers' permission to collect, use and sell personal information. Most of the provisions do not go into effect until later this year.\n\nAnd they likely never will. Now that Republicans are in power, Congress -- and new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai -- are quickly targeting regulations they consider to be overly burdensome and anti-business.\n\nLast week, the Senate voted 50-48 to overturn the broadband privacy rules using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to dismiss regulations recently enacted by the previous administration with simple majority votes.\n\nThe House, which like the Senate is led by Republicans, is expected to vote Tuesday afternoon and if its members, as expected, pass the resolution, it will be forwarded onto President Trump, who is expected to sign it into law.\n\nThe opposition has tried to rally public outcry over the last day or so with several groups including Color of Change, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Free Press using Twitter to urge voters to contact their House representatives. \"The space our communities have claimed online is so vital in this moment & movement. We must keep it safe, open & secure,\" tweeted Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color Of Change.\n\nThe space our communities have claimed online is so vital in this moment & movement. We must keep it safe, open, & secure #BroadbandPrivacyhttps://t.co/XX9JcB6iCg — Rashad Robinson (@rashadrobinson) March 27, 2017\n\nNet freedom group Fight for the Future said it plans to put up billboards with names of all congressmen who vote to overturn the privacy rules. “These billboards are just the beginning,\" said Evan Greer, the group's campaign director. \"People from across the political spectrum are outraged, and every lawmaker who votes to take away our privacy will regret it come election day.”\n\nWhat do the FCC's broadband privacy rules do?\n\nISPs would be required to obtain “opt-in” consent from consumers to use and share sensitive information such as health and financial information, children's information, geo-location, Web browsing and app usage histories, and Social Security numbers. ISPs could not refuse service to customers who would not opt-in. Other less sensitive information could be used on an opt-out basis.\n\nWhy did the FCC pass the rules?\n\nThen-Chairman Wheeler sought to strengthen consumers' privacy protection in advance of coming tech advances including the Internet of Things, a growing variety of Net-connected devices including appliances and wearables. \"The more our economy and our lives move online, the more information about us goes over our (ISP) – and the more consumers want to know how to protect their personal information in the digital age,\" he said at the time. The new rules give consumers more say in how their personal data would be used, Wheeler said.\n\nThe rules also required Net providers to maintain data security to protect consumer data. Without the rules, ISPs' potential use of users' browsing data will undermine cybersecurity, the EFF says.\n\nWhy would ISPs fight the rules?\n\nUp until now, ISPs have not really tried to monetize consumer data, but these rules would make it harder should they want to become bigger players in \"the lucrative online advertising market,\" said Hap Rigby, a senior policy advisor at Wiley Rein, a law firm in Washington, and a former advisor to Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. As long as ISPs and digital advertising leaders Google and Facebook must play by the same rules, some see an opportunity for more competition in online advertising, he says, and the FCC's new rules could prevent that.\n\nSo there's no rules governing consumer broadband privacy if these are overturned?\n\nISPs do have their own privacy policies. And the FCC already has the authority to take action should an ISP commit unjust or unreasonable business practices, for instance, and that would not change should these new rules be axed. The Federal Trade Commission also has some consumer protection capabilities should companies take part in unfair and deceptive acts.\n\nBut there is some question of its authority because a recent federal court ruling found that the FTC had no jurisdiction over common carriers, which ISPs became under the 2015 Open Internet, or net neutrality rules, the FCC passed.\n\nPrivacy advocates note that these provisions involve after-the-fact enforcement, while the FCC rules provide expectations of conduct for ISPs.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe FCC is prohibited from proposing new similar privacy regulations, under the Congressional Review Act, if passed. \"So now we have a gap,\" said Ryan Calo, a law professor at University of Washington. \"Presumably, the FTC could enter that gap, but it would require further action.\"\n\nThat sounds like what some legislators want to do: make the FTC the overall privacy cop. “Today’s action takes us one step closer to restoring the FTC’s role as America’s expert agency on privacy,\" said Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., the House sponsor of the resolution, after the Senate vote last week.\n\nIn the meantime, the agencies handle privacy on a case-by-case basis. \"I do think there is some potential for activity in Congress,\" Rigby said, \"maybe not in the near-term, but you have got a lot of people who are paying more attention and would like some long-term certainty and more uniform treatment across the board.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2oulsxM",

  "latent_26982": "Detroit's transportation infrastructure has been in a state of chaotic flux over the last few years. It's been a period that's included both drastic cuts to public bus service and the emergence of new transit alternatives like the private Detroit Bus Company and the anticpated M-1 rail line.\n\nNow a service that is both a smartphone app and a transit option is setting up shop in Detroit. It's called Uber -- and it could change the way people think about getting around in the Motor City.\n\nAt its heart, the company is an on-demand luxury car service that uses smartphone technology to quickly connect passengers with private drivers. Uber is available as an app for Android and iPhone users, as well as through a website.\n\nAlthough service officially launched Wednesday, Uber has been testing and offering \"secret\" preview rides in Metro Detroit since March 7.\n\nPhilip Bator, editor of Thrillist Detroit, told The Huffington Post that he regularly uses the service when traveling in Uber's other market cities -- and has even used it several times since the company announced their test phase in Detroit. He says his wait times have ranged between two and ten minutes.\n\n\"I wouldn't even compare Uber to a typical Detroit taxi. It's reliable, transparent in its costs, effective, and entirely trackable. In short, I absolutely love it,\" he said in an email. \"The drivers are professional and prompt, the cars [are] in fantastic condition, and the app is incredibly simple to use.\"\n\nSome customers, however, have had less a positive experience than Bator. A Virginia man, for example, recently claimed he had been insulted and slapped by an Uber driver.\n\nSo, how does Uber work exactly?\n\nIt's a fairly simple process. To get a car sent out, all a person has to do is set their location on a smartphone map or type their address in on Uber's website. Customers are notified of the vehicle's expected arrival time through a text message. Once the driver gets arrived, they'll ask for a destination and begin the journey. Afterwards fees are taken care of automatically using credit card information that's been filed on Uber's database ahead of time. The cost of the ride is calculated by taking a base fare and adding an additional charge based on distance or time, depending on how fast the vehicle is traveling.\n\nLaunched in 2010 in San Francisco, Uber has now spread to around 30 cities in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Some of these locations offer a variety of vehicles including SUVs, but right now Detroiters will be limited to a black sedan or non-stretched limousine.\n\nInterestingly, the company itself doesn't own any of these vehicles. Instead, Uber finds existing transportation service companies, tests them to make sure to their vehicles and drivers meet its standards and then allows them to make use of their software.\n\n\"I guess you can think of us like a marketplace. We efficiently connect the rider and the driver,\" Ryan Graves, Uber's head of operations told The Huffington Post. \"Essentially, you hit a button and in five minutes we connect you with a private driver.\"\n\nUber sees this system as a mutually beneficial arrangement, but drivers in some cities have accused the company of tip-skimming. In Boston, these type of allegations have even become the focus of a class-action lawsuit, according to Mother Jones.\n\nGraves said these accusations come from a small minority of drivers and have little merit, adding that most drivers have increased their takeaway between 30 to 40 percent.\n\nFor customers, the service promises easy access to around-the-clock transportation.\n\nUber's website says that clients can expect service \"anywhere at anytime\" in participating cities like Detroit. In addition its coverage extends out into a number of surrounding suburbs -- spanning out roughly north and south between Troy and Taylor, and east to west between Grosse Pointe and Romulus.\n\nGraves added that customers can have \"100% confidence the car is arriving.\" This should be welcome news to Detroiters who can afford the service.\n\nIt can be a little pricey, however. After all, it's a company that bills itself as \"everyone's private driver.\" Graves told Xconomy an Uber ride could cost 10 to 15 percent more than taking a taxi, although clients don't have to worry about paying a tip. The Detroit pricing section on Uber's website estimates a ride from the city's downtown to Wayne State University would cost about $18 and a ride from there to Detroit Metro Airport would ring up at $70.\n\nSo Uber doesn't come cheap, but it does provide travelers with an alternative to waiting for inconsistent taxis or Detroit's weary bus system, which the transit advocacy group Transportation Riders United has estimated has lost about half its service since 2005.\n\nGraves said the city's lack of transit options -- along with the recent revitalization of the city's downtown and data suggesting a healthy customer base -- was one of the main reasons Uber decided to set up shop in Detroit.",

  "latent_27474": "Taipei, August 24, 2017--Chinese authorities should end their harassment of international journalists and let all media operate freely, the Committee to Protect Journalists said today. Police yesterday briefly detained the Asia correspondent for Canada's Globe and Mail in Kashgar, in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.\n\nPolice detained Nathan VanderKlippe, The Globe and Mail's Beijing-based correspondent, for three hours, searched his bag and camera, and confiscated his laptop, the journalist said on Twitter. The journalist's paper reported that police did not provide him with a reason for his detainment.\n\nVanderKlippe was detained while interviewing residents in the township of Elishku about the security situation of the Uighur community, according to The Globe and Mail. Three police officers and several government officials approached the journalist and demanded that he follow them to a local government office, the report said.\n\n\"People living inside and outside of China have a right to know what is going on in the country, and there is no legal basis for harassing foreign correspondents who interview Chinese citizens,\" said CPJ Asia Program Coordinator Steven Butler, in Washington D.C. \"China needs to stop trying to block coverage of sensitive stories, including on the Uighurs.\"\n\nVanderKlippe said on Twitter that after authorities gave him permission to leave, a car with two officers in it followed him. The reporter said that his computer was later returned to him along with a handwritten note, marked with an incorrect date, which read, \"On July 24, 2017 at 1:35 Beijing time, [we] confiscated Nathan VanderKlippe's Apple computer for operation purposes.\"\n\nThe Xinjiang region has been a site of tension in recent years as Chinese authorities tighten controls in the area and criminalize religious activities of the Uighur population. Residents of Elishku last month protested the arrests of 12 women for praying at a mosque and allegations of illegal use of force and extra-judicial killings by Chinese security forces, according to Radio Free Asia. Journalists covering the region have long been censored and jailed.\n\nConditions for the international press in China continue to deteriorate. The Foreign Correspondents Club of China 2016 survey of working conditions for international journalists found that more than half of respondents had been subjected to harassment, violence, or interference while attempting to report in China. Conditions for the local media are even worse, with journalists arrested, sentenced to years in prison, and subject to strict censorship requirements, CPJ research shows.",
  "latent_27493": "Pastor Steven Anderson (Screenshot/YouTube)\n\nAn Arizona pastor known for his virulently anti-LGBT views went on a podium-stomping tirade recently after businesses began cutting off their services to his and other bigoted pastors’ churches, the Friendly Atheist reports.\n\nPastor Steven Anderson, who heads the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Phoenix, Arizona, lashed out this week at activists who successfully petitioned businesses like PayPal and Apple to shut down his accounts after his hate speech. While Anderson posted his June 22 sermon on a website called Archive, the Friendly Atheist uploaded a sampling to YouTube.\n\nAfter the June 12 massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Anderson posted a video in which he said there are “50 less pedophiles” in the world. Forty-nine people were killed in the mass shooting at the gay nightclub.\n\nAnderson has been reaping the consequences of his words, and he is not happy about it.\n\n“It’s war. You know what the filthy sodomites have done toward our church and us, and our friends and our fellow pastors that actually have the guts to say what needs to be said? Here’s what they’ve done in the last few weeks,” he told his congregation. “They got our PayPal account shut down so that we can’t take anymore online donations. We set up with another company, GivLet, they got that shut down. Qgiv, they got that shut down. BitPay, they got that shut down. They shut down our iTunes podcast. They shut down Brother Jimenez’s PayPal account. They shut down Brother Romero’s PayPal account… The landlord of Pastor Jimenez is saying, ‘hey we’re not going to renew your lease.'”\n\nAnderson was referencing Roger Jimenez, a California pastor who made headlines and earned widespread condemnation when he cheered the actions of the Orlando shooter for attacking LGBT people.\n\n“I think that’s great. I think that helps society. I think Orlando, Florida’s a little safer tonight,” Jimenez said in response to the attack. “It is unnatural for a man to be attracted to another man. The tragedy is that more of them didn’t die.”\n\nHe was also referencing Texas pastor Donnie Romero, who weighed in saying he agreed with Jimenez.\n\n“These 50 sodomites are all perverts and pedophiles, and they are the scum of the earth, and the earth is a little bit better place now,” he said in a sermon following the massacre.\n\nAnderson was clearly angry that these words have come back to haunt them.\n\n“I mean these people are dedicated,” he said, about LGBT rights activists. “These people are researching, they’re finding out where we bank, they’re finding out who we do business with. They’re trying to get us shut down on all fronts, and you know what, let me tell you something, I’m sick of it.”\n\nHe then jumped up on his podium and started pointing at the audience.\n\n“And you know what, if you’re not gonna back us up then get out of here, we don’t need your help,” he said, before launching into an invective-filled rant calling LGBT people “dogs.”\n\nWatch the clip, as posted by the Friendly Atheist, here:",
  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nMagic-Heat Preview\n\nBy JEFF BARTL\n\nPosted Mar 02 2011 8:56PM The Miami Heat and Orlando Magic are in the midst of difficult stretches which may define their seasons, and neither team has played particularly well against tougher competition. One team will shed that label for at least a day when the in-state rivals meet Thursday night in Miami. The Heat (43-17) began a six-game stretch against likely playoff teams Sunday with a 91-86 loss to New York. They're second in the Eastern Conference, but have matchups looming with San Antonio, Chicago, Portland and the Los Angeles Lakers. The loss to the Knicks dropped Miami to 13-14 against teams .500 or better, a stark contrast to a 29-2 mark against squads below the break-even mark. With 22 games remaining and the Heat battling the Bulls and Boston for the top three seeds in the East, improvement against top-tier competition is necessary. \"We've got to figure it out,\" said Dwyane Wade, who was limited to 12 points against New York on 5-for-15 shooting. \"That's why we continue to play these games. We continue to build habits. Hopefully, eventually we'll turn the corner.\" Miami hopes the acquisition of point guard Mike Bibby will provide an added boost. Bibby, who reached a buyout agreement Monday with Washington, is expected to be in uniform Thursday after the Heat cleared a roster spot by releasing Carlos Arroyo on Tuesday. LeBron James, who said he had private discussions with Bibby about playing with the Heat, scored a season-high 51 points against Orlando in the most recent meeting - a 104-100 victory Feb. 3. Coincidently, that marked the last time Miami beat a team with a winning record. The Magic (39-22), fourth in the East and 4 1/2 games behind the Heat, have lost two of the three matchups this season but have seemed to hit their stride. Orlando has won three straight and five of six after beating visiting New York 116-110 on Tuesday. After a stretch from Jan. 12-Feb. 11 without beating a team with a winning record, the Magic have won three straight such games and are making their case for home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. Orlando will face Miami, followed by Chicago on Friday and Portland on Monday. \"We'll be forced to play every night or suffer the consequences if we don't play well,\" coach Stan Van Gundy said. \"And I think that's a good mindset and focus to have - that you have to play very well to get a win. You're not going to get anything given to you in this stretch.\" The Magic are 2-4 combined against their next three opponents. \"This is kind of a chance to redeem ourselves,\" guard Jason Richardson said. \"We haven't played against some of the top teams well, but I think we have a chance this week to show people we're serious about trying to win a championship here.\" Dwight Howard had 30 points and 16 rebounds, and Jameer Nelson scored 23 of his 26 points in the second half Tuesday. Nelson scored a team-high 22 points in the most recent meeting with the Heat, while Howard has averaged 20.0 points and 13.7 rebounds in three matchups this season.\n\nCopyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

It's becoming a trend for the Miami Heat - and one the Orlando Magic were more than thrilled to exploit Thursday night. Down by 24 points in the third quarter, the Magic went on an unbelievable 40-9 run over the next 15 minutes and stunned the Heat 99-96, the second-largest comeback in Orlando franchise history and matching the second-biggest in the NBA this season. Jason Richardson scored 24 points for Orlando, 11 of them to kickstart the epic burst that turned a 73-49 deficit into an 89-82 lead. \"Well, that defies explanation,\" Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. There's only been six instances this season of a team taking a 22-point lead or more and losing. The Heat have been victimized that way twice, both times at home, the first against Utah in the season's earliest stages. This one seemed to cut much deeper. \"We've blown a lot of games where we were in full control,\" Heat forward Chris Bosh said. \"And we have to do something.\" Jameer Nelson scored 12 of his 16 in the second half and Dwight Howard finished with 14 points and 18 rebounds for the Magic, who fell into the 24-point hole when LeBron James scored with 8:57 remaining in the third quarter. Orlando outscored Miami 50-23 the rest of the way. \"To do it on the road, that was an incredible win,\" Van Gundy said. Said Dwyane Wade: \"Mindboggling.\" James and Wade combined for 47 points in the first half and outscored the Magic by two in the first 24 minutes. That was long forgotten by the end. \"I've been a part of games like this one before, but this one is special,\" said Richardson, who was 5 for 5 from 3-point range after halftime. \"We knew what they did to us last time. LeBron and D-Wade played at a superstar level in the first half. We just hung in there, battled, got some stops. It was huge getting a win here.\" James scored 29 and Wade had 28 for Miami. Wade was 0 for 4 in the fourth, James 0 for 2. Combined in the second half, they were 3 for 13, all three makes by James. They were hardly the only ones to blame - in the fourth quarter, Howard alone outrebounded Miami 10-9. \"We need to keep on pushing through,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"There's no other way to say it. ... The tide turned.\" The game was significant in the standings. Miami is now two games behind Boston - three in the loss column - for the best record in the Eastern Conference. And Orlando, which has very quietly won four straight, is now just 3 1/2 games behind Miami in the Southeast Division. The Heat go to San Antonio on Friday, while Orlando hosts Chicago. Ryan Anderson scored 15 and Gilbert Arenas added 11, including a pair of big 3-pointers in the fourth. Orlando was 9 for 14 from 3-point range after halftime, while the Heat were 11 for 37 from anywhere on the floor. \"I have never been a part of one like that,\" Van Gundy said. That's not entirely true. Orlando nearly rallied from a 23-point deficit in the final 7 1/2 minutes when the teams last met early last month, missing a potential game-tying shot in the final seconds that night on its home floor. So on Thursday, the Magic started rallying much sooner. \"To tell you the truth, I didn't even know we were down that much,\" Nelson said. \"I was just playing. I just think that's what you have to do when you know you can play better and you're not playing up to your potential. Just get it going somehow, not worry about the score.\" Miami was down 97-96 with 9.6 seconds left. J.J. Redick pushed the lead to three with a pair of free throws, before Bosh and James missed 3-point attempts in the final seconds. \"Got a good look,\" James said. \"Just didn't go in.\" Mike Miller made a 70-footer for Miami moments after the halftime buzzer, something that looked inconsequential when the Heat were leading by 18 at the time. The final margin? Three points. \"The urgency is there,\" Wade said. \"Just got to finish it. We enjoy these games. We play them hard. ... It's growing pains and it (stinks). You look for the light at the end of the tunnel.\" James made his first 11 shots when the teams last met in Orlando a month ago, so the Magic were possibly relieved when his first attempt Thursday bounced away. Ah, a mere temporary blip for the two-time MVP. James wound up making nine straight shots after that first miss and Wade was 10 for 12 from the field by halftime, as the Heat took a 63-45 edge into the locker room. \"It was one of those nights the stars aligned,\" Van Gundy said. In the last Heat home game, they wasted a 15-point lead before losing to the New York Knicks. At Orlando a month ago, Miami was up by 23 with 7:40 left before surviving a white-knuckle finish. A 23-point lead in Indiana was all but squandered a couple weeks ago, and there was the stunning 22-point collapse in a home loss to Utah in November. This might have been the worst of all. \"We continue to get big leads and we continue to falter,\" James said. \"Hopefully we can figure it out soon.\" Notes: The teams split the season series, each going 1-1 at home. ... James was charged with a turnover midway through the third, but the play hurt Bosh more. He inadvertently walked into James' passing lane and took a ball off the face, the pass rolling out of bounds toward the Orlando bench. ... Orlando's biggest comeback this season was a 16-point deficit before beating Dallas.\n\nCopyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27648": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Carolina Panthers defensive end Charles Johnson didn't have to buy his own ticket for Sunday's game at Tennessee after all.\n\nHe just had trouble locating the one the team left for him.\n\nBut Johnson, scheduled to come off injured reserve next week, created a bit of a stir when he tweeted that he was going to have to purchase a ticket before the 27-10 Carolina win.\n\nWhen u standing in front of the Staduim with no ticket @Panthers smh. Guess I'll buy my own ticket lol ( serious ) pic.twitter.com/cgXn5ItVJi — charles johnson (@randywattson) November 15, 2015\n\nWhat might have been lost in people wondering why a player would have to buy his own ticket was that Johnson traveled on his own to two of Carolina's road games while a severe hamstring injury sidelined him for eight weeks.\n\nHe didn't have to. The NFL allows players on injured reserve to travel with the team and stay at the team hotel. The Panthers offered Johnson that opportunity.\n\nJohnson turned them down.\n\n\"That's him,\" coach Ron Rivera said. \"He said he didn't want to be a distraction.\"\n\nIt's not a common occurrence for injured players to travel to away games. Carolina defensive end Jared Allen said he hasn't heard of that since he arrived in the league 12 years ago.\n\nIt's even less common that that a player would pay his own way to travel.\n\n\"It just shows the dedication to this team,\" Allen said. \"It just shows what this locker room is all about. Guys genuinely want to be a part of this in some facet.\n\n\"Him being there, it's a spark for us. It's a lift for us. A guy who is a leader in this locker room, who has been here all of his career, it shows he's absolutely involved.\"\n\nJohnson should be ready to play when the Panthers (9-0) play at Dallas on Thanksgiving Day. The hamstring he strained in the third game hasn't been bothering him for several weeks. He looked good in practice this week as Carolina prepared for Washington.\n\nGetting back into a game can't come soon enough. Johnson tweeted this following a Monday night win over Indianapolis.\n\nGreat win. I promise I'm coming back with vengeance #3moreweeks — charles johnson (@randywattson) November 3, 2015\n\nWhen asked how bad he's wanted to be on the field during an undefeated start, Johnson said in his usual short, distinct way, \"A lot, man.\"\n\nSecond-year defensive end Kony Ealy summed it up another way.\n\n\"He would die just to be on the field, just to play with us,\" he said.\n\nBut Johnson has been there for his teammates throughout this extended break. He has been to the past five games, beginning with paying his own airfare to Seattle for an Oct. 18 win against the two-time NFC champions.\n\nHe has gone onto the field and talked to the team prior to those games, which gives defensive coordinator Sean McDermott goose bumps.\n\n\"He just tells us to go out there, leave it on the field and go to the max,\" Ealy said. \"It's the same thing our coaches say, but at the end of the day, coming from a peer, it means that much more.\"\n\nJohnson has been anything but a distraction. His teammates miss him and can't wait to have the team's second all-time leader in sacks back having an impact in the lineup.\n\nBut Johnson paying to attend away games also made an impact.\n\n\"To see him on the sideline, what it does for all the guys, it's a huge uplift,\" said defensive tackle Dwan Edwards, expected to return from an ankle injury Sunday. \"That the guy is willing to spend his own money to go says a lot.\"\n\nEdwards said he has seen a few injured players travel to away games in their hometown during his 12 seasons.\n\n\"But not random trips,\" he said.\n\nCarolina fullback Mike Tolbert went to a few road games last season when he was on injured reserve with a designation to return, but he flew with the team and stayed in the team hotel.\n\n\"Everybody doesn't have his kind of money,\" he said of Johnson, with a laugh.\n\nJohnson has one more season after this left on a six-year, $76 million contract. He could afford to fly the entire team to away games.\n\nBut his ability to pay his own way isn't why he did so. He simply didn't want to get in the way.\n\n\"He's a team player,\" Tolbert said. \"His moral support is just as good as him being on the field right now.\"\n\nJohnson shrugs it off as no big deal, even though it really is to his teammates.\n\n\"I'm just along for the ride,\" he said. \"I'm along for the ride.\"",

  "latent_27730": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) defended the Treasury Department’s analysis that the administration’s policy agenda would pay for the GOP tax bill, though he did not specifically endorse the administration’s $1.8 trillion growth estimate.\n\n“That estimate makes a lot of sense,” Mr. Ryan told reporters Tuesday. “You see a wide variety [of estimates], but I do think we’re going to have a big, positive, dynamic effect.”\n\nOn Monday, the Treasury released a one-page document projecting that if the U.S. economy achieves the rapid growth the Trump administration says is possible under its economic policies, that expansion will generate enough money to pay for more than $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. Some budget analysts and Democrats criticized the document as relying on overly rosy growth estimates and not delving into how much growth the tax bill itself would spur.\n\n“Baselessly asserting that the economy will grow faster simply because one says so is both disingenuous and dangerously misleading,” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said Monday.\n\nThe Treasury analysis started with the administration’s assumption of a steady 2.9% growth rate, from the president’s budget released in May, but it did not assess how much growth the latest tax plan itself might cause. Other agencies have predicted slower economic growth. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, for example, has projected the economy would grow at a 1.9% annual rate in the coming years, and the Federal Reserve projected 1.8% growth over the long run.\n\nIn the Treasury analysis, about half of the growth pickup would come from changes in business taxation, while half would come from other policies that Congress has yet to consider, including an overhaul of the welfare system and a new infrastructure package, a Treasury official said in a briefing on the document.\n\n“Every administration does this, just so you know, that they put into their plans what their plans are,” Mr. Ryan said. “That’s all going to help grow the economy, so it’s perfectly appropriate that the administration looks at that when they make their assessments on economic growth.”\n\nSeveral analyses have said the tax bill would fall short of being able to pay for itself. The Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan tax analysts in Congress, said the House and Senate version of the tax bill won’t pay for themselves with faster growth and would instead lead to $1 trillion in additional budget deficits over a decade even after assuming economic growth.\n\nMr. Ryan said he did not believe the JCT analysis provided the most accurate assessment of the tax bill’s effect on the economy.\n\n“They gave us what I would call the low range,” he said. “It’s still positive but there are other models that I think are more reflective of reality.”",
  "latent_27759": "(Welcome to The Soapbox, the space where we get loud, feisty, political, and opinionated about anything and everything. In this edition: MoviePass’s latest terms of service updates are ridiculous.)\n\nIt’s been three months since MoviePass announced their new subscription model allowing consumers to pay $10 a month for the ability to see a movie in theaters everyday. The company initially wasn’t prepared for the onslaught of new customers signing up for MoviePass, which caused significant delays in the shipping of the card to subscribers. On top of that, the customer service provided to both longtime and new customers was dismal, and there were glitches abound for users after the new price point was introduced.\n\nThankfully, MoviePass has mostly fixed these problems, though they have created some concerns with some recent, vaguely threatening changes to their rules and regulations for subscribers. But MoviePass users still have a problem, and unfortunately, it’s the largest movie theater chain in the United States: AMC Theatres.\n\nRemember, AMC Theatres Hates MoviePass\n\nFor anyone who hasn’t kept up with all the news surrounding MoviePass over the past few months, AMC Theatres adamantly came out against the subscription service as soon as it was announced. The theater chain issued a press released indicating that MoviePass was not welcome at their establishments, albeit without legally being able to stop any customers from using MoviePass at any of their locations. The chain said their legal team was “consulting with its attorneys to determine if or how AMC can prevent a subscription program offered by MoviePass from being used at AMC Theatres in the United States.”\n\nFollowing that press release, it was determined that the only way AMC Theatres could actually stop customers from paying for tickets with MoviePass at any of their US locations was if they stopped accepting MasterCard payments altogether. Since breaking an agreement with MasterCard would cost AMC Theatres a significant amount of money, it seemed like they couldn’t do a damn thing about stopping MoviePass. So instead they decided to make it more difficult for some of their customers to use MoviePass.\n\nThe first strike from AMC Theatres came when they decided to stop MoviePass users from making E-ticket purchases ahead of time in order to beat the crowd and pick seats in advance. This restriction had only popped up in certain locations, and it actually wasn’t that big of a deal since only 5% of locations where MoviePass can be used had E-ticketing available.\n\nRecently, AMC Theatres has been more passive aggressive about their attempts at creating MoviePass restrictions. Since AMC Theatres can’t stop customers from paying with MoviePass, instead they’re punishing those customers by not allowing them to earn points on their Stubs or Stubs Premiere card for their ticket purchases made with a MoviePass card. It’s basically the movie theater chain equivalent of, “Fine, you can play in our sandbox, but you can’t use our bucket.” Give me a break.\n\nOther AMC Theatres have been more bold (or maybe they’ve misunderstood how they’re supposed to handle MoviePass customers). At least one AMC Theatres location in Illinois stopped customers from buying a ticket with MoviePass altogether, saying that they don’t accept the card. I know this because my twentysomething cousin was turned away from this location on several occasions until he eventually decided to go elsewhere. More potentially concerning is this unconfirmed detail from a MoviePass subscriber on Twitter:\n\nThis was posted in a group on Facebook.\n\nSon works at an AMC Theatre. They will no longer be honoring Movie Pass beginning January 1, nationwide. FYI. — Gary Klinger (@garyjr217) November 20, 2017\n\nBut as we said, that kind of action would create some serious problems for AMC Theatres, so take it with a grain of salt for the time being.\n\nWhy Is AMC Theatres Acting Like a Petulant Child?\n\nWhen we called out AMC Theatres for their ridiculously aggressive stance against MoviePass, we wondered why they came out against the service so strongly. As it stands, all theaters who accept MoviePass aren’t losing any money. They get paid full price for the movie ticket by MoviePass. There’s no discount on the ticket whatsoever, so movie theater chains only benefit from having more customers coming to theater. That customer also has some extra money in their pocket to spend on concessions since they didn’t have to pay for their movie ticket. So what’s the problem?\n\nIn Deadline’s recent report on the newly revealed yearly subscription plan that MoviePass is offering for a limited time, they offered up this nugget of information:\n\n“AMC Theatres reportedly shopped around their version of a monthly ticket price plan to the major studios, which Deadline heard was met with a cold response.”\n\nAnd there it is. Now this all makes perfect sense. AMC Theatres wasn’t against the idea of MoviePass. Instead, AMC Theatres was upset that MoviePass was able to succeed where they had failed. The reason AMC Theatres couldn’t get their own subscription plan to work (something we suggested they should do if they hated MoviePass so much), is because studios were leery about renegotiating how much money they would get from any ticket sales tied to the potential subscription plan. MoviePass doesn’t have that problem, because they’re paying full price for tickets. So now AMC Theatres is retaliating by making the movie-going experience for MoviePass customers downright inconvenient.\n\nGrow Up, AMC Theatres\n\nHey, AMC Theatres, maybe instead of pouting because your own subscription service couldn’t move forward and punishing the customers who are taking advantage of the free market, why don’t you figure out how to make your movie theater experience worth the ticket price?\n\nThe reason customers are flocking to MoviePass is because it’s cheap. The reason attendance has dropped at movie theaters is because the exorbitant ticket price was not met with an experience worth the money. Whether it’s unclean theaters, poor quality screens, unfriendly customer service or the recent decision to stop masking movies, it seems like you’re doing everything in your power to keep customers away. So why not embrace the fact that more customers may opt to come back now that they have a MoviePass? Your customers should want to come to an AMC Theatres location and not simply come due to a lack of options.\n\nThis is an opportunity for you to impress new customers who had given up on the movie theater experience. MoviePass isn’t going anywhere anytime soon because they have plenty of funding to back up the increased cost of paying full price for movie tickets for all their customers. Even with the increased attendance that comes with the holiday season blockbusters like Star Wars: The Last Jedi, MoviePass is fully prepared to keep marching forward. So the ball is in your court, AMC Theatres. Instead of focusing on how to stop MoviePass, maybe figure out how you can take advantage of this situation and prove why you deserve to be the largest movie theater chain in the United States.",

My Santa shipped out my gifts practically right away, and two of them arrived this weekend! \\o/ (According to the tracking numbers I was given, there are still two more on the way! This post will definitely be updated when I receive them.)\n\nThe first gift arrived stuffed into my mailbox last night (Friday), and I was practically bouncing all the way up to my apartment. I couldn't wait to open it and find out what was inside!!! It's the very first thing I did when I got into my apartment. Inside my package was a very beautifully-wrapped box... that contained a pair of golden bow-and-arrow earrings from my Redditgifts wish list! They're from the shop Compendium, and they are beautiful. :D\n\nThe postal service had actually attempted to deliver my second gift on Thursday, but I was at work - I've been keeping an eye on my tracking numbers, so I felt bad when I saw the \"attempted delivery\" notice! It indicated that the parcel was being sent to the post office, and that I'd get a notice in the mail telling me which post office it would be at. (I live in the city itself, so there are four within walking distance of me.) Of course, no notice in the mail yet! But Canada Post's tracking system was able to tell me which post office it wound up at, so today I went for a walk through all the snow to try and pick it up. And the internet was right! It was there for me, and the lovely lady at the counter let me take it even though I didn't have the delivery number. I got it home and opened it up... and inside was a Pumpkin Pasties lip balm and a Pumpkin Pasties candle, both also from my Redditgifts wish list! They're from Bubble & Geek. They both smell AMAZING, and are a perfect way to combine my love of pumpkin-flavoured things and Harry Potter.\n\nThank you to Compendium and Bubble & Geek for the lovely products. And a huge, giant THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to my Secret Santa, whoever you are!!! Alas, both my packages had my Santa's username omitted. Maybe one of the other two packages that are on their way will tell me who my lovely gifter is. If not, Secret Santa, I would love to find out who you are. I want to thank you properly and by name! In the meantime, this post will have to suffice. Thank you again, so much - you've absolutely made my weekend. You're the best!\n\n(And, of course, an update on the other two gifts will be added once they arrive! For now, enjoy the ton of pictures I took, because I couldn't help myself. :D )",

Then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win - Mahatma Gandhi,\" Trump wrote on social networking site Instagram as part of his effort to rally supporters.The Instagram post included a picture of hordes of supporters rallying at a Trump campaign stop in Alabama.Soon, the anti-Trump lobby was up in flames on the social media.The Hill, a top US political website, said, \"There's no record that Gandhi ever used the phrase, which has been widely attributed to him.\"The quotation appears to be similar to words used in a 1918 trade union address by socialist leader Nicholas Klein, it said.Christian Science Monitor has put this among the top 10 political misquotes.There was no immediate response from the Trump's campaign on the issue.\"Gandhi did not say this,\" one Scott T Smith wrote on Twitter.Trump sought to quote Gandhi a day after he was criticised for re-tweeting Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini early Sunday morning.\"He got tired of quoting Mussolini and he's saving the Hitler quotes until he's really desperate,\" tweeted Brad Fraser.Several popular websites have attributed this quote — First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win - to Mahatma Gandhi.According to Wikiquotes, this is the quote which is often misattributed to Mahatma Gandhi.",
  "latent_28265": "SALEM -- A bill that would limit default gun sales when background checks take longer than expected is \"unlikely\" to emerge from a divided, work-choked Senate -- meaning Oregon lawmakers could end this year's session without passing any gun-related legislation.\n\nHouse Bill 4147 remains on hold in the Senate's rules committee after barely clearing the House on a 31-28 vote Monday. That vote had initially been set for Friday but had to wait because support among Democrats, particularly among wary moderates, was so soft.\n\n\"It's unlikely this late in the session,\" said Senate Majority Leader Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, who also made clear, given her traditional support for gun measures: \"I hate to see any gun bill not make it.\"\n\nThe bill would make Oregon gun-buyers wait a few days longer to obtain a firearm if their background checks encounter complications. Right now, sellers can proceed -- at their discretion -- if a check takes longer than three days. That's in line with federal law.\n\nHB 4147 initially sought to make buyers wait as long as it took for a background to come back. To stay alive in the House, it was eventually amended to make buyers wait 10 days.\n\nThe bill emerged after a mass shooting at a Charleston, S.C., church that left nine people dead. The suspected gunman, federal authorities found, was allowed to purchase his weapon even though his background check slipped past the three-day window.\n\nClerical errors kept an inexperienced investigator from learning, within the waiting period, that the suspected gunman had disqualifying drug offenses. Critics of HB 4147, in a tense House debate, argued that no amount of extra time would have unearthed that mistake.\n\nHouse Democrats acknowledge that a so-called \"Charleston loophole\" would not be closed. But they've argued that HB 4147 will still keep more guns away from people barred from having them -- including domestic violence abusers and other potential mass shooters.\n\nAnd yet with tensions flaring in the Senate -- leading to an awkward Republican no-show Wednesday, forcing leaders to abandon a nighttime floor session -- some would-be supporters privately see HB 4147 as too tepid to justify fighting things out in their chamber.\n\nData from the state police found delays in just 8,467 -- or 3.2 percent -- of the 262,838 background checks conducted last year. Most went through within minutes. Buyers whose checks faced delays, however, were five times more likely to be denied.\n\nOf more than 600 denials in the last four months of 2015, 52 involved a fugitive from justice and 205 were from would-be buyers with felony convictions. Dozens of other denied buyers had convictions for assault or menacing.\n\nThe bill's sponsor, House Majority Leader Jennifer Williamson, D-Portland, has promised more money to help the Oregon State Police better process background checks as well as work through a backlog of rape kits.

  "latent_28479": "South Lake Union’s transformation — largely fueled by the growth of its highest-profile employer, Amazon — has had a ripple effect that’s reshaped the surrounding city, for better or worse. Click on the handle above and slide to compare photos.\n\nIt’s all happened so quickly.\n\nYou don’t have to be a lifelong Seattleite to remember the old, down-at-heel South Lake Union of the 1990s — less a neighborhood than a patchwork of parking lots, warehouses and low-slung industrial buildings. It felt like a ghost town, even at midday.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, 36,000 people work in the neighborhood, almost a 50 percent jump just since 2009, the year before Amazon relocated its headquarters here from Beacon Hill. At the corner of Westlake and Denny — where Whole Foods opened in 2006 — the number of pedestrians nearly quadrupled in just five years, according to counts conducted by the Downtown Seattle Association. At peak time, 1,711 people cross there every hour — their faces buried in their phones, no doubt.\n\nOn a stroll down Westlake Avenue, you can shop for swank home goods at West Elm, dine at Tom Douglas’ upscale pizza parlor or even splurge on an electro-luxury car at the Tesla showroom.\n\nIs South Lake Union the fastest-changing urban neighborhood in America?\n\nIt’s certainly a contender. True, there are a few other big city neighborhoods that have seemingly sprung up overnight recently: San Francisco’s Mission Bay, Boston’s Seaport District and New York’s Hudson Square come to mind.\n\nBut South Lake Union is unique. Its transformation — largely fueled by the growth of its highest-profile employer, Amazon — has had a ripple effect that’s reshaped the surrounding city, for better or worse.\n\nThe amount of development has been staggering. “More than 50 new buildings in the last decade,” says Ethan Phelps-Goodman, who runs the construction-tracking website Seattle In Progress. “That’s just about doubled the total commercial square footage in the neighborhood.”\n\nSo much of South Lake Union is sleek and new, it’s not surprising that it’s been derided as “soulless.” All the gleaming glass buildings have an architectural sameness. Even though it has become a major job center, it’s true that the neighborhood doesn’t quite feel lived-in yet.\n\nBut that’s also changing rapidly. Census data shows close to 7,000 residents in South Lake Union and the Denny Triangle area in 2014, up from 1,500 in 2000 — a rate of growth that leaves every other Seattle neighborhood in the dust.\n\nThe eastern half of South Lake Union — folks used to call it Cascade — was once a low-rent area, but new luxury-apartment complexes have transformed it into an upscale address.\n\nCensus data shows that the median rent paid by residents increased 26 percent between 2009 and 2014 — and that’s after adjusting for inflation. The median listing price for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,950, according to Zillow.\n\nBut as dramatic as the changes have been, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.\n\nGet ready for skyscrapers.\n\nAccording to Ethan Phelps-Goodman, high-rise towers up to 42 stories tall will further change the face of South Lake Union over the next few years: “With 16 different towers in the planning stages, we’re likely to see the residential and commercial capacity of the neighborhood double yet again.”",
  "latent_28492": "High fructose corn syrup is a killer. Since humans started consuming it, obesity rates have more than tripled and diabetes incidence has increased more than seven fold. Even when used in moderation it is a major cause of heart disease, obesity, cancer, dementia, liver failure, tooth decay, and more.\n\nSo what does the FDA do about this silent killer? It allows food producers to change the name of the infamous sweeter in order to trick consumers into thinking they are not eating high fructose corn syrup.\n\nThat’s right, high fructose corn syrup now goes by a new, deceitful name – “Natural Sweetener” – designed to trick customers into making ill-informed choices that will impact on their health.\n\nConsumers are finally catching on to the fact that what we put in our mouths effects our waistline as well as our health. Since consumers have become much smarter and finally waking up to these realities, they are demanding healthier food choices. Every food company is smearing 100% natural on every box of anything regardless of whats inside the box.\n\nNow we have to know the new sneaky name to know whether or not we are consuming High Fructose Corn Syrup or not. Obviously the best way to avoid this mess is to buy from companies you really trust.\n\nBig food companies are hiding ingredients they know we really don’t want to consume in their products. This time it’s the presence of a new version of high fructose corn syrup. But this is not the innocuous fructose that has sweetened the fruits humans have eaten since time began. This is a questionable ingredient with many names that could be causing all sorts of health problems.\n\nThe product is General Mills’ Vanilla Chex, an updated version of the Chex cereal sold in most conventional grocery and discount stores for many years. The front of the box clearly states that the product contains “no high fructose corn syrup” (HFCS), but turn it over to read the ingredient list and there it is – the new isolated fructose.\n\nWhy is that a problem? According to the Corn Refiners Association (CRA), there’s been a sneaky name change. The term ‘fructose’ is now being used to denote a product that was previously known as HFCS-90, meaning it is 90 percent pure fructose. Compare this to what is termed ‘regular’ HFCS, which contains either 42 or 55 percent fructose, and you will know why General Mills is so eager to keep you in the dark.\n\nCRA explains:\n\n“A third product, HFCS-90, is sometimes used in natural and ‘light’ foods, where very little is needed to provide sweetness. Syrups with 90% fructose will not state high fructose corn syrup on the label [anymore], they will state ‘fructose’ or ‘fructose syrup’.”\n\nAnd the way that they get away with this is fairly simple:\n\n“Simply eliminating the high fructose corn syrup designation for the laboratory sweetener that’s nine-tenths fructose and calling it what it really is: fructose. And that’s how a processed-food product like Vanilla Chex that contains “fructose”, a substance that, according to the corn refiners, used to be called HFCS-90, can now declare itself to be high fructose corn syrup-free.”",
  "latent_28577": "METAIRIE, La. -- Finally, Saints coach Sean Payton gets to do what he loves the most.\n\nNearly 19 months after he coached his last game, Payton will be back on the sideline when New Orleans plays the Kansas City Chiefs in an exhibition opener Friday night at the Superdome.\n\nIt won't come close to matching the intensity of his last game, a pulsating, excruciating 36-32 loss at San Francisco in the divisional round of the 2011 playoffs. But the dome should be rocking for his return from an unprecedented year-long suspension for his role in the bounty scandal.\n\n\"Just getting back to being out on the field in practice and having a chance to coach in a regular game, that part of it is exciting,\" Payton said. \"The fans have been great. They get excited about our team, especially at the start of the season after everything that went on a year ago. I know our players are excited to play.\"\n\nMuch has changed since Payton walked off the field at Candlestick Park on Jan. 14, 2012, ruing a heartbreaking end to the Saints' season. In a game with four lead changes in the last 4:02, the 49ers won on a 14-yard touchdown reception with 9 seconds left. New Orleans, which was 9-0 at home, would have played host to the New York Giants in the NFC Championship Game the following week.\n\nWithout Payton, the Saints slipped to 7-9 last year, losing their first four games en route to their first sub-.500 season since 2007. After setting an NFL record for most yards gained in 2011, New Orleans shattered the mark for most yards allowed in 2012.\n\nThen-defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, hired by Payton before his suspension, was fired and replaced by Rob Ryan. The Saints have changed to a 3-4 alignment from a 4-3.\n\nDrew Brees, who threw for an NFL-record 5,476 yards in 2011, tied the NFL high with 19 interceptions in 2012.\n\nChiefs quarterback Chase Daniel, slated to play the second quarter after spending the last three years with the Saints as Brees' backup, had an inside view of the New Orleans locker room without Payton.\n\n\"It was one of the toughest years professionally in my short career that I've been through,\" Daniel said. \"It's hard when you lose your rock and your head coach like Sean Payton is down there. I think Drew put a little extra pressure on himself to fill the player and the head coach void. \"\n\nDaniel knows it will not be the normal preseason atmosphere at the dome.\n\n\"Well, I talked to the ticket guy a couple days ago, and it's sold out,\" he said. \"It's Sean Payton's first game really in like two years. The New Orleans fans love their football and it doesn't matter if it's preseason, offseason, Super Bowl, regular season. They're going to be out in full force, and it's going to be loud.\"\n\nPayton's last game in the Superdome was a 45-28 win against Detroit on Jan. 7, 2012 in the NFC wild-card round. He will call plays for the first time since Nov. 6, 2011, when he tore his left MCL and broke his leg in a sideline collision during a game at Tampa Bay. He gave up the play calling to offensive coordinator Pete Carmichael for the rest of 2011, but has reclaimed that duty.\n\nPayton played down his emotions a bit Thursday, but his players anticipate a raucous atmosphere.\n\n\"It's going to be live,\" safety Malcolm Jenkins said. \"It's loud every time we go into the dome, and with Sean's return and just the anticipation that seems to be buzzing around this season, everyone is going to be very excited.\"\n\nNOTES: Payton said the starters would play 14 to 16 snaps.

  "latent_28599": "This afternoon, at the end of an energetic news conference re-introducing a bill that would require employers to give workers more advance notice of their schedules, a reporter asked an obvious question: Why do you think this has any more chance of passing a Republican-led Congress this year than it did when you introduced it last year?\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren could have brushed it off with a blithely confident statement. Instead, perhaps tired of hearing this kind of thing, she wanted to make a larger point.\n\n\"Let me say a word on that,\" she said, stepping up to the podium. \"It is hard. I understand. And our party is not in the majority. But you don’t get what you don’t fight for. And that’s what this is about.\" Warren warmed to her oratory, which might as well be the Democrats' anthem this term.\n\n\"It takes sometimes one try, sometimes it takes four, sometimes it takes six. I don’t know how many tries it will take,\" she said. \"But I know that people in this room and people across the country who need these changes will unite with one voice. We are not going to get change from a bunch of senators and congresspeople just talking to each other. It’s going to happen because enough people are gonna say 'it’s fair, come on!' That’s how we move forward,\" she said, to cheers from the friendly crowd.\n\nAs Congress has been unable to agree on much over the past few years, that's increasingly the progressive model for getting things done: Introduce token federal legislation, while pushing corporations to act on their own to improve practices. That lessens business opposition down the road when new laws are eventually proposed, first on the local level, until it works, finally, in Congress.\n\nThat's why the sponsors of the Schedules that Work Act didn't seem shy about admitting that its chances were basically nil this time around.\n\n\"This is about changing laws, but this is also about changing practices, calling out the worst actors, insisting that they do better,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) \"We will win eventually here in Washington, but we will win on the march there, too.\"\n\nThat's how it went with gay rights -- the Employment Non-Discrimination Act had been introduced almost every session since 1994, failing again and again, while companies introduced their own protections for LGBT employees and some states started to require them. Now, after the sweeping shift on gay marriage from the Supreme Court, Democrats are going for a much more ambitious legislative approach that would ban discrimination against gay people everywhere.\n\nAnd that's certainly how things appear to be working with the minimum wage and paid leave. While bills languish in Congress, mostly not even making it out of committee, big corporations have been raising their minimum wages and introducing paid leave policies on their own, basking briefly in the glow of public approval. States and cities are moving to mandate those changes for everyone else, as well, with a push from unions and advocacy groups.\n\nOn stable schedules, the main action is also in localities, while corporations like Wal-Mart and the Gap experiment with tech-savvy ways to give their employees more control over when and how much they work. Ultimately, they may find that a law requiring them to do so isn't so objectionable after all. (It's worth noting that lawmakers also sometimes introduce bills that won't pass simply to curry favor with donors, since they can at least say they tried.)\n\nFor Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), it's about pushing a package of reforms that adapt to how the relationships between workers and their employers have evolved.\n\n\"The world has changed. For the new people who are growing up, the protections that were once built into the workplace by just the way the workplace worked, by unions, are gone. So we have to change things,\" Schumer said. \"This is not only an important piece of legislation that I’m proud to co-sponsor, but it’s a very important step that we as Democrats who care about the middle class realize that new kinds of protections, new kinds of thinking are needed.\"\n\nAnd there are some signs of progress on this one. Last year's bill had only five Senate co-sponsors, while this one has 18 right out of the gate. A bill in the next term might also have a powerful ally in the White House: Hillary Clinton, who called out fair scheduling in her big economic speech earlier this week.",

  "latent_28956": "Scum Developer(s) Developer Gamepires\n\nCroteam Publisher(s) Devolver Digital Director(s) Tomislav Pongrac\n\nRoman Ribaric Platform(s) PC (Steam) Latest release date August 28, 2018 Genre(s) Open world survival Rating(s) 18+ Rating\n\nScum (aka SCUM) evolves the multiplayer open world survival game with high levels of character customization, control, and progression where knowledge and skills are the ultimate weapons for long-term survival. Players balance base level needs with knowledge-based skills to manage everything from nourishment, metabolic rate, and body mass to weapons proficiency, combat style, and security systems hacking. They dominate the island with their skills, cunning, and strategies to achieve higher levels of the game and receive powerful gifts from corporate sponsors and if they happen to slip up and die, get resurrected by the show’s producers with all their valuable skills still intact.\n\nContents show]\n\nStory Edit\n\nNot too distant future Edit\n\nIt is the time of a new world order. Large private corporations have obtained absolute control over the world and its resources. Countries and governments are merely pawns controlled by money and corporate interests. The whole world has united under the reign of greed for profit. In human history, there has never been a greater gap between the rich and the poor, between the elite and the rest everyone has been enslaved, turned into mere tools for creating more money for that 1% of the population, the privileged ones who regard themselves as the rulers of the Earth.\n\nMost of the population refuses to accept this state of affairs. The repressive police and military forces have been keeping things under control but more and more people are starting to oppose the rulers, openly showing their disobedience and calling for justice. Labeled as criminals/terrorists, they are transported to privately-owned correctional facilities. Once locked away, they rarely live long enough to come out alive. In addition, the few who somehow manage to survive the prison terms, usually develop serious mental disorders and die quickly upon the release, being unable to adapt back into society. There are even rumors about illegal experiments conducted on the prisoners; as has been proven so far, these remain only unjustified claims.\n\nReality TV Edit\n\nThe elite want to keep things under control and retain the existing situation at all costs. Although the death penalty, for instance, is even declared for lesser crimes, this doesn’t help much. Finally, the proposition by TEC1, a global broadcasting company, is accepted and Project “Island” is launched. The solution it offers is very simple: instead of oppressing people even more, a special TV reality show will be created and broadcast 24/7–as long as people are entertained, they will forget about the real problems! It’s a concept that has proven itself effective many times before and so it happens again!\n\nFor the purposes of the show, the whole island is transformed into a heavily secured location. Throughout the area broadcasting equipment is installed and the island is then populated by modern-age gladiators, i.e. prisoners sentenced to death. All former residents are moved to other locations and those who don’t want to leave are simply left to die. Prisoners themselves are parachuted from the sky in small groups and left to build their own violent society.\n\nAlthough the island’s perimeters are heavily guarded, many try to escape however, there is no official confirmation that anyone has succeeded in their attempt. On the other hand, rumor has it that there are a few successful escapes during the first season of the show and that a secret alliance called ‘Renegades’ has been formed by ex-cons to fight the oppression. So far, the government has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of ‘Renegades’ resistance movement.\n\nBody Control Implants Edit\n\nFor the purposes of the show, the convicts have bio control units (BCU-2) implanted in them, which connect directly to their spinal cord. BCU-2s are the very first mass-produced bioengineered AI units capable of controlling any kind of living organism. The BCU-1 was originally used for medical purposes only: to keep the brain-damaged patients alive by inducing a coma and stimulating their life functions until the patients get better. However, an upgraded version of the unit was then produced for the industrial and military purposes. This upgraded version, the so-called BCU-2, is a radio-controlled unit with more options and it could replace all the subject’s basic brain functions. What this means is that once the real brain dies, the company could easily take over the subject’s body and control it by a simple programming code injected into the BCU-2 unit.\n\nThe common practice of BCU-2 usage is to take control over the body when the subject dies. In this case, the BCU-2 starts to activate all subroutines and it takes a few minutes for the unit to resume all bodily functions. Once this happens, the corpse is reanimated and is thus brought back to life. To stay operational, the unit has to ensure a sufficient energy flow by food consumption. The subjects controlled by BCU-2 unit are programmed to attack the living convicts and they feed off their flesh until the victim dies and becomes controlled as well. All BCU-2 units are capable of intercommunication via shortwave radio signals within the range of 250m. Depending on the programming, BCU-2 units can perform various bodily actions such as walking, running, jumping, climbing and grasping. To a certain extent, they can even coordinate the limbs to perform complex actions such as wielding a weapon or throwing a rock. If the unit is fully charged, it may stimulate the body to move faster than a normal human being does, but as its energy runs out, the controlled subjects are slowed down and experience only occasional energy bursts. These subjects are also known as ‘puppets’, ‘spooks’, ’biters’, ‘walkers’, ‘pawns’, ‘roamers’ or ’runners’.\n\nThe BCU-2 is capable of broadcasting footage directly from the subject’s eyes and this feature has become extremely popular among the viewers. To be able to experience the very last moments seen by a dying man is an instant hit on television and has helped TEC1 to take reality TV to the next level. The software that controls BCU-2 units can be upgraded from the TEC1 network servers in real-time. There are rumors about new software upgrades allowing pay2move service, which enables the viewers to control their own ‘puppets’ during the live show broadcast.\n\nAll BCU-2 units are equipped with a locator and a small explosive charge which activates if an attempt to remove the device has been made. It is not completely impossible to remove it; yet, the removal process requires surgery and some knowledge in electronics. It is also recommended that it’s carried out during general anesthesia. Also, BCU-2 units can be jammed and disabled for some time or permanently. For both options, additional hardware and software may be required. Jamming devices can limit or cut off the communication between the implant and master server by generating white noise. Using jammers for longer periods of time may result in the activation of the self-destruct subroutine within the BCU. Once it is activated, the convicts have a limited time to restore the BCU’s connection with the master server. When the connection is restored, the self-destruct sequence is turned off. To disable the implant, the BCU has to be reprogrammed to simulate correspondence with the master server. This is done with a device capable of making the connection with the BCU and certain software that acts as an upgrade. Before disabling the unit, it is necessary to cut off its connections with the master server; otherwise, the unit will detect an unauthorized access and trigger the self-destruct sequence.\n\nAll the ‘puppets’ can be terminated only if their BCU is destroyed or removed. The implants can be manually torn off of the back of the neck or smashed by striking with them with a hard object. Once the units have been destroyed or removed, the self-destruct sequence will initiate (announced by a Beeping sound) and after 30 seconds, the explosive charge will be activated.\n\nThe Name Of The Game Edit\n\nThe convicts are transferred to the island by air. Before the departure, they are allowed to take a few items with them. They can select them from the list of offered items: these can serve for defense (Knife, brass knuckles, pepper spray, hand Axe, etc. ), survival (pocket Swiss knife, compass, flashlight, map, lighter, matches, survival guide, fishing gear, etc..), protection (bug repellents, small first aid kit, bandages, antiseptic wipes, alcohol, butterfly closure strips,...) or they can comprise plain food and water ratios (Military MRE, 0.5l bottle of water, canned food). The newcomers are dressed in standard prison jumpsuits of orange color and provided with parachutes. Once they are delivered to the drop location, they are pushed out of the plane. Most manage to open the parachute and survive the fall. It is not uncommon that the prisoners on the island wait and kill the newcomers when they are in the air, looting their bodies upon landing. It is recommended to activate the parachutes as late as possible to buy some time for an escape out of the drop location. Except for the convicts, the planes also drop supplies for the prisoners on the ground. These can contain anything from food, weapons, ammunition to clothes and gadgets. Sometimes fake booby-trapped supplies are dropped, too. The dropped supplies are regarded as hot zones because they attract gangs of prisoners, who fight among themselves for the dropped cargo.\n\nOnce they are on the ground, the convicts are free to do whatever they want to in order to survive – there are no strict rules. Most of them do get killed in the first 24 hours anyway. The rest, those that manage to survive, have a chance to achieve the celebrity status and become as popular as movie stars. The celebrity status might provide them with additional sponsored items that are dropped in the vicinity of their locations. However, the same status may prove to be dangerous – being loved by viewers is a good thing; still, gaining too much popularity will put a price on your head! The easiest way to get attention and gain popularity is to kill a celebrity. Popularity points (achievements) are somewhat proportional to the time of survival on the island. More kills usually means more popularity points, but sometimes the plain survival and escape from difficult situations could bring even more points. It is not unusual for the audience to identify with the positive characters’ suffering and struggle.\n\nAlthough extremes always attract the viewers’ attention, positive characters rarely stay alive long enough. In the first season of the show, a few exceptionally positive characters grouped up to survive. Eventually, the group became larger, influential and strong enough to start reorganizing chaos into a well-balanced society. Soon enough, the audience started to regard them as heroes and hope arised among the common people, followed by an increase in disobedience towards the government and the ruling elite. As canceling the show would make people even angrier, the producers decide to provide positive characters with tougher challenges and several new deadly scenarios are staged in an attempt to eliminate the leaders of the group, who always miraculously manage to survive. The ratings went up and the whole world starts watching the show. It all ends with the leaders of the group disappearing at the end of the first season while engaging in conflict with the hunters (a mercenary squad dropped onto the island to hunt and kill prisoners for trophies). Apparently, their bodies completely disintegrated after an explosion – that’s what the producers claim. This grand finale episode breaks all the ratings; supposedly, over 70% of population watched the end of the first season. Thus, “The Island” becomes the most successful show in the history of television. The story doesn’t end here – a few weeks after the first season has ended, the first activities of ‘Renegade’ resistance movement are recorded. Allegedly, the lead characters have survived, removed their implants and managed to get off the island. The rest of their allies break into smaller groups and the affairs on the island soon gravitate towards the initial chaotic state.\n\nThe newcomers have to secure the bare necessities first, which means that they have to search for food, water and clothes. However functional they may be, orange prison jumpsuits are easy to spot from a distance and one of the rules of survival is to blend with surroundings as much as possible. Nobody wants to be a target. There are plenty of things lying around the island, waiting to be found. Items can be obtained from puppets or from other players too, but usually they will be reluctant to give their possessions away. Every encounter can be potentially lethal and it is desirable to be very careful when other convicts or puppets are encountered. Other than that, the convicts can form clans, gather supplies together but it is always a good thing not to trust anybody because friends on the island are as frequent as tooth fairies. Once per day, the top five most popular convicts are projected by BCU implants to all prisoners on the island.\n\nMore prisoners usually create a base or a stronghold once they group up and decide that they will stay on the same place for a longer time. The group has to be strong enough to be able to defend their base against all attacks, and if they succeed in doing so, they may become an influential factor in the region. On several occasions during the show, the prisoners try to establish their communities and some of them even last for longer periods. Unfortunately, no group manages to survive for the duration of the whole season, mostly because of the conflicts among the existing factions.\n\nEncounters Edit\n\nAlmost during the whole first season of the show, there are no other scenarios than capturing life or death situations between prisoners and puppets. Occasional encounters with wild animals or former island residents are presented as well, but it’s only at the end of the first season that the producers decide to spice things up with custom-based scenarios. The main reason for interfering in the lives of the prisoners on the island is to keep under control the faction that threatens to take over the island. A special tactics group is deployed directly at the HQ. The audience welcomes this outer interference and for the next season, the producers arrange several scenarios to pump up the tensions on the island.\n\nFirstly, the puppets are upgraded with a new kind of software and become capable of performing more actions – group movement and action. Now it’s possible to carry out a large-scale attack on a certain area, or route a horde of puppets to roam in certain directions. These hordes then serve as moving walls that can block or redirect the prisoners’ movements, even split large groups into smaller ones if necessary.\n\nFor the purposes of the show, the producers also arrange the control over the weather conditions. Most of the time they leave it as it is, but sometimes, when it’s necessary for the atmosphere, they change the ambiance setting by pulling on clouds and starting storms.\n\nLarge-scale disasters such as forest fires, earthquakes and floods can be initiated at will. Even genetically modified pests (Mosquitoes, Killer bees) can be released on certain areas– upon request.\n\nCompanies have invested large sums of money on bio-engineering; years of research and development have been spent to create special animal breeds for military purposes and attacks. These animals wear implants with the last generation of BCUs, have a natural body armor, some of them even possess Bioweapons, while others are genetically modified crossbreeds. It is not unusual for these species to be tested on the island. Company would drop a few of those creatures on a certain area and leave them to cause havoc until they are dead. Each generation of these bio-animals gets improved until the perfect killer is created.\n\nIn the second season, Company will introduce special hunting session episodes featuring viewers as participants of the show. Some of them are rich citizens and others are picked as lottery winners. They are deployed on the island for a limited period 1-3 days and left there to hunt for the prisoners. The hunters with high scores are given wealthy rewards, usually money or stocks, but most of them are there for fun and glory. Their goal is to track down popular convicts and kill them. The more popular victims will assure more praise from the audience. All the hunters choose their weapons and armor. They are usually heavily equipped but that does not guarantee that they will get out of the island alive. Actually, the mortality rate among them is high among because most of them come to the island unprepared. Also, the convicts see in them a fantastic opportunity to get hold of weapons, armor and other tech toys. It is not unusual that the convicts turn the tables and hunt the hunters down to get their goodies. And guess what? That is what the viewers like the best! Once their deployment time runs out, the hunters have to pick a zone where some sort of transportation awaits them. If they miss their ride, they remain on the island until the next group of hunters is deployed.\n\nOn several occasions, special military squads can be deployed on the island. The purpose of their deployment is to destabilize larger and organized groups of prisoners or to eliminate popular convicts who pose a threat to national security. These black ops are usually hidden from the TV cameras. The last known black op happens during the second season and is a rescue mission for the survivors of the flight MB324, the plane that crashes on the island. Apparently, the producers have deliberately crashed the plane to boost the number of viewers.\n\nThe Island Edit\n\nThe island has been selected for several reasons: it is located on a remote location, far away from the usual sea traffic routes. Before “The Island” project, the island has a population of 200K people. There are several smaller cities, many small settlements and villages, farms, an airport, a military base, several industrial areas and a prison facility, of course. It’s a green island with a Mediterranean climate: the forests and fields are full of wildlife and it’s a pleasant place to live. Its coastal area is dotted with nice beaches, hotels and holiday resorts, while its central part is mountainous, with thick vegetation and snow-covered mountains throughout the whole year.\n\nSo what is the deal here? Well, nothing too complicated: where there is money, there is a way! Aided by the local government, corporations start to lay off residents with the excuse that business is going bad. Without jobs and a steady income, everyone turns to the black market, which is controlled by the same people. Crime and violence escalate along with criminal activities. The police and military start patrolling the streets and a dusk-to-dawn curfew is imposed. Still, these security forces do not provide any sort of protection; instead, they continue to oppress people regardless of whether they are obedient or disobedient. Then, as if this wasn’t bad enough, an “accident” occurs at the chemical plant, which results in toxic materials spreading via air and water. This then leads to an epidemic and soon people are dropping dead like flies! Quarantine zones are created and all the sick and infected are successfully “neutralized”. The rest of the survivors are offered small settlement fees if they agree to relocate from the island, because the government has to carry out a detailed inspection. The smart ones accept this and leave, while the rest simply disappear in the systematic cleansing operation that follows. Once the alleged decontamination is finished, the government declares that everything is safe but that the former residents (the few thousands who have left the island and are still alive) are not interested in returning to their homes. TEC1 Global Networks rents out the island and a few months later “The Island” reality show is announced. Soon after the show starts, the ill faith of the island and its residents is quickly forgotten.\n\nImages Edit",
  "latent_29041": "Before last week, I'd never met a doomsday prepper in person. My entire knowledge of them was culled from stuff like Tremors, Louis Theroux documentaries and that one show on National Geographic where the guy cried.\n\nI'd learned that preppers are, without exception, a bunch of fat racists playing with guns in the woods and throwing money down the drain to buy underground shelters and dehydrated foods to survive an event that's never going to happen. Also, probably, they have at some point posted in the same internet forums as someone who went on to be a spree killer.\n\nLast weekend, I attended the Arizona Survivalist/Prepper Expo in Prescott Valley, Arizona – an event featuring more than 75 vendors selling everything to get you \"prepared and ready for any natural, man-made or economic disaster\".\n\nEntry was $10 (£6), which also got me a pocket-size copy of the Constitution of the United States for me to keep on my person at all times.\n\nStalls sold pretty much everything you'd expect to need to survive any kind of apocalypse scenario. Everything from live rabbits (\"the other other white meat\") to women's jewellery that doubles up as firelighters. Other stalls sold things that I'm not totally sure would be neccesary in a survival situation – like acupuncture needles and ear plugs – but people seemed interested in them nonetheless.\n\nAs I went from stall to stall, I asked people what they thought was going to happen in the future that might lead to them requiring all this stuff.\n\nPeople were, without exception, very defensive when I asked them this.\n\nI suppose for anyone who belongs to a group that is universally LOL'd at, being defensive becomes a way of life. They were very keen to point out that they were buying this shit because it's best to be prepared, not because they think the world is going to end next week.\n\nWhat they felt they needed to prepare for varied. People told me they were worried about socialism, about terrorists, about earthquakes and hurricanes, about Obama taking away their guns. The only common factor was a strong desire to point out to me that they weren't insane.\n\nIt was while I was chatting to two men who run an emergency broadcasting network that I got to thinking about how massively unprepared I am to deal with a crisis.\n\nThey began to ask me questions about what I would do in an emergency. \"And I don't mean the apocalypse,\" one of the men said. \"We deal with personal disasters every day. What would you do in an earthquake? What would you do if you lost your job? What would you do if your house burned down?\"\n\nLike most people, when I'm watching The Walking Dead or playing Fallout I like to imagine I'd fare pretty well in an apocalypse scenario. This is, however, quite obviously bullshit.\n\nIn my apartment, I have maybe, like, three things that would come in handy in a survival situation: a box of Cliff Bars, a promotional Nalgene bottle and a knife that I bought because it looks cool. I also live in a major city. If something big were to go down, it would take about 20 minutes for me to get robbed to death.\n\nEven at the lower end of disasters, like getting fired or my apartment flooding, I would be fucked. I could last maybe a week on my box of Cliff Bars, but then I would have no choice but to go find somewhere to quietly die.\n\nLike you, I have been pampered and privileged by the modern world. And it's not like it's completely out of the question that I will be in a survival situation some day.\n\nAmerica is a scary place, one that's always doing something to try to kill its inhabitants. There are earthquakes and hurricanes and mass shootings and mudslides and SWAT raids over weed. On my daily drive to work, I pass tsunami warning signs and buildings that had to be rebuilt after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. That's not to say that I'm 100 percent sure I will one day be in some sort of post-apocalyptic Mad Max survival battle, but I doubt the residents of the Ninth Ward ever seriously thought they might one day have to swim out of their attic windows, either.\n\nBriefly, I toyed with the idea of becoming more prepared, which wouldn't be easy. Surviving disasters that might not ever happen is expensive business. As the threat could come from anything from ice storms to wildfires, there's a lot to stock up on. A basic survival pack costs $300 (£170). Modifying your windows to become unbreakable costs $100 (£60) per window. Body armor is $195 (£120). A non-electrical torch is $20 (£12). Etc., etc., etc.\n\nI got talking to a woman who was working at a stall selling water purifiers and camping stoves, and I asked her if she thought she was going to require any of the stuff she was selling in her lifetime. She told me, \"I don't know. But If there was an apocalypse, I'd be running for the flash. I don't wanna be a cockroach.\"\n\nAnd she has a point. Why would you want to survive the apocalypse?\n\nEven though there was everything you could possibly need to make it after the world ends (up to and including DIY gunshot-treatment kits, Hello Kitty-branded knives and a terrifying-looking concoction called \"Worm Wine\"), there was not one single form of post-apocalyptic entertainment on sale. No card games, no books, no portable DVD players. Nothing.\n\nI don't know what to do with myself in the ten minutes I don't have a phone signal on the subway. I once hiked ten miles to get to a Wi-Fi signal. I can't imagine spending the rest of my life solely surviving, living in an underground box, with nothing to do but stare at the wall and shit in bags to save as fertiliser.\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who is too pampered by the modern world for survival to be an appealing option. I counted four people at the expo rolling around on Rascal scooters. I can't imagine all the guns and solar panels in the world are gonna save you in a The Road–type situation if you need a scooter to get you around an air-conditioned expo hall.\n\nI intend to get just as much as I need to survive a small-scale disaster, but not enough to survive the apocalypse. Fuck surviving the apocalypse. Maybe I'll buy a couple of extra boxes of Cliff Bars, IDK.\n\n@jlct",

  "latent_29439": "This article is over 7 years old\n\nGovernment to review live exports after graphic footage of Australian cattle slaughtered inhumanely shown on TV\n\nThe Australian government has suspended live cattle exports to 11 Indonesian abattoirs and announced a review of the A$320m (£270m) trade after graphic footage was broadcast of Australian cattle being slaughtered inhumanely. Agriculture minister Joe Ludwig warned that more slaughter houses could be added to the banned list.\n\n\"I will appoint an independent reviewer to investigate the complete supply chain for live exports up to and including the point of slaughter,\" Ludwig said.\n\nIndonesian officials could not immediately be reached for response.\n\nWhile Australian abattoirs render cattle unconscious with stun guns before killing them, most in Indonesia follow the Islamic method of cutting the throats of conscious animals. The ABC programme Four Corners showed steers being whipped and taking minutes to bleed to death after their throats were cut.\n\nThe 11 abattoirs in Jakarta, Bogor, Bandar Lampung and Medan were selected at random in March and video was recorded by Lyn White, a former police officer and campaign director of the animal welfare group Animals Australia.\n\n\"We just stopped on the side of the road and asked people where their local abattoir was, it's as simple as that,\" White said.\n\nShe did not expect the government investigation would find conditions any more humane at the vast majority of other Indonesians abattoirs.\n\n\"There's about 770 (abattoirs) in Indonesia and only five stun, so only five would have remotely acceptable standards,\" White said.\n\nAnimals Australia and the Australian Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) want the live cattle trade banned on cruelty grounds. Both co-operated with Australian Broadcasting Corporaton to produce the gruesome television programme screened nationally on Monday night.\n\nRSPCA chief scientist Bidda Jones, who analysed the video slaughter of 50 cattle, said the slaughtermen used on average 11 cuts to the throat to kill each animal, and as many as 33. The Australian standard was death within 30 seconds.\n\n\"They basically hack the heads off with blunt knifes, causing a lot of distress and pain,\" Jones said.\n\nLudwig described the images as \"shocking in the extreme\".\n\nCharles Armstrong, president of the Farmers' Association in New South Wales, which represents many Australian cattle ranchers, labelled the Indonesian practices as \"horrific cruelty\".\n\nSome key Greens party and independent lawmakers, whose support is crucial to the Labor party government, as well as some government lawmakers, are calling for the trade with Indonesia to be suspended or terminated.\n\nForeign minister Kevin Rudd told government colleagues at a meeting on Tuesday that the trade suspensions with individual abattoirs would not harm Australia's \"strong and robust relationship\" with Indonesia.\n\nTwo government lawmakers, Janelle Saffin and Kelvin Thomson, proposed banning all live exports to Indonesia until abattoir standards were improved. Their proposal will be discussed by government colleagues at their next party meeting on 14 June.\n\n\"There was a very strong view among caucus members ... that action had to occur,\" a spokesman for the meeting told reporters.\n\nThe video showed abattoir workers break a bull's tail and repeatedly gouge its eyes and nostrils in failed attempts to get the animal to regain its feet, despite a broken leg.\n\nAt an abattoir in Medan in north Sumatra, cattle are seen tied and trembling as they watch other cattle slaughtered and skinned in front of them.\n\nBefore the government suspensions, Australian industry body LiveCorp had responded to the footage by suspending trade with three of the abattoirs featured and had sent trainers to a fourth.\n\n\"While we face many challenges in improving animal welfare in a developing country, we've made major progress during the past decade,\" LiveCorp chief executive Cameron Hall said.",
  "latent_29588": "Opinion: Policy should be informed by evidence instead of fake facts, but when is this going to be the case for the science of Applied Behaviour Analysis in Ireland and the UK?\n\nBy Professor Mickey Keenan, Ulster University and Professor Karola Dillenburger, Queen’s University Belfast\n\n\"It’s heart breaking for any parent to see their child struggle and I was left feeling that I let my son down as I couldn’t get him the help that he needs. For 10 years, I struggled to get my son an official diagnosis of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), which eventually happened in April 2017.\n\n\"I was referred to a leading charity for autism in Northern Ireland, but no mention was made of ABA (Applied Behaviour Analysis). This was unusual, I thought, because from my own research I found that the science of ABA could help overcome the difficulties of everyday life that hinder him socially, emotionally and mentally.\n\n\"We rely so much as parents on advice given by professionals. But how can we make the best decisions for our children when we are not given appropriate information. Again, I was left feeling very hopeless and alone. I was denied my rights as a parent to avail of a service/therapy that has been shown to be effective for helping children.\" (Letter from a parent)\n\nFrom RTÉ Rearing to Go, Taragh Loughrey-Grant talks to Grainne McGuinness, creator of Pablo a new RTÉjr series which explores the world through the eyes of a 5-year-old boy with autism, and Jake who is the voice of Pablo\n\nBefore you hear from another parent below, here is some context to understand just how extraordinary it is that ABA-based interventions are not actively promoted in Ireland and the UK. In the United States, where the science of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) was developed, 45 states, as well as the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands, have introduced legislation to ensure that those affected by autism have access to ABA-based interventions. This means that it was concluded that there was sufficient scientific evidence to warrant the creation of new laws to ensure access to ABA-based services on 47 separate occasions.\n\nSo, why does this evidence have little or no impact on policy decisions here? Part of the problem is that there are very few courses that train students in ABA to international standards in Europe. When training is limited, misunderstandings grow\n\nWe have all heard about the problems with fake news and fake facts have been a problem in some very prominent discussions about ABA, as well as in some government-sponsored reports (see the DENI report from 2002 or this piece by the co-author). Another example of the ostrich’s head well and truly stuck in the sand can be found in the recent review by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that dismissed ABA altogether.\n\nIt is easy to misrepresent a science that one is not trained in and that is why international standards of training are developed\n\nUsing particular methods that are recognised as providing the gold standard when assessing the effectiveness of interventions -i.e. Randomised Control Trials (RCTs) - they could not find supporting evidence for ABA. However, it is not appropriate to assess a scientific discipline using these methods. Indeed, you will not find any RCTs for any discipline such as medical science, physical science, speech and language therapy, psychology, etc.\n\nIt is easy to misrepresent a science that one is not trained in and that is why international standards of training are developed. An outline of the knowledge and skills developed by the internationally recognised qualification in ABA, the Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA), is available here.\n\nThere is yet another layer that compounds the problem and this is when misinformation reaches a politician. Commenting on issues that arise when politicians and scientists communicate with each other, Ken Baldwin, director of the Energy Change Institute at the Australian National University noted the following: \"science has evolved over many centuries to become an integral part of modern society, underpinning our health, wealth, and cultural fabric. Yet scientific evidence is often wilfully disregarded by politicians worldwide. They often cherrypick or ignore the science when it does not accord with their political agenda. We have seen \"alternative facts\" supplant scientific and other evidence bases in this \"post-fact\" era.\"\n\nDrawing by Tara DK\n\nIn one sense, circumstances evolve inevitably to produce a perfect storm that impacts directly on the design of policy decisions. The result is that parents often have to do their own research to get at the truth at a time when they are most under pressure. When parents eventually get help from ABA-based interventions, their stories look like this:\n\n\"My fight for ABA therapy started when my son had been placed in SEN school for two years and still hadn’t made any progress. He was non-verbal, head-banging, violently aggressive, smearing faeces around the bedroom most nights and was violently aggressive. He stopped waving bye-bye at 10-months old and couldn’t imitate. My partner and I were desperate so we put him in an ABA school and the progress was astounding. I’ve kept a diary about his progress from when he first started ABA therapy and looking back you see how powerful ABA therapy really is. Within two weeks, aggressive behaviour was down to a minimum level. Within a month, he waved bye for the first time. After two months, he was sitting on the potty independently and making sounds because he was in the early progress of learning to talk, also using head gestures for ‘yes’ and ‘no’. The list goes on and on.\"\n\nPolicy should be informed by evidence instead of fake facts\n\nUnless the Ostrich lifts its head out of the sand to see what it has been missing, it will not see the damage inflicted on vulnerable families. Of course, parents can bypass the ostrich and get trained in ABA themselves, with platforms like Simple Steps or STAMPPP, but that is simply not good enough.\n\nPolicy should be informed by evidence instead of fake facts, but who is going to help the ostrich lift its head out of the sand? Who is going to encourage it to scrutinise the evidence before each of those 45 US states to see why they concluded that there was sufficient support to enact new laws? Who is going to help it be brave enough to challenge the generally accepted notion of ABA being \"controversial\" and instead advance the argument that it is \"not doing ABA that is controversial\". Who is going to investigate those vested interests who have consigned parents and their children to a lifetime of worry and concern, simply because they cannot acknowledge that they got it wrong when they dismissed ABA?\n\nMickey Keenan is Professor of Behaviour Analysis at the School of Psychology, Ulster University Professor Karola Dillenburger is director of the Centre for Behaviour Analysis at Queen’s University Belfast.\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the author and do not represent or reflect the views of RTÉ",
  "latent_29714": "Uridine's rise and fall: Food for thought The nucleoside uridine is well known for its role in critical cellular functions such as nucleic acid synthesis. Its role in whole-animal physiology has received comparatively little attention. In mammals, plasma uridine levels are tightly regulated, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Studying mouse models, Deng et al. show that plasma uridine levels are controlled by feeding behavior (see the Perspective by Jastroch and Tschöp). Fasting causes an adipocyte-mediated rise in plasma uridine, which triggers a lowering of body temperature. Feeding causes a bile-mediated drop in plasma uridine, which enhances insulin sensitivity in a leptin-dependent manner. Thus, uridine is part of a complex regulatory loop that affects energy balance and potentially contributes to metabolic disease. Science, this issue p. aaf5375; see also p. 1124\n\nStructured Abstract INTRODUCTION Uridine is a pyrimidine nucleoside that is critical for cellular function and survival. In addition to its role in RNA and DNA biosynthesis, uridine is required for glycogen deposition, protein and lipid glycosylation, extracellular matrix biosynthesis, and detoxification of xenobiotics. Plasma uridine levels are maintained within a narrow range, and most cells depend on a readily available pool of uridine in plasma to maintain basic cellular functions. Enhanced understanding of the physiological mechanisms controlling biosynthesis and clearance of this metabolite has the potential to shed light on several disease states, including diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders. RATIONALE Despite its pivotal physiological role, uridine has received limited attention in comparison to other nucleosides such as adenosine. Studying rodent models, we set out to define the mechanisms regulating plasma uridine levels and to dissect the molecular circuitry whereby uridine governs energy homeostasis in normal and obese conditions. RESULTS One of our key findings is that plasma uridine levels are subject to tight regulation during feeding and fasting in both rodents and humans. Plasma uridine levels are elevated during fasting and drop rapidly in the postprandial state. We demonstrate that liver is the predominant biosynthetic organ and contributor to plasma uridine in the fed state, whereas the adipocyte dominates uridine biosynthetic activity in the fasted state. Both glucose and uridine levels must be maintained in the fasted state, not only as basic building blocks for macromolecule biosynthesis, but also as fuels for metabolically active cell types such as neurons. We find that the fasting-induced rise in uridine is tightly linked to a drop in core body temperature driven by a reduction in metabolic rate. The fasting-induced drop in body temperature, although small, is highly reproducible and seen in both rodents and humans. Plasma uridine homeostasis thus links thermoregulation to the fasting/refeeding cycle. Leptin signaling governs uridine-dependent thermoregulation such that leptin deficiency amplifies fasting-induced declines in core temperature. Conversely, prolonged exposure to a high-fat diet blunts the fasting-induced body temperature drop. We clarify the mechanism underlying the rapid reduction of plasma uridine upon refeeding, which involves both reduction of uridine synthesis in adipocytes and enhancement of its clearance through the bile. Uridine from the digestive tract has a different fate than uridine derived biosynthetically from the adipocyte in the fasted state. Adipose tissue–derived uridine increases plasma uridine concentrations, which in turn elicit a hypothalamic response culminating in body temperature lowering. In contrast, gut-derived uridine is never fully released into the circulation, but rather is rapidly resorbed into bile again and effectively reused as part of an enterohepatic recycling process. This minimizes the effects of postprandial uridine absorption, obviating an impact on temperature control in the fed state. CONCLUSION Our results show that plasma uridine concentrations in mammals are regulated by fasting/refeeding. Adipocytes are key contributors to uridine supply during fasting, whereas biliary excretion is the primary mechanism for uridine clearance following food intake. Bile-mediated uridine release promotes body temperature declines during fasting and enhances insulin sensitivity in a leptin-dependent manner. Because nutrient intake triggers bile release, our work identifies a metabolic regulatory model in which feeding behavior directly regulates plasma uridine homeostasis, which then alters energy balance through thermoregulation. A regulatory model of energy homeostasis during fasting/refeeding. The liver is the predominant biosynthetic organ and contributor to plasma uridine in the fed state, whereas the adipocyte dominates uridine biosynthetic activity in the fasted state. Biliary excretion is the primary mechanism for plasma uridine clearance. Because nutrient intake triggers bile release, plasma uridine levels are elevated during fasting and drop rapidly in the postprandial state. The fasting-associated increase of plasma uridine elicits a hypothalamic response culminating in body temperature lowering, whereas bile-mediated uridine release promotes a decline of plasma uridine and enhances insulin sensitivity.\n\nAbstract Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside present at high levels in the plasma of rodents and humans, is critical for RNA synthesis, glycogen deposition, and many other essential cellular processes. It also contributes to systemic metabolism, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that plasma uridine levels are regulated by fasting and refeeding in mice, rats, and humans. Fasting increases plasma uridine levels, and this increase relies largely on adipocytes. In contrast, refeeding reduces plasma uridine levels through biliary clearance. Elevation of plasma uridine is required for the drop in body temperature that occurs during fasting. Further, feeding-induced clearance of plasma uridine improves glucose metabolism. We also present findings that implicate leptin signaling in uridine homeostasis and consequent metabolic control and thermoregulation. Our results indicate that plasma uridine governs energy homeostasis and thermoregulation in a mechanism involving adipocyte-dependent uridine biosynthesis and leptin signaling.\n\nUridine is a uracil nucleoside that plays a critical role as a building block for RNA and DNA biosynthesis (1, 2). It also serves to generate pyrimidine-lipid and pyrimidine-sugar conjugates required for glycogen deposition, protein and lipid glycosylation, extracellular matrix biosynthesis, and detoxification of xenobiotics (1, 2). These anabolic reactions are critical for normal cellular function and survival. In addition, uridine catabolism by uridine phosphorylase may regulate events important to systemic metabolism, such as body temperature and circadian rhythm (3). Despite its important physiologic and pharmacological roles, uridine has received much less research emphasis than adenosine (3).\n\nPlasma uridine concentrations are tightly regulated in both humans and rodents, but the mechanisms underlying homeostasis of circulating uridine are unknown (2). The liver is considered the major organ controlling plasma uridine levels, mediating de novo biosynthesis within hepatocytes and uridine clearance via Kupffer cells (4, 5). The majority of plasma uridine is degraded by the liver after uptake through the portal vein. However, the processes by which the liver regulates uridine degradation, and the biological effects of this massive clearance process, have not been studied.\n\nA constant supply of circulating uridine is required for a number of biological functions (2, 6), and disruption of plasma uridine homeostasis through uridine supplementation has profound effects on systemic metabolism (7). Short-term supplementation of uridine in food improves insulin sensitivity in mice, but long-term administration causes fatty liver and promotes development of pre-diabetes. Thus, control of plasma uridine is tightly coupled to energy homeostasis.\n\nPrevious work suggests that uridine affects both body temperature and feeding behavior. For example, injection of high doses of uridine decreases body temperature in rodents (8). Co-administration of uridine and benzylacyclouridine, a compound that inhibits uridine degradation, partially prevents this temperature drop (8, 9). In addition, elevated plasma uridine can increase brain (hypothalamic) levels of uridine diphosphate (UDP), which then promotes food intake via P2Y2-dependent activation of AgRP (Agouti-related protein) neurons (10). Here, we investigated mechanisms by which feeding behavior regulates body temperature and plasma uridine levels.\n\nFasting and refeeding regulate plasma uridine concentrations Because fasting leads to a number of physiological adaptations, we set out to determine whether this process is associated with dynamic regulation of plasma uridine. In C57BL/6 mice, plasma uridine levels doubled upon 24 hours of fasting (4.96 ± 0.76 μM versus 8.89 ± 1.02 μM, P < 0.0001) and recovered to basal levels 4 hours after refeeding (3.86 ± 0.54 μM) (Fig. 1A). Rats manifested a similar elevation in plasma uridine after an overnight fast (5.61 ± 0.71 μM versus 9.74 ± 2.24 μM, P < 0.001), but the levels did not return to basal levels even 24 hours after refeeding (Fig. 1B). In healthy human subjects (table S1), a single meal following an overnight fast reduced plasma uridine levels by 40.3 ± 10.3% within 4 hours (4.63 ± 0.75 μM after overnight fast versus 1.84 ± 0.44 μM 4 hours after meal, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1C). There was no postprandial change in plasma uric acid concentrations in the human subjects (Fig. 1D), indicating that the change in plasma uridine levels that results from fasting and refeeding is unlikely to be due to generalized nucleotide catabolism. Fig. 1 Plasma uridine dynamics during fasting and refeeding. (A) Plasma uridine levels in male C57BL/6 mice in a fasting/refeeding study (n = 7). (B) Plasma uridine levels in male Sprague-Dawley rats in a fasting/refeeding study (n = 7). (C and D) Plasma uridine and uric acid levels in healthy women after subjects were fasted for ~12 hours overnight, and at regular intervals after they consumed a breakfast meal at 7 a.m. (47). Plasma uridine and uric acid levels after overnight fasting were considered as basal for each subject for statistical analysis (n = 6). Data were analyzed with paired t test. ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001; ns, not significant. Error bars denote SEM.\n\nPlasma uridine links thermoregulation to fasting and refeeding In rodents, fasting and refeeding triggers body temperature changes that allow the animal to adapt to the altered nutrient status. Previous reports show that administration of high-dose uridine (3500 mg/kg) resulted in severe hypothermia of 6° to 10°C in mice (8). To test whether uridine plays a role in thermoregulation, we injected mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) with uridine at a reduced dose (1000 mg/kg) to avoid severe hypothermia. We found that this treatment rapidly lowered body temperature [37.9° ± 0.9°C, 34.9° ± 0.7°C, and 34.0° ± 1.6°C at 0, 15, and 30 min after uridine injection, P < 0.01 compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injection]. This drop in temperature was then partially recovered within 60 min (36.0° ± 0.9°C, P < 0.01 compared to PBS injection) (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2 Plasma uridine dynamics correlates with body temperature fluctuation. (A) Body temperature was monitored in male C57BL/6 mice after intraperitoneal injection of PBS or uridine (1 g/kg) (n = 6 per group). (B) Body temperature was monitored in a fasting/refeeding study using male wild-type (WT), ob/ob, and 6 weeks HFD-fed animals (n = 6 per group). (C) Male WT and ob/ob mice fed on chow or HFD (10 weeks) were monitored for plasma uridine levels during a fasting/refeeding study (n = 6 per group). (D) PALA prevented the drop of body temperature by fasting in ob/ob mice (n = 7 per group). Statistical analysis was performed for each condition using time 0 or the fed state of that group as base line if not specified. Data in (A) to (C) were analyzed with paired t test, and data in (D) were analyzed with two-tailed Student t test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Error bars denote SEM. Obesity, a pandemic now seen throughout the world (11), displays characteristic abnormalities in thermoregulation (12). To test this in a preclinical model and to explore the potential role of leptin, we studied two animal models: leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and wild-type mice on a high-fat diet (HFD). We found that when wild-type mice fed a chow diet were fasted for 24 hours, their body temperature dropped 1.8° ± 0.5°C (n = 6, P < 0.05). However, when chow-fed leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were fasted for 24 hours, the effect was more striking: Their body temperature dropped by 7.3° ± 2.7°C (n = 6, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2B). These findings confirm that leptin-deficient mice have defects in maintaining normal body temperature (13); however, it is unclear whether this is the direct result of leptin deficiency or a general phenomenon due to obesity. To address this, we compared the body temperature response to fasting and refeeding in HFD-fed wild-type mice and HFD-fed ob/ob mice. In HFD-fed wild-type mice, the body temperature drop triggered by 24 hours of fasting (1.2° ± 0.6°C, n = 6, P < 0.01) was similar to that elicited by fasting in chow-fed wild-type mice (1.8° ± 0.5°C, n = 6, P < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). By contrast, when ob/ob mice were fed HFD for 6 weeks, their body temperature drop triggered by 24 hours of fasting was reduced to 2.3° ± 1.3°C (n = 6, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2B). Thus, although both the HFD and ob/ob mice are obese and are widely used for studies of insulin resistance, the fasting response in HFD-fed wild-type animals differs from the fasting response in ob/ob mice. Together, these data lend credence to a model in which leptin signaling participates in fasting-induced temperature declines in a manner blunted by HFD exposure. To test whether uridine participates in thermoregulation during fasting and refeeding, we analyzed plasma uridine levels in HFD-fed ob/ob and wild-type mice. We detected higher levels of plasma uridine in ob/ob mice than in wild-type mice; conversely, obese HFD-fed wild-type mice harbored plasma uridine levels comparable to those in lean chow-fed wild-type mice (Fig. 2C). Fasting further increased plasma uridine levels in ob/ob mice in the first 4 hours after food removal, but fasting had no effect on plasma uridine levels in HFD-fed wild-type mice (Fig. 2C). Upon refeeding, ob/ob mice exhibited a rapid decline in plasma uridine levels, whereas no significant changes were observed in obese HFD-fed wild-type mice (Fig. 2C). These data reveal a strong correlation between plasma uridine levels and thermoregulation and further highlight the distinct effects of HFD and leptin-deficiency on body temperature that is mediated through plasma uridine. Uridine-triggered temperature declines in rodents rely on the activity of uridine phosphorylase (8), the enzyme responsible for initiation of uridine catabolism. We hypothesized that increases in plasma uridine levels during fasting mediate the temperature drop by increasing uridine availability for degradation. To test this, we injected ob/ob mice with N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA). This compound is an inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase (14), which is the rate-limiting enzyme for uridine biosynthesis (15) and is part of the trifunctional protein Cad (carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase). In this context, PALA prevented both the drop in body temperature in ob/ob mice (Fig. 2D) and the elevation of plasma uridine after 24-hour fasting. These findings support a model in which plasma uridine levels govern core body temperature.\n\nUridine links thermoregulation with leptin Temperature exchange with the environment depends on the difference in temperature between the subject and surrounding environment and relies on three mechanisms: conduction, convection, and radiation. To examine whether the acute temperature drop triggered by uridine is mediated by temperature exchange with the environment, we housed mice in a near-thermoneutral environment (29°C), 7°C above the ambient room temperature used for the studies depicted in Fig. 2A. Wild-type mice injected with PBS showed a slight increase in body temperature after they were moved to 29°C (37.5° ± 0.24°C, 38.3° ± 0.2°C, and 38.1° ± 0.2°C at 0, 15, and 30 min, respectively; n = 6) (Fig. 3A). When mice were injected with uridine and subsequently transferred to the 29°C incubator, the temperature drop seen at ambient room temperature (Fig. 2A) was no longer observed; rather, the mice displayed a body temperature only slightly lower than that observed with the PBS injection under the same conditions (37.4° ± 0.3°C versus 38.3° ± 0.2°C at 15 min, 36.9° ± 0.4°C versus 38.1° ± 0.2°C at 30 min; n = 6, P < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). From these experiments, we conclude that the thermoregulation effects of uridine rely on temperature exchange with the ambient environment. Fig. 3 Thermoregulation effects of uridine. (A) Male C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with PBS or uridine (1 g/kg) at room temperature (22° to 25°C), then transferred to a chamber at 29°C, and monitored for their body temperature (n = 6 per group). (B to D) Injection of uridine (i.p., 1 g/kg) reduced the rates of O 2 consumption and CO 2 production, but increased RER of male C57BL/6 mice in an indirect calorimetry study (n = 5 per group). The arrows indicate the changes due to cage opening. Values of VO 2 and VCO 2 were plotted relative to the baseline measurements. (E) Body temperature was monitored in male WT and ob/ob mice after uridine i.p. injection (1 g/kg) at the indicated time point. The HFD group consisted of male WT mice fed with HFD for 15 weeks (n = 5 per group). (F) Plasma leptin levels in WT mice (HFD for 15 weeks) were measured before and after uridine i.p. injection (1 g/kg) (n = 6 per group). (G) Plasma leptin levels in WT and ob+/− mice were measured before and 15 min after uridine i.p. injection (1 g/kg) (n = 6 per group). Statistical analysis was performed for different treatments or genotypes at indicated time points if not specified. Data were analyzed with two-tailed Student t test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Error bars denote SEM. To determine whether uridine reduces heat production through effects on metabolism, we housed mice in metabolic cage units and measured O 2 consumption, CO 2 production, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER). After two baseline recordings, we injected the mice i.p. with PBS or uridine and then performed a third recording 5 min later. Because the cages had to be opened for injections, there was a sudden transient change in all parameters. Upon equilibration, the rates of O 2 consumption and CO 2 production rapidly recovered to normal levels in the vehicle group, indicating that metabolic rates were not affected. In contrast, uridine-injected mice displayed a reduced rate of recovery of O 2 consumption and CO 2 production, reflecting a suppression of the metabolic rate (Fig. 3, B and C). A reduced energy demand is another way to reduce heat production under stress conditions such as hypoxia (16). To determine whether a modulation of energy demand contributes to uridine-related thermoregulation, we measured the RER, which was increased within 1 hour after uridine injection (Fig. 3D). This increase suggests that uridine administration leads to an increase in carbohydrate consumption instead of lipid use (17). Indeed, a correlation has been established between elevated RER and lower energy demand (18). Combined, these data indicate that the uridine-induced drop in body temperature is caused by metabolic rate suppression due to lowered energetic demand. One of the major sites of leptin action is the hypothalamus (19), which is also the master regulator of core body temperature (20). To examine whether the uridine-mediated drop in body temperature involves leptin, we injected uridine intraperitoneally into ob/ob and into HFD-fed wild-type mice. In both cases, uridine caused a rapid drop in body temperature (2.9° ± 0.3°C and 4.2° ± 0.9°C, n = 3, P < 0.01, respectively, 30 min after uridine injection). However, ob/ob mice manifested a significant delay in the recovery of normal body temperature (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that the uridine-induced drop in body temperature is leptin-independent, but that leptin is required to recover body temperature after hypothermia. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed a robust increase by nearly a factor of 2 in plasma leptin levels within 30 min after uridine injection (Fig. 3F). To determine whether the change in circulating leptin derives from increased secretion or reduced clearance, we studied heterozygous ob/+ mice, which are known to harbor reduced plasma levels of leptin (21). If uridine-stimulated leptin elevation is due to impaired clearance, the response in ob/+ mice would be expected to be similar to that occurring in wild-type mice. However, we found that increases in plasma leptin were diminished in the ob/+ mice after uridine injection (Fig. 3G), which suggests that the effect of uridine on circulating leptin is likely due to increased secretion.\n\nPlasma uridine is cleared by bile The accumulation of plasma uridine upon fasting, coupled with its rapid postprandial drop, led us to examine whether bile might be involved in plasma uridine clearance, because bile excretion is increased by food intake. Indeed, we found that bile extracted from the gallbladder of wild-type mice contained uridine levels that were higher than levels present in plasma under fasting conditions by a factor of ≤8 (Fig. 4A). Moreover, bile uridine levels trended toward a decrease in fasted mice, but within 4 hours of refeeding, bile uridine concentrations increased 27% (n = 6, P < 0.05) and 100% (n = 10, P < 0.01) in male and female wild-type mice, respectively (Fig. 4B); these findings suggest that mice under refed conditions have a much higher rate of uridine flux from blood to the gallbladder than fasted mice. And consistent with changes in plasma uridine observed in HFD and ob/ob mice (Fig. 2C), bile from HFD mice harbored lower uridine content under fasted conditions (Fig. 4C). Conversely, bile isolated from ob/ob mice had higher uridine levels that declined when they were exposed to a HFD (Fig. 4D). Fig. 4 Biliary release of uridine. (A) Uridine concentrations in plasma and bile from 24 hour–fasted male C57BL/6 mice (n = 6). (B) Uridine concentration in bile from male and female C57BL/6 mice (n = 6 to 10 for each time point). (C) Biliary uridine levels in 24 hour–fasted male C57BL/6 mice fed with chow or HFD for 15 weeks (n = 6 per group). (D) Biliary uridine levels in 24 hour–fasted male WT and ob/ob mice fed with chow or HFD for 15 weeks (n = 6 per group). (E) Male C57BL/6 mice were administered with [5-3H]uridine by tail vein injection or oral gavage (gav). Plasma from tail tip and bile from gallbladder were harvested at indicated time points (n = 4 per time point). (F) Male C57BL/6 mice were administered with [3H]uridine by oral gavage. Plasma from tail tip and portal vein and bile from gallbladder were harvested 2 min after gavage (n = 6). Data were analyzed with two-tailed Student t test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Error bars denote SEM. To study the dynamics of plasma uridine under fed conditions, we injected wild-type mice with a trace amount of [3H]uridine (25 μCi) via the tail vein. Rapid turnover (half-life ~3 min) of plasma uridine has been reported in rats and dogs (22, 23), and we observed similar values in mice. Notably, we found a concomitant accumulation of [3H]uridine in bile (Fig. 4E), with levels in bile as high as those in plasma within 15 min of tail vein injection (Fig. 4E). In contrast, when [3H]uridine was gavaged orally, no significant radioactivity was detected in plasma, whereas rapid accumulation of [3H]uridine was detected within 2 min in bile (Fig. 4E). Together, these data suggest that orally supplied uridine is efficiently channeled through the liver to the gallbladder with a negligible amount of transit through the peripheral circulation. To test this further, we collected blood from the portal vein 2 min after [3H]uridine gavage. Here, we observed a significant burst of radioactivity within the portal vein, comparable to levels detected in the gallbladder, within 2 min (Fig. 4F). In contrast, radioactivity detected in plasma was less than 50% of that in bile, confirming that orally supplied uridine is efficiently channeled to the liver through the portal vein.\n\nBiliary uridine clearance improves glucose tolerance To begin to explore whether uridine plays a role in metabolism beyond thermoregulation, we examined its effect on glucose homeostasis. First, we found that oral co-administration of uridine and glucose to wild-type mice on a HFD led to significant improvements in glucose tolerance (Fig. 5A); this improvement, however, was not observed in ob/ob mice (Fig. 5B). We next tested whether parenteral administration of uridine mimics the effects of oral uridine. We injected uridine i.p. (at the same dose that induced a temperature drop) into HFD-fed wild-type mice and into ob/ob mice 15 min prior to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The HFD-fed wild-type mice also manifested a significant improvement in glucose tolerance after uridine injection (Fig. 5C). In contrast, and consistent with an active role of leptin in this process, ob/ob mice manifested deterioration in their glucose tolerance after uridine injection (Fig. 5D). Together, these results suggest that leptin is a key mediator of uridine’s effect on glucose metabolism. Fig. 5 Uridine effects on glucose metabolism. (A and B) Plasma glucose levels from male WT mice (HFD for 25 weeks) or ob/ob mice were measured in oral glucose tolerance tests with glucose or glucose-uridine solution (n = 6 per group). (C and D) Plasma glucose levels from male WT mice (HFD for 25 weeks) or ob/ob mice were measured in oral glucose tolerance tests with PBS or uridine intraperitoneal injection 15 min before glucose gavage (n = 6 per group). (E) Plasma glucose levels from male C57BL/6 mice (18 months old) were measured in oral glucose tolerance tests with glucose or glucose-uridine solution (n = 6 per group). (F) Plasma glucose levels from male C57BL/6 mice (18 months old) were measured in oral glucose tolerance tests with PBS or uridine intraperitoneal injection 15 min before glucose gavage separately (n = 6 per group). (G and H) Plasma glucose levels and body weight were measured in male C57BL/6 mice (HFD for 30 days) before and after i.p. injection with PALA or vehicle (Veh) (n = 5 per group). Statistical analysis was performed for different treatments at indicated time points if not specified. Data were analyzed with two-tailed Student t test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Error bars denote SEM. Aging is often associated with development of insulin resistance and obesity. In a study of older wild-type mice (18 months of age), we found that uridine administration markedly improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 5, E and F), which suggests that both aging-associated and HFD-associated insulin resistance can be attenuated by uridine supplementation. To explore this further, we used PALA to inhibit uridine biosynthesis (14). Prior toxicological evaluation of this compound in C57BL/6 mice revealed that a 50% lethal dose corresponds to 1587 mg/kg (24). Given this report, we studied the effect of a much lower single dose of 62.5 mg/kg. No gross abnormalities were observed after drug administration in chow-fed mice. However, PALA led to an acute elevation of plasma glucose in HFD-fed mice (Fig. 5G). Upon more prolonged monitoring of these mice, after receiving just this single dose of PALA, the mice displayed a significant loss of body weight and died within 2 weeks of treatment (Fig. 5H)—an observation not seen in the chow-fed animals. We interpret these observations with a uridine biosynthesis inhibitor to suggest that endogenous uridine synthesis is critical for both blood glucose control and survival of mice when exposed to HFD.\n\nEnteral uridine delivery does not reduce body temperature Our results indicate that enteral provision of uridine does not culminate in plasma increases in uridine (Fig. 4E) but improves glucose tolerance similar to that elicited by i.p. administration (Fig. 5C). To explore the underlying mechanisms, we first evaluated core body temperature. Here, we observed that uridine gavaged orally in HFD-fed mice elicited marginal changes in body temperature and led to temporary elevation of body temperature in ob/ob mice (Fig. 6A). This is in sharp contrast to the effects of i.p. administration of the same dose of uridine (Fig. 3E). Thus, uridine administration through an oral route did not provoke hypothermia. Further, we noted that glucose gavage did not lead to a decrease in body temperature in either HFD-fed wild-type or ob/ob mice, irrespective of co-administration of uridine (Fig. 6, B and C). This suggests that uridine-induced improvements in glucose tolerance are not mediated by thermoregulation. Fig. 6 Thermoregulation effects of enteral administration of uridine. (A) Body temperature of male WT (chow or HFD for 10 weeks) and age-matched ob/ob mice was monitored before and after oral administration of uridine (1 g/kg, n = 6 per group). (B and C) Body temperature of male WT (HFD for 10 weeks) or age-matched ob/ob mice was monitored before and after oral administration of glucose or glucose-uridine solution (n = 6 per group). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and no significant difference was detected between each group. Error bars denote SEM.\n\nAdipocytes are a key regulator for plasma uridine Our findings indicate that biliary clearance is critical for the declines in plasma uridine elicited by refeeding. We proposed that fasting-induced elevations in plasma uridine could derive from reduced biliary clearance during the fasting state. Further, the abnormal dynamics of plasma uridine observed in ob/ob and HFD-fed mice suggested that adipose tissue might participate in the elevations of plasma uridine triggered by fasting. To test this, we evaluated the impact of acute loss of adipocytes on plasma uridine levels. First, we used our previously characterized FAT-ATTAC mice, a model in which adipocytes in adult animals can be selectively eliminated by induced apoptosis (25). Three days after loss of viable adipocytes, FAT-ATTAC mice under fed conditions displayed a modest but statistically significant drop in plasma uridine levels relative to wild-type mice (8.16 ± 1.07 μM in wild type, n = 6 versus 6.34 ± 1.11 μM in FAT-ATTAC; n = 6, P = 0.016) (Fig. 7A). Upon fasting, the FAT-ATTAC mice manifested no increase in uridine levels relative to control mice (Fig. 7A). In contrast, refeeding led to similar reductions in plasma uridine concentrations in both groups. Beyond a small reduction in fat mass (0.15 ± 0.05 g in wild type, –0.39 ± 0.13 g in FAT-ATTAC), no significant changes in body weight were detected between the two groups either before or 3 days after induction of adipocyte apoptosis (fig. S1). Fig. 7 Adipocytes are critical for plasma uridine supply. (A) Plasma uridine levels in male WT and FAT-ATTAC mice in a fasting/refeeding study (n = 6 per group). (B) Relative plasma uridine levels in male WT and Agpat2 KO mice in a fasting/refeeding study (n = 4 per group). (C) qPCR quantification of genes involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis in liver from male C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 per group). (D) qPCR quantification of Cad in liver, epididymal fat (eWAT), subcutaneous fat (sWAT), and brown fat (BAT) from male C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 per group). (E) Uridine contents in subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies from metabolically healthy subjects were reduced 5 hours after breakfast (n = 6). (F to I) Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with streptozotocin (STZ) or vehicle (CTL) and monitored for plasma glucose levels and body weight up to 7 weeks. The uridine concentrations in plasma, bile, and tissues were measured from mice fasted for 24 hours (n = 5 or 6 per group). Statistical analysis was performed for each group or treatment using the fed state or CTL treatment of that group as baseline if not specified. Data were analyzed with two-tailed Student t test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Error bars denote SEM. To test this further, we studied mice selectively silenced for Agpat2 (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate-O-acyltransferase 2), a mutant line that lacks functional adipose tissue and serves as a model of congenital lipodystrophy (26). In these animals, fasting did not elicit an increase in plasma uridine levels (Fig. 7B). These data lend additional credence to a model in which adipose tissue is required for fasting-induced increases in plasma uridine. The liver is widely held to be the major organ maintaining plasma uridine supply (4). However, even though fasting triggered increases in plasma uridine, we found that the genes responsible for de novo uridine synthesis were all down-regulated by fasting in the liver (Fig. 7C). In contrast, Cad, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for uridine biosynthesis, was highly expressed in three different adipose tissue depots when examined under both fed and fasted conditions (Fig. 7D). Furthermore, the genes encoding the other two enzymes in the uridine biosynthetic pathway, Dhodh and Umps, manifested expression patterns similar to Cad (fig. S2). This suggests that adipose tissue is indeed an important site of uridine synthesis contributing to fasting-induced rises in plasma uridine. Consistent with this, biopsy specimens of subcutaneous fat from subjects depicted in Fig. 1C uniformly harbored reduced uridine content in the postprandial state (Fig. 7E). To explore further the role of adipose tissue in plasma uridine homeostasis, we studied a streptozotocin (STZ)–induced model of type 1 diabetes. As expected, STZ administration caused hyperglycemia (Fig. 7F) and a rapid loss of fat mass (fig. S3). After the initial loss of body mass, mice subsequently reached a plateau of body weight that was maintained for the subsequent 7 weeks (Fig. 7G). Under these conditions, both plasma and bile uridine levels were reduced to half the levels observed in the control vehicle-treated group (Fig. 7H). Similarly, uridine concentrations in both brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the heart were reduced (Fig. 7I). In contrast, uridine levels in livers isolated from STZ-treated mice were comparable to those in the control group (Fig. 7I), which suggests that uridine biosynthesis in the liver remains functional even in the absence of circulating insulin. However, the seemingly unaltered production of uridine in the liver is insufficient to maintain normal levels of plasma uridine under fasting conditions. Although our observations support the idea that adipose tissue plays a critical role in plasma uridine homeostasis, the inducible and constitutive loss of adipose tissue as well as lowering of systemic insulin production through the loss of β cells are associated with a multitude of metabolic changes, so the effects on uridine could be indirect. To test more specifically whether adipose tissue supplies uridine through pyrimidine biosynthesis, we generated mice selectively silenced for Cad in adipocytes. Upon 24 hours of fasting, the Cad knockout mice manifested no increase in uridine levels relative to the control group (fig. S4), which suggests that uridine biosynthesis in adipocytes is necessary for a fasting-induced increase in plasma uridine. However, more experiments are warranted to examine confounding effects from compensatory alteration in liver uridine biosynthesis and/or degradation in response to reduced adipocyte Cad expression.\n\nDiscussion Uridine and thermoregulation Temperature homeostasis is a tightly regulated process in mammals. The human body retains a set temperature of ~37°C, with complications arising when the temperature increases by little more than 3°C (27). During fasting, both rodents and humans manifest a reduction in body temperature, a process regulated by the sympathetic nervous system (20, 28). Our findings indicate that plasma uridine is a metabolite critically involved in this process. The dynamic regulation of plasma uridine is unusual for a metabolite, particularly one with the range of vital biological functions associated with uridine. Characterizing the dynamics of plasma uridine as part of the systemic response to fasting and refeeding has led us to propose a model that integrates feeding, carbohydrate metabolism, and thermoregulation through a novel adipo-biliary-uridine axis. In studies with leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, coupled with measurements of circulating leptin in response to uridine administration, we also uncovered a role for leptin signaling in the governance of uridine homeostasis and fasting-induced declines in body temperature. Plasma-bile-gut uridine homeostasis Our results unveil pivotal roles for uridine biosynthesis and transport to and from bile in the metabolic control of body temperature. Bile is produced by the liver and released into the small intestine to enhance the digestion and absorption of fat (29). Recently, components of bile have been shown to mediate effects on energy metabolism and blood glucose regulation, and even to shape the composition of the gut flora (30). Our findings indicate that uridine released from bile can increase glucose assimilation. Although the detailed mechanism is unclear, intestinal nutrient absorption is a process tightly linked to the function of biliary uridine. Because of the limited capacity for de novo synthesis of nucleotides (31, 32), the salvage pathway for utilization of exogenous nucleosides is of particular importance in epithelial cells in the small intestine. How, then, is uridine transported across these systems? Nucleosides are transported into cells by plasma membrane carriers that belong to two gene families, CNT and ENT (33–36). Whereas CNT1- and CNT2-related proteins are responsible for the concentrative Na-dependent high-affinity transport of pyrimidine (33–36), less is known about the transport of uridine. Our findings point to excretion of uridine into bile canaliculi by hepatocytes, as well as transport of plasma uridine into the gallbladder, suggesting the presence of nucleoside carriers on both canalicular and sinusoidal membranes of hepatocytes. Interestingly, bile acids can increase CNT2-related activity in the liver through the recruitment of CNT2 from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane (37); this implies that uridine may be taken up by hepatocytes during the fed state and subsequently shunted to the gallbladder. Adipocyte-dependent uridine biosynthesis A role for adipocytes in plasma uridine homeostasis has not been appreciated to date. Our observations reveal that fasting-induced elevation and maintenance of elevated plasma uridine levels rely critically on adipocytes. The uridine levels in fat biopsies from HIV-infected patients that suffer from HIV-associated partial lipodystrophy are significantly elevated (38), indicating that excessive uridine production might lead to the loss of adipose tissue. Our studies have drawn a consistent correlation between increased plasma uridine and increased biosynthesis in adipocytes; however, regardless of the consistency and strength of the correlation, this does not establish causality. Detailed mechanisms underlying the leptin-mediated plasma uridine clearance also remain unclear. However, a connection between leptin transcription and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway end product UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) has been reported (39), suggesting the involvement of a signaling pathway from uridine to UDP-GlcNAc. Given the complexity of plasma uridine homeostasis and the pivotal role of uridine in systemic metabolism reported here, inhibition of uridine supplied from one tissue is expected to alter the supply, salvage, and clearance of uridine in other tissues. Indeed, our findings point to a critical role of adipocytes in plasma uridine homeostasis. Additional studies combining tissue-specific loss and gain of function of enzymes responsible for pyrimidine de novo synthesis are warranted to characterize the contribution of adipocytes to the plasma uridine supply. Future directions Our description of an adipo-biliary-uridine axis raises interesting questions for future investigation. What are the effects of feeding-induced reductions in uridine levels in organs that rely heavily on uridine uptake from plasma, such as the heart? Given the established links among feeding, metabolism, and circadian rhythmicity (40, 41), does uridine play a central role in these processes? Whether bariatric surgery, the only obesity treatment that achieves substantial and permanent weight loss (42), is associated with alterations in plasma uridine homeostasis due to altered recycling of uridine from gut to blood also merits investigation. Recently, diabetes has been linked to impairments in temperature control during exposure to thermal stress (43). Our studies reveal a direct link between temperature regulation and metabolism, indicating that a uridine-centered model of energy homeostasis may pave the way for future studies on uridine homeostasis and diabetes as well as other metabolic diseases.\n\nMaterials and methods Animals and experimental protocol Adult C57BL/6 inbred mice (WT) and leptin deficient mice (ob/ob) were housed in individually ventilated cages with constant temperature on a standard 12:12 light cycle, and were fed standard rodent chow diet (2916, Teklad) with free access to water. Male C57BL/6 mice that were used for high fat diet study were switched to high fat diet (D12492, Research Diet) after their body weight reached 20 g (8 to 10 weeks old). Age-matched ob/ob mice were used, with both male and female data pooled in the analysis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from the Charles River Laboratory and fed with rat diet (Teklad). All procedures were approved by The Institutional Animal Care and the Use Committee of UT Southwestern Medical Center. Study subjects and human samples This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before their participation. Subjects were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit in the evening before the study, and consumed a standard dinner (12 kcal per kg fat-free mass) at 1800 hours. At 0700 hours the next morning, after subjects fasted for 12 hours overnight, they consumed a liquid mixed meal, provided in 5 equal aliquots every 5 min for 20 min. The meal contained one-third of each subject’s estimated total daily energy requirement and was comprised of 55% of total energy as carbohydrates, 15% as protein, and 30% as fat. Arterial blood samples were obtained 10 min before and immediately before, and at 20, 40, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 min after initiating meal consumption. Human subject information is shown in table S1. Fasting/refeeding studies in rodents Male WT mice (10 to 35 weeks old) and male rats (10 weeks old) were used for fasting/refeeding studies at ambient temperature (22° to 25°C). Age-matched ob/ob mice were used which include both males and females. Male Agpat KO (8 to 10 weeks old) and male FAT-ATTAC mice (10 to 12 weeks old) were used for fasting/refeeding studies with their age-matched WT controls, respectively. For FAT-ATTAC mice, the study was performed 3 days post dimerizer compound AP20187 (Ariad) administration as described (25). Blood samples (30 μl) were collected in heparinized capillaries from tail tip at specified time points. Samples were centrifuged and aliquots of plasma were frozen at –20°C. Plasma and bile measurements Blood samples (30 μl) from tail tip were collected in heparinized capillaries from male WT and age-matched ob/ob mice (12 to 30 weeks old) and male rats (10 weeks old). Samples were centrifuged and aliquots of plasma were frozen at –20°C. Bile samples were collected from gallbladders from male WT, female WT and age-matched ob/ob mice (28 to 32 weeks old). Plasma uridine and uric acid, and bile uridine levels were quantified by HPLC-MS/MS at UT Southwestern Medical Center Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Core. Plasma glucose was measured by an oxidase-peroxidase assay (Sigma) as described (44). Plasma leptin levels were measured using an ELISA kit (Millipore). Effect of uridine and glucose on body temperature Male WT (15 to 35 weeks old) and age-matched ob/ob mice were used for body temperature measurements through an IPTT-300 transponder implanted longitudinally above the shoulder of mouse (Bio Medic Data Systems). To study the thermal effect of uridine, 0.1 g/ml uridine (Sigma) in PBS was administrated to mice (1 g/kg body weight) via intraperitoneal injection or oral gavage. To study the thermal effect of glucose, 0.25 g/ml glucose (Sigma) in H 2 O was administrated orally to mice (2.5 g/kg body weight). To study the combined effect of glucose and uridine, glucose-uridine solution (0.25 g/ml glucose and 0.1 g/ml uridine in H 2 O) was administrated orally at the same dose as the study for glucose alone. All the treatment and temperature measurements were performed at ambient room temperature (23° to 25°C), if not specified. A refrigerated incubator at 29°C (Powers Scientific) was used to achieve a near-thermoneutral environment. [3H]Uridine clearance study [5-3H]Uridine (25 μCi, PerkinElmer) in 250 μl PBS was administrated to male C57BL/6 mice (15 to 35 weeks old) via tail vein injection or oral gavage. This dose (0.274 μg uridine per mouse) was lower than that for thermal effects of uridine (1 g/kg body weight), such that no drop in body temperature was triggered in the clearance study. Plasma from tail tip was sampled from intact mouse before its bile was harvested from gallbladder. Plasma (5 μl) and bile (2 μl) were used for radioactivity measurements. To collect blood from portal vein, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane after plasma had been first sampled from its tail tip. Indirect calorimetry and NMR VO 2 (ml/hr/kg), VCO 2 (ml/hr/kg), and RER (VCO 2 /VO 2 , dimensionless) were calculated using an open-flow, indirect calorimeter in the UTSW Metabolic Phenotyping Core. Two male C57BL/6 mice (10 to 13 weeks old, chow fed) were studied at a time such that the variables were recorded every 6 min for 2 hours. After 15 min acclimation in the test chambers, three recordings were performed before injection (–13 min, –7 min, and –1 min) from which the base line of VO 2 and VCO 2 were calculated for each mouse. One minute after the third recording, the mouse was taken out of the test chamber to receive an intraperitoneal injection of uridine (1 g/kg bodyweight) or PBS, such that the time 0 indicated when the injection was performed. This paired study was repeated for five times, and the results were expressed as mean ± SEM. The administration of uridine or PBS required opening the test chamber, which caused a sudden drop in the calculated rates of O 2 consumption and CO 2 production in the first recording, 5 min post injection for each mouse. Accurate determination of body composition in intact mouse was conducted using nuclear magnetic resonance (Bruckner Minispec mq10). Tolerance tests For glucose tolerance tests, glucose (0.25 g/ml in H 2 O) was gavaged (2.5 g/kg body weight) orally to male WT mice and age-matched ob/ob mice (15 to 35 weeks old) after fasted for 4 hours. To test parenteral effect of uridine, uridine (0.1 g/ml in PBS) was administrated via intraperitoneal injection (1 g/kg body weight) 15 min before glucose tolerance tests. To test enteral effect of uridine, uridine was dissolved together with glucose in H 2 O and the glucose-uridine solution (0.25 g/ml glucose and 0.1 g/ml uridine in H2O) was used for oral gavage at the same dose as glucose tolerance test. N-(phosphonacetyl)- l -aspartate (PALA) and streptozotocin (STZ) treatments PALA (100 mg/ml in 0.9% saline) was administrated via intraperitoneal injection at 62.5 mg/kg body weight to ob/ob (10 to 35 weeks old) or male WT mice (16 to 20 weeks old on HFD for 30 days). Food was removed after PALA injection up to 24 hours to monitor response in body temperature and plasma glucose. PALA was synthesized at UT Southwestern Medical Center as described (45) with purity greater than 95% as assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance. STZ (Sigma) was dissolved freshly in ice-cold sodium citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.5) and administrated via intraperitoneal injection to male C57BL/6 mice (10 to 15 weeks old) at 120 μg/g body weight as described previously (46). Body weight and plasma glucose levels were monitored up to 7 weeks post STZ treatment, and the mice were euthanized for plasma, bile and tissue collection after 24 hours of fasting. RNA isolation and qPCR Male C57BL/6 mice (15 to 25 weeks old) fed or fasted of 24 hours were euthanized and tissues were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA II mini columns (Macherey-Nagel) from 50 to 100 mg tissue and total RNA (100 ng to 1 μg) was used for reverse transcription with iScript kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were then diluted tenfold with ddH 2 O and stored at –20°C for qPCR (Roche). Primers are shown in table S2. 18S RNA served as an internal control. Statistical analysis Results are reported as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis of the data was performed with two-tailed Student t test or two-way ANOVA, as specified. Paired t test was performed for samples collected from the same mouse during a time course study. A P value < 0.05 was considered as significant. Statistical software consisted of Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 6.04.\n\nSupplementary Materials www.sciencemag.org/content/355/6330/eaaf5375/suppl/DC1 Figs.

She’s also the mother of a toddler and is expecting another baby this May.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\n“With one child, it didn’t have a huge effect on our family,” Miller tells Fast Company, “but with two children, it will have a much greater impact on the overall decisions we make for our future.” Juggling career and family is a given for almost every working parent today. According to Ernst & Young’s Global Generations Survey, the biggest challenge U.S. workers face is finding a balance between lengthening hours at work and spending more time with family. Data from Child Care Attendance Automation (CCAA) that tracks attendance in care facilities reveals that nearly 11 million kids under the age of 5 are in some type of child care arrangement in the U.S., where they spend an average of around 36 hours per week. Infant care costs exceed the average cost of in-state college tuition at public four-year institutions. This comes at a high cost. Recent analysis from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) found that in 33 states and the District of Columbia, infant care costs exceed the average cost of in-state college tuition at public four-year institutions. It’s ironic, given that as millennials become parents, many are still paying back loans for their own college educations. Children between infancy and preschool are the costliest to care for. According to the EPI’s findings, “When 10 family budgets in various areas are reconstructed to include two-parent, two-child families with an infant and a 4-year-old (instead of a 4-year-old and an 8-year-old), child care ranges from 19.3% to 28.7% of total family budgets.” For older children, the costs range from 11.8% to 21.6% for families with a 4-year-old and an 8-year-old.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe EPI also found that child care costs as a percentage of total family budgets often exceed the 10% affordability threshold established by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Miller reports, “We currently pay $23,000 per year in child care, which is 10% of our salary.” When the second child is born, she says the cost will jump to $46,000 per year (or 20% of their two-income household’s earnings). This will exceed that 10% affordability guideline issued by the HHS. Although costs vary according to where you live (a household with one 4-year-old in rural South Carolina pays $344 a month, but it jumps to $1,472 a month in Washington, D.C.), Miller’s not alone. She’s a member of the working parents platform It’s Working Project by Forty Weeks where other mothers and fathers have reported spending a similar amount and more on their child care. Even though their child care costs will soon be at 20% of their income, the Millers are in a better financial situation than most parents in dual-income homes. For example, the average annual earnings of men in Washington, D.C., is close to $68,000 a year, while the average salary for women in that city (D.C. has one of the smallest wage gaps in the country) is around $61,000 a year . A family in D.C. earning those salaries would be paying over 35% of their dual income to pay for the care of two young children (or more than three times what is considered affordable). That imbalance of affordability grows even more in the second most expensive location for child care, New York City, where men earn on average around $51,000 a year and women earn on average only $44,000 a year.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“Women lose $11,000 a year on average because of the pay gap, which incidentally is just about the average yearly cost of child care in the U.S.,” Tracy Sturdivant, cofounder and codirector of Make It Work, a campaign to advance economic security for working women, men, and families, points out. “To really get a handle on America’s child care crisis, the federal government has to take action to bring child care within the means of working parents,” Sturdivant tells Fast Company. One way might be raising the minimum wage across the country. Among the parents who are the hardest hit are those working minimum-wage jobs. The EPI found that a full-time, full-year minimum-wage worker with one child falls far below the family budget threshold—even after adjusting for higher state and city minimum wages. Research by the Census Bureau indicates that families below the poverty line spent 30% of their incomes on child care in 2011, which is as much as four times the percentage spent by more affluent parents. After decades of decline and a drop to 23% in 1999, the number of stay-at-home mothers rose to 29% in 2012. Despite being in a higher earning bracket, Miller admits she’s considered leaving her job because of the cost of child care. And she’s certainly not alone. Research has indicated that the rise in child care costs have coincided with the number of parents–women in particular–who choose to stay home.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe most recent data from Pew Research found that after decades of decline and a drop to 23% in 1999, the number of stay-at-home mothers rose to 29% in 2012. In order to retain talented parents, Sturdivant says there are some things employers can do to ease the strain, beginning by ensuring they’re paying women and men the same amount for equal work. “Additionally,” she says, “employers can support working parents through policies like fair, flexible scheduling, paid sick days, and paid family leave, so that they’re never forcing their employees to choose between work and family.” *Miller’s name has been changed at her request to protect her privacy.\n\nRelated: What Netflix’s Amazing New Unlimited Parental Leave Policy Really Means",

  "latent_30674": "Okay, I had this brilliant plan of making a video for this. But you know what? I have a twenty quid Nokia phone from over a decade ago and it’s not going to happen. I tried to do something slick on my computer, but I have no idea what I’m doing and so here we are. I’m just going to write it. Old school.\n\nFirst off, can I say thanks to Jim O’Hara and all my pals here who were great enough to volunteer their time to help with this talent search. Not just for going through the thousand or so scripts we received and shepherding the five or six hundred artists who submitted sample pages, but for their endless good grace and time spent helping people through the entire process on the boards these last few months. I literally wouldn’t have had a hope in Hell of doing this without them and so a huge thanks to the guys for taking what must amount to at least several weeks of full-time work making this happen.\n\nCan I also say not to be disheartened if you’re not one of the creators chosen this time. I’m financing 13 people to get their big start in print next summer and that means less than one in every hundred who submitted can possibly be selected. The level of talent was also staggering. I knew there was a huge amount of untapped, smart people out there just waiting for a place to focus their energies, but - my God - you’re going to love this annual. The range is truly international. I’d guess less than a third of the entries came from the US or UK and paring it down to just thirty this week and then a final six writers and six artists plus a cover artist yesterday was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. Seriously, you’ll see what I mean. Wait till you see what these guys have done with my characters.\n\nSo before I announce the names just remember that we have the CREATIVE FORUM here all year with pros and fellow new creators to help you develop your skills. I’m paying Marvel and DC rates every year for these annuals, given 13 new creators their first taste of print every summer. So if you’re not on the list THIS time stick around and enter NEXT time. I’ll post details of when it’s happening again next summer and - I swear - I’ll get the video working for December 23rd next year.\n\nSo here we go. I’ve loaned out six of our franchises here to twelve new people and matched up the artists I feel are most appropriate. I’m about to take a family break until January 4th, but I’ll be in touch with each of you privately on the day we get back with deadlines, very small rewrites and - best of all - getting your bank details so each of you can get paid.\n\nThe Summer 2016 annual will thus be as follows:\n\nCOVER - Satine Zillah\n\nKick-Ass - Writer Ricardo Mo/ Artist Ifesinachi Orjiekwe\n\nKingsman - Writer Philip Huxley/ Artist Myron Macklin\n\nStarlight - Writer Deniz Camp/ Artist Pracheta Banerjee\n\nAmerican Jesus - Writer Cliff Bumgardiner/ Artist Steve Beach\n\nChrononauts - Writer Shaun Brill/ Artist Conor Hughes\n\nHit-Girl - Writer Mark Abnett/ Artist Ozgur Yildirim\n\nBIG BIG BIG congratulations to all the winners. Like I said, this was enormously difficult and I know people always say that, but actually true in this case. COMIC BOOK PUBLISHERS, I want you to take a look at the art thread beneath this post and see the level of talent taking part. There’s EASILY a hundred people who should be working full-time and about twenty I think are going to have really big careers. I hope you employ them and I ALSO hope you pay them proper rates. Writers and artists, I’m not on Facebook, but I’m here on www.forums.millarworld.tv and on Twitter most days so come and talk to me if you feel uncertain about what you’re being offered from any company. I’m here for advice of any kind.\n\nSo we’re back next summer with a brand new talent search, but writing and drawing should continue here as you hone your skills. Also, we have some INSANE plans for next year, creative designs being employed in a whole new venture I’ll tell you about in the New Year plus a huge international COSPLAY COMPETITION I’m going to launch on January 27th. Don’t miss this. It’s going to be really fun and taking cosplay to a whole new audience all across the world.\n\nBig thanks also to everyone for all the kind words on the books this year and for coming to see the Kingsman movie. Next year will be nuts with Stuart Immonen and I launching our sci-fi series Empress in April, MONTHLY FRANK QUITELY right after, Sean Murphy back for Chrononauts 2: Futureshock in July and GREG CAPULLO in the Autumn with our big creator-owned book I’m writing at the moment. This time next year it’s Mister Jae Lee and a horror series unlike any other. Empress #1, incidentally, gets a massive preview in the extra-sized Huck #3, on sale on the 13th of January.\n\nHave a Merry Christmas, folks, and I really do hope you all have a lovely New Year.\n\nCongrats again to the winners. You all did brilliantly and should be very proud.\n\nLove,\n\nMark Millar\n\nxxx\n\nPS Here’s the art thread for other publishers to have a look at and for readers to get a glimpse of the brilliant work they can expect in our annual next summer…",

  "latent_31246": "As if stories involving the Washington Redskins needed any extra elements of flair or intrigue before they are processed through the juggernaut that is modern media only to be churned out on the other side full of sensationalism, the addition of a fan-favorite former Pro Bowl player pondering a comeback nearly three years since he last touched the ball in a regular season game seems to have well and truly done the trick.\n\nBack in the early summer when the stories of Chris Cooley expressing a desire to make a comeback to the NFL first started propagating, the concept was summarily dismissed by most people as the stock standard post-career lamentations that are common from retired players. Even 52 year old Michael Jordan still thinks he could beat current day NBA players in one-on-one games. To be a successful professional athlete certainly requires an extraordinary amount of self-belief and confidence in your own abilities, and once you hang up your boots those same character traits don’t just disappear.\n\nBut then, fate seemed to dictate that this comeback dream was going to get a little more attention than most. When both Niles Paul and Logan Paulsen succumbed to injuries that ended their seasons before they began, and players like Chase Dixon and Je’Ron Hamm looked as though they may potentially make the cut to round out the Tight End corps on the final Redskins 53 man roster behind Jordan Reed, fans and pundits alike started paying closer attention to Cooley. Running routes (in front of cameras) on the First Energy Stadium field in Cleveland hours before kickoff this past week, Cooley was sending a clear message saying ‘this is not a flight of fancy. I’m serious’.\n\nShould the Redskins then actually consider the prospect of bringing back the man affectionately remembered as ‘Captain Chaos’?\n\nThe last time Cooley was on the field as a Redskin was in 2012, and if you cast your mind back to that eventful year, you may recall that even then, Cooley playing in 2012 was considered a “comeback”. He wasn’t on the roster to start the regular season, having been cut in the preseason to make way for Fred Davis, Niles Paul and Logan Paulson. But then Fred Davis injured his achilles and Cooley rejoined the team in late October. Even though he was on the roster, Cooley saw almost no action, and in fact only had one single reception for the year, coming in Week 16 against the Eagles. Here is footage of that 8 yard catch – his last touch of the ball in professional football.\n\nAmong the valid concerns and questions people have regarding any player returning from several years away from the game is how their body would stand up to the rigors of the NFL. This is especially relevant at a position like Tight End where contact is to be expected. Towards the end of his playing career in 2011 and 2012, there were huge concerns about Cooley’s knee, with some reports suggesting that his knee had deteriorated to where it was nearly ‘bone on bone’.\n\nAnother concern involves the question of what sort of distraction having a current member of the media rejoining the locker room as a player would be, especially one whom has been very publicly critical of some of the current locker room leaders including Quarterback Robert Griffin III. Furthermore, what happens if the Redskins do give fan-favorite Cooley a shot and it simply doesn’t work out? And lastly, isn’t there a rule that stipulates team employees can’t play for the team within the same year they’ve been on the payroll?\n\nCooley addressed all of these issues on Monday’s edition of his ESPN980 show in a nearly 20 minute segment that served as both Cooley’s Mea Culpa as well as his audition tape for General Manager Scot McCloughan.\n\nThe responses to these questions that Cooley gave ranged from short and sweet, to intricately detailed. Regarding his fitness and his health, Cooley offered up a simple assurance, stating;\n\n“I’m working out and I’m in great shape and I’m ready to play. And I want to work out.”\n\nRegarding the supposed regulation that would prevent him playing, Cooley was more detailed;\n\n“I was actually told that this has been talked about a bunch lately; that because of the rules and regulations of the NFL by-laws, and my employment by Red Zebra Radio (being an affiliate of Dan Snyder), that I could not play for the Redskins. I was told that by… let’s just say by the Redskins. This was when Arizona called two weeks ago, and I think it was just a bit of ‘if they [Arizona] do sign you, we [Washington] couldn’t even offer you a deal, so don’t worry’. There is a by-law that states that anyone employed as a coach/trainer, or in another capacity, could not play in that same year [for that same club]. And I am employed by the club in another capacity.\n\nBut there’s an ‘unless‘. Unless signed to an NFL player contract and within the first applicable player limit of the preseason and making all subsequent cuts. Well that’s now. I’m within that applicable limit so I can be acquired right now, and I’d have to make it through all subsequent cuts. Pretty easy. Straight forward. I can be signed by the Redskins”.\n\nOn what would impact a potential signing would have on his status with the team and officials who he has worked so closely with for the last decade, Cooley was philosophical, yet also adamant;\n\n“I’m just a guy. I can fill a spot, and if it wasn’t good then you can just cut me. I can work out. You give me a shot for three weeks, and then say you sign a guy from San Francisco then you just release me then if I don’t work out. My feelings aren’t going to be hurt either way. I’m not going to be crushed either way. I’m going to play for someone this year. I’m going to get an opportunity. I personally know it for a fact.”\n\nInterestingly, Cooley also mentioned (in almost a bragging tone) that the prospect of his return to the Redskins was closer than some would think, with one key roadblock;\n\n“There are four people that could potentially be involved in this decision. Three out of four are for this. For me coming back to the Redskins. The fourth is strongly averse.”\n\nOut of all the pieces of information that Cooley shared during the segment, this is perhaps the most intriguing. If we are to accept that Cooley is telling the truth, and that there are four (and only four) people that would be involved in making this decision, one would have to assume that those four are Head Coach Jay Gruden, Offensive Coordinator Sean McVay, Team President Bruce Allen, and General Manager Scot McCloughan. (As tempting as I’m sure it is for many to suggest that owner Dan Snyder would be involved in this decision, remember that he has ceded total football control to his President and General Manager).\n\nOf those four, McCloughan has made the most concrete public statements that suggest he is that ‘averse’ party. When asked directly about whether or not the injuries at the Tight End position mean that he would consider approaching Cooley to give him a workout, McCloughan didn’t mince words;\n\n“No, I’m not going there. Chris Cooley’s a really good Redskin, he’s a part of the Redskins still, but I’m not going there.”\n\nMcCloughan’s messaging here is reflective of what the entire ethos of the organization he is trying to build should represent. And it is precisely this ethos that is the reason why Cooley making a return to the Burgundy and Gold is unlikely. Simply put, it’s not the sort of move that a winning organization makes. Whether you’re chasing a Super Bowl or looking to rebuild your roster, the very basic principle that underpins success is that you must always be moving forward. If you’re not moving forward, you’re either stagnating or you’re moving backwards, and both represent failure. McCloughan is not accustomed to failure.\n\nChris Cooley is right; even nearly three years removed from the game he may still be better than the options the Redskins have at Tight End right now. But nothing is ever black or white in the NFL, and when you’re an organization that has a decades-long reputation as a basket-case, the last thing you should be looking to do is add fuel to that fire.\n\nThe fact that he is still revered amongst Redskins fans is a reflection on how significant the special place this fan base has for Cooley in their hearts, and we here at Redskins Capital Connection certainly count ourselves amongst his fans. The best place for him in 2015, however, is on the sidelines, just like he was at Training Camp.\n\nChris Cooley out on the sideline next to me watching the action. I can't help it.

  "latent_31826": "Share\n\nWhen you hear the term electronic pills, you might be imagining some sort of hardwired chips that you’re supposed to unwillingly ingest. This isn’t quite the case. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration passed an edible electronic sensor on Monday that will be used to keep track of a patient’s medication patterns to ensure they are regularly taking their meds.\n\nProteus Digital Health, Inc. has developed a tiny, digestible sensor that aims to transmit data to an online app to help improve a patient’s health habits and patterns. These sensors can be integrated into any medically ingested products. Once the pill is consumed and the sensor reaches the patient’s stomach fluids, data transmission is activated to determine the time of ingestion straight onto an external app. Patients will have to wear a patch on their skin to receive the data while the patch will also calculate heart rate, body position, and physical activity. This information can be relayed to the patient’s doctor or caretaker to evaluate his or her health patterns to help them make better health choices.\n\nThe technology makes sense considering many people often forget to take their pills, especially if some are required to be taken at a certain time of day. It’s also a good reminder for those who might have forgotten whether they have taken their dose for the day or not.\n\n“This device could be a solution to that problem, so that doctors can know when to rev up a patient’s medication adherence,” said Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute. “It’s like big brother watching you take your medicine.”\n\nFor those who are avert to the idea of eating microchips, you might be happy to know the sensors are made of silicon, magnesium, and copper so once the pill has been consumed and broken down, you actually earn a bit of minerals in your body.\n\n“The FDA validation represents a major milestone in digital medicine,” said Topol. “Directly digitizing pills, for the first time, in conjunction with our wireless infrastructure, may prove to be the new standard for influencing medication adherence and significantly aid chronic disease management.”\n\nWe could only wonder how long it will take before such integration will come to regular food products? If incorporated into healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables, perhaps parents can keep track of whether or not their children are eating their greens and ingesting them properly. The ability to track nutrition breakdown via an edible sensor might also help us regulate food intake without the need to take blood tests to identify malnourished nutrients and minerals.",
  "latent_31849": "In the aftermath of the attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009 by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) moved to increase airport security. Passengers flying “non-stop” to the US were subject to enhanced screenings, including in some cases a full-body pat-down. But, immediately, TSA realized that this placed an “extraordinary burden” on airports and airlines and TSA moved to develop a “regime” that would subject a “reduced pool” of passengers to “enhanced screenings.”\n\nOn January 13, 2010, it was announced a list of fourteen countries of interest. The list included: Cuba, Sudan, Syria, Iran (four countries on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism) and Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Yemen. The new regime meant all passengers traveling from any of the fourteen countries would, regardless of nationality or US citizenship, be subject to increased security and possible violations of privacy.\n\nNewly published cables from WikiLeaks shed light on reactions from leaders of countries on the list. From January to February 2010, US diplomats had to explain and justify the designation. Some leaders from countries on the list took serious offense thus relations between the US and certain countries were in jeopardy. As one leader in Nigeria put it, the US had gone ahead and designated countries as terrorist countries and that was unacceptable.\n\n“Poison” to US-Algeria Relations\n\nAlgerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci, in a meeting with Near Eastern Affairs Deputy Assistant Secretary Janet Sanderson, called Algeria’s designation “a blow to relations.” He said “Algeria’s security professionals were baffled by the move” and the designation “was at odds with President Obama’s Cairo speech calling for more solidarity between the West and the Muslim World.” Sanderson attempted to justify the decision and said the measure was in no way a reflection of US appreciation of cooperation between the US and Algeria. But, Medelci didn’t buy this explanation.\n\n“Algeria had taken all necessary measures to ensure the security of its territory and should not have been put on this list, which was discriminatory,” he explained. Medelci called this move a “poison” in US-Algeria relations and said, while he understood Sanderson was here to assuage concerns, she was on a “mission impossible.” Algeria wanted to be off the list. “No more, no less.” Algeria also wanted to know why the announcement of this list had been made now. There had been “no special measures in place for years” so it was upsetting.\n\nIn a meeting with Algerian Counterterrorism Coordinator Kamel Rezag Bara, Bara told Sanderson the US could have “implemented the measure without publicizing it.” Bara refused to buy the idea that “enhanced airport screenings” were appropriate for all Algerians.\n\nSuch treatment would be understandable for state sponsors of terrorism; or countries in areas where U.S. troops were fighting like Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan; or for countries in turmoil like Yemen and Somalia; or perhaps for Saudi Arabia, which had been the source of 19 of 22 terrorists involved in the 9/11 attack; or even Lebanon, because of Hizballah. But it was not understandable for Algeria or Libya. Libya was one of the first states to take action against Osama bin Ladin. (Note: In addition to sticking up for the only other Maghrebi state on TSA list, Rezag Bara is a former Algerian ambassador to Libya.) Algeria was a prime U.S. ally in fighting terrorism. How had this list been drawn up? he asked. Rezag Bara said it might have been acceptable to screen, for example, Algerians who had visited Yemen or Afghanistan, but not all Algerian nationals. He said he would not say more, but the government of Algeria really (he put emphasis on this last word) wanted the US to take Algeria off the list.\n\nLebanon: Enhanced Security Will Be “Economically Injurious”\n\nLebanon President Michel Sleiman and other Lebanese officials publicly and privately voiced their dismay at TSA’s designation. In a “scenesetter” for Special Envoy for Middle East Peace George Mitchell, then-charge d’affaires to Lebanon Michele Sison notes Presidency Director General Naji Abi Assi argued “the differentiation between state sponsors of terrorism and other countries of concern was not properly made and the resulting sense of humiliation and embarrassment would only benefit extremists.”\n\nIn a meeting with a congressional delegation led by Rep. Alcee L. Hastings (D-FL) on January 8, President Sleiman raised the issue of the TSA listing protesting, “Lebanon’s safety record at Beirut’s Rafiq Hariri International Airport was excellent.” He added the new security procedures would likely be “economically injurious.”\n\nAmerican Tourists Could “Attract Terrorists”\n\nOn January 21, Mahmoud Jibril, head of Libya’s National Economic Development Board (NEDB), met with US Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz. He was “commended” for taking on the task of re-engaging Libya diplomatically after “decades of isolation.” Jibril informed Cretz that it was time to begin to implement projects that built trust between the two countries. He added, “Arabs of the sixties are no longer the Arabs of today,” meaning leaders in the region no longer will reject relations simply because of the US-Israel relationship. But, he pointed out the inclusion of Libya on the “countries of interest” list would not help matters, as it “reinforced negative perceptions about the US in Libya.\n\nAdditionally, a cable sent out on February 4, 2010, indicates the designation pushed the Libya government to return the favor and see how the US would like it if they were treated as a country that was a magnet for terrorism. In a meeting with Brigadier General Mohamed al Rammali of the Libyan Immigration and Passports Department, Cretz pushed for an end to a freeze on Libya visas to official US government-related travelers. Cretz also urged Libya to lift the ban on visas for US tourists. Rammali told Cretz the Libya government had concerns American tourists would “attract terrorists” and were at “higher risk of getting attacked by al Qaeda when they go out in the desert than Italian or French tourists.” Rammali continued after the announcement that Libyans would be subject to enhanced TSA screenings, “The timing is not right for us to start issuing tourist visas…you should be encouraging us to do so with positive measures, rather than adding us to lists where our citizens get screened.”\n\nIt’s worth noting Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa “summoned” the US ambassador to Libya to his office on October 26. He told the ambassador he was angry and disappointed at the treatment Libyan UN Permanent Representative Abdulrahman Shalgam and his wife experienced at the hands of John F. Kennedy Airport security officials when they recently departed from New York. What happened to them deeply angered Muammar Gaddafi and Koussa called on the Ambassador to investigate and respond with a report so the government could decide what “measures” to take in response:\n\nWhat did Koussa tell the ambassador?\n\n…Kusa said Shalgam and his wife were put in a room and subjected to “strip searches and rude behavior as if they were criminals.” The trauma had affected Shalgam’s wife so deeply that, according to Kusa, she is currently under hospital care. Kusa called the incident unjustified and immoral: “Morally speaking, Shalgam is a guest in your country. If he had done something wrong or was a security threat, then that would have been a different story. How would you like it if your diplomats were treated by us in such a manner?” He argued that if a high level diplomat such as Shalgam — a former foreign minister — could experience such treatment by U.S. officials, then other Libyan diplomats or average Libyan travelers were probably facing even worse treatment.\n\nSo, the designation was not the first time Libya had expressed anger at TSA.\n\nA Sign US Insensitive to Sensibilities of the Pakistani Public\n\nThe designation of Pakistan further irritated tensions between the US and Pakistan. According to a January 2010 cable, it was yet another sign to officials like Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi that the US was “insensitive to the sensibilities of the Pakistani public.” Qureshi urged the USA to reconsider the new policy of enhanced security for Pakistanis.\n\nAmbassador Richard Holbrooke explained that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano had asked him to inform Pakistan the changes were part of a review of previous TSA guidelines, Pakistan had not been singled out as other US allies like Saudi Arabia were on the list, random security checks would continue at airports like Heathrow and an ongoing review of countries on the list would be conducted with adjustments to the list made if necessary.\n\nQureshi apparently found Holbrooke’s answer good enough, as the meeting moved forward. But, it cannot be overstated: this is something that carried the potential to greatly impact relations, given the fact that there were already tensions over drones, US ground operations on Pakistani soil and a perception that the US did not care about Pakistan’s security concerns with India.\n\nIt Makes Us Feel and Look Like “Black Sheep”\n\nSaudi leaders from the General Civil Aviation Authority (GACA), Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Culture and Information all thought Saudi Arabia was being “singled out.” Aviation Security Director of GACA, Abdulhameed Abalary, said he and senior Saudi leaders, including King Abdullah, were “surprised.” Abalary acknowledged the US had the “sovereign right” to establish these procedures for the protection of US citizens, however, he still took issue.\n\nAbalary said the aviation security standards in Saudi Arabia were “very different” from other countries of interest, such as Afghanistan and Somalia. He emphasized that his country’s aviation security record was unblemished since 9/11 and that Saudi Arabia has one of the two highest aviation security standards in the region. Abalary said both Saudi Arabia and the United States have made the protection of all air passengers their highest priority, and Saudi Arabia also places great value on facilitating legitimate travel between our countries, especially the 30,000 Saudi students studying in the United States, who will become the next generation of the Kingdom’s technocratic and business elite.\n\nThe designation was particularly unsettling to Abalary because the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the TSA had a “long history of cooperation on civil aviation security.” Abalary noted that he had a “constructive, wonderful” visit to TSA headquarters in December 2009 and was “excited” about a memorandum of understanding that had been developed with the TSA. He hoped the designation would be lifted and invited officials to tour Saudi airports to see how the country was secure and compliant, as GACA had implemented “full-body pat-downs of 100 percent of all passengers and physical examination of all accessible property.”\n\nSaudi Deputy Foreign Minister for Multilateral Relations Dr. Prince Torki bin Mohammed was disappointed and said the designation makes Saudi Arabia “feel and look like a ‘black sheep.’” The Prince took particular exception to US attempts to justify the listing of Saudi Arabia:\n\nThe Prince said he understood that America’s first priority is to save lives, but the U.S. approach should be to screen all passengers and not single out countries publicly. He agreed with A/DCM’s assertion that it was reasonable given finite resources to concentrate security screening on travelers linked to routes of travel (e.g., originating in Yemen), but he said the U.S. should have found a way to keep such routes and countries confidential. A/DCM emphasized that the list of countries was not intended to be made public and that leaks were regrettable. Beyond this, the list would evolve to reflect the nature of the threat. The Prince opined that the attempted bombing was a failure of U.S. intelligence and therefore the U.S. should focus on fixing its internal procedures, rather than “blaming Saudi Arabia” or adding new layers of passenger screening that terrorists will easily circumvent. The Prince reported that during a large dinner party the previous evening, he had been asked repeatedly (and “only”) about the new TSA regulations. Torki noted that we have one of the “closest bilateral relationships of any two countries,” which included thousands of Saudi students in the United States. He hoped to avoid pressure for reciprocal measures, and closed by asking the A/DCM to urgently convey the SAG’s concerns to Washington.\n\nIn response to the designation, the Ministry of Culture and Information’s Eastern Province Directorate “delayed a meeting with Consulate Dhahran.” And, “military contacts” were extremely displeased. Some even suggested the new procedures could “negatively affect Saudi deliberations on the purchase of ships and systems in conjunction with the Eastern Fleet Modernization Program,” which was a program developed to “replace aging naval and aviation assets that the kingdom uses to patrol the Persian Gulf.”\n\nUS ambassador James B. Smith urged “prompt engagement to explain the US action and identify what specific concerns led to Saudi Arabia’s inclusion in the list.”\n\nSyria: “Wrong to Say Terrorists Come from Just These Countries”\n\nFor the most part, all Syrians from government officials to students to journalists to businesspeople were enraged by the designation. They believed the designation might “deter Syrians from traveling to the US,” according to a cable sent out on January 11, 2010. Syria had been listed as a “state sponsor of terrorism” since 1979 so Syrians had become used to the increased attention that comes with that, but Syrians communicated frustration with being on the new list because they believed Syria had a “good track record of Syrian travelers to the US.”\n\nThe Syrian Young Entrepreneurs’ Association (SYEA) had its sixth anniversary gala dinner in Damascus on January 14. While attendees informed Charge d’Affaires Charles Hunter they were excited about the possibility of US-Syria relations improving, the arrival of a new US ambassador to Damascus and an “eventual end of US sanctions,” they displayed opposition to new TSA requirements for travelers coming from Syria.\n\nSYEA members called the measures “discriminatory” and a “form of humiliation.” They told stories of mistreatment at airports. One individual described how he was “consistently delayed at airports while in the United States after he presented his Syrian passport as identification.” Several indicated they would no longer be flying as a result of the measures.\n\nA January 11, 2010 cable indicates Vice Foreign Minister Faisal al-Miqdad was particularly upset. He explained, “For our people this is an immoral policy from a religious viewpoint because it is wrong to say terrorists come from just these 14 countries.” He believed the requirements would “dissuade Syrians from traveling to the US” and he bluntly stated, “f you do this, no Syrian will go to the US and we will torture you at our airports if you come here.” (According to Hunter, in reaction to US airport screening procedures Miqdad blocked visas for Homeland Security Department personnel, who were traveling to interview Iraqi refugees. This was in reaction to how he was treated at Dulles Airport in September of 2009.)\n\nAbdul Ghani Attar, a businessman who runs the Damascino Mall, questioned the designation noting how some Arab and Muslim countries had not been included. “\n\n“Look at Jordan, they are not on the list even though they have terrorists. One of them just bombed a CIA base in Afghanistan,” he said. His father, Syrian Arab Red Crescent President Abdul Rahman Attar, argued Syria had established its anti-terrorist credentials and did not deserve to be on the new list. “We have been fighting terrorism for years,” Attar said, referring to the late President Hafez Asad’s campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1980s.\n\nManager of Syriatel, Muhammed Lahham, criticized the measures and said, “We (Muslims) must not be taken as terrorists only because one crazy man tried to blow up an airplane. The new measures are unfair and humiliating.” Davidoff sales representative Maher Sheikh Khaled questioned said, “Would the U.S. accept that we apply the same measures on Americans at our airports? Of course they won’t.”\n\nFinally, the designation was problematic for Syrian students who were hoping to study in the US:\n\nDamascus University student Hussein Chalhoum reported many of his friends, especially young men, have cited the enhanced screening requirements as a reason to pursue study in France or Canada instead. “There is already a feeling that there is some discrimination against Arabs in the U.S. because of September 11, and so something like this makes it harder to get the courage to go there,” he said. Omar Kahwaji, a masters student, criticized the measures as discriminatory. “If the measures were applied on everybody it would be kind of reasonable. But applying them on holders of (only) certain nationalities is not acceptable.”\n\n“Whole Yemeni People are Penalized by Being Put on the Blacklist”\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Mohyadeen al-Dhabbi expressed concerns to a group of ambassadors on January 18. Upset about the designation of Yemen, he said, “Twenty-three million people, wherever they’re traveling, whatever they’re doing, they are wanted … The whole Yemeni people are penalized by being put on the blacklist.” Dhabbi recounted “successful efforts against al Qaeda” and how the Yemen government had killed and arrested many extremists. This was why he was furious with the “collective punishment” being “inflicted” on the people of Yemen by the new procedures.\n\n“We don’t know who these (procedures) serve. We need the Yemeni people with us in the fight against terrorism,” Dhabbi stated. “The procedures create the impression that the international community regards all Yemeni travelers as potential extremists, leaving the Yemeni public mistrustful of counterterrorism efforts.” US ambassador Stephen Seche tried to explain the procedures were not meant to “target the citizens of any nation” but to address “gaps in aviation security.” Dhabbi responded, “There is a better way.”\n\nWhen the ambassador was met with the reaction, the designation had not been reported in the Yemeni press. Seche believed this new designation could become a “sticking point” in US-Yemen relations and suggested, “The planned visit of an ATA team to Sana’a International Airport to assist in upgrading the airport’s security procedures presents an opportunity to put a better face on USG efforts to improve aviation security in Yemen.”\n\nThe “Shoe Bomber” Was from Britain. Why Wasn’t the UK Put on a List After That Incident?\n\nThe country where Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was born, Nigeria, did not like the designation either. Foreign Minister Ojo Maduekwe believed it would “mar the image of the nation during the lead-up to Nigeria’s 50-year anniversary.” He blamed what happened on the actions of a “stupid young man” and, according to a cable sent out on January 21, 2010, he asked Deputy Homeland Security Jane Holl Lute to reconsider the designation.\n\nDespite that, authorities in charge of security were much more willing than other countries on the list to advance security cooperation. Lute discussed aviation security with Harold Demuren, Director General of Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). Demuren, a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was sad about the events. He told Lute all options were on the table and indicated a willingness to work with DHS to establish a US air marshals program in Nigeria. Demuren also gave Lute a “package of documents” with information on Abdulmutallab’s activities prior to the attempted bombing. (A package of material was also passed on to the FBI.)\n\nFollowing the incident, former President George W. Bush and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke with Acting President Goodluck Jonathan on February 21. Jonathan raised the issue of the designation and talked about Abdulmutallab:\n\nJonathan joked that “Nigerians don’t want to die” and that suicide bombers like Abdulmutallab possessed “traits alien to the nation,” which were usually inculcated from abroad. He observed that most extremists since September 11, 2001, have not come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and “had stayed in some of the best cities in the world, but received some bad influences while they were there.” Former President Bush observed that it was never the leaders who were suicide bombers, but “some poor kid” whom the leaders had brainwashed into committing the attack… … Acting President Jonathan decried the effect Nigeria’s inclusion on the TSA watch list would have on foreign investment, economic development, and job creation. “No investor will want to be associated with a country without free movement,” he lamented. Jonathan said, although he recognized Bush as a former President, he remarked that he still retained influence as a former leader. The former President declared that “I don’t have anything to do with Government any longer” and, turning to the Ambassador, quipped that “It’s her job now.” He added that “I’m sure that our diplomats will work through these issues.” He explained that the best aspect of retirement was that he was not responsible for these difficult and sensitive issues anymore\n\nEven more fascinating are the views Muslim scholars, government officials, politicians, professors, students and civil society representatives expressed. During a visit by officials to the northern Nigerian state of Sokoto, residents explained Nigerian Muslims felt they were now being “harshly judged and discriminated against by the US, which has led people to become angry and suspicious.”\n\nMuslim scholar Khalid said the Abdulmutallab incident is “strange” to Nigeria since suicide bombing is not part of Nigerian culture, which contributed to skepticism and conspiracy theories. Khalid expressed skepticism over the ability of Abdulmutallab to pass through the various security screenings if he had had the bomb materials on him at the time. He asserted the possibility that Abdulmutallab had undergone “hypnosis” after which someone had planted the bomb on him. He even wondered whether the U.S. might have set up the incident as an excuse to invade Yemen. Echoing arguments heard from other Nigerian interlocutors, Khalid questioned why the U.S. had not placed Great Britain on a security watch list after the “shoe bomber” incident or after learning that Abdulmutallab had received much of his higher education in London.\n\nSokoto State Secretary Athair Mohammed of the Opposition Democratic People’s Party (DPP) claimed the inclusion would do “irreparable” damage to US-Nigeria relations. He added the “US should not place names of individuals on any watch list, as he feared that persons with similar names would suffer.”\n\nA professor called the listing a “miscarriage of justice” and said 150 million Nigerians should not be held “accountable for one person’s actions.” The professor suggested the US extradite Abdulmutallab to Nigeria for “prosecution and sentencing.”\n\nSeveral students doubted accounts of the incident involving Abdulmutallab. They thought the incident could have been a conspiracy. A director of a university center of peace studies offered to organize a discussion with students but told an official arranging the discussion “some people had become suspicious of his intentions and asked if he was CIA.” Professors refused to meet with the officials and added the Muslim scholars said people, who support development programs, are seen by some as US agents.\n\nUS Ambassador Robin Renee Sanders considered these “suspicions and skepticisms” to be the product of “paranoia and disinformation frequently promoted by extremist websites and other Islamist portals.” She blamed the reactions on “low literacy, underdevelopment and relative isolation.” And, she concluded that the people she talked to her were just the kind of people who needed to be watched because they could easily be manipulated by extremists.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor what it’s worth, here’s the cable Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent out to diplomats, which they were to use in meetings with officials that were angry over the listing. If one goes by the cables, it doesn’t look like they worked, but then do they need to? The US was probably able to get away with the designations because at the end of the day leaders would get over it because what would they do? Quit accepting military or economic aid? Abandon their role as partners in the global war on terror? No way.",
  "latent_31894": "Healthcare\n\nThe Republican Study Committee hosted a bicameral panel today to discuss “the Obama Administration’s abuses of power and its refusal to enforce current laws on the books.” Senator Ted Cruz showed up at the last minute in cowboy boots to put an exclamation point on the whole thing.\n\n“The fight we are engaged in in the next 60 days is the most important fight of this Congress,” he said, referring to fight to defund Obamacare. Cruz said the “single best opportunity to defeat Obamacare” will fall on the shoulders of the House.\n\n“The way that makes sense to proceed is [to] begin in the House with y’all passing a continuing resolution that…prohibits both discretionary and mandatory funding to Obamacare,” he said. “President Obama and Harry Reid will scream and yell that [mean] Republicans want to shut down the government. Stand up and fight.”\n\nCruz stressed the urgency of preventing people from becoming “hooked on the sugar and hooked on the subsidies” of Obamacare before they become a “permanent feature of our economy going forward.”“If we don’t stand and fight now, we never will,” he said. “If we don’t stand and defund Obamacare today, we are saying we surrender.”\n\n“What is the alternative to the continuing resolution?” Cruz asked. He said other attempts to defund Obamacare are “symbolic statements” that won’t become law under Harry Reid.\n\nCruz finished by saying the “fight is going to prove a very different kind of fight” in that it will not come from politicians in Washington, but from the American people who oppose Obamacare and who have signed and will sign the petition at dontfundit.com.\n\nObamacare was the topic of focus during the panel, but Congressman Darrell Issa was on hand to speak of the numerous other scandals which he, as chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has been aggressively pursuing. Issa said the basis for President Obama referring to the Benghazi, Fast and Furious, and IRS scandals as “phony” comes from the fact that the fault comes to fall on the president’s political appointees.\n\nIssa clarified that the “vast majority” of these scandals are revealed through investigation by the inspector general’s office. He said the job of the Oversight Committee is to “follow the facts…[to]uncover waste, fraud, and abuse.”\n\n“If the president hides those facts, we will find them, and we will report them,” Issa said.\n\nSenator Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania, chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, proposed legislation that his staff is working on to grant American citizens the ability to file a lawsuit against the federal government to fight infringement on their First Amendment rights. He said such a bill would “hold people accountable” and enable release of documents “we ought to be getting.”\n\n“People deserve to get that justice,” Toomey said.",
  "latent_32016": "A group of millenial whites, dressed like misfits, initiated organized chaos around the Jefferson Davis statue in Mid City on Monday night. NOPD had officers on site, but their presence was not known until late in the hostility.\n\nI grew up knowing New Orleans people don’t protest. It’s not in our blood.\n\nMitch Landrieu’s monument controversy has brought protests to town. The pro monument supporters are mostly Southerners and folks from Louisiana, but outside of the Big Easy. They are peaceful, mainly sitting in lawn chairs and engaging in conversation. The Antifascist protesters instigate trouble. These anarchists are not from New Orleans either. They have maybe 1-3 years here, possibly at local colleges, from the ones I spoken with.\n\nBut that doesn’t stop the Antifas from imposing moral superiority. They sing, “Get the f**k out of New Orleans” over and over. They chant, “Go home Nazi scum.” It’s a stomach-churning scene for true New Orleanians.\n\nThe NOPD chose not to engage in the protest that also occurred there on Saturday. Several monument supporters attempted to file police reports when Antifas attacked from the darkness on Saturday. Police officers would not file reports.\n\nThe NOPD has largely ignored all acts of lawlessness at ground zero. A gun shot was fired Thursday night from the dark neutral ground of Jeff Davis Parkway towards the supporters. Antifas drinking at The Holy Ground bar told police it was one of the preservationists. “He has a gun!” Indeed, he did. Police checked, it was not fired, the handgun was on display on his leg, perfectly legal in the open carry state. Police would not file a report.\n\nSince then, Jeff Davis has witnessed more attacks on monument supporters, more conversations with police, no reports.\n\n“All we really want is for law enforcement to perform their duty and uphold the law,” monument supporter George Peterson said. Peterson has been out at the Davis monument several times and reported that the ANTIFA protesters assaulted monument supporters including a 63 year old black woman who came from Oklahoma. On Saturday night, a preservationist asked an officer for help. He was told NOPD was ordered not to “interfere.” The supporter took a picture of the officer asking with his vehicle number. New Orleans news outlets have yet to report on NOPD’s stand-down.\n\nThe intimidation from the anarchists on Monday night at the Jeff Davis monument forced several gun-toting preservationists to leave. The anarchists taunted the pro-monument people, stealing a flag and burning it. The American flags that surrounded Davis were removed by the anarchists. Someone jumped on the monument base and threw aside candles and flowers that were set up as a memorial. The anarchists cheered as the police provided protection to the monument supporters as they left, but the anarchists soon, predictably, turned on police.\n\nNOPD made a few arrests, mainly the fascist anarchists, although one preservationist was taken. As the police walked a fascist woman to an NOPD vehicle, the hostile crowd chased police while chanting loudly, “Cops and Klan go hand in hand!” repeatedly. As they locked her up, the whining fascists yelled, “Let her go” to no avail. Then the order, “Block the street” was yelled as the criminal was being taken away. The anarchists tried to stop police from leaving with their fellow fascist. It failed.\n\nThe police masterfully managed the crowd from that point on. In a few minutes, they had all anarchists across the neutral ground and on the lake side of Canal Boulevard from Davis. Concerns raised that this was a cover to slyly remove Davis, but the Confederate President still stands.\n\nThe anarchists made their way to the P.G.T. Beauregard monument during the night and threw red paint on it as well as placing signs. NOFD tried to clean off the monument.\n\nThe anarchists are here. They are starting protests and getting away with sneaky assaults. NOPD is watching hostility escalate until it is on the verge of boiling over. The anarchists are on the same side as Mitch Landrieu. They claim to be “from New Orleans.” While real New Orleanians sit at home and watch their city get destroyed by angry girls who aggressively get in people’s faces and skinny-jean-wearing boys waving “Anti-Fascist” flags calling everyone who disagrees with them “Nazi scum.” This is intimidation and threats not reported by news outlets. This is Mitch’s New Orleans – it’s not yours.",
  "latent_32021": "I stumbled upon a very strange bug in PHP; this statement sends it into an infinite loop:\n\n<?php $d = 2.2250738585072011e-308; ?>\n\n(The same thing happens if you write the number without scientific notation — 324 decimal places.)\n\nI hit this bug in the two places I tested for it: on Windows (PHP 5.3.1 under XAMPP 1.7.3), and on Linux (PHP Version 5.3.2-1ubuntu4.5) — both on an Intel Core Duo processor. I’ve written a bug report.\n\nWhat’s Going On?\n\nAs a string, 2.2250738585072011e-308 causes no problems; it’s when it’s treated as a numeric value that the bug hits.\n\nThis works:\n\n<?php $d = '2.2250738585072011e-308'; echo $d; ?>\n\nbut this doesn’t:\n\n<?php $d = '2.2250738585072011e-308'; echo $d + 0; ?>\n\nI don’t have a debug build of PHP available, but I did poke around in the source code (version 5.2.8). I found zend_strtod.c, which appears to be based on a very old version of David Gay’s strtod() function. I don’t know if zend_strtod() is even called in this case, but it was simple enough for me to isolate it and run it outside of PHP — under Visual C++ in fact. It did not hang on that input. (Update: zend_strtod() is called, and I can hang zend_strtod() in Visual C++ if I compile with all optimizations.)\n\nWhat’s Special About 2.2250738585072011e-308?\n\n2.2250738585072011e-308 represents the largest subnormal double-precision floating-point number; written as a hexadecimal floating-point constant, it’s 0x0.fffffffffffffp-1022. 2.2250738585072011e-308 is one of five 17-digit decimal values that convert (correctly) to 0x0.fffffffffffffp-1022:\n\n2.2250738585072007e-308\n\n2.2250738585072008e-308\n\n2.2250738585072009e-308\n\n2.2250738585072010e-308\n\n2.2250738585072011e-308\n\nOnly 2.2250738585072011e-308 causes the problem. It happens to be the largest of the five decimal values, so I guess that matters somehow.\n\nIf you have any thoughts on what the bug is, please let me (or PHP) know.\n\nIs This Serious?\n\nI’ve gotten no response to my bug report yet, but I can’t help but wonder: is this serious? Could you bring down a Web server by entering this constant in a PHP-based form?\n\nUpdate\n\nYes, it’s serious.\n\n1/4/2011: There is a lot of discussion about this, in addition to the comments below; for example, see\n\nAnd as pointed out in the comments, equivalent forms of the number also cause the problem:\n\nVariations on the placement of the decimal point: 0.22250738585072011e-307, 22.250738585072011e-309, 22250738585072011e-324, etc.\n\nLeading zeros: e.g., 0 2.2250738585072011e-308.\n\n2.2250738585072011e-308. Trailing zeros: e.g., 2.2250738585072011 0 e-308.\n\ne-308. Leading zeros in the exponent: e.g., 2.2250738585072011e- 0 308.\n\n308. (Combinations of the above)\n\nYou can also alter the full 324 decimal place version of the number with leading and trailing zeros.\n\n1/22/2011: I thought of another set of numbers that cause the same problem — numbers of 18 digits or more but with the same 17 digit prefix. For example:\n\n2.22507385850720111e-308\n\n2.225073858507201123e-308\n\n2.22507385850720113099e-308\n\n2.225073858507201100001e-308\n\n2.2250738585072011123456789012345678901234567890123456789e-308\n\netc.\n\nIn decimal these numbers are distinct, but they all map to the same floating-point number.\n\nIt seems the only ones that cause a problem though are those whose 18th digit is 0, 1, 2, or 3 (2.22507385850720114e-308 doesn’t cause the problem, for example).\n\nUpdate: The Bug Has Been Fixed\n\nThe bug fix was released on 1/6/2011; this is from the PHP news release:\n\nThis release resolves a critical issue … where conversions from string to double might cause the PHP interpreter to hang on systems using x87 FPU registers.\n\nThe problem is known to only affect x86 32-bit PHP processes, regardless of whether the system hosting PHP is 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\nUpdate: An Analysis of the Bug and Its Fix\n\nI’ve found the specific cause of the bug, and why the fix fixes it; please see my article “Why “Volatile” Fixes the 2.2250738585072011e-308 Bug.”\n\nUpdate: The Real Problem Is the Old Copy of dtoa.c\n\nThis bug could have been avoided altogether if zend_strtod() was kept in sync with David Gay’s strtod(); see my article “A Better Fix for the PHP 2.2250738585072011e-308 Bug.”",
  "latent_32343": "Much to the dismay of my friends and colleagues at MLB.com, I want to strongly urge you to not cast your votes yet for this season’s All-Star Game.\n\nIt’s way to early and a vote now is a month too early unless you are absolutely convinced that James Loney is a .381 hitter.\n\nHowever, I do want to start a campaign to have Mariano Rivera start the All-Star Game\n\nI urge Jim Leyland and the powers that be in Major League Baseball that the starting pitcher in the All-Star Game on July 16 at Citi Field in New York City for the American League should be none other than the greatest closer of all-time, Mariano Rivera.\n\nWhy you ask?\n\nWhy not, I reply.\n\nNine to Know\n\nLet me make my case for the starters role for Mo:\n\nThere are no players who receive more attention in the days leading up to the game than the leagues’ starting pitchers. In this season, in which Mariano is retiring and awaiting his Hall of Fame induction, the attention should go to Rivera. After earning his 16th save of the season last night, there is no question that Mo is having an All-Star season, so his selection wouldn’t be a pity pick. The only discussion is whether he should start the game (hopefully against the Mets’ Matt Harvey ) or be saved for a save opportunity. We have no idea as to whether there will be a save situation and this way Rivera’s appearance would be insured and celebrated. There is a sketchy precedence for a great player to be honored through a position switch. In the 2001 All-Star Game in Seattle, Cal Ripken , Jr. received an enormous ovation as he was introduced in the pre-game starting lineup introductions,. Soon after the AL took the field in the top of the 1st, prior to the first pitch, shortstop Alex Rodriguez motioned to Ripken at third base to switch positions, giving him one last start at shortstop, the position where he earned much of his fame. Rivera starting would pit him against the best the NL has to offer. From the 6th inning on the game is filled with substitutes and often the mandatory one player from each team representative. Rivera against the true All Stars is what we want to see and with that as a tease MLB and FOX can assure themselves of a large first pitch audience. Think of the kids. By the time Rivera gets into this dragged-out game kids are in bed. By starting, kids are getting to see one of the greatest players to put on a uniform. It will be something that they can tell their children about. For those of you purists, I ask you: Does it really matter which inning in this exhibition game that the great Mariano actually pitches, or does it matter that we get to see him pitch? There is no finer gentleman in the game and this player, who is respected by so many of his peers, would never ask for the accolade which makes him all the more deserving.\n\nHere is Mariano All-Star Record\n\nYear Lg Age GS W L W-L% ERA GF SV IP H R ER HR BB SO 1997 AL 27 0 0 0 0.00 1 1 1.0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1999 AL 29 2000 AL 30 0 0 0 0.00 1 0 1.0 2 1 0 0 0 0 2001 AL 31 2002 AL 32 0 0 0 0.00 0 0 1.0 1 0 0 0 0 0 2004 AL 34 0 0 0 0.00 1 0 1.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2005 AL 35 0 0 0 0.00 1 1 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2006 AL 36 0 0 0 0.00 1 1 1.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2008 AL 38 0 0 0 0.00 0 0 1.2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2009 AL 39 0 0 0 0.00 1 1 1.0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2010 AL 40 2011 AL 41 12 Yrs (8 GP) 0 0 0 0.00 6 4 8.0 5 1 0 0 0 5 View Original Table\n\nGenerated 5/15/2013.
