  "latent_37": "reuters The US economy gained 222,000 jobs in June, many more than expected, according to a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday.\n\nEconomists had forecast that nonfarm payrolls increased by 178,000, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe excess number of people employed in June over those who were laid off or fired was revised upward for both April and May. That left the June job gains roughly in line with the average increases this year and did not vastly change the overall picture of employment.\n\n\"The bottom line is that jobs are out there, and job hunters with marketable skills are in a good position to move on or move up,\" said Jim Baird, the chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.\n\nThe unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% from a 16-year low of 4.3%. The increase was viewed as a positive indication that more people were entering the workforce, as the labor-force participation rate indeed increased to 62.8% from 62.7%.\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics\n\nWage growth was softer than expected and unchanged from May. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.2% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.\n\nEconomists expect wages to be rising at an even faster pace because the unemployment rate is near a postcrisis low, and so there should be more competition for skilled workers. But some Federal Reserve officials have noted that the lower unemployment rate is not lifting workers' pay the way it used to partly because productivity is lower.\n\nRetail hiring rose for the first time since January, pausing an exodus of jobs from large department stores that are losing ground to e-commerce. Retail trade gained 8,100 jobs overall, though hiring fell on net in car dealerships, electronics stores, and clothing stores.\n\nThe healthcare sector contributed the most jobs, at 37,000. The coal industry added no jobs.",

I’d play that!” whenever you’ve seen one of their “fake” games during the benchmark run. Watching the footage for Shattered Horizon, one realizes that they have finally made that game.\n\nSet in a near-Earth space of forty years in the future, the game pits ISA astronauts against MMC (Moon Mining Corporation) guards in an armed conflict surrounding a catastrophic mining accident.\n\nMultiplayer mode will allow 32-player maps, with extensive online leaderboards and stats tracking.\n\nThe game is PC only, and will run on Windows Vista and Windows 7. Futuremark are known for their punishing, boundary-pushing benchmarks; could this be the next “Crysis”?\n\nThe website reveals some details about weapons and gameplay, but one worrisome thing is that it appears there is only one gun available to the players, in addition to grenades. The gun has ranged, close-up, and melee modes, but the lack of variety could become tiresome very quickly.",
  "latent_141": "Invicta FC returns this Saturday night and for the first time fans will be able to catch all the action on UFC Fight Pass.\n\nThe main event at Invicta FC 8 is between the Atomweight Champion Michelle “The Karate Hottie” Waterson and Japanese veteran Yasuko Tamada. This will be Waterson’s first title defense since taking the belt from Jessica Penne at Invicta FC 5 back in April of 2013.\n\nThe 28-year-old had seventeen-months to sit around and wait to get back inside the cage. Not only was she inactive, but the organization hasn’t held an event since December 7.\n\nEven though there was the long lay-off, Waterson said she wasn’t just sitting around, in fact she did the complete opposite.\n\n“Ya know the usual drinking — no, ha ha. I’ve been spending a lot of time getting better. After you get the championship belt you feel like there is a target on your back,” Waterson told Sucka Radio. “Everyone is gunning for you, just like I was gunning for Jessica. I had no time to slack, I needed to get better. I’ve been working my strength and conditioning, I’ve been working my wrestling and just working on becoming an all around better fighter.”\n\nDuring the year and a half off, “The Karate Hottie” had time to reflect on her very exciting championship winning bout against Penne. The fight didn’t come without some hiccups for her, as she was almost finished in the third round with an extremely tight armbar. Her willpower proved that she had the tenacity of a champion and that prevailed in the end.\n\n“I think it made for a great championship fight. I feel like it was a lot of back and forth. I feel like at the end of the day both of us were great athletes, but I think equally talented with our technique and skill. But at the end of the day I feel like I had the more will. I was the one that came out victorious because I had the will to push through that adversity.”\n\nMMASucka.com spoke with Waterson’s opponent, Tamada, who stated that this will definitely be her ‘toughest fight to date.’ She also said fighting in America has always been a dream for her. Waterson made it crystal clear however that the belt will not be leaving the country.\n\n“I’m real eager to get back in the cage and so I’m hungry. This is my first title defense, so I’ve been training really hard. I don’t want to let that belt go — especially to someone that doesn’t live in the States. You know I keep that belt here in America.”\n\nBeing a 105-pound fighter, you would think there aren’t too many training partners for “The Karate Hottie,” but she said there are not only a good group of girls, but she also trains with some of the lighter fellas as well — including UFC flyweight contender John Dodson.\n\n“John [Dodson] is definitely one of my great training partners and his little brother — his little big brother, I train with him a lot and there are a lot of up and comers that are smaller as far as the guys go. Jodie Esquibel is another 105’er that is at the gym and then we also have Celine Haga who came over from Norway and she’s actually a 105’er too. We have Emily Kagan, she’s a 115’er, so there’s actually a good group of girls that are my size that I can get in there and scrap with.”\n\nWhen she said that she trained with the men, a lightbulb went off and Julianna Pena’s name popped up. No, Waterson has never been injured training with an overzealous male fighter and there is one reason for that — ‘The Regulators’.\n\n“No, no, no not at all. It’s funny, when you have a gym like Jackson’s there’s always a guy that’s new that wants to get in there and prove a point. Sometimes they feel like they need to do something. I remember when I first started training at Jackson’s there was a guy that was going just a little too hard (they call me ‘Peanut’ at the gym). The guy was going a little too hard with Peanut, so we have these other guys we call ‘The Regulators’ . So then we just put them in with The Regulators the next round and straighten them out right away.”\n\nAt Invicta FC 8, not only will Waterson be fighting in the evening’s main event, but her training partners Jodie Esquibel and women’s veteran Tara LaRosa will also be featured on the fight card.\n\nIt isn’t too often that a numerous fighters at one camp are all peaking at the same time, so Waterson was lucky to have a few different shoulders to lean on.\n\n“It’s great. It kind of gives you a sense of comfort knowing that you’re not the only one going through the motions in there. It’s nice to be able to go through those emotions with somebody else when you’re having a bad day. You don’t feel too bad when somebody else is having a bad day too. Or sometimes they might be having a bad day and I’m the one there helping get their spirits up and vice versa.”\n\nListen to the full interview with Michelle Waterson on this week’s episode of Sucka Radio.",

  "latent_232": "AT&T killed all-you-can-eat wireless data. Which sadly was inevitable. But if I'm paying for bytes like I do for minutes, why don't I get rollover data, too?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe premise of AT&T's new wireless data plans is simple. They've gone to the same pricing model for data that they've always had for voice. Just like paying $40 for 450 minutes of talk time or $60 for 900 minutes, you pay $15 for 200 megabytes, or $25 for 2 gigabytes of data. You're buying a set amount of data for a fixed price, so you pay per byte, just like you pay per minute. Same deal. It breaks down like this:\n\nAT&T is the only major carrier in the US to offer rollover minutes as a standard perk. Any minutes you don't use \"roll over,\" banking them to use later, like on a rainy day when you're really bored and just want to sit on the phone for hours. You pay for 1400 minutes a month, but only talk for 950. Those leftover 450 minutes are added to your general pool of minutes, so you'd have 1850 to use the following month. The net effect is that you're legitimately buying the minutes, in the same way you purchase a 12-pack of soda for $5.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf AT&T is going to count bytes like minutes, you should get rollover bytes. If you pay for 2 gigs of data, you should get 2 gigs of data. If you only use 500 megabytes that month, the leftover 1.5GB should rollover to the next month. Particularly since there's no middle ground between the two new plans—there's a massive gulf, 1000 percent wide, between 200MB and 2GB. So a lot of iPhone users are stuck, since they use somewhere between 200MB and 2GB of data—not skimpy enough to grab the cheaper $15-a-month plan, but not anything approaching 2GB. (A $20 500MB plan would be dead on for most iPhone owners, I think—which is probably why it doesn't exist.)\n\nRollover data would make AT&T's argument that the new plans are about value—not simply strangling the most hardcore data users taxing the network—way more convincing, since it would make the plans address the issue of network capacity in a tangible way.\n\nUnfortunately, it's highly unlikely that AT&T is particularly interested in fairness, or at least in the idea of you actually using all the data you pay for. AT&T senior VP of data and voice products Mark Collins' response about why they're charging $20 extra for the privilege of tethering says it all:\n\nThat capability is enabling something you can't do today. You can use one device and get multiple connections so it's more useful to you. You're going to use more data so the price is based on the value that will be delivered. [emphasis mine]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn't make any sense at face value, because you're paying for every byte of data you consume, and the tethering fee doesn't give include additional data—it comes out of the 2GB you're already paying for. The subtext is that AT&T doesn't actually expect most people to use that 2GB, and in fact, they don't want you to—which is they make it more expensive to make it easier to use.\n\nLook, I'll pay per byte. Just give me all the bytes I pay for.\n\nHat tip to Giz reader Ryan Henson for throwing this suggestion our way\n\nClick to view",
  "latent_425": "Typically, a president works hand in hand with federal agencies to enact policy, but Donald Trump is clearly dead set on shattering that mold. Just two weeks into his presidency, he has once again sent the federal government into complete chaos with a single stroke of his pen: President Trump has signed into law a piece of paper containing only the words “HOT CUBE,” and federal agencies have been scrambling to figure out just what that means ever since.\n\nOof. Looks like the Trump administration really bungled the rollout on this one.\n\nJust minutes after Trump’s “HOT CUBE” order was signed this morning, the State Department, unsure how to interpret the two-word directive, recommended that all its employees avoid cubes of any temperature until further clarification from the president. An equally confused CDC issued an immediate memorandum that all cubes must be heated to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for safety, while military leaders began drawing up plans for an air raid on Cairo, certain that the president’s “hot cubes” were a coded reference to Egypt’s desert pyramids. The Department of Homeland Security, meanwhile, temporarily grounded all flights that did not have hot cubes on board, before later reversing their stance and declaring that only hot-cube-free planes were safe for travel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYikes. Members of the president’s staff have gotten their wires crossed, to say the least.\n\nThough he’s presenting a strong front, it looks as though even Sean Spicer is a bit baffled by this latest order: “Hot Cube has so far been a resounding success and will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the greatest triumphs of this administration,” Spicer announced in a press conference shortly after the order had been issued. “President Trump’s order is ensuring that American cubes are among the hottest cubes in the world or condemning American cubes for being too hot, and either is something to applaud.”\n\nUm, okay. When not even the press secretary can make heads or tails of your order, you know you’ve really screwed up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor anyone who thinks they can parse Donald Trump’s meaning, here is the full text of the Executive Order:\n\nWhether “HOT CUBE” is a public policy, a military order, or merely an innocuous declaration of the president’s interests in 3D shapes remains to be seen. What its rollout does demonstrate is just how much disarray still persists in this new government, and how many communication hurdles Trump must overcome if he hopes to be the effective leader he claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat a mess.",

Deixaram seus cargos o diretor presidente Vagner de Castro e a diretora administrativo-financeira Ana Maria Érnica, ambos acusados pela Promotoria da prática de 2364 crimes de estelionato na gestão da cooperativa.\n\nA acusação, levada à Justiça no dia 8 de março, alcançou 16 investigados, entre os quais Lula, a mulher dele, Marisa Letícia, o filho mais velho do casal Fábio Luiz Lula da Silva, o Lulinha, o ex-tesouoreiro e ex-presidente da Bancoop João Vaccari Neto e o empreireito Léo Pinheiro, da OAS – empresa que assumiu diversos empreendimentos que a Bancoop não finalizou, entre eles o Condomínio Solaris, no Guarujá, onde fica tríplex 164/A, supostamente de propriedade do ex-presidente – o que é negado por Lula e seus advogados.\n\nA Promotoria acusa o petista por lavagem de dinheiro e falsidade ideológica. A Promotoria requereu a prisão preventiva de Lula, mas a juíza da 4.ª Vara Criminal da Capital, mandou os autos para o juiz federal Sérgio Moro, da Operação Lava Jato. O caso está nas mãos do ministro Teori Zavascki, do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), porque Lula foi nomeado ministro da Casa Civil e agora detém foro privilegiado.\n\nA renúncia do primeiro escalão da Bancoop deixou perplexos muitos cooperados.

  "latent_610": "By LUCY GUANUNA\n\nECHO PARK — Echo Park skaters will be happy to hear that a final design has been selected for an Echo Park Skate Park, and it’s more than twice the size originally envisioned. But it’s also more expensive than expected, leaving the city to find the necessary funds before construction can begin and skaters can start showing off on the rails and mini bowl planned for the park.\n\nSkaters as well as residents got to voice their opinions and vote on three concepts for the skate park, which will be built where a now empty public swimming pool is located next to the 101 Freeway onramp at Echo Park and Bellevue avenues.\n\nAs part of the community outreach, the Local Volunteer Neighborhood Oversight Committee held three meetings to discuss the pros and cons of each design, which were prepared by HMC Architects and the skate park design firm, Site Design.\n\nDuring the second community briefing, through an informal voting process, the designers were asked to combine two of the concepts into one design, according to information provided by the city. By the third meeting, the combined design was unanimously approved by the committee. This design has a small skating bowl in the middle of the skate park, and a “street style” skating design for the large area around the center bowl.\n\nInitially there was a discussion about the best location for the skate park, and a number of issues were considered, with safety being the first priority. One concept to place the skate park next to the existing children’s play area on Bellevue raised safety and compatibility concerns. As a result, the skate park was moved on the other side of the brick recreation center where a shallow pool, long out of service, is now located To protect this area, the skate park will have guardrails and trees to shield it from the onramp to the Hollywood Freeway, and will also have a heavy gauge chain link fence around the space.\n\nBut the approved skate park concept measures 7,000-square-feet in size, more than double the 3,000-square-foot park envisioned as part of a $500,000 Prop K grant that would pay for the facility. That means the city will have to find more cash to pay for the larger skate park.\n\n“The City is working to identify the required extra funding,” according to a summary by Richard Campbell with the city’s Bureau of Engineering. “Meanwhile, HMC and Site Design are proceeding with the final design, while the additional funds being sought. No construction will begin until such time as such funds are identified and allocated to the project.”\n\nAssuming funds are found, the skate park will take about a year to build.\n\nCan’t get enough Echo Park news?

  "latent_633": "Representative Joe Barton of Texas introduced a bill Friday that would allow for the legalization of online poker in the United States. The bill, named the “Internet Gambling Prohibition, Poker Consumer Protection, and Strengthening UIGEA Act of 2011,” would allow individual states to choose whether they want to allow residents access to online poker rooms.\n\n“Poker is an all-American game, and it’s a game that requires strategy and skill,” said Rep. Barton in a statement Friday. “Millions of Americans play poker online. Although it’s legal to play for money, it’s illegal to process the transactions that allow players to collect their earnings.”\n\n“We want to have an iron-clad system to make sure that those who play for money are playing in an honest, fair system where they can reap the benefits of their winnings. To put it simply, this bill is about having the personal freedom to play a skill-based game you enjoy without fear of breaking the law. ”\n\nThe bill has 11 co-sponsors, including Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA), Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) and Rep. John Campbell (R-CA). Many parts of Barton bill look similar to the one drawn up by Frank last summer that never made its way through the Senate. Barton’s bill is fuzzy in some areas, but several regulations were drawn out regarding matters such as player age requirement, cheating, license eligibility, and deposit methods.\n\nThe bill would prohibit players from using credit cards for transactions and enforce an age limit of 21. Younger players would not be able to cash out any winnings, but would be responsible for any losses. Cheaters, meanwhile, could be charged with a federal crime, punishable by a fine and/or up to three years in prison. The bill mentions the use of bots as well as collusion as forms of cheating, but would not initially prohibit popular tracking programs such as PokerTracker or Hold’Em Manager.\n\nLike versions of online poker bills of the past, this bill would allow for only U.S. residents to play against one another, isolating Americans from playing against players from other countries as they had been accustomed to on sites like PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker.\n\nPlayers would also have the option of excluding themselves from playing on a particular site. Should they find a way to play during their self-exclusion, the same rules for under-aged players would apply for those caught in the act.\n\nThe legislation doesn’t have a timetable, but Barton and his supporters are in the process of moving it as quickly as possible. If passed, the bill would need to make its way through the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of the Treasury, and then the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The licensing framework would then begin under the supervision of the Department of Commerce. That department would have control over issuing licenses to online poker operators.\n\nThe Barton bill was met with overwhelming support Friday by the Poker Players Alliance (PPA), a Washington-based non-profit group formed to protect poker players’ rights. The PPA released a statement following the release of the bill:\n\n“On behalf of the PPA membership and millions of poker players across the country, I thank Congressman Barton for his commitment to protecting Americans’ freedom to play poker on the Internet,” said former Senator Alfonse D’Amato, chairman of the PPA. “As recent events have shown, the lack of clarity surrounding online poker has wreaked havoc on Americans who choose to play this great game both for fun and in some cases as their profession. Congressman Barton’s bill aims to bring clarity to the law, while implementing tough consumer protections and providing a mechanism for the Federal and state governments to collect billions of dollars in revenue. ”\n\nCongressman Barton will make an appearance at the World Series of Poker Saturday to announce the ceremonial “Shuffle Up and Deal” for Event #43, a $1,500 No Limit Hold ’em tournament, at Noon PT. Players can voice their support of the bill to him in person at the Rio, or send a customized email to their member of Congress urging him or her to support the Barton bill.",
  "latent_752": "Antti Vedenpää and Harri Lehikoinen were disappointed at some of the meat mugs because they had salad hidden at the bottom. Photos by: Antti Sepponen\n\nIt's Sunday evening and four middle-aged men are gathered around a table in a pub. In front of them are seven mugs covered with tin foil. Each is filled with different kinds of kebab meat, sauces and salad.\n\n\"Let's be honest with this one. It's donkey shit\", says Antti Vedenpää who just ate some kebab meat from a 0,5-litre Pepsi meat mug, or Lihamuki as the Finns call it. Antti is one of four \"Meat Mug Board Members\" who are here to decide what mug with contents is considered to be the best in Lahti – and ultimately – the world. The other board members are Harri Lehikoinen, Kai Lindroos and Jani-Petteri Uhrman. Jani-Petteri holds the title as 2013's Meat Mug World Champion.\n\nThe reason for the board's gathering is the Meat Mug World Championship, organised by Antti and that will be held for the third time on Saturday. Thanks to Lahti Is a Paradise that VICE published last year, the meat mug has risen to national fame and Finnish mainstream media is suddenly cheering for the mug and its contents. Here, national media tend to focus a lot of energy on how Finland and the Finnish are portrayed outside the country's boarders. VICE's mention of Lahti accidently boosted the Finnish self-esteem. Probably because it was published right after mobile-giant Nokia sold its smartphone production to Microsoft, which became a national tragedy in a way. Even though the meat mug in itself isn't anything special, it has become a collective joke everyone can relate to. Also, it's the best 3AM-snack in the world.\n\nOne of the board members, Kai Lindroos.\n\nThis year the World Championship will be held in the Rooster Pub located in the city-centre of Lahti. The buzz around the mug has grown so big that it's currently on everybody's lips – literally. Will Antti's initiative mark Finland as a world-leader once again?\n\nThe moment of truth is near as the Meat Mug Board is ready to announce the best meat mug of 2014. A reporter and press photographer from Lahti-based regional newspaper Etelä-Suomen Sanomat are present. The flash is going mental and the reporter is ready with his pen.\n\n\"Is this something illegal or what is going on?\" An old lady next to me suddenly yells, clearly under the influence.\n\nJani-Petteri Uhrman is currently the Meat Mug Champion.\n\nThe board has voted the meat mug from Jonen Grilli as the best. \"The meat is OK, the sauce is really nice and there wasn't really any salad in it.\"\n\n\"No salad?\"\n\n\"It's a meat mug, not a fucking meat-and-salad mug\", says Antti. \"Jone [the grill owner] will deliver the meat mugs for the World Championship\", he then declares.\n\nThe board underlines that a meat mug isn't about quality kebab or meat. It's a matter of an \"eating experience\".\n\nThe kebab used in the meat mugs can be any kind of meat. There's pork with garlic sauce in the winner mug.\n\nThe rules of the Meat Mug World Championship are simple: One eats the meat as fast as one can. Then the meat has to be held inside the body for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\n\"It would be cheating if you just homp everything in, declare yourself a winner, and then gag it all out immediately\", Antti explains.\n\nThis year there are only three competitors taking part in the championship: Last year's champion Jani-Petteri, a local anonymous challenger, as well as a \"world representative\".\n\nApart from Jani-Petteri, it's unclear who the others are.\n\nThe local reporter writes notes to his memo as quickly as he can when he interviews the board members. It is vital for the paper to announce what grill serves the best meat mug in the city. Once the paper goes to print, Jone's only worry in the world will be to maintain the quality of his meat mugs and make sure they are as indestructible as Nokia's 3310s.\n\n\"How do you want your meat mug? When is the meat mug at its best?\", the reporter asks Jani-Petteri, who clearly is an expert in the field. \"Usually I don't remember where I've ordered my meat mug. I tend to eat it the morning after so it has marinated in the fridge.\"\n\nIn fact, people tend to be piss-drunk when they get their mugs. \"It's not the same to eat these when you're sober. You should be wasted as fuck to feel the spirit\", Antti says. Everyone laughs and agrees.\n\nJonen Grilli's meat mugs were chosen the best of 2014. You can have your own culinary experience for €6,50.\n\nAlthough the board members seem to be taking the Lihamuki pretty seriously, the Meat Mug World Championship was initially meant to be taken lighthearted. For example, the event has never had a single foreign competitor even though the name suggests it has.\n\n\"The closest foreigner yet is our champion who is born in Stockholm, Sweden. There have been some people applying from Europe, but they've always chickened out\", Antti says.\n\nIt appears as if the Meat Mug World Championship has grown to become a spectacle and is now a matter of national concern.\n\nThe World Championship is held during the hardcore punk festival Roosterfest. Rooster Pub is a small room for a handful of people. \"Next year I'm going to separate the Meat Mug World Championship from Roosterfest and make it an event of its own\", Antti dreams. \"The joke has already gotten out of hand and been exaggerated so it'd be stupid to stop now. Let's hit the pedal and go all the way\", he laughs.\n\nThe Meat Mug World Championship will be held tomorrow, Saturday February the 22nd, at Rooster Pub in Lahti, Finland.",

First, Urmson: he recently wrote a lengthy blog post on Medium yesterday to explain his move.\n\n\"After leading our cars through the human equivalent of 150 years of driving and helping our project make the leap from pure research to developing a product that we hope someday anyone will be able to use, I am ready for a fresh challenge,\" Urmson wrote.\n\n\"It has been a tremendous privilege and honor to be part of a team that has been at the forefront of bringing this life-saving technology to the world. I feel lucky to have played a role in building this team from a handful of people into the world-class team it is today, readying self-driving cars that will soon take you from A to B at the push of a button. If I can find another project that turns into an obsession and becomes something more, I will consider myself twice lucky.\"\n\nThe two other big names departing Google's vehicular project are Jiajun Zhu, one the project's top software engineers and one of its founding members—as Recode reported—as well as Dave Ferguson, another top software engineer. The The New York Times reports that both are heading out to launch an undisclosed startup.\n\nGoogle confirmed Urmson's departure in a statement, but didn't mention anything about the other two.\n\n\"Seven years ago, the idea that a car could drive itself wasn't much more than an idea. Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this lifesaving technology will soon become a reality. He departs with our warmest wishes,\" reads a statement from an Alphabet spokesperson. Google's self-driving car project is one of the pet projects of X, the research arm of Alphabet.\n\nAccording to the Times, Urmson had disagreed with the direction of the car project, and he made those concerns known to Alphabet CEO Larry Page and car project CEO John Krafcik a number of months ago. (Krafcik just joined the project last year after Google hired him away from Hyundai America.) However, according to Urmson, these disagreements were not the reason for his decision to leave the project.\n\n\"I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands. There are many other problems or products this talented group of people could work on, but they've chosen self-driving cars because they understand the impact their work can have on making our roads safer and bringing everyday destinations within reach for millions of people. I will be cheering along and following their progress,\" he wrote.",

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nOne of the saddest things about being an old-school RPG fan is just how misunderstood one of the most traditional and exciting RPG systems is: the Turn-Based combat.\n\nFor many gamers, turn-based combat is best know as \"JRPG combat\". And it's often seen as outdated, slow, unrealistic, repetitive and many other unflattering adjectives.\n\nThere are many reasons for this. In the West, Turn-Based RPGs dominated the 80s but, with the rise of FPS and RTS games, they started to be replaced by Real-Time and Real-Time-with-Pause RPGs.\n\nAs TB games vanished from the shelves, misinformation, prejudice and hype-driven reporting stepped in - such as this infamous 2011 interview with InXile's president Matthew Findley, where he states that turn-based games were just a \"technical limitation\":\n\n\"I think these games always wanted to be action games at their heart. I think all those old turn-based games, it’s just that’s all the technology would allow.\"\n\nUgh.\n\nWhile JRPG series like Final Fantasy kept TB combat going for a while longer, the Japanese game industry had a lot of difficulties during the PS3 & Xbox 360 era. Fewer games were translated and crossed the oceans, and many of those were disappointments. For a while, the biggest news on Japanese games was Phil Fish saying that they suck.\n\nIn 2012 Kotaku's Jason Schreier even wrote an entire article just to counter-attack the perception that Japanese games are \"Stale, Old-Fashioned, Archaic, Obsolete, Out Of Touch Rehashes\".\n\nI completely agree with the article, but the fact that it had to be written says a lot.\n\nThankfully, things improved greatly since then. More JRPGs get localized, we have a more healthy & diverse industry open to trying different things and digital distribution made everything more accessible.\n\nToday you can open Steam or GoG and find all sort of Turn-Based RPGs, from indies like Age of Decadence, Lords of Xulima and Underrail to Japanese imports like Trails in the Sky, Strangers in Sword City and Hyperdimension Neptunia to big AAA titles like XCOM 2 and Divinity: Original Sin 2.\n\nIn fact, D:OS2 stands as this year's highest rated PC game on Metacritic! So let's take some time to celebrate Turn-based RPGs, looking at some of their most interesting systems!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this first article I'll focus on the basics: the so-called \"menu-based combat\", where there's little to no movement - your party stands in front of the enemy and trade blows until one side is dead.\n\nThis is what many consider the typical \"JRPG combat\", though it actually originated in the US - first in PLATO games from the 70s, then it matured with Wizardry: Proving Ground of the Mad Overlord (1981), as it was the first RPG to allow its players to create & control a party of characters in battle:\n\nI usually prefer holistic analysis, as game systems are (or at least should be) deeply interconnected, but for this article I'll just show some of the most common and interesting design choices regarding Turn-Based combat. It will be long, but hopefully it will be worth it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAction Order:\n\nOk, so the game is Turn-Based... but who goes first? Well, it depends.\n\nIn traditional Turn-Based games, each character has a turn. Turn order is usually decided by initiative/speed, and sometimes a very fast character can have more turns than a slow one. You can see this in games like Final Fantasy X, Temple of Elemental Evil, Fallout 1 & 2, the Gold Box games, etc.\n\nSome games - especially tactical ones such as X-COM, Disgaea or Jagged Alliance 2 - instead alternate between a \"player turn\", where you control all characters and attack, followed by an \"enemy turn\", were the opposing force does the same. This elevates the risk & reward: you can coordinate your attacks and deal a lot of damage, but then you'll have to endure the enemy doing the same.\n\nHowever, a few RPGs use instead a Phase-Based system (aka \"We-Go\"), where you and your opponent give orders to all characters and then the actions are executed all at once.\n\nThis is a more chaotic system, that requires some gambles. Let's say you are facing a strong monster and one that is near-death: how many characters should attack the near-death one? Just one? But what if the attack misses? Several? But if the first attack kills, then the others might be wasted...\n\nInitiative is also key. If one of your characters is dying, a fast monster might kill him/her before your slow Cleric can cast a healing spell - will you take the gamble, or order the Ninja to use a healing item?\n\nThis system was used mostly on older RPGs, such a Bard's Tale and Wizardry, but lives on in modern Wizardry clones, such as Etrian Odissey, Stranger Of Sword City or Elminage: Gothic.\n\nIn 1991 Final Fantasy IV introduced the ATB (Active Time Battle) system, where characters can act as soon as their ATB bars fill up. This remains the quintessential JRPG combat system for a lot of people - especially since it was used in several of Squaresoft JRPGs in the 90s, including FFVII:\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 expanded upon the concept, adding bonus damage when the player chains attacks together. Final Fantasy XIII added more flexibility: you could quickly execute weaker attacks, or wait for it to charge further and unleash stronger ones - a useful choice when trying to keep a combo up:\n\nIt's interesting to note that later Lightning Returns added do many nodes to the ATB bar that it effectivly plays like a stamina bar in a real-time RPG like Dark Souls.\n\nBravely Default elevated combat turns into a resource. Characters can skip turn to save them for later, attacking several times at once or using powerful attacks that take several turns to execute. They can also spend more turns than they saved, which will force them to helplessly stand still for a few turns.\n\nGrandia, on the other hand, made the turn order itself interactive - characters \"race\" each other on a timeline to select an action. Each action takes a certain time to be executed, and you can try to interrupt an enemy's attack, delay it or quickly prepare a defense before it lands. This system was later used in games like Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 & 4 and Child of Light:\n\nNowadays many gamers are familiar with the Persona series, where hitting an enemy with elemental magic he's weak to will negate his turn and leave him exposed. But the Turn Press system in the Shin Megami Tensei games goes much deeper. During your turn you get a certain number of points to use - and each action will consume some of those points.\n\nHowever, Critical hits or exploiting enemies' weakness consumes less points than normal, while a miss will consume more points. And if you screw up big - like using a spell the enemy can absorb, you lose ALL points and your turn will end.\n\nIt's an elaborate system, that requires you to know each enemy and their weakness, then exploit those to make your turn last as long as possible.\n\nPosition & Reach:\n\nWizardry 1 divided your characters into front & back row, meaning only the three characters in the front could physically attack & be attacked. The problem was that this limited party composition. For example, Mages and Priests could still cast spells from the back row, but the Thief class was useless in combat - it was too weak to be in the front row, but unable to cast spells from the back row.\n\nFinal Fantasy I \"solved\" this by making front & back rows more subtle - everyone can hit everyone, but characters in the front row deal & take full physical damage, while those in the back take & deal less:\n\nA better solution came in Wizardry V, with the addition of weapon range. Now characters from the back row could attack as well, as the game's manual anxiously explains:\n\nRecently, Lords of Xulima spiced things up, adding horizontal range: characters with short weapons can only attack adjacent enemies. In the image below, the far right goblin can only be attacked by the right-most Warrior or the bow-wielding Thief. For the Cleric to hit him, he'll have to move to the right:\n\nWizardry 8 revolutionized the concept by mixing a fully 3D world with a circular party formation. Now enemies could engage you from any direction, so being attacked from the left means that your right-side characters likely wouldn't be able to reach the enemy. Being surrounded means you have to spread your defenses thin, and enemies will likely have easy access to your fragile casters.\n\nMeanwhile, we also have games where position not only who can attack/be attacked, but also which skills can be used. In Darkest Dungeon some skills are only available if the character is in the two front slots, while others can only be used from the two back slots:\n\nA further example is Yumina: The Ethereal, where only the front-most character can attack - the others provide support, buffing the attack, debuffing the enemy or trying to interrupt/counter the enemy's buff/debuff. It looks chaotic, but it's quite intuitive:\n\nRadiant Historia inverts things by offering attacks that allows you to manipulate the enemy's position on the grid - you can push them into traps, into the range of AoE spells or pile them up in a single square, so that you can deal damage to all of them at once. The game even allows you to delay your turns, so that you can coordinate the attack better & land multiple hits with the same character:\n\nA common characteristic in all these games is that the heroes and the enemies are in separate fields - even when characters can move around, they cannot enter the opposing field.\n\nObviously, not every Turn-Based game follows this rule. There are RPGs where encounters take place in small tactical maps, like Albion or Agarest: Generatios of War; in large areas, like Final Fantasy Tactics or X-COM; in oddly-shaped arenas, such as Wild Arms 4 & 5; those with free movement inside a radius, such as Hyperdimension Neptunia; and even those set in large open worlds, like Jagged Alliance 2, Divinity: Original Sin or Fallout 1 & 2:\n\nHowever, these add several new elements, such as Action Points, Grids, Stances, Flanking, Attacks of Opportunity, etc... so we'll address them and Tactical RPGs another time.\n\nTimed button press / QTEs:\n\nAn advantage of TB combat is that during a character's attack the game & player are 100% focused on that single attack, so many games ask players to perform additional actions during the attack.\n\nA very common one is to press a button right when the attack/block happens, to make it more efficient. Several RPGs, from Paper Mario to Final Fantasy 8 make use of this feature.\n\nFinal Fantasy 8 actually takes it further. Some Limit Break attacks require special inputs - Squall's just asks players to time the button press correctly, but Zell's come with a long list of attacks that must be executed by pressing a specific button combination:\n\nA fan-favorite is Shadow Hearts' Judgment Ring system, where attacks require that players time their button presses to hit certain areas on a clock-like artifact:\n\nExecuting the attack is usually easy, but landing a critical requires hitting a very narrow area - and might lead to a miss. More than a gimmick, this is a key part of the game - different attacks have different rings, and some buffs/debuffs can affect the ring's speed or the size of the hit areas.\n\nIn a slightly different take, Mario & Luigi blended the brother's platforming skills with RPG by having not only timed button presses to boost attacks, but also asking players to jump with both characters to avoid attacks during the enemy's turn:\n\nOther games, like Valkyrie Profile and Agarest 2 go for a combo-like approach. In Valkyrie Profile each of the PSX's four face buttons is assigned to one party member. During your turn you can attack with each character a certain number of times - the goal is to make them combo the enemy with as many hits as possible - but the trick is that each hero has a different speed and attack type.\n\nIf you can coordinate all characters and land enough its in a short amount of time, you'll unleash extra special attacks. Of course, enemies won't just stand there - they may block or counter your moves.\n\nParty Members\n\nTurn-based games rely heavily on abstraction - mechanics over verisimilitude - or \"gamistic\" rather than \"simulationistic\", if you prefer. As such, they more easily acommodate mechanics like instantly swapping party members during battle - although it begs the question of WTF were they doing instead of fighting.\n\nPokémon, arguably the world's most popular Turn-Based RPG, uses character swapping as a core mechanic. You may have a party of six pokémons, but only one will fight at a time. This is complemented by the several Pokémon types, each with their strengths and weakness. A key part of the game is knowing which Pokémon to use and when to swap it.\n\nIf you push this concept to its ultimate limit, you get Labyrinth of Touhou. These games allow you to fight with a four-character party, but with eight more characters in the reserve, where they slowly regenerate. This is because characters are all very fragile - and there's no way to resurrect them mid-combat. You have to play smart, selecting characters with the appropriate attacks & resistances, then swapping them out a soon as their HP starts to go down:\n\nOther games, such as Breath of Fire 4, will keep extra party members as support. The game only allows three characters to battle (again, mechanics over realism), but the rest of the party stays in the back, occasionally using support skills. They can be instantly swapped with active characters, as well:\n\nMana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis also keeps half your party on the reserve, but you can swap them in mid-attack or even while defending. Not only this allows for extra damage, but you'll later unlock special finishing moves that require you to deal a certain number of combos, or use all characters in one attack.\n\nAnother design choice is to have a party, but only give players control over one character at a time. A few games do this, but IMHO the pinnacle of such system was Final Fantasy XII and its gambit system, where you \"program\" party members using a series of conditionals - \"IF health < 30%, USE Potion\", and so on:\n\nThe Last Remnant might be a mess of a game, but it's a very interesting mess. While most RPGs have between three and eight party members, here you have up to 18 characters at once, split in up to five different squads - each with their own formation. The stats of each squad are a mix between the individual character stats and a group average + current formation bonus:\n\nInstead of asking you to control all 18 characters, the game takes a more \"macro\" approach: you give orders like \"Full Attack!\" to each squad, and each character will use the attack they think works best.\n\nAnother example of fighting large scale battles is Sengoku Rance, in which you control generals & their armies. Their troops are their HP - and the more troops, the more damage they can deal:\n\nBTW, another unique aspect of Sengoku Rance is that battle & character has a turn limit. Each unit can only attack up to four times per battle, and battles can't last more than 24 turns. Once time ends, the side with the highest morale wins.\n\nTime-keeping & Status Effects:\n\nSpeaking of time, an cool side-effect of having turns is that it makes the passing of time much easier to measure & understand. Compare it to a Real-Time RPG: even if you know that a buff lasts 35 seconds, that doesn't clearly convey how many actions you're able to perform. In TB games, that's very simple to understand - it will just say \"this buff last five turns\".\n\nAs such, many TB games make great use of effects that happen over time, such buffs, debuffs and trade-offs - or even just annoying enemies that regenerate 20% HP each turn.\n\nThe Etrian Odyssey series has plenty of skills based on short time windows or temporary trade-offs - such as dealing more damage this turn but being left vulnerable; forfeiting a turn to boost damage for the next 2-3 turns; or dealing a lot of damage at once, then resting for 1-2 turns.\n\nCosmic Star Heroine has several systems that will make you carefully track time. Each turn both you and the enemies get stronger, so combat grows increasingly deadly. Also, every X number of turns your characters get a \"hyper\" buff, which grealty increases their damage.\n\nMoreover, there's no mana: each ability can be used once, then you must rest or defend to be able to use it again - effectively asking you to \"waste\" a turn to recharge your powers. Thus, knowing when to use your best attacks (ASAP to quickly kill enemies? When hyper activates? Later when they're more powerful?) and when to rest is key to surviving.\n\nOther games, such as Chrono Cross, play with the alternating nature of turns. Each spell you cast has an element color, which affects the battle's \"Field Effect\". Cast three Green spells in a row and the field will be 100% Green - this boosts characters that are attuned to the Green Element, and allows them to use higher-tier spells such as summons or ultimate moves.\n\nThe trick is that you control only three characters, so even if you cast three spells of the same color in a row, the next turn the enemy might cast a different color - or take advantage of the field for himself!\n\nYumina, which I mentioned previously, also does this with its shared mana bar: there are four colors of mana - if you cast a spell that costs 12 Green mana, the Green portion of the mana bar will go down by 12 and the other colors will go up by 4.\n\nIf you use too much of one color, you'll drain it - but also allow more powerful spells from other colors to be cast. All characters in battle draw from the same mana bar, so if the opponent has a powerful Red attack, you can use a heavy Red spell immediatly before him, leaving him out of mana.\n\nJoint Attacks\n\nAnother tradition of TB RPGs are joint attacks. Instead of having each character attack separately, two or more heroes join forces in a single attack. Several games do this, but Chrono Trigger is perhaps the most famous, with its double and triple techs:\n\nAh, the memories...\n\nBut Chrono Trigger is far from the only - or the best game at this. Suikoden II uses its massive 108 character roster to allow all sizes of joint attacks, from a double strike all the way to five humanoid squirrels joing forces to instantly kill an enemy:\n\nHowever, not all combination attacks are openly presented. Some games \"hide\" them - they occur when a specific sequence of attacks is inputted. In Phantasy Star IV, for example, instead of individually selecting what each character will do, you can create a macro - in theory to make combat faster, but using certain spells in a certain order leads to powerful attacks executed by multiple characters:\n\nTruly weird stuff\n\nFinally, we get to the truly weird & unique TB games.\n\nSD Snatcher is a spin-off of Hideo Kojima's adventure game Snatcher. The game can be described as a \"Turn-Based FPS\": each turn you choose a gun and aim with the crosshairs - you can destroy specific body parts of your enemies to make them slower or weaker, but they'll often move before you fire. Thus, aiming for a small critical spot is risky, while shooting at the body is a guaranteed hit... unless they have shields or hostages:\n\nAfter a Turn-Based FPS, why not a Turn-Based 2D fighting game? Windwalker is a martial arts RPG where battles play like a turn-based Street Fighter - each turn you choose one of ten movements, such as jumping, kicking, dashing forward, cartwheeling, punching, etc - each with its own range, damage and execution time. Plus, after each battle you can watch a real-time replay!\n\nUndertale deserves a lot of credit as well: a turn-based RPG that requires you to play through short gameplay segments during the enemy's turn - from bullet hell to platforming. Perhaps most importantly, it uses the game as a whole to convey its story - from the soundtrack to the user interface.\n\nA favorite of mine is NEO Scavenger. The game is a survival RPG that almost hides all information from the player. You never see damage numbers and there's not a single combat animation.\n\nInstead, you select commands, such as “shoot”, “kick” or “sneak towards”, and the combat log will describe what happened. While this may seem crude, it allow for actions that even AAA games find too complex to animate, such as head-butting, leg tripping and even grappling (with mods) – all while pushing a shopping cart. You'll have to use your intuition to understand which actions deals more damage and are more useful. A nice twist on what's usually a very number-driven genre.\n\nFinally, here's Hylics:\n\nThe gameplay is quite standard, but damn the art looks cool.\n\n----------------\n\nThere's many more games to talk about, but this article is already long enough as it is. I shall return soon(ish) with a second part about interesting aspects and systems in turn-based tactical RPGs, but feel free to point out other games & systems that I missed.\n\nIn the meanwhile, if your heart desires more RPG-goodness, check the CRPG Book Project, my ongoing FREE ebook on the history of Computer Role-Playing Games.

Tack on a recession-dodging economy, and boom! Brazil is the belle of the ball. Be it trekking across towering windswept dunes peppered with cerulean lagoons in Lençóis Maranhenses, exploring gilded colonial churches in frozen-in-time cities such as Ouro Preto or swimming in aquarium-like rivers near Bonito, Brazil’s diversity will leave you slack-jawed.\n\nThe adventure of a lifetime\n\nA noisy gentoo penguin in Antarctica.

It is also the Year of Homecoming, a government initiative to welcome the Scottish diaspora back to the mother country by celebrating Scotland’s heritage, food and drink. The phrase ‘there’s something for everyone’ applies: Europe’s biggest brass band festival blasts Perthshire, an orienteering contest around Scottish castles, the Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival in May... Despite all this, politics will take centre stage: to be or not to be independent, that is the question. Hold onto your hats, Scotland.\n\nFood, culture and scary stories\n\nSummertime in Västra Götaland, Sweden. Image by Christer Fredriksson / Lonely Planet Images / Getty Images.\n\nThanks to the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson, most people have a sense of what Sweden’s like, even in the far north – cold, beautiful and a bit scary. Sweden is emerging with a new pop-culture persona. Perhaps not coincidentally, northern Sweden’s largest city, Umeå, is the European Capital of Culture for 2014. Then there’s the food. The capital has long been a stylish, top-notch destination for serious gourmands and boldly experimental chefs but lately the reputation and influence of Swedish cooking have spread beyond the country’s borders. Considering that Swedish cuisine is so strongly tied to locally sourced ingredients (be it seafood, game, berries, herbs or regional cheeses), it makes perfect sense to go to the source of all this fine food.\n\nThe Big Five and beach life without the crowds\n\nElephant marches through Majete Wildlife Reserve in Malawi.

You get up close to the aforementioned elephant, rhino, lion, leopard and buffalo without the pesky 4WD scrum so common in Africa’s best-known parks. Then perhaps it’s off to Lake Malawi for a spot of high-visibility snorkelling, or Mt Mulanje for a hike over hazy peaks in an otherworldly moonscape. And there’s always the Viphya Plateau, a haunting wilderness of grasslands and whaleback hills that feels downright prehistoric.\n\nThe sleeping giant is waking\n\nRoadside fruit and vegetable stall in Oaxaca, Mexico.

And it’s not just the holidaymakers - many Mexicans are happier about living in Mexico now than most can ever remember. Exciting developments on the travel scene have continued, from major new Maya museums in Cancún and Mérida to the installation of Latin America’s longest ziplines on the rim of the awe-inspiring Copper Canyon. Now Mexico’s image is on the cusp of change – it’s time to dust off your Mexican dream again and enjoy it to the max before those prices go back up and the crowds really start rolling in.\n\nParadise within reach\n\nAn idyllic spot on Anse Lazio beach on Praslin in the Seychelles.

And there’s much more to do than sipping cocktails on the beach. Hiking, diving, snorkelling, boat tours and other adventure options are all readily available, with the added appeal of grandiose scenery. Wildlife lovers will get a buzz too – the Seychelles is not dubbed ‘The Galápagos of the Indian Ocean’ for nothing.\n\nHigh emotions in Europe's underrated gem\n\nHistoric buildings along the River Leie in Ghent, Belgium. Image by Allan Baxter / The Image Bank / Getty Images.\n\nBelgium has picturesque cities – Bruges, Antwerp, Ghent – and in Brussels a walkable capital with great museums. The food and drink is a gustatory blast (think the world’s best beer, chocolate and chips), the countryside flat and placid, the seaside surprisingly chic, while cultural treasures range from medieval masters to Tintin. Yet the words ‘Belgium’ and ‘holiday’ don’t usually mix. From 2014, a huge influx of visitors is expected due to the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of WWI – a festival of remembrance lasting until 2018 – which may change preconceptions. Belgo-newbies will find medieval towns where culture and gastronomy meet, with Gothic buildings, paintings by Breugel, Van Eyck and Magritte, canals and cool shops. And they’ll discover mellow meadows, where cows moo beside monuments, and battlefields and cemeteries that testify to the horrors of a war now shifting from living memory.\n\nBack to the future, Balkan-style\n\nChurch on the shores of Lake Ohrid, Macedonia. Image by Keren Su / Photodisc / Getty Images.\n\nThe year 2014 marks the completion of the government’s love-it-or-hate-it makeover of the capital, Skopje. The Macedonian capital has at the same time quietly become more visitor-friendly, with a bevy of cool new hostels, upscale wine bars and bistros, and one of southeastern Europe’s best club scenes. Beyond work-in-progress Skopje and the more established tourist sites such as Lake Ohrid, Mavrovo ski area and ancient Stobi, new things are happening elsewhere. Quiet Berovo, on the border with Bulgaria, is an up-and-coming contender on the spa-hotel scene. Also in Macedonia’s idyllic eastern half, sturdy old Kratovo – with Ottoman-era stone bridges and cobblestone lanes – is revitalising previously derelict Turkish mansions, attesting the bygone wealth of this old mining town. And in the arid central vineyard region of Tikveš, new quality wineries are catering to thirsty visitors.\n\nA revitalised Malaysia goes back to business\n\nKek Lok Si Temple in Penang, Malaysia. Image by MIXA / Getty Images.\n\nWith its sights set on 28 million visitors to the country, Malaysia is rolling out an array of new attractions. The headline-grabbers are the largest bird park in Southeast Asia in Melaka (with 6000 birds featuring 400 species), and Legoland Malaysia and Hello Kitty Land in Nusajaya, which are packing in both locals and Singaporeans flocking across the causeway. The new second terminal at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA2), catering mainly to the booming budget airline sector, is another major factor in attracting more visitors. Competitive fares offered by Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia, Firefly and new operator Malindo Air make getting around this widely spread-out country a cinch. Further afield, weekly direct links are now scheduled to destinations as diverse as Istanbul and Pyongyang. Amazing experiences await in Malaysian Borneo, from exploring off-the-beaten- track Kudat to indulging at the luxurious Gaya Island Resort on Pulau Gaya. And active travellers can discover the country on two wheels as cycle tourism takes off with guided tours in Sabah, a proposal to build a bike path around the coast of Penang, and a community project to map out cycle routes around Kuala Lumpur.",

At the time he accused Ferguson of ‘grassing’ him up.\n\nNow Shelvey has revealed further details about the clash which endeared him, not just to the Anfield faithful, but apparently to the United boss himself.\n\nHe now accepts he was wrong to confront Ferguson – but says the Scot was impressed with his passion.\n\nShelvey said: “I was a bit immature then and a bit silly.

Начавшееся извержение вулкана Агунг на острове Бали заставило власти Индонезии эвакуировать свыше 100 тыс. человек, находившихся в 224 населенных пунктах.

  "latent_1808": "The Trump Administration keeps trying to go after scientists, and being forced to retreat\n\nAs President George W. Bush said, “Fool me once, shame on ... shame on you. Fool me ... You can’t get fooled again!”\n\nDuring the his Administration, political appointees censored climate science reports from government agencies, and mostly got away with it by gagging the scientists. A survey found that nearly half of 1,600 government scientists at seven agencies ranging from NASA to the EPA had been warned against using terms like “global warming” in reports or speeches, throughout Bush’s eight-year presidency.\n\nUnaccustomed to being strong-armed by their own administrators, some government scientists reacted with what former US Climate Change Science Program senior associate Rick Piltz called “an anticipatory kind of self-censorship.” As a result, the Bush Administration’s efforts to smother scientific findings concerning global warming in government reports were remarkably effective.\n\nTrump is dusting off the Bush censorship playbook\n\nPerhaps assuming those tactics would work again, the Trump Administration has copied the Bush scientific censorship playbook. They issued de facto gag orders to government science agencies like the EPA and USDA, ordered that the EPA take down its climate webpage, and have mandated that any studies or data from EPA scientists must undergo review by political appointees before they can be released to the public.\n\nHowever, the Trump Administration is quickly realizing that scientists learned from the Bush scandal. This time around they’re not trying to appease the political appointees by staying quiet and allowing the censorship to happen.\n\nWe saw an early indication that the Bush tactics won’t succeed in 2017 when the Trump transition team launched an inquisition into Department of Energy employees working on climate change. The department refused to provide the requested list, and in the face of public and media outrage, the Trump team retreated. Around the same time, climate scientists held a ‘rally to stand up for science’ in San Francisco, fearing that the new administration would bully and censor scientists.\n\nNevertheless, the Trump Administration ignored those warning signs and continued to follow the Bush climate science censorship playbook. It hasn’t worked.\n\nReacting to the deletion of some National Parks Service tweets of climate change facts, a number of “resistance” Twitter accounts ostensibly run by government scientists have been created. Most recently, the Trump Administration had ordered that the EPA delete its climate webpage, but again in the face of public and media outrage has retreated.\n\nThis time around, government scientists have been quick to blow the whistle against political censorship of science, either by contacting congressional offices or journalists. Whistleblowers can contact Guardian journalists securely and anonymously by following these instructions.\n\nScientists are even becoming proactive. Following on the tremendous success of the Women’s March on Trump’s first full day as President, a group is organizing a March for Science sometime in March 2017.\n\nScientists are right to feel threatened\n\nIt’s possible that reactions to these Trump Administration moves are overblown - that they’re simply the result of a clumsy transition period and weren’t meant to signal a permanent censorship of science. But Trump has given scientists every reason to feel threatened.\n\nFor example, he appointed Myron Ebell to lead his EPA transition team - an oil and coal-funded enemy of science who wants to gut the agency. That team also included David Schnare and Chris Horner, who have spent much of their careers harassing and intimidating climate scientists. Here’s what the transition team had to say about how the EPA currently uses science:\n\nEPA does not use science to guide regulatory policy as much as it uses regulatory policy to steer the science ... EPA has greatly increased its science manipulation.\n\nTrump himself has described what the EPA does as “a disgrace.” He then nominated Scott Pruitt to head the agency - a man who has sued the EPA 14 times on behalf of polluters. For his science advisor, Trump is rumored to be considering two climate science deniers. He’s now appointed another climate science denier to lead the NOAA transition.\n\nWho you gonna trust?\n\nThe head of the House [Anti-]Science, Space, and Technology Committee Lamar Smith suggested that for accurate information we should rely not on scientists or the media, but solely on Donald Trump.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) tells us how to get “the unvarnished truth.”\n\nDonald Trump recently said “I have a running war with the media,” but in reality his war is with facts, and since evidence and facts are the currency of science, scientists fear that he’ll also wage a war on science.\n\nA war on science is a war he’s guaranteed to lose. Trump can deny the science, silence the scientists, censor their reports, even fire them from government agencies - but that won’t stop the Earth from heating and its climate from changing at a dangerous rate. At best he would survive a four or eight-year term, leave the planet a worse place for future generations, and be seen as a villain in the history books.\n\nBut it looks as though scientists and journalists aren’t going to let that happen without a fight, and kudos to them for standing up to the anti-science bullies on behalf of the planet and future generations. We’ll all have to do our parts to protect science and hold the administration accountable to facts and truth for the next four years.",

  "latent_2058": "MISSION, Texas — Multiple civil rights, church, and nature organizations staged a march along the banks of the Rio Grande to draw attention to President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall. The groups are expected to hold a second march for the same purpose on Sunday.\n\nA little over 200 activists gathered on Saturday morning at the Our Lady of Guadalupe Church for the “Save the Mission, Save the River, Resist the Wall” event.\n\n“Trump’s walls are a manifestation of hate, and would damage our communities and natural areas and cut off our access to the river,” event organizers wrote on a Facebook page.\n\nA short rally followed the march where organizers voiced their opposition to the proposed border wall. A similar march is expected to take place on Sunday at a federal wildlife refuge. The protest is called “Protect Santa Ana Protest Hike” referencing the name of the refuge.\n\nAccording to an online statement by event organizers:\n\nThe Trump Administration is planning to wall off long stretches of the Rio Grande Valley, including important sites like the Historic La Lomita Chapel, which was built in 1865. A wall on the levee next to the Mission could damage the structure and block access to the site. Walls elsewhere would cut off people’s homes, strip farmers of their land, close our parks and devastate our ecologically sensitive wildlife refuges. Walls do not stop people from crossing, but they do funnel them into remote areas where they are at risk of dying from dehydration and exposure.\n\nThe event is meant to draw attention to the impact that the wall would have in the area and to give a voice to vulnerable groups, organizers claimed.\n\nThe Trump administration, Congress, and the Texas Legislature have made statements and crafted policies that malign, scapegoat, and abuse the border region and those who live here. Proposals such as new border walls would inflict real and lasting harm, and they demonstrate a fundamental ignorance of the reality of the border. We will not stand for immigrants, people of color, those living in poverty, members of the LGBTQ community and others being targeted. We demand that federal, state, and local elected officials cease attacks on our community, repudiate the false narratives driving bad policy, and advocate on our behalf.\n\nIn the case of the wildlife refuge, organizers of that event claim that the area is home to more than 400 bird species that are at the heart of the ecotourism industry in the region.\n\n“We cannot let the Trump administration’s false border war narrative and their hostility toward federally protected public lands devastate and close Save Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge, and we need your help to stop them!”\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

  "latent_2103": "On the heels of the devastating and despicable acts of terrorism in France, it would do us some good to revisit one of the most powerful, hopefully defiant and inspirational rock albums of all time – Bruce Springsteen's post-9/11 masterpiece, The Rising.\n\nIts messages and themes of hope and resilience, as well as steely-eyed defiance, are entirely applicable to the horrific situation playing out in Paris.\n\nThe Rising – released in July of 2002 just 10 months after the carnage of 9/11 – is hailed to this day as a tribute to the strength and resolve of the American people over terrorism. The album speaks to all Americans, but it focuses specifically on the contributions of hard-working everyday heroes, like firemen, police and medical personnel – those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their fellow man that day. According to Springsteen, our love and devotion to each other is how we defeat evil.\n\nIn a macro sense, The Rising can be applied to good in its ongoing battle over evil. The French, for instance, in their battle against ISIS (i.e., soulless cowards). Bruce served up an emotionally red-hot set of songs in The Rising that honors and nurtures love in its battle over hate, and salutes freedom's long-running reign over oppression.\n\nThe Rising is the most poignant and notable example (at least in recent rock history) of music's ability to soothe, heal and inspire people to forge on in the face of unspeakable tragedy. It works.\n\nFrance is bowed, but just like America after 9/11, it will never ever be broken by hate and terror. The cowardly – regardless of how vicious and immoral – will never break the back of the brave.

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nThe army on Thursday announced it has filed an indictment against a soldier for illegally sharing classified military information regarding IDF operations on the Golan border with another Israeli citizen who passed the information on to the Syrian government.\n\nThe soldier, a corporal whose name is under gag order and was referred to as “H.H.” serves in a combat unit and was charged with exposing secrets and aiding the enemy.\n\nAccording to the indictment filed in the Central Military District Court, H.H. provided information around February 16-17 “that could harm state security.”The Israeli citizen middleman to whom H.H. allegedly provided the information, Sudi al-Makat, 48, from Majdal Shams on the Golan Heights, was indicted last week by the Nazareth District Court for a wide range of security offenses.H.H., Makat and associates were arrested by the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) and the police on and around February 25. According to investigators, Makat and other residents of Majdal Shams documented IDF movements along the border with Syria and transferred the information to officials in the Syrian government and intelligence community. Information was sent over the Internet, through a Syrian television station, and by a direct line that Makat had with Syrian officials.Makat admitted that he was in touch with Medhat Saleh, a Syrian government official well known for his links with officials in Syrian intelligence. Makat had served a full 27-year prison sentence up until 2012 for violent security crimes.The Central District Military Court ordered H.H. remanded to military police custody until the end of the trial and, until now, had imposed a gag order on the entire affair.On Thursday night, the High Court of Justice rejected a petition by Makat to appoint a defense lawyer for him who does not have approved credentials for representing defendants in cases dealing with classified information.Makat had argued that having a lawyer “approved” by the state, even if the state gave him some choice, was a policy made to muzzle defendants such as him.Jerusalem Post staff contributed to this report.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_2507": "The Turnbull government is pushing ahead with Tony Abbott’s controversial “lawfare’ changes to remove the legal standing of conservation groups to mount environmental court cases, with a Senate committee dominated by Coalition members recommending they proceed without holding any public hearings.\n\nFarm groups furious at Coalition move to restrict environmental challenges Read more\n\nLabor accused the government of using its numbers to cancel public hearings and bring forward the report, and said it proved the “radical right” of the Liberal party still called the shots, despite the change of prime minister to Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nAfter Turnbull took over, the government’s rhetoric against the alleged legal “sabotage” by green groups appeared to cool, and the committee considering the proposed legislation deferred its reporting date until February.\n\nBut on Wednesday it unexpectedly issued a report, with Coalition senators recommending the bill be passed. Both Labor and Green senators said the bill should be rejected, leaving its fate in the hands of the crossbench.\n\nThe government announced in August it would remove the right of most environmental organisations to challenge developments under federal laws unless they could show they were “directly affected” – in response to a federal court decision that environment minister Greg Hunt had not properly considered all advice in his approval of Adani’s $16.6bn Carmichael coalmine.\n\nFormer prime minister Abbott accused environmental groups of engaging in “sabotage” of investment and jobs and the government dubbed the use of the courts to challenge mining projects as “lawfare”.\n\nIn October, Hunt approved the Carmichael mine for a second time, but then in November the Australian Conservation Foundation launched more legal action – this time on the grounds that Hunt failed to consider its impact on climate change and therefore on the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nHunt insists the project has been approved in accordance with the law, and that 36 strict conditions have been imposed, including on groundwater monitoring, protecting local fauna and funding research for conservation in the Galilee Basin.\n\nThe Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act requires the minister to consider the principles of ecologically sustainable development when assessing projects of national environmental significance, but it is not clear whether this could include the consideration of the climate change impact on the reef of the emissions from the coal when exported and burnt.\n\nThe chances of the government getting the bill through the Senate suffered a setback last month when the National Farmers’ Federation (NFF) confirmed its opposition – because of fears it would also deny farm groups the ability to mount legal challenges.\n\n“The NFF ... cannot support the proposed amendment to remove s487 from the EPBC Act due to the risk of denying farming groups and individual farmers the right to appeal against government decisions that they believe are going to adversely affect farming communities or individual operations,” it said in a submission to the Senate committee.\n\nTasmanian Labor senator Anne Urquhart said the government used its voting numbers in the committee to cancel public hearings and change the reporting date to a non-parliamentary sitting day to avoid scrutiny.\n\n“The government has shown absolute contempt for due process and for the more than 20,000 individuals, organisations and academic experts who took the time to raise their very legitimate concerns about the EPBC bill,” Urquhart said.\n\n“The Turnbull government has wantonly trampled on key democratic principles by trying to dodge accountability and remove fundamental rights of appeal, and then shutting down a legitimate inquiry before a single hearing has been held.\n\n“While we might have a new prime minister, this debacle shows the Abbott-era anti-environment policy continues unabated with the radical right of the Liberal party still calling the shots.”\n\nGreens senator Larissa Waters said the government was ignoring community opposition, scientific evidence and legal advice.\n\n“Traditional owners, farmers, lawyers, environmentalists and ordinary Australians are standing up for their rights to enforce our national environment law and the Turnbull government is ignoring them in favour of its big mining buddies,” she said.\n\nCoalition to restrict green groups' right to challenge after Carmichael setback Read more\n\nThe chief executive of the ACF, Kelly O’Shanassy, said: “The vast majority of the 292 submissions to this inquiry – submissions from lawyers, scientists, health professionals, unions, environment groups and plenty of individual Australians – opposed any change to the law.\n\n“The few submissions that advocated changing the law to restrict environment groups’ rights were unsurprisingly from groups that have a vested interest in profit-making from new coalmines, like the Business Council and the Minerals Council.\n\n“Once again our government is doing the bidding of the big polluters, serving their interests over the interests of Australians who depend on a healthy environment.”\n\nThe Lock the Gate Alliance said it was “disappointed” the government appeared to be “pressing ahead with its agenda to take away access to the courts for farmers whose livelihoods depend on a healthy environment.”",
  "latent_2537": "Shiraz Maher, senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, in a 2015 photo.Morten Brakestad / Stortinget / Flickr CC\n\nThe so-called Islamic State will not stop until it has “exterminated” all other religious groups, according to a former Islamic extremist now working in counter-terrorism.\n\n“They’re on a mission – a programme of extermination – to wipe out everyone else,” said Shiraz Maher, a former member of Islamist group Hizbut Tahrir, speaking this week in London as he promoted his book, “Salafi-Jihadism: The History of an Idea”.\n\nMaher said wiping out Christians, in particular, is a “very important part” of IS’s ideology. He said that although they were “religious amateurs” with “weak theology”, their claim to have restored the Caliphate – by appointing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as “God’s representative on earth” – has given them a strong position, which leaves other Muslims with a choice: reject that claim or to “do whatever he says”.\n\nWho is Shiraz Maher? Born in Britain, Shiraz Maher became a member of the Islamist group Hizbut Tahrir after 9/11, saying it had “activated” anti-American ideas picked up during several years in Saudi Arabia. He left the group after the 7/7 London bombings, and criticised its ideology, claiming it led to terrorism. He now works as a senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London.\n\nHowever, Maher, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, said IS’s ideology did “not necessarily need to resound” with all of its followers – only the leadership. He said this was one of the group’s greatest strengths – its ability to attract people without developing more than a “tokenistic” theology.\n\n‘Mosul will be held for some time yet’\n\n“We’re losing,” said Maher, when asked about the current status of the fight against IS. “The Syrian crisis is a huge disaster for everybody. Only the jihadists are winning. These groups are very entrenched, they aren’t going anywhere. ISIS is not suffering any kind of existential threat.”\n\nMaher said he thinks Mosul will be held “for some time yet”, saying that “for the past year Iraq’s army has been saying they’ll recapture it in three months’ time”. He said he thought the same was true of Raqqa – IS’s de facto capital – because to lose either of these bases would constitute an “existential threat”, whereas other territory is expendable.\n\nWorld Watch Monitor has reported on the anguish of the Christians displaced from Mosul more than two years ago. On 6-7 August, prayer services were held in Internally Displaced People camps across the country to mark the “Black Day” in 2014 when IS took the towns surrounding the northern Iraqi city, such as Qaraqosh.\n\nWhat is Salafi-jihadism?\n\nMaher explained that Salafi-jihadists like IS are desperate to return to what they view as the “golden era” of Islam, when Muhammad and the two generations after him provided an “authentic” example of what it is to be a Muslim. He said that while they believe it is impossible to attain to the “level” of Muhammad, it is possible to emulate the “pious predecessors”.\n\nMaher said Salafi-jihadists hold five core beliefs, which are expanded upon in his book:\n\n1. Jihad – It is necessary to engage in combat to truly partake in “jihad” (holy war).\n\n2. Excommunication – It is possible to “excommunicate” other Muslims by engaging in “takfir” – accusing another Muslim of being impure.\n\n3. Loyalty – Muslims owe a special loyalty to other Muslims and, by virtue of this, a disloyalty to others and a disavowal of their beliefs.\n\n4. Monotheism – While all Muslims are monotheists, Maher said there is some disagreement as to how to “demonstrate belief in this concept”. For Salafi-jihadists, he said “you can’t be a true monotheists unless you fight jihad”.\n\n5. An Islamic State – The ideal is to create a state governed by Muslims in accordance with Sharia.\n\nMaher said that all Muslims would be able to identify to various degrees with these concepts, but that their interpretation of how to “realise their monotheism” (be the best Muslim they can be) will be different. He said that even among “Salafis” – those desperate to attain to the level of the “pious predecessors” – there are many “quietists”, who “aren’t concerned with changing the world” and whose expression of monotheism will be played out on a purely personal level, such as ensuring their beard is the “correct” length.\n\nThese Salafis, he said, spend their time “trying to better themselves or to resolve esoteric debates … and place a huge emphasis on social stability”.\n\nAl-Qaeda ‘trying to win hearts and minds’\n\nMaher contrasted IS with Al-Qaeda, which he said has changed its tactics to a “more pragmatic” approach aimed at gaining public support.\n\nHe gave the example of Al-Qaeda’s recent suspension of Islamic punishments in the areas it governs in Syria’s north-western Idlib province, and contrasted this with the continued brash brutality of IS.\n\nAl-Qaeda, Maher said, are able to justify their relative leniency by citing, in line with Islamic doctrine, that punishments can be suspended “in times of calamity”. He said that Al-Qaeda produced “hundreds of pages of booklets to explain or justify its actions”, whereas IS will just boast about its actions with a short video or one-paragraph press release.\n\nMaher warned that the “genuine public support” that exists for these groups in some places will make them “much more intractable in the long run”.",
  "latent_2604": "Each of Europe’s 5.6 million unemployed youths has a different story to tell. Some are university educated and vastly over-qualified for the jobs they are seeking. Others left school early to cash in on the boom times, only to lose everything when the crash came.\n\nHeads of state from the EU holding talks in Brussels today and tomorrow have put youth unemployment at the top of the agenda, as figures hit an all-time high. In April, nearly a quarter of people under 25 looking for work in the EU were unemployed. In Greece, it is more than 60 per cent; in Spain, 56 per cent.\n\nUnless the bleak figures are reversed soon, experts warn of a “lost generation” trapped in a spiral of poverty and exclusion. This could lead to deepening social unrest, political extremism, and the possibility that policies meant to bind Europe through monetary union could tear it apart.\n\nWe’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 $0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n“A generation that is growing up unemployed, what will be its stance towards Europe, towards European solidarity?” asked Nils Muižnieks, Human Rights Commissioner for the Council of Europe, an independent rights watchdog. “I have a feeling this will not be the most Europe-orientated generation, and that’s the price we will pay for neglecting this issue.”\n\nOverall 11 per cent of the EU workforce is unemployed, as the ongoing recession and austerity measures cause businesses to shut down. The young are hit hard, as retiring workers are not replaced and they are often the first to be laid off.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is what the EU leaders can actually achieve when the continent remains mired in recession. László Andor, the EU Commissioner for employment, social affairs and inclusion, said richer nations should help poorer ones recover. “There is clearly a need for more solidarity in the EU – the young generation needs and deserves it,” he told The Independent ahead of the summit.\n\nBut the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, made clear that she was not in favour of increasing funding. “The German government insists that the problems [of] Europe and the eurozone have to be tackled at the root and solved step by step,” she told the German parliament.\n\nAn early draft of the conclusions from the summit calls for accelerating the implementation of a scheme to ensure young people have access to education or training within four months of losing a job or leaving school. It also advocates labour market reform and policies to help people to move country to find work. About €6bn from the next budget is also expected to be mobilised for schemes to tackle youth unemployment.\n\nPrevious pledges have come and gone, however, and unemployment figures continue to rise.\n\n“We have to resolve the underlying financial crisis and return to sustainable growth,” said Mr Andor. “Without this, all actions simply provide temporary relief.”\n\nWhile there are signs that some countries are edging towards recovery, growth figures across much of Europe continue to be disappointing.\n\nHopelessness takes hold, and there are already signs of what despair and alienation can bring. In Greece, neo-Nazi extremists have record support. The riots in Sweden earlier this year were partly blamed on miserable job prospects for the young. Independence movements are thriving, and many young people fed up with mainstream politics are turning to smaller protest parties.\n\n“If there is a crisis, people may start to distrust their national leaders and turn to the EU for solutions. But, after a while, confidence in the EU may also decline,” said Mr Andor. “We are in this second phase now. The response is partly about better communication, but more importantly the policies have to be more convincing too.”\n\nMany economists and social activists, however, feel it is the very policies being prescribed by the EU and International Monetary Fund to kick-start growth that are causing the pain.\n\n“From the European Council we expect EU leaders to move beyond austerity and to stimulate new growth and jobs,” said Patrick Itschert, deputy general secretary of the ETUC trade union. “European leaders need the political courage to recognise the mistakes made in recent years and correct their course.”\n\n***\n\nAfter months of negotiations, officials from the European Parliament and European Union member states yesterday agreed a pared down budget for the next seven years. The $960bn budget for 2014-2020 marks the first spending cuts in the EU’s history, and was hashed out at a summit in February, when David Cameron and others fought to slash spending. However the parliament refused to ratify the budget, arguing for more flexibility to increase spending if economies picked up, the ability to reallocate funds not spent, and a boost in funding to tackle unemployment.\n\nWe’ll tell you what’s true.

  "latent_2614": "The White House is brimming with aides, lawyers and communications gurus who are begging President Donald Trump to stop tweeting. The lone exception is Dan Scavino, the president’s former golf caddy who now oversees the White House’s messaging on social media.\n\nScavino is in many ways the president’s mini-me, a man whose bombast, impulse control and instinct for a good punch match those of his boss.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAfter Trump last weekend blasted London Mayor Sadiq Khan after a terror attack that killed eight people, Scavino posted a message citing Khan’s own 2016 criticism of Trump’s rhetoric on Muslims and terrorism — complete with a Trumpian, all-caps “WAKE UP!!!!”\n\nAnd like his boss, Scavino has ignored warnings from high-level White House officials to tone down his tweets. Scavino was reprimanded on Friday for violating the Hatch Act, which prohibits senior executive branch officials from using their authority to interfere with elections, by calling in April for the ouster of Michigan Republican Rep. Justin Amash.\n\nSteve Schmidt, a former George W. Bush administration official who served as campaign manager for John McCain in 2008, said Scavino’s remarks demonstrated “no sense of probity or dignity.”\n\nBut Scavino’s purpose in the White House is to give Trump an outlet, not to lend him restraint. When the president goes quiet, as he did during and shortly after the testimony of fired FBI Director James Comey, Scavino ensures there is a field marshal leading the pro-Trump Twitter army online. “Sorry Dems- nothing here,” he tweeted on his own account as Comey’s testimony got underway before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. “POTUS or team NEVER asked to stop election investigation.”\n\nScavino, whose title is director of social media, is omnipresent in the West Wing, constantly recording content for online videos. He has said that he often taps out tweets for the president’s account as Trump dictates them, and he has a knack for mimicking his boss on Twitter. “Scavino channels Trump, not the other way around,” said a senior White House aide.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n“Dan Scavino is a true team player and an invaluable asset. He is a person who works incredibly hard, is totally selfless and extremely humble,” said White House strategic communications manager Hope Hicks. “Dan’s contributions to both the campaign and now the White House are immeasurable and beyond that, he is a really wonderful person.”\n\nScavino first connected with Trump decades ago after caddying for him at a Westchester, New York, golf club. He’s now one of the president’s most loyal lieutenants, carrying on his tweeting even as other aides increasingly resist stepping up to spin the latest controversies.\n\nAfter several Republican congressmen refused to back the initial version of an Obamacare repeal bill, Scavino in early April launched the broadside against Amash, urging voters to “defeat him in primary,” which resulted in a warning from the Office of Special Counsel.\n\nHe’s served as the president’s alter ego to congratulate Fox News hosts on their successes, lambaste journalists from other networks or bestow derogatory monikers on the president’s critics.\n\nHe has frequently derided Bill Kristol, a frequent Trump critic and editor emeritus of the conservative Weekly Standard, as #LoserBilly. Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice is “Lyin’ Leakin’ Susan Rice.”\n\n“Congratulations to Lyin’ Leakin’ Susan Rice on receiving FOUR PINOCCHIOS from the Washington Post,” Scavino wrote in early April regarding Rice’s claim that the Obama administration was able to force the removal of chemical weapons from Syria.\n\nAfter CNN host Anderson Cooper said he was disgusted by comedian Kathy Griffin’s decision to conduct a mock beheading of Trump, Scavino tweeted, “If you are so appalled, you would make it clear to everyone that you will never have that piece of trash (@kathygriffin) on your show again.”\n\nThat has endeared him to the president, who ensconced him in the West Wing just a few doors down from chief strategist Steve Bannon. Scavino was among the staffers Trump invited to join him at the Vatican to meet the pope when he visited in May — even though Scavino tweeted sarcastically during the 2016 campaign about the Vatican being surrounded by walls after Francis criticized Trump’s plan to build a border wall with Mexico.\n\nAs a college freshman, Scavino caddied for Trump’s group at what was then Briar Hall Country Club Trump made Scavino the general manager of Trump National Golf Club in Westchester after he purchased the property. His improbable rise made him one of Westchester magazine’s “inspiring tales of unexpected success” long before he landed at the White House.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Scavino was a constant presence at Trump’s side, traveling with him to rallies, debates and other stops. He became known as the keeper of Trump’s social media profile, overseeing his Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts.\n\nScavino is among the few Trump originalists, along with Hicks and director of Oval Office operations Keith Schiller, who accompanied the president from his campaign launch in June 2015 all the way to his election in November 2016 — despite multiple management changes and high turnover. After Paul Manafort was brought in to run the campaign and Trump’s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was ousted, it was widely speculated that Scavino would be pushed aside or let go.\n\nHe came under fire after tweeting a picture of Hillary Clinton next to a Star of David-shaped figure within which appeared the words “Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!” In the background was a sea of cash. Critics blasted the image as anti-Semitic. Scavino later tweeted, “For the MSM to suggest that I am antisemite is AWFUL. I proudly celebrate holidays w/ my wife's amazing Jewish family for the past 16 years.”\n\nOne senior White House aide said the continuing Twitter controversies in which the White House finds itself embroiled are a permanent feature of the landscape in the Trump era. “I don’t blame the president for that, I blame everybody else around him,\" the aide said. \" Factor it into your jobs.”\n\nAlex Isenstadt contributed to this report.",
  "latent_2741": "Originally published Wednesday, December 15, 2010 at 3:54 PM\n\nComments (0) E-mail article Print Share\n\nGuest columnist Bob Jeffers-Schroder argues that the U.S. must act now to avert the challenges of climate change.\n\nTHE climate change conference in Cancún concluded last weekend, and once again no agreement was reached to reduce the heat-trapping gases that are warming our planet. That's because the United States continues to drag heels when it comes to putting a price on carbon.\n\nAt the Cancún meeting, several reports suggested there is greater urgency than ever to stop burning fossil fuels. One report predicts that the way things are going, a billion people would lose their homes by the end of the century. Another predicts that climate change will double food prices by midcentury.\n\nThe urgency appears lost on Congress, which adjourns this year without enacting climate and energy legislation.\n\nThis is astonishing. Even some energy companies recognize the need for action. On its website, Shell Oil says, \"For us the debate on climate change is over ... We are calling on governments to establish policies that will encourage a reduction in CO2 emissions.\"\n\nUnfortunately, many members of the fossil-fuel industry are not as enlightened. A \"No Climate Tax\" pledge is being circulated by Americans for Prosperity, an organization funded by oil conglomerate Koch Industries. More than 150 members of the U.S. House of Representatives have signed the pledge, including three from our state — Doc Hastings, Cathy McMorris-Rodgers and Jaime Herrera (newly elected).\n\nThe rest of our delegation supports at least some action. Congressman Jim McDermott sponsored a carbon-tax bill and Sen. Maria Cantwell sponsored a cap-and-dividend bill. While neither bill is ideal, each includes excellent features. The rest of our representatives should join with them to come up with legislation that includes the best features of each.\n\nCurrently, the primary objection to taxing carbon-based fuels is the claim that jobs will be lost. However, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that if 20 percent of our power were to be derived from wind energy, 500,000 jobs would be created, dwarfing the 174,000 jobs supported by the coal industry. Similar proportions can be expected for our state if we phase out the coal-powered plant in Chehalis.\n\nWhile the \"No Climate Tax\" pledge appears to make climate and energy legislation a non-starter for those who signed it, the wording of the pledge appears to allow support for a revenue-neutral climate and energy bill:\n\n\"I, [NAME], pledge to the taxpayers of the state of [STATE NAME] and to the American people that I will oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue.\"\n\nCitizens' Climate Lobby proposes an act that does not include \"a net increase in government revenue\": carbon fee and dividend. It works by placing a steadily rising fee on carbon-based fuels paid by producers and importers. All the revenue is distributed to the public as equal dividends for everyone. It won't increase the size of government, and it gives Americans extra money needed to cover rising energy costs associated with the carbon fee.\n\nIt also provides a clear price signal for investors who are waiting for some assurance that betting on wind, solar and other forms of clean energy will pay off in the future. That confidence will create a privately funded stimulus for new jobs.\n\nIt's a solution that both political parties should be able to agree upon. Based on what the scientific reports presented in Cancún are telling us — essentially, objects in the mirror are closer than they appear — we can't afford to wait another two years to address climate change.\n\nBob Jeffers-Schroder is a member of the Citizens' Climate Lobby. He campaigned throughout the 7th Congressional District, reaching 60,000 homes with the message that Congress needs to act now to reduce CO2 emissions.",
  "latent_2847": "Four members of the Florida congressional delegation--Republican U.S. Reps. Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Democratic U.S. Reps. Darren Soto and Debbie Wasserman Schultz--are backing a proposal giving Venezuelan refugees a path to permanent residency.\n\nCurbelo brought out the “Venezuelan Refugee Assistance Act” on Wednesday. The proposal would let Venezuelans who fled their home country, cannot return to that nation and arrived in the United States before the start of 2013 the ability to apply for permanent residency from now until the start of 2021 provided they do not have criminal records. Ros-Lehtinen, Soto and Wasserman Schultz are original co-sponsors of the bill.\n\n“For over a decade, thousands of Venezuelans were forced to flee the brutal Chavez dictatorship, and now, the situation has not improved under his hand-picked successor, Nicolas Maduro,” Curbelo said. “In the last few weeks alone we have seen countless examples of the regime’s thuggish tactics, unethical behavior, and lethal force against innocent civilians. Top opposition leaders, like Leopoldo Lopez, remain locked up in Maduro’s prisons while the dictator continues to stop at nothing to try and control all branches of government. Over the last several years, thousands of opposition protestors have been arrested and dozens have been left for dead or killed. This bill will allow Venezuelan nationals who have made a new home in the United States to remain here if they choose to, since it is too dangerous to return home.”\n\n\"The whole world has seen all the heartbreaking images of children suffering from malnutrition, seniors facing life threatening illnesses who have no access to medicines or appropriate healthcare, desperate mothers trying to find food in the streets to feed their families. We have seen young students dying at the hands of President Nicolás Maduro's brutal, thuggish, corrupt regime,\" said Soto. \"Basic human rights and democracy must be restored in Venezuela. That's why I am proposing this bill with Rep. Curbelo, so our brothers and sisters from Venezuela who are already in the United States receive protected immigration status as a result of this humanitarian crisis.\"\n\nThe bill was sent to the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.",

  "latent_2908": "A fascinating and volatile drama has been unfolding in recent weeks around the intrigue that begins in Jerusalem and winds through Moscow, Damascus, Beirut, Ankara, Tehran and Canberra. Israel, Russia, Turkey, Australia and Iran are the key players, while Syria and Lebanon have supporting roles. To the players in the field, the game is reminiscent of a regional chessboard with a lot more than two contestants.\n\nIt all began with an official state visit that Israeli President Reuven Rivlin was supposed to have made to Australia on March 17. The visit was scheduled via direct contacts between Jerusalem and Canberra. Israel and Australia enjoy a close, warm relationship, and the Australian government officials were very excited for the visit of the popular Israeli president. They cleared their schedules for him, and one high-level government official even canceled a planned trip abroad.\n\nBut then, it emerged that Rivlin was suddenly canceling his visit. The reason: At the moment, Russian President Vladimir Putin is more important to Israel’s security interests. Simultaneously with Israel’s contacts with Australia, the Israeli Foreign Ministry had also been sending out feelers to the Kremlin regarding a possible visit to Russia. After the visit with the Australians had already been secured, the Russians put forward the same date. Rivlin had to decide whether to stick with the Australia trip or insult the Australians in favor of the Russian one.\n\nThis dilemma involved very sensitive security strategic interests, and they were raised in a special meeting between Rivlin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week. Netanyahu personally made it clear to Rivlin that there was no choice: A visit to Moscow was absolutely imperative at this time.\n\nGenerally speaking, Netanyahu and Rivlin share a strained relationship, with a long disconnect between them. Netanyahu tried to torpedo Rivlin’s appointment to the presidency, and the two have been miffed with one another ever since. But this time, national interests overcame ego issues and personal antagonism. Netanyahu is focusing tremendous Israeli efforts on convincing Putin of the damage caused by Iran and the “axis of evil” connecting Iran, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah. At the epicenter of the debate are the S-300 air defense missiles that the Russians promised to sell the Iranians years ago but still have not reached Tehran.\n\nOn March 5, the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida reported that Putin halted the transfer of the missiles because Iran violated its earlier agreement not to transfer sophisticated Russian weaponry to Hezbollah. According to the publication, Putin decided to punish the Iranians after the Russians received intelligence from Israel proving that Tehran had recently transferred SA-22 surface-to-air missiles to Hezbollah. According to the same Kuwaiti report, Russian pilots cruising the Syrian skies have recently been reporting that anti-aircraft missiles were locking onto them from Lebanese territory. The assessment is that those missiles are the very ones produced by Russia, given to Iran and then transferred to Hezbollah. It turns out that anything is possible in the Middle East, and actors can find themselves in the crosshairs of the very systems they created. This is exactly what happened to the Americans a generation ago, with the mujahedeen in Afghanistan.\n\nAl-Jarida is seen as tightly linked with Netanyahu’s close associates. Since Netanyahu’s return to the Israeli government in the spring of 2009, his colleagues allegedly have, on occasion, used the Kuwaiti paper to leak information without leaving footprints. Many in Israel and the West view leaks in Al-Jarida as originating Israeli sources, which tends to increase their credibility. According to this theory, Netanyahu asked Rivlin to favor Moscow over Canberra to maintain his momentum vis-a-vis Putin. He wanted Rivlin to present additional materials to Putin that will emphasize the real risks involved, should S-300 batteries also be transferred from Iran to Hezbollah, if and when Putin decides to supply them.\n\nSimultaneously, reports continue to flow from Ankara saying a historic reconciliation between Israel and Turkey has long since matured and been agreed on. So why has nothing been signed on the dotted line? Almost all my sources in this sphere are united in their opinion: It is Netanyahu who is stepping on the brakes. Defense Minister Moshe (Bogie) Ya’alon has also denounced the potential reconciliation several times in recent weeks. It is assumed that Putin does not wish to see a rapprochement between Israel and Turkey, as Turkey felled a Russian combat plane several months ago and since then has been conducting something of a cold war with Moscow.\n\nThus Israel is in a dilemma: On one hand, it needs to end the crisis with Turkey and normalize ties between the two states, which enjoyed a valuable military alliance in the not-so-distant past. On the other hand, Israel also needs to convince Putin to disengage himself from Iran and Hezbollah as much as possible.\n\nIsrael has a clear preference for option B. At this point in time, Putin is far more important to Israel than Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Turkish tyrant is viewed in Jerusalem as a lost cause. The Israeli-Turkish military alliance will not be renewed so long as Erdogan’s party remains in power, and Jerusalem has no illusions. It is clear to Netanyahu that Erdogan is angling for a reconciliation with Israel only because of his political weakness, his problems with Russia, Israel’s natural gas and the fact that his standing in the region is not what it used to be.\n\nThe natural gas story complicates things even further, in light of Israel’s clear interests to sell its gas to Turkey and the fact that Russia is competing for the same market. But Putin wins out decisively on all counts: The path he adopted in Syria has upgraded Russia’s status in the region and beyond. Almost overnight, Russia has become an influential and dominant world power. Russia’s deep involvement in Syria proved itself a successful bet. Russia changed the regional reality, redirecting the bloody conflict from a dead end to another path, transformed Assad from a loser to a winner and reshuffled the cards in a Russian display of power and determination. Recently, I quoted a very highly placed Israeli military source as saying “even if a Russian jet flies over Tel Aviv, we will not take it down.” There are endless reasons for the coordination and closeness between Israel and Russia, and Israel’s strategic decision not to do anything to rub the Russians the wrong way.\n\nIsrael is now working diligently on tightening ties with Russia at almost any price. Higher-ups in Jerusalem, including in Tel Aviv’s security apparatus, are optimistic. According to senior Israeli sources, the Russians are cognizant of the damage perpetrated by the “axis of evil” and have no intentions of letting Iran become a patron of Syria. Even with regard to Hezbollah, they understand Israel’s stance and are now reconsidering their missile deal with Tehran.\n\nThe Russians have their own interests to promote, and they have no special commitment to Hezbollah. They will burn the candle at both ends, trying not to become embroiled in a crisis with Iran in an era when all the world’s global companies are trying to dive into the Iranian economy. On the other hand, they don’t want to help Iran gain the enormous power that it hopes to. Israel, meanwhile, is busy maneuvering within this game plan, while scoring a few considerable achievements for itself.",

Much of what we are seeing can be attributed to the small businesses that have invested in commercial districts, from Hertel Avenue to the Old First Ward, and points in-between.\n\nA lot of people have been happy to see that Buffalo is being built from the ground up, in an almost grassroots manner. That is what is making this renaissance so special. Mom n’ pop bakeries, retail stores, co-ops, breweries, restaurants, cafés, shoe stores, urban farms, tattoo studios, print shops, etc,. – these are the businesses that believed in Buffalo enough to invest their own money to create the burgeoning neighborhoods that are bearing fruit today.\n\nNow a rallying cry is beginning to be heard, to keep a similar momentum going strong. Buffalo is very unique in that the majority of businesses that thrive here currently are owner operated. Not to say that it’s bad to have a mix – all cities could use a Starbucks or a Trader Joe’s. Having a healthy mix of owner operated businesses and out of town hotspots is a good thing. The combination allows for Buffalo to have home town appeal, along with big city attributes. But what is the right balance, and how do we maintain it?\n\nAs Buffalo continues to grow, we will see this city begin to change in many ways. Some people are starting to prepare for that growth by recognizing that our neighborhoods must continue to support the economic efforts of those who live here. Instead of watching Buffalo turn into a homogenized city, there are ways to empower Buffalonians to be a part of the growth, instead of standing by and watching the reordering (missing the boat). Similar shifts have happened in other cities countless times.\n\nOn Thursday, November 5, starting at 5:30pm, Assemblyman Sean Ryan will be hosting The Worker Cooperative Roundtable. In attendance will be regional cooperative leaders, and special guests from the New York City Network of Worker Cooperatives and The Democracy Collaborative.

  "latent_3087": "GENEVA (Reuters) - India’s tough diplomacy blocked a landmark world trade treaty late on Thursday, despite last-ditch talks to rescue what would have been the first global trade reform since the creation of the World Trade Organization 19 years ago.\n\nA truck passes near a container yard at a port in Yangon April 18, 2013. REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun/Files\n\nTrade diplomats in Geneva have said they are “flabbergasted”, “astonished” and “dismayed” and described India’s position as “hostage-taking” and “suicidal”. Here are nine reasons why they say India’s stance made no sense.\n\n1. India has been a vocal backer of world trade reform. It has criticised the small clubs of countries, led by the United States and European Union, that lost patience with the slow pace of global reforms and started to discuss faster liberalising of trade in certain areas, such as services and information technology products. India is not in any of these groups. But Thursday’s veto is likely to give them even more momentum as hope of a global trade pact, long in doubt, appears to be over.\n\n2. India’s veto may be the beginning of the end for the WTO. Trade experts say that if the WTO’s 20-year-old rulebook does not evolve, more and more trade will be governed by new regional agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will have their own rules and systems of resolving disputes. That could lead to a fragmented world of separate trade blocs.\n\n3. India’s new government was widely seen as being pro-business. And yet it blocked a deal on “trade facilitation”, a worldwide streamlining of customs rules that would cut container handling times, guarantee standard procedures for getting goods to and from their destinations and kill off vast amounts of paperwork at borders around the world. Some estimates said it would add $1 trillion to the world economy as well as 21 million jobs, 18 million of them in developing countries.\n\n4. Nobody else was negotiating. Thursday’s meeting was simply supposed to formally adopt the final trade negotiation text into the WTO rulebook, following its agreement by ministers at a meeting in Bali last December. India’s then Trade Minister Anand Sharma hailed the Bali deal as a landmark in the history of the WTO. “We were able to arrive at a balanced outcome which secures our supreme national interest,” Sharma said at the time. India did not hint at any further objection until days before it wielded its veto, and even then it made no concrete demands until the WTO meeting to adopt the new rules was in progress.\n\n5. India did not object to the deal it vetoed. Its objections were unconnected to trade facilitation. It blocked the trade facilitation deal to try to get what it wanted on something else: food security.\n\n6. India had already got what it wanted on food security. At Bali, it forced a big concession from the United States and European Union, which initially strongly opposed its demands, but agreed that India could stockpile food at subsidised prices, reversing the trend of trying to reduce and remove trade-distorting food subsidies globally. The arrangement was temporary, but the WTO agreed to work towards a permanent solution within four years, by the end of 2017.\n\n7. India’s demands reversed its previous position. India blocked the trade facilitation deal because it wanted the WTO to move to a permanent solution more quickly than the four-year timeline. But diplomats say that India was offered a two-year timeframe before Bali but it insisted on four.\n\n8. India’s veto could put it in legal danger. As part of the Bali deal, India won a pledge that nobody would bring a trade dispute to challenge its food stockpiling programme, which is widely thought to have broken the WTO rules. However, diplomats say that Bali was a “package” of 10 agreements, and the only legally binding part was trade facilitation. If that fails, the package unravels, and India may lose its protection.\n\n9. India was isolated. Cuba, Venezuela and Bolivia voiced support, but diplomats say other big developing countries such as Russia, China and Brazil, as well as India’s neighbour Pakistan, were among the chief opponents of its veto. Poorer countries stand to lose most, WTO chief Roberto Azevedo told the WTO meeting after the deal collapsed. “They’re the ones with fewer options, who are at risk of being left behind. They’re the ones that may no longer have a seat at the table.”",
  "latent_3286": "He'll be joined in Oxford by the No. 1 offensive tackle in Laremy Tunsil (Lake City, Fla./Columbia), the nation's No. 1 receiver in Laquon Treadwell (Crete, Ill.), ESPN 150 offensive lineman Austin Golson and ESPN 150 safety Antonio Conner. They form the foundation for what could be the Rebels' best recruiting class.\n\nOle Miss is the 11th school since ESPN began ranking recruits in 2006 to get multiple top-five players, but only the fourth school to do it in the same season. USC did it in 2007, while Florida and Texas did it in 2010.\n\nThe Rebels also signed Nkemdiche's close friend and Loganville Grayson teammate David Kamara, a three-star cornerback, but missed out on ESPN 150 defensive end Chris Jones, who stayed true to his longtime commitment to Mississippi State.\n\n\"I feel like it's the right place for me,\" Nkemdiche said after his announcement. \"I feel like they can do special things, and they're on the rise. I feel like going to play with my brother [Denzel Nkemdiche], we can do something special.\"\n\nOle Miss recovered from a disastrous 2-10 season in 2011 to finish 7-6 under second-year coach Hugh Freeze, including a win over rival Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl and Pittsburgh in the BBVA Compass Bowl.\n\n\"I feel like he's a good man, he's special,\" Robert Nkemdiche said of Freeze. \"I feel like he's a man of his word. I respect him a lot, and I feel like he has good things coming.\"\n\nWhen Nkemdiche, Treadwell and Tunsil announced their decisions, the Ole Miss coaching staff celebrated.\n\nOle Miss doesn't have the pedigree to usually recruit toe-to-toe with the likes of Alabama, LSU and other Southeastern Conference powerhouse programs. But at least on paper, the Rebels might outshine their SEC opponents when signing day ends.\n\n\"I'm so thankful and blessed that these families have chosen to trust in us,\" Freeze said. \"We'll treat these young men as our own.\"\n\nNkemdiche's choice marks a signature addition to what is shaping up to be one of the top recruiting classes in the country. He had offers from coast to coast and took official visits to Florida, Ole Miss and LSU before deciding to join his brother in Oxford. Denzel Nkemdiche, a defensive back, had a breakout season for the Rebels in 2012, leading the team with 82 tackles, including 13 for a loss.\n\nTalk of Ole Miss landing Robert Nkemdiche began almost two years ago when the Rebels signed his brother, then a lightly recruited defensive back, in May 2011. After back-to-back 18-sack seasons, Robert emerged as the top prospect in the 2013 class.\n\nSurprisingly, Nkemdiche committed to Clemson during an unofficial visit last June, citing a solid connection with the Tigers' coaching staff. It was apparent that he was excited about the opportunity to continue playing with Kamara, who had committed to Clemson while on campus with Nkemdiche the day before.\n\nIn July, Nkemdiche visited Ole Miss with Kamara while maintaining it was primarily just to see his brother. He would make two return visits in September to watch the Rebels play, with a visit to Clemson in between. It was during that month that his mother, Beverly, made headlines by stating her displeasure with her son's actions while she was out of the country.\n\nDenzel Nkemdiche said he and his mother pushed hard for Robert to choose Ole Miss, but ultimately the decision was his. Denzel said his individual success at Ole Miss -- along with the big improvement for the program this season -- were important factors in Robert's choice.\n\n\"The feeling right now is unreal,\" Denzel Nkemdiche said Wednesday. \"It's real hard to explain. I'm glad it's over. I wanted him to make the right decision that he wanted to make, and I wanted him to feel comfortable with the decision he made because he's going to be where he's going to be for the next three years. I'm glad he's going to be there with me. I'll be able to look after him and take some care of him, and we'll be able to win the national championship together.\"\n\nDefensive end Robert Nkemdiche (left) and offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil were two of a handful of big-time players Ole Miss landed Wednesday. AP Photo, USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 295-pound Tunsil chose Ole Miss over Georgia and Alabama.\n\n\"It really wasn't the official visit [to Oxford], to be honest with you,\" Tunsil said after announcing his choice in Lake City, Fla. \"Me and [defensive line coach] Chris Kiffin had a relationship for about a year. He never gave up, he never gave up. I told him that Alabama was on top, then I told him that Georgia was on top, and he still didn't give up.\"\n\nConner (Batesville, Miss./South Panola), the No. 1 player in Mississippi and No. 24 prospect in the ESPN 150, picked the Rebels over Alabama and Mississippi State to extend Ole Miss' signing-day run of success.\n\n\"It's right down the road,\" Conner said in an interview on ESPNU. \"I feel more comfortable playing in my home state. I want to do something to put Mississippi on the map.\"\n\nGolson (Prattville, Ala./Prattville) had a tough choice to make: head to the SEC and one of the hottest programs around in Ole Miss, or stick with the team, Florida State, to which he had been committed for nearly two years. The Rebels won out.\n\nIn other developments on signing day involving top recruits:\n\nDefensive linemen Adams, Daniel join Lawson at Auburn\n\nMontravius Adams, the nation's No. 2 defensive tackle prospect out of Dooly County High School in Vienna, Ga., committed to Auburn.\n\nAdams made official visits to Florida, Clemson, Alabama, Georgia and Auburn over the past five weekends. He said early in his recruitment that he would like to leave the Peach State to continue his football career. Clemson appeared to be the early front-runner, as the Tigers' coaching staff was the first to offer a scholarship to the Under Armour All-American. More than 20 programs followed suit, but Adams chose Auburn.",
  "latent_3315": "A few weeks ago, Apple arrived at Pixar Studios with a handful of iPad Pros, beseeching their employees — illustrators, graphic designers, animators and 3D compositors — to use the tablet in place of their traditional input combination, be it a Wacom slate or pen and paper.\n\nThe move was unprecedented for a company famous for its secrecy, particularly because the Pixar employees were encouraged to go public with their findings.\n\nOf particular importance to Apple’s public relations campaign to revitalize its flagging tablet sales was to position the iPad Pro as more than just an oversized iPad, a factor the company had to overcome when its first tablet was immediately called “just a big iPhone” upon its debut in 2010.\n\nFive years later, the iPad is still by far the most popular tablet on earth, commanding a dominant 86 percent of worldwide tablet web usage. That statistic betrays a truth about the iPad: for many buyers, it sits in a purgatory between the phone and the laptop, used more often on the couch than the office.\n\nBut there’s another side to the story: the iPad is a PC, and has for many people replaced their laptops. The more casual user may peck away an email or edit a report on Apple’s virtual keyboard, and a smaller segment may buy a Bluetooth keyboard case or a capacitive stylus to augment the kinds of experiences Apple has tacitly enabled over the past five years.\n\nWith the iPad Pro, Apple is giving those users, the ones that see the iPad as the future of personal computing, a brand new canvas, one with nearly everything they asked for. But does it come with too high a cost? And how does it compare to products like the Surface?\n\nSpecs\n\niOS 9.1\n\n12.9-inch 2732 x 2048 pixel IPS laminated display,\n\nA9X SoC (2 x A9 cores @ 2.15Ghz), M9 co-processor\n\n4GB RAM\n\n8MP rear camera, F2.4 lens\n\n1.2MP front-facing camera\n\n802.11 (a/b/g/n/ac), dual-channel (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz) MIMO\n\nBluetooth 4.2\n\nLTE optional (Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 38, 39, 40, 41)\n\n10 hours battery life over WiFi), nine hours over LTE\n\nSecond-gen Touch ID sensor\n\nFour speakers for stereo sound in any orientation\n\n220.6 x 305.7 x 6.9mm\n\n713 grams (WiFi), 723 grams (WiFi + Cellular)\n\n32GB WiFi ($1049), 128GB WiFi ($1249), 128GB WiFi + Cellular ($1429)\n\nI bought the first iPad back in 2010, realizing it was more than just a big iPhone. But as the hardware has thinned, the internals become more powerful, and the software and app ecosystem more eclectic and full-featured, its uses cases have waned. And I’m not alone in feeling this way.\n\nBlame the rise of the phablet. With phones getting bigger — and statistically, whether you’re an iPhone or Android user, you’re still likely to purchase an iPad over a competing tablet — the explicit need for yet another screen between the smartphone and the laptop has declined.\n\nThe iPad Pro gives an awkward first impression. The human brain can quickly adapt to scale, but when you’re used to something being a certain size and weight, there can be an adjustment period. Upon first picking up Apple’s 12.9-inch slate, I had a disorienting Brobdingnagian feeling of being suddenly shrunken, the object before me a precise recreation of an object I know and use nearly every day.\n\nBut whereas the iPad Air 2 mainly resides on my bedside table, for reading and catching up on Twitter, I could tell right away that the iPad Pro would likely live in the office.\n\nThe tablet does have a few significant design departures from the 9.7-inch iPad worth noting. Bezels above the display have been reduced to the same extent that the side bezels were with the iPad Air, improving the screen-to-body ratio and making the front appear more symmetrical.\n\nAnd while the Lightning port, power, volume and home buttons are all in the same spots, the iPad Pro includes four identical speaker holes etched into the aluminum chassis, equally spaced to the left and right sides on the top and bottom of the tablet, respectively. Four speakers of course make for louder output — Apple claims three times the volume over the iPad Air 2, and it’s true — but the radical improvement here is in the bass, which is actually discernible amidst the highs and mids.\n\nI’ll get the obvious out of the way: watching movies on the iPad Pro is a wonderful experience. It’s just the right size to see all the relevant details, and scales up 1080p video with no visual artifacts. The 2732×2048 pixel IPS display employs a technique called “photo alignment,” ensuring the 5.6-million pixels that comprise the screen are always firing the right way and in the correct direction.\n\nLike the 5K iMac released in late 2014, the iPad Pro employs a custom display timing controller, necessary because there were no components available to Apple to ensure a stable stream of pixels from the GPU to the screen — so Apple built one itself. Not only does this inherently lower energy consumption, because it enables more subtle gradations in brightness, but it allowed Apple to build custom refresh rates into iOS for the first time.\n\nThe iPad Pro can go down to 30Hz when a static image is displayed on the screen, lowering power consumption during marathon reading sessions and other low-movement activities.\n\nWhat’s interesting about the amount of custom technology in the iPad Pro’s display is how quickly the company’s Mac innovations are trickling down to the iPad. From the Oxide TFT panel to the timing controller itself, Apple has quickly adapted one of its most impressive in-house developments to a much more mainstream product in the iPad Pro. Expect to see similar iterations in future versions of the iPad and iPhone.\n\nBut the iPad Pro is a touch-enabled device, running iOS 9. The operating system was designed for touch, and as much as the iPad Pro’s marketing is going to emphasize its utility as a laptop replacement, it still exists in between a traditional tablet and a laptop. That is never more evident than while using the Pencil, Apple’s first home-built stylus, and one of the stranger accessories the company has released.\n\nFirst, know this: Pencil has the lowest latency of any powered stylus I’ve used, and that includes the new Surface Pro 4’s pen. The difference is subtle, and Microsoft’s solution offers its own advantages, but the Apple Pencil is simply the best tool for precise input I’ve found on a portable computer. Designed to work with Apple Notes and a number of recently-updated design-based apps like FiftyThree’s Paper, Adobe’s Creative Cloud, ProCreate, Evernote and many more, the Pencil feels well balanced and comfortable.\n\nBecause of its 240Hz refresh rate, I found that even the more precise movements were recognized. The stylus also recognizes tilt, which allows developers to add a second variable to the input; in most cases, painting apps use the tilt motion to bloom the size of a brush or extend the eraser, but developers, like they do with 3D Touch, have free rein to adopt it how they see fit.\n\nThe stylus also has some of the best palm rejection I’ve seen from a tablet. The iPad Pro’s physical screen is considerable, and there are going to be times where it is necessary to place part of a hand or palm on the display to sketch, shade or write, and screen is almost always able to tell what’s part of a palm and what’s a finger. That’s good because it’s possible to even use a finger on the display while using the Pencil.\n\nWhile in Apple’s newly-improved Notes app, holding two fingers on the display creates a virtual ruler that the Pencil then adheres to when drawing straight lines. It’s a remarkable way to show off what’s possible with the tool, but also reinforces that the Pencil is more than just a piece of plastic; there are complex electronics inside, and the iPad can tell the difference.\n\nThe Pencil’s body is a made of a smooth white plastic that will probably get marked up over time, since Apple has committed the sin of simplicity, by omitting a place to store the tool in between sessions.\n\nUnlike the Surface Pen, whose magnetized metal exterior can be attached to the side of its Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 hosts, the Pencil’s only means of storage is through its built-in Lightning adapter, revealed by popping off the magnetic cap and plugging it into an iOS device. If you manage not to lose the Pencil (check the bottom of your bag, where mine usually lay hiding), it lasts for 12 hours, but like most peripherals, only needs a few minutes of charging to get right back to work.\n\nThough Pencil costs a stupefying $129 CAD, for many people, mostly creative professionals, it will be built into the price of the device. Apple has always commanded a premium for products that have significant impacts on peoples’ lives, and to many artists, designers, architects, compositors and photographers, using the Pencil to make precise refinements to an image or creating a painting from nothing feels like part of the same continuum.\n\nAnd while Microsoft has done an admirable job enticing companies like Adobe to adopt desktop versions of Photoshop and Illustrator to support pen input on Windows 10, because iOS 9 has a touch-first modality, those same companies are free to create iPad Pro apps like Photoshop Fix and Adobe Sketch, whose mobile-first lineages are free from the complex, menu-heavy user experiences found in most Windows apps.\n\nThat touch-first experience extends to iOS as a whole, whose latest version brought Split View multitasking and picture-in-picture video, along with a host of improvements to Siri.\n\nSplit View has been a slow burn feature, the type that doesn’t seem to solve the traditional issues surrounding multitasking on a sandboxed operating system like iOS, but over time, as the apps one uses grow to support it, it proves its worth.\n\nTim Cook thinks the iPad Pro will replace the laptops of millions of people around the world. But before he made that claim to The Telegraph, it was foremost in my mind: are people going to consider the iPad Pro instead of a MacBook Air or even a MacBook Pro?\n\nTo Apple, these are the same customer: as long as they stay within the company’s vast ecosystem of profitable hardware, Cook doesn’t care how you get things done.\n\nBut to test the mettle of the iPad’s post-PC claims requires living in that world — so that’s what I did. Every morning, I brought the iPad Pro to work, unsheathing it from its Smart Keyboard case as I would my MacBook Pro. And it succeeded — for the most part.\n\nIronically, despite the sheer number of high-quality applications available through Apple’s App Store, I almost always had a Safari browser window open on the left side, and something, be it Slack, Tweetbot, Evernote or theScore, on the right. What felt cramped and muddled on the iPad Air 2 worked flawlessly on the iPad Pro; the extra screen space, which amounts to a whole iPad app vertically oriented spread twice across the screen, made it relatively easy to get my work done.\n\nFor my workflow, I found iOS’s lack of background services, such as Dropbox sync, a major detriment, since I would have to explicitly open the app whenever I wanted to initiate a download, something I never have to think about on my MacBook Pro.\n\nBut I quickly realized that the enforced window management of having two apps side by side in either a 50/50 or 75/25 split made it easy to rethink the way I worked, since I was only given two options. iOS 9 makes it easy to switch between these apps, too, and on the iPad Pro it is made even easier with the Command-Tab function adapted from OS X.\n\nThis brings us to the Smart Keyboard, which is, like the Surface’s Type Cover, sold separately from the iPad. While I would argue that the Apple Pencil is very much an optional accessory for the iPad Pro buyer, the Smart Keyboard is not.\n\nWithout it, the iPad Pro loses much of its effectiveness as a laptop replacement, and whether Apple is keen on admitting it, the slate is not nearly as compelling a solution — and loses its “Pro”-ness — without a keyboard.\n\nMost accessory companies have built iPad keyboards for the smaller units, but Apple’s Smart Connector changes everything by losing the need for Bluetooth. One could argue that at such close range Bluetooth is pretty reliable, but that wasn’t the issue: until now, every wireless keyboard required a battery, which added bulk and needed to be charged. Yes, Apple has created yet another proprietary connector for which manufacturers will have to pay license fees, but the upside is that they will derive power from the iOS device itself (the iPad Pro is undoubtedly the first of many Apple products to use the Smart Connector), and obtain much greater data bandwidth through a hard connection. Apple isn’t saying what the bus speed is for Smart Connector, but it’s surely at least 10 times the speed of Bluetooth 4.x’s 25 megabits per second.\n\nThe $229 CAD Smart Keyboard is a great product, and one of the best keyboards I’ve typed on. Unlike Apple’s MacBook keyboards, the keys themselves are tightly covered in fabric, protecting them from impact, dirt and other mistreatment. The material is not dissimilar to what Microsoft uses on its Type Covers, but instead of a trackpad the keys go right up to the edge.\n\nIt’s strange using a device like this with no trackpad, no mouse, especially when the mode of operation is physically moving your hand up to the display to tap on items. That awkwardness is exacerbated by the fact that the Smart Keyboard only holds the iPad at a single angle, albeit one that works for most use cases. It’s better on the lap than the table, but it can work for both.\n\nPerhaps the strangest thing about the Smart Keyboard isn’t how it works, but how it folds. As thin as the actual keyboard element is — it’s only about three millimetres — Apple had to fit the extra girth somewhere, so its engineers designed a solution where the keyboard folds under the outer layer of the case itself. It’s not perfect, and was likely prototyped a hundred different ways, but it works remarkably well while simultaneously keeping the device both secure and clean.\n\nWith the Keyboard Cover attached, the iPad Pro weighs just over a kilogram, or 2.34 pounds, just over half a pound less than a 13″ MacBook Air, and 1.2 pounds less than a MacBook Pro. These are significant weight differences, and will certainly factor into some peoples’ choices to purchase the iPad over a MacBook.\n\nApple has also opened up the Smart Connector to MFi-certified companies. I got to try Logitech’s Logi CREATE Backlit Keyboard Case with Smart Connector, which encloses the entire iPad in in a hard plastic shell. The keyboard itself is much more akin to a traditional MacBook experience, with clicky, backlit keys that feel tactile and springy, but it weighs much more than Apple’s Smart Keyboard case, and doesn’t look nearly as sleek. On the plus side, it too doesn’t need to be charged, despite the presence of its backlight.\n\nWhether the iPad Pro is connected to a keyboard or not, the tablet is the fastest in Apple’s retinue of A9-powered devices, and, subjectively, one of the fastest computers I’ve used this year. The company’s A9X chip is a very different beast than the A8X, which itself was a slightly modified version of the A7.\n\nNot only has Apple reduced the number of cores to two, from three in the A8X, it has ramped up the clock speed in each one to 2.15Ghz, compared to 1.5Ghz in each A8X core. Apple is able to do this because the chips themselves are smaller, and output less heat, expanding the thermal threshold past 2Ghz.\n\nThis is the first time an A-series chip has broached that vaulted clock speed, and helps the A9X demolish previous single-core and multi-core Geekbench benchmarks in the mobile category.\n\nTo put the A9X’s single-core performance in perspective, it surpasses the Intel Core i7-870 in the 2010 27″ iMac, and is only slightly below the Core i7-2600, which arrived a year later. More impressive is that the A9X’s single-core benchmark eclipses the 1.7Ghz Core i7-4650U inside the 2013 MacBook Air, and its two cores come close to beating the quad-core chip in Geekbench’s multi-chip benchmark.\n\nThe fact that Apple also returned to a dual-core CPU setup speaks to the confidence it has in the A9’s abilities.\n\nOn the GPU side, Apple has clearly beefed up both the number of cores, from six in the iPhone 6s to likely eight or ten, as well as each one’s clock speeds. In tests like GFXBench’s Manhattan Offscreen, the iPad Pro scored 100 percent better than the iPhone 6s, and 100 percent better than the iPad Air 2; the two older devices scored the same for two very different reasons.\n\nThough it may seem awkward to recommend the iPad Pro as a gaming machine, there is great potential given the power it has. I also tested 3D4Medical’s Complete Anatomy, an app that renders the body’s various systems — muscular, vascular, nervous — in real-time using extremely high-resolution textures that can be both zoomed in and manipulated. The app, which was buttery smooth on the iPad Pro, is the type of app Apple has used to great effect over the years, showcasing a product’s computing power and intuitiveness in one fell swoop.\n\nThe iPad Pro can run all of the nearly one million apps made for the smaller iPads, though ones that haven’t been explicitly updated to support the Pro’s higher-resolution display will scale up, with fuzzy text and less usable space, similar to the way an iPhone 5-era app scales to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\n\nThe ones that have been updated, like Slack, Evernote and Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite, have around the same usable space as the same app on a MacBook Pro, and for the most part are just as capable.\n\nThis is the conundrum, and something I want to emphasize if you’re deciding between a laptop like a MacBook or Surface Book and the iPad Pro: the iPad can facilitate more experiences better than the MacBook, but the MacBook is still better at some core things, like multitasking and sharing information between apps, and likely will be for the foreseeable future. But iOS is taking more from OS X than the other way around, and if the iPad Pro engenders a replacement cycle similar to a laptop, which it will, the two platforms will be closer in two years from now — but the iPad will still be the only one with touch support, Pencil support, and a million apps.\n\nThe other advantage to the iPad Pro is battery life. Apple promises around 10 hours of use on WiFi, and nine on LTE, but I nearly doubled that in my testing. The company has always been conservative with its iPad battery estimates, and based on my workflow I found the device to last nearly 18 hours on a charge, which is some 10 hours longer than my 13-inch MacBook Pro. I can’t promise everyone will have the same experience — I wasn’t playing games or watching videos during my work days — but there is a clear energy advantage to be had from the low-power A9X chip over an Intel Core solution in a MacBook.\n\nThe iPad Pro also borrows the iPhone 6s’s new WiFi and LTE capabilities, expanding speeds to 867Mbps and 300Mbps respectively. The only cellular version is $1429 CAD 128GB model, which is a shame, but the company is clearly going after potential laptop buyers looking to stay connected wherever they go. Also adapted from the new iPhones are the second-generation Touch ID sensor, which is much faster than that of the iPad Air 2, and considerably more accurate than on previous generations.\n\nIn fact, the only disappointing aspects of the hardware are its cameras, which have remained identical to the iPad Air 2 at 8MP and 1.2MP respectively. There is an irony in the camera’s relatively poor optics in that Apple encourages you to edit three streams of 4K video on the iPad Pro’s beautiful screen, knowing that the likely source would be from a phone a fifth the physical size. That’s where iCloud Photo Library comes in, which synchronizes a person’s media through iCloud.\n\nThe iPad Pro is a tablet that can replace your laptop. Microsoft’s tag for its Surface line applies just as readily to Apple’s new slate, even if the former doesn’t run what many would consider a “desktop” operating system. The difference between the iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 4 is that without the keyboard attachment it is thoroughly reduced in usability, both from an app ecosystem and software design perspective.\n\nThe iPad Pro, on the other hand, inherits thousands of incredible applications that don’t need, and will never need, any peripherals. But when a keyboard is attached, the iPad Pro is almost as good as the laptops it will eventually replace. It’s not quite there yet, and most people should probably wait a generation until some of its software kinks are sorted out, but there will be many, like me, who love the iPad Pro for what it can do today.\n\nThe final consideration is price. In Canada, the markup on the iPad Pro is fairly substantial, owing to the continued weakness in the dollar. The 32GB WiFi $799 USD entry-level version is $1049 CAD here; the 128GB WiFi version is $949 USD and $1249 CAD; and the most expensive, and most desirable option, the 128GB LTE model, is $1079 USD and and $1429 CAD. Add in the cost of a $229 Smart Keyboard (and a $129 Pencil) and you’re looking at spending nearly $1500 tax-in for an iPad. By contrast, the cheapest Surface Pro 4, which features an Intel Core m3 chip, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, costs $1179 CAD, and with a $169 Type Cover comes to around the same price as the 128GB WiFi iPad Pro.\n\nThat’s a lot of money for a big screen and a keyboard. And for many, it will be too much, especially for an unproven form factor. But if you’ve been considering buying both a MacBook Air and a smaller iPad, it may be worth taking the leap.\n\nPros\n\nBeautiful design\n\nConsistently excellent performance\n\nSharp, responsive display\n\nVery low latency on Apple Pencil\n\nSmart Keyboard case well designed\n\nLots of compatible productivity apps\n\niOS 9 multitasking is a boon to usability\n\nExcellent battery life\n\nCons",
  "latent_3329": "Radical religious preacher and president of the Islamic Research Foundation, Zakir Naik, is a controversial clerical figure since the time he left his medical profession for a priestly career.\n\nA medical doctor-turned- televangelist, Naik is a Salafism-inspired debater on Islam loudly speaking of himself as a ‘student of Comparative Religion'. Based in Mumbai, he is a frequent state guest of Saudi Arabia who has been honoured by the kingdom, on several occasion, for propagating its state religion “Salafism”, or what is popularly known as Wahhabism. Unlike the radical Islamist preachers from South Punjab in Pakistan or from Afghanistan who grew up under the Taliban influence, Naik was born and brought up in a liberal Muslim society with secular Indian ethos. Therefore, it is utterly surprising to see how an Indian Muslim qualified doctor of a modern educational background turned into the biggest Salafist preacher of the world.\n\nThough, in the beginning, he was praised by most common Muslims in India and abroad, they have been awakened by their local clergy and imams against Naik’s un-Islamic utterances. On account of his coining an exclusivist and supremacist theology, Naik has been opposed by almost all mainstream Islamic scholars, except those who subscribe to the Wahhabi-Salafi clergymen of Saudi Arabia, popularly known in India as Ulema of Ahle Hadith.\n\nInterestingly, Naik embarked on his Salafist mission in a disguise. He emerged as an Islamic televangelist speaking about Islam as a faith of peace and pluralism, finding similarities in it with different religions. But he showed his true colours later when he pronounced supremacist, anti-Semitic and incendiary judgments against other faith traditions.\n\nMore deplorable to Muslims was his misguided and narrowed stand on various theological issues in Islam as well as other religions. As a result, mainstream Muslims have been advised by the classical Islamic scholars and Muftis (theologians) to shun his speeches and prevent his programmes in their localities. Consequently, he was barred, in the last few years, from addressing Islamic conferences and public gatherings in Allahabad, Kanpur and Lucknow and New Delhi at the urging of local influential imams as well as the moderate Islamic thinkers.\n\nAn overwhelming number of Sufi and Shia Muslims in all these cities have peacefully protested against the proposed programmes of Naik. They maintained that Naik has not only offended the religious sentiments of both Shia and Sunni-Sufi Muslims, but also tried to sabotage the universal values of national interest; interfaith harmony, communal affinity, national integration and respect for all faiths. Therefore, they held, they did not want Naik to preach to the Indian Muslims who are imbued in Sufi teachings of communal harmony, spiritual symbiosis and sharing cultural amity among the different religious communities of India.\n\nChallenging Sufi Islam, which calls for inclusiveness and syncretic values among Muslims and non-Muslims, Naik run down the age-old Rishi-Sufi tradition of peace and pluralism in the country. Through his enchanting memorization of holy verses of different religious scriptures to lay the claim of religious supremacy, he created a huge fan club among the Muslims, particularly those inclined to the Salafism.\n\nCherry-picking the religious texts out of sync with their deeper connotations, he evolved an utterly exclusivist, intolerant, xenophobic and anti-pluralism theological underpinnings breeding the ground for the Salafist combat against kufr (infidelity) and shirk (polytheism). No wonder then, the recent brutal killing of an innocent Sufi singer Amjad Sabri in Pakistan is viewed as the assassination of a grave worshipper, a mushrik (polytheist) by the hardcore followers of Naik.\n\nIt is a common knowledge that Naik often demonized the Sufi Muslims calling them Qabr parast (shrine worshippers) likening their shirk to that of the Hindu community. He is on record clearly stating that, \"aaj ke daur men Muhammad (pbuh) se bhi mangna shirk hai, in fakiron aur babaon ki to baat hi mat karo\" (It's an act of polytheism to seek blessings even from Muhammad pbuh in this age, not to speak of the Sufi saints and holy men). Like the most Salafist clergy, Naik has also declared the Sufi and Shia communities beyond the pale of Islam on these theological grounds.\n\nTherefore, both Sufi-Sunni and Shia Muslims in India countered Naik along with other radical Salafist preachers and televangelists like Shaikh Yusuf al-Qardawi, the spiritual leader of Ikhwan al-Muslimin (Muslim Brotherhood) in Egypt. For instance, an apex body of Sufi Sunni Muslims in India, All India Ulama & Mashaikh Board (AIUMB) organized a massive protest against his public lecture on 17 January, 2015 at Delhi’s India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC). A large number of common Muslims, from both Sunnis and Shias, gathered outside the premises of the IICC protesting against his address at the venue. I myself heard them shout slogans against Naik’s radical Salafism taking roots in India. One slogan was going like this: Na Atanki Na ikhwan…Sunni Sufi Hindustan (India is an abode for Sufi Sunnis, not for terrorists or extremist political outfits like Muslim Brotherhood).\n\nAfter a week or so, the AIUMB also took out a strong procession against the leading extremist Wahhabi preachers in the Middle East, particularly Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a world-renowned Egyptian Salafist Islamist jurist (Mufti) who had sought to justify suicide-bombing of the jihadists in his Fatwas. Sufi Muslims in India lament that al-Qaradawi, despite his explicit radical pronouncements, continues to enjoy exposure via global Islamic TV channels. His weekly program “al-Shari’a wal-Hayat” (Sharia and Life) aired on an Egyptian TV channel is one of the most viewed TV programmes in the Middle East.\n\nNaik has often averred that he has never offended the religious sentiments of any Islamic sect nor did he outrage other faith traditions. But his incendiary speeches against different faiths and various established beliefs and practices of Islam are viral.\n\nHe declared the battle of Karbala between the Prophet’s grandson Imam Husain and the tyrant ruler, Yazid as a political phenomenon in the Islamic history, which is viewed as a ‘fight between good and evil'. Imam Hussain strongly refused to surrender to the unjust and tyrannical ruler Yazid, who walked away from the Prophet’s concept of leadership through consensual democracy and created a completely dictatorial dynasty. Yazid was responsible for the brutal killings of Imam Hussain and his entire noble family along with his companions. He led the war of destruction at Medina. Therefore, the sacrifice of Imam Hussain is looked up as a lofty Islamic principle of democracy, freedom and justice. But in his speeches, Naik held Yazid in high esteem glorifying him with a great Islamic prayer “May Allah bless him”. Because of this sectarian slug fest, Naik had to face the ire of the mainstream Sufi and Shia Muslims.\n\nMore to the point, Naik cannot wash off his hands from his inflammatory speeches that might cause violent extremism in a section of the gullible Muslim youth. In one of his lectures when he was asked whether how he viewed Osama bin Laden. He replied: “If he (Osama bin Laden) is terrorizing the biggest terrorist (America) then, I endorse him.”\n\nIndeed, it’s a matter of grave concern. It’s unthinkable to lionize a global terrorist responsible for the murder of thousands of people, Muslims and non-Muslims alike. But one is amazed at the sheer naivety of this global Salafist televangelist who washes off his hands stating that he did not meet Osama bin Laden.\n\nJaved Anand, general secretary, Muslims for Secular Democracy, has succinctly put it: “Naik could say nothing for sure about bin Laden because “I have never met him”. Naik never met George Bush either but he had no doubt that the former American President was the “biggest terrorist”.\n\nThis is precisely why Naik’s Peace TV has been banned in India. It had potential to inspire violent extremism. Since its inception, it has been airing views antithetical to interfaith harmony, pluralism and democracy in India, much in the same way as the Salafist televangelists did in Egyptian Islamic televisions. Peace TV had a viewer base of up to 100 million people across the region. But due to the extremist, exclusivist and misogynistic utterances that Naik made in several episodes, the Indian government has banned Peace TV broadcasts in India since 2012. Answering a question in the Lok Sabha in 2012, the Minister of State of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry had stated that “The content of this channel (Peace TV) is not conducive to the security environment in the country and poses a potential security hazard.”\n\nMore worryingly, Naik’s outfit, Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) was extensively featured on the official website of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which has been declared a terrorist organization under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.\n\nIt cannot be denied outright that radical religious preachers like Naik misguided a section of the gullible and naïve Muslim youth indoctrinating them into an ideology of religious bigotry, exclusivism and supremacism. But at the same time, it is gratifying to note that the mainstream Indian Muslims are increasing awareness about the imminent threat that the radical preachers pose to the secular fabric of the country. Muslims who are anchored in the Rishi-Sufi tradition of India have always combated and defeated the menace of radicalism. They are gearing up to do it again.\n\nThe author is a scholar of Comparative Religion & Classical Islamic sciences, cultural analyst and Doctoral Research Scholar at Centre for Culture, Media & Governance (JMI Central University).

  "latent_3550": "West Haven initiates eminent domain to acquire 6 properties for The Haven South project 6 properties targeted for The Haven\n\nDave Saldibar, 83, a life-long resident of West Haven turns to speak directly to the city’s residents, March 23, 2016, during the West Haven Redevelopment Agency’s public hearing at City Hall regarding the aquisition by purchase or eminent domain of the nine remaining properties involved in the Haven South Municipal Development Plan Project. Saldibar, a proponent of the project doesn’t agree the city of West Haven should use eminent domain. less Dave Saldibar, 83, a life-long resident of West Haven turns to speak directly to the city’s residents, March 23, 2016, during the West Haven Redevelopment Agency’s public hearing at City Hall ... more Photo: Catherine Avalone — New Haven Register Photo: Catherine Avalone — New Haven Register Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close West Haven initiates eminent domain to acquire 6 properties for The Haven South project 1 / 1 Back to Gallery\n\nWEST HAVEN >> The city, through its Redevelopment Agency, has initiated eminent domain proceedings to acquire six properties within The Haven South project area for the first phase of the proposed The Haven upscale outlet mall.\n\nThe agency filed the six “statement of compensation” documents Tuesday, according to attorney Gary O’Connor of Pullman & Comley.\n\nThe documents were filed with the City Clerk’s office and sent to attorneys for the property owners, some of which are holdouts and some of which have unclear status that the proceedings are meant to clarify, he said.\n\nEach of the six statements specify how much the city proposes to pay the respective properties via the eminent domain process based on the legally mandated formula of 125 percent of the average of two independent appraisals.\n\nThe figures are as follows:\n\n• $862,500 for the Citgo station property at 60 Elm St., owned by SZS Enterprises LLC, owner of the Citgo station and mini-mart at Elm Street and First Avenue. Representatives on both sides have said that at one point the developer had offered $1.8 million.\n\n• $236,875 for 341 First Ave., owned by Robert McGinnity, his mother, Natalie McGinnity, and his uncle, Michael Perrone.\n\n• $225,000 for 349 First Ave., owned by Robert McGinnity.\n\n• $450,000 for 38 Elm St. (at the corner of Elm and Water streets), owned by 38 Elm St. LLC. City officials have said that at one point the owner agreed to a settlement, but never followed through with the closing.\n\n• $198,125 for 395 First Ave., owned by Charles Gore. O’Connor said the owner at one point had agreed to a settlement, but the mortgage holder did not respond.\n\n• $23,750 for the FMR Grinding Wheel Corp. property at 0 Center St. O’Connor previously has said that condemnation proceedings would clarify this property’s status. FMR no longer is in business. The city and developer, The Haven Group LLC, also are listed as potentially having interests in the property.\n\n“Unfortunately, the city has been left with no other viable choice than to initiate the use of eminent domain for the advancement of The Haven South Municipal Development Plan,” said Mayor Ed O’Brien in an emailed statement.\n\n“Eminent domain will proceed because negotiations in good faith between the city and the property owners have concluded with no success,” O’Brien said. “Accordingly, on Aug. 30, letters were delivered to inform the remaining property owners that the city has filed statements of compensation ... to begin the eminent domain process.”\n\nBut the attorney representing the owners of three of the six properties said the city and developer The Haven Group do have choices — and those choices include leaving his clients’ properties, or at least portions of them, out of the plan.\n\n“They told us they were going to do this, so it is not a surprise,” said Dwight Merriam of Robinson & Cole of Hartford, who represents SZS Enterprises, as well as the McGinnitys and Perrone, who own houses at 341 First Ave. and 349 First Ave.\n\nBut “we have seen nothing that demonstrates that there is any public purpose to be served by the taking of these ... properties,” said Merriam, who teaches land use law at the University of Connecticut.\n\n“The city should not really be taking properties by the coercive force of eminent domain ... unless they can demonstrate that it is absolutely necessary to take these properties,” Merriam said.\n\n“It seems like all West Haven wants to do is the same tragic mistake that New London did” in the landmark Kelo v. New London eminent domain case, which ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court, said Merriam, who co-edited a 2006 book about the case and the issues it raised, “Eminent Domain Use and Abuse: Kelo in Context.”\n\nThe high court ultimately ruled in New London’s favor, but nothing ever was built.\n\nNatalie McGinnity and Perrone “have life estate interests” in 341 First Ave. to live there “until they die,” Merriam said. If West Haven proceeds forward with condemnation proceedings, “they’re going to have to evict the elderly,” he said.\n\n“You have two elderly people who don’t want to move and aren’t going to move,” Merriam said. (Natalie McGinnity doesn’t live there now but reserves the right to if or when she reaches a point where she needs the additional care that her family can provide, he said.)\n\nBoth the McGinnity family and SZS owners Saed Ahmed and Sheik Hossain have offered to sell their properties and lease them back, Merriam said.\n\n“We’re ready to deal with the city and we’re ready to deal with The Haven Group ... and figure out ways that these properties can be incorporated with this project in the long run, but in the meantime” the current owners can continue to live and work in them, he said.\n\nHossain and Ahmed, who have owned the Citgo station for 18 years, “want to spend the rest of their working lives harvesting the fruits of their sweat equity and hard labor,” Merriam said. They are willing to paint or decorate it “to be consistent with the project.”\n\n“But they are not going to leave that property without a fight,” he said.\n\nDespite the offers, “nobody seems interested in doing that,” Merriam said. “They just want to grab these properties.”\n\nO’Brien previously had said a number of times that he did not want to go to eminent domain and would only do so as a last resort, but suggested that that’s where things have arrived here. The City Council authorized the use of eminent domain if necessary on June 10.\n\n“Five property owners — and six properties in all — remain (to be acquired) in The Haven South project area” while “more than 50 property owners have accepted generous offers from the developers in far excess of the fair market value of their homes or businesses,” he said.\n\n“As mayor of this great city, I acknowledge that this decision is not without controversy,” O’Brien said. “However, in the interests of the tens of thousands of West Haven residents who according to a poll conducted by the University of New Haven support this progressive economic development initiative, I can no longer stand idle and watch a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create hundreds of jobs and generate millions of dollars in property tax revenue slip through our fingers.\n\n“Indeed, The Haven will be a transformational project for West Haven and its proud residents, one that will positively impact the landscape of the city’s business climate, cementing its reputation as a major destination once again, in the generations ahead,” he said.\n\nThe mayor’s statement says the documents were filed in U.S. District Court in New Haven, although the documents themselves state that they were prepared for Superior Court in the Ansonia-Milford Judicial District.\n\nThe Haven developers Sheldon Gordon and Ty Miller have proposed to build the $200 million, 347,826-square-foot waterfront development project in two phases, with about 60 stores and seven restaurants in the first phase and about 100 stores if both phases ultimately are built.\n\nExecutive Vice President Matt Armstrong told the City Council March 30 that The Haven would be the only direct-waterfront, luxury retail center in the country, with 60 stores, seven restaurants and a public waterfront promenade with a 200-seat amphitheater.\n\nIt would pay $2 million in annual property tax and create more than $15 million in incremental sales tax for the state, he said.\n\nThe Haven would provide 800 full-time and 400 part-time jobs, plus 800 construction jobs using all Connecticut-based contractors, he said. The developers had spent $15 million on the project as of that date, Armstrong said.",
  "latent_3665": "This article walks you through four different ways that you can speed up your exports in Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\nYou can follow along in the video tutorial, which walks you through each step, or you can skim down the article if you want to focus on one technique. Each of them has advantages for a different type of workflow.\n\nExporting = Rendering and Encoding\n\nWhen Premiere is going to export some edited video, it has to do two separate tasks: rendering and encoding. It’s important that you understand what that means, so you can understand why our tricks can save you time.\n\nWhen Premiere exports a video, it starts by reading the source file that you have imported into your project, which is nearly always a compressed file. Then it decompresses the file so that it can deal with the actual image. It’s not saving the uncompressed image to a file – it’s just holding it temporarily in memory.\n\nNext it applies any transformations that you’ve done in your sequence – color correction, resizing, any manipulations to the image. That’s rendering.\n\nThen it encodes the image into whatever codec you chose in your export settings, and it saves that compressed data to the output file. So, we start with a compressed file, and we end up with a compressed file.\n\nNow, it’s usually not possible to skip either one of those steps—you usually have to render and then encode when you’re exporting. But our first trick allows you to avoid rendering and encoding multiple times. In most situations, you don’t just render out your timeline once. You often render out a rough cut, and then you get feedback from your producer or your client (perhaps using a tool like Frame.io ), and then you need to export again after you have made some tweaks. And then the process repeats itself, so you often end up exporting the same timeline several times. If we’re careful about our rendering and exporting, though, we can save a lot of time.\n\n1. Compress Previews\n\nImagine I have a clip on my timeline with a bunch of color corrections. If I tell Premiere to export, it’s going to render that file with my color correction, and then it’s going to compress that data into my output codec. If it’s a long clip with a lot of adjustments, it might take about 60 seconds.\n\nBut I can also tell Premiere to just render the clip, and save that rendered file on the hard drive. That file is called a preview file, and I can use that file for exporting later without rendering all over again.\n\nI click on “sequence” and then “render in to out”. Now Premiere renders that clip and saves it away, and the bar on my timeline turns green.\n\nThe green bar means that Premiere does not need to render that section of my timeline again when it exports.\n\nNow if I go to export the clip again, and I check the box in the export settings that says “use previews,” now Premiere will simply take the file that it saved when I rendered and compress that to my output codec. It does not need to render any of my color corrections – it just needs to read that rendered file and encode it (we usually call that a transcode). And that takes only a couple seconds, instead of 60 seconds from before.\n\nNow let’s say that I want to change the title at the end of my film because there was a typo the first time. Premiere will still need to render the changed title, but it doesn’t have to render the main clip again, which means that my second export will be almost as fast as the last one.\n\nIf I am only making fairly small changes to my edit, all of my exports from now on will be very quick.\n\nAll of that sounds wonderful, but there is a catch. By default, Premiere uses a fairly low-quality codec for its previews. That means that, if I check the box to use previews when I export, my final result will not have the full quality that I’m expecting. That is fine if I am just going to export a low-resolution preview and it’s not the final version, but what if I want to export the full quality clip multiple times?\n\nIn that case, I need to change my preview codec to a high-quality codec, which is very easy. Go to “Sequence Settings,” then “Preview File Format.” If you want to be absolutely sure that you aren’t losing any quality, then you can choose a lossless or uncompressed format. Bear in mind that, if you use a very high-quality, high-bitrate codec for your previews, that may take up a lot of space on your hard drive, so most people will pick something on the high end but not the very top (maybe ProRes 422 HQ).\n\nIf you’re not sure which codec to use, you can take a look at this page on the frame.io blog , which allows you to compare many different codecs.\n\n2. Smart Render From Previews\n\nThere’s one more feature of the “use previews” box that can make a huge difference in render times, and strangely, it’s seldom mentioned. If you choose exactly the same codec settings for preview files and for your output file, you can skip both the rendering and encoding when you export.\n\nBecause Premiere has already rendered the previews and encoded them, all it has to do is copy the data into the output file. Premiere calls this Smart Rendering, and in this case we are actually combining the Use Previews feature and the Smart Rendering feature.\n\nCheck out the video for a detailed walkthrough.\n\nThat clip, which took about 60 seconds to export normally, and took about 5 seconds with the normal “Use Previews”, takes less than a second when you Smart Render from previews.\n\nThis trick has the extra advantage that the image is not processed twice. If you use previews without the Smart Render, then your image will be compressed twice (unless you choose an uncompressed codec as your preview codec, of course).\n\nThis trick doesn’t work for all codecs unfortunately—you have to use one of the codecs listed under “ QuickTime Match Source (Rewrap) Support ”. The two most common codecs listed are ProRes and Cineform, both of which are great.\n\nThe tricky part is knowing whether or not Premiere is using your preview files exactly as they are and just copying them into the export file, or whether Premiere is reading those preview files, decoding them, and then re-encoding them into the output file. It’s important for you to know, because if it’s re-encoding those files, then you could be losing some quality, because the images are being compressed twice. And of course it will take longer, which is lame.\n\nFortunately, it’s not actually that hard to do. Select a clip, pre-render it, and then export with the Use Previews box checked, and write down how long it takes. Then export again, but make a small tweak to your output codec. You should use the same codec, but make a small change (maybe go from ProRes 422 to ProRes 422 HQ). You should see the slightly tweaked export taking longer, because now it’s having to transcode your preview files, whereas the first time it just copied the data. If it takes about the same amount of time to do both exports, that probably means that Premiere is not using the Smart Render feature.\n\nTest Results Showing Smart Render Working:\n\nPreview files set to ProRes 422 HQ, Exported to ProRes 422 HQ: 1.4 seconds.\n\nPreview files set to ProRes 422 HQ, Exported to ProRes 422: 5.6 seconds.\n\nTest Results Showing Smart Render Not Working:\n\nPreview files set to ProRes 422 HQ, Exported to ProRes 422 HQ: 4.9 seconds.\n\nPreview files set to ProRes 422 HQ, Exported to ProRes 422: 5.6 seconds.\n\n3. Smart Render from Source\n\nThe third trick can make a HUGE difference in export speeds, but it will only work for people who are doing only the editing in Premiere, not the color correction.\n\nLet’s imagine that I am the editor for film, and the camera department has given me proxy files to edit with. They took the raw files from the camera and converted them into a DNxHD proxy format with a standard rec709 look (which means I don’t need to add a LUT to my timeline in order to preview accurately). I am just doing the edit, so I’m not bothering with any color correction or special effects in premiere.\n\nIf I export in exactly the same format as my source footage, which in this case is DNxHD, then Premiere doesn’t have to render or compress at all. I haven’t added any color correction or effects to my clips, so Premiere can copy my images straight from the original files, which are DNxHD, and paste them into my exported file, which is also DNxHD.\n\nThis is another way to take advantage of premiere’s Smart Rendering feature, but this time we’re only using the Smart Rendering, not the Use Previews feature. When you’re Smart Rendering from your source footage, you can export an entire 10-minute film is a few seconds. It’s that fast.\n\nAgain, since we’re using the Smart Render feature, we can only use one of the codecs listed on this page . H.264 files, for instance, will not work with this workflow, but ProRes, DNxHD, and Cineform all work well.\n\n4. Smart Render from Export\n\nTrick #4 is a lot more flexible than the first three. There are no restrictions about your source footage, you don’t need to pre-render the timeline before you export, and it works even if you’re doing lots of effects and color correction in Premiere.\n\nThe first time that you export, you have to wait for the normal export. But if you need to make a minor change to the edit and export again, you do a smart render from your first export.\n\nYou take the first export and import it back into your project, and then lay it on top of your timeline in a new layer. Then you take the slice tool and cut away whatever portion of the timeline that’s been changed for the second export.\n\nAs long as you use the same settings for both exports, Premiere will be able to copy the compressed data straight from your exported file into your second exported file. All that it has to render is what’s changed, and so it exports extremely quickly.\n\nThe great thing about this method is that you don’t have to prepare anything first. You didn’t have to remember to pre-render my sequence. You can take advantage of this trick after the fact.\n\nAgain, this works with ProRes, DNxHD, Cineform, and all of the codecs listed on this page .\n\nI should note that, in each of these 4 tricks, we care about saving time on the rendering and compression of the video not the audio.

  "latent_3727": "Ted Cruz refuses to back Donald Trump and hints he could revive his campaign\n\nTed Cruz refused to commit his support to Donald Trump as the Republican nominee on Tuesday, and did not rule out resurrecting his campaign for president despite having dropped out of the race last week.\n\nIn an interview with conservative talk show host Glenn Beck, the Texas senator said that picking a presidential candidate “is not a choice that we as voters have to make today”.\n\nHis comments came as Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who suspended his own presidential bid in March, said he would support Trump as the nominee.\n\nDuring an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Rubio said he intended to stick to a pledge signed by all of the Republican candidates last year to back the eventual nominee.\n\n“I signed a pledge, put my name on it, and said I would support the Republican nominee and that’s what I intend to do,” Rubio said.\n\nCruz appeared less bound by the pledge, which has already been discarded by former contenders Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham – both of whom have come out against Trump despite his all but clinching the Republican nomination.\n\nCruz pointed out there were still two months until the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and six months until the general election, saying “we need to watch and see what the candidates say and do”.\n\nAlthough Cruz had long committed to supporting the Republican nominee in the past, his tone changed after Trump repeatedly made personal attacks against Cruz and his family.\n\nThe businessman branded his rival “Lyin’ Ted”, threatened to “spill the beans” on his wife while implying she was unattractive, and accused Cruz’s father of involvement in the assassination of John F Kennedy. While Cruz once called Trump “a friend” and “terrific”, he held an abrupt press conference hours before ending his campaign at which he derided Trump as a “serial philanderer”, an “amoral pathological liar”, and a “braggadocious, arrogant buffoon”.\n\nTed Cruz, the master strategist, was no match for Trump's cult of personality Read more\n\nNor would Cruz rule out returning to the campaign trail if “there’s a path to victory”. The Texas senator suspended his campaign after losing the Indiana primary on 3 May by a margin of 53%-37%, and said that with the loss he no longer saw a path to the Republican nomination. On Tuesday, Cruz told Beck: “If that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly.”\n\nHowever, Cruz’s campaign had a well-organized effort to put his supporters into positions of power among Republican delegates, who will elect the party’s nominee at the national convention in Cleveland this July. This effort means that although Trump is the only candidate left in the Republican primary, Cruz supporters will have significant influence on the convention floor, and that his delegates will probably hold control of crucial committees, such as those that write the convention rules and design the party’s platform.\n\nCruz made clear that a return to the trail was very unlikely, though he would not rule it out. “I’m not holding my breath,” he said, in response to questioning about a primary election in Nebraska, also on Tuesday, that he was once expected to win.\n\nThe Texas senator did dismiss the possibility of running as a third-party candidate or supporting a third-party alternative in November. “I don’t think that’s very likely,” he told Beck. “It’s always talked about; I don’t think it’s something that’s likely to happen.”\n\nCruz’s statements followed Trump’s continued failure to unite the Republican party behind him. Two former presidents have said they will not back him and key party figures like the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, have declined to endorse him, at least for the present. The former reality television star is scheduled to meet Republican congressional leaders in Washington on Thursday, as part of his effort to heal the rifts within the party.\n\nRubio said while he stood by his prior criticisms of Trump – which included dubbing his former opponent “an erratic con artist” – Republican primary voters had made their choice clear.\n\n“My differences with Donald – both my reservations about his campaign and my policy differences with him – are well documented and they remain,” Rubio said.\n\n“But I’m not going to sit here right now and become his chief critic over the next six months, because he deserves the opportunity to go forward and make his argument and try to win.”\n\nHe added: “I know what I said during the campaign; I enunciated those things repeatedly. And voters chose a different direction. I stand by the things that I said.”\n\nRubio nonetheless declined to offer Trump an explicit endorsement, hedging when asked if he planned to vote for the billionaire in November.\n\n“I intend to support the nominee,” Rubio said.\n\nPressed again by the CNN host Jake Tapper on whether that meant casting a ballot in Trump’s favor, Rubio responded: “I’m not voting for Hillary Clinton. I’m not throwing away my vote.”",
  "latent_3746": "The Justice Department’s settlement with Citigroup was finally announced Monday. A $7 billion settlement against a too-big-to-fail bank? What’s not to love?\n\nWe’ll answer that with another question: If the settlement that the Justice Department just negotiated with Citigroup is as punitive, why did Citigroup’s stock go up when the deal was announced? Reasons for the rise include the report of a good second quarter – a report that just happened to be released on the same day this deal was announced.\n\nNot bad for a bank that just settled fraud charges, recently failed a Federal Reserve stress test, and wouldn’t even exist if the American people hadn’t bailed it out.\n\nApparently the fraud settlement was anything but a mortal blow for the bank, an entity created by the actions of both Democrats and Republicans in Washington. Citigroup was subsequently saved from collapse with a $45 billion emergency loan from the government, after participating in the crime wave that helped precipitate a financial crisis. (More background here.)\n\nIt wasn’t just Citigroup. The stock market overall had a good day Monday. The American people, not so much. As we’ll see, the “consumer relief” in these deals tends to prove elusive. The government isn’t doing much to help. Of the $38.5 billion set aside to help homeowners in 2009, the Obama administration has only spent $10 billion (as of the January 2014 Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Inspector General’s Report).\n\nThese agreements leave criminal bankers with no incentive to mend their ways. They reinforce the message that they won’t be prosecuted, and allow them to keep their ill-gotten gains while shareholders (many of whom were defrauded by the bank itself) pick up the tab for their wrongdoing. And they allow a too-big-to-fail bank with an extensive record of fraud to remain a systemic threat.\n\nIf you’re looking for a silver lining, here it is: The Obama administration is clearly feeling the heat about its treatment of Wall Street. Otherwise the rhetoric wouldn’t be quite as stern and the settlement figures would probably be lower. But that’s not a reason for the public to settle for deals that leave perverse incentives – and dangerous banks – in place.\n\nHere are seven reasons why the much-touted new deal isn’t everything it’s cracked up to be, especially for consumers.\n\n1. No individual prosecutions were announced.\n\nThey have the evidence, including damning emails that reveal that Citigroup employees knew they were peddling highly defective mortgages as AAA-rated and materially misrepresenting them to investors. Consider this sentence, one of many such statements in the Justice Department’s filing: “Citigroup’s due diligence personnel reevaluated certain of the vendor’s loan grades and directed the due diligence vendor to change some of those grades …”\n\nWho, exactly? Wasn’t that evidence of an intent to defraud?\n\nNot a single Citi executive or employee is being charged with a crime as of this writing. In fact, no major banker has been. By contrast, more than 1,000 bankers were prosecuted and convicted in the savings and loan scandal of the 1980s – a crime wave that represented much less fraud than that committed by America’s big banks in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n2. The Justice Department appears to be offering false hopes of prosecution.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder says that this doesn’t preclude the possibility of criminal indictments. But he said the same thing when the $13 billion settlement with JPMorgan Chase was announced. That was eight months ago, in November of 2013.\n\n“The bank’s misconduct was egregious,” the Attorney General said in Monday’s announcement. But “banks” don’t commit crimes. Bankers do.\n\nThere’s no deterrence in this deal – and, as David Dayen has observed, the usual suspects are up to some of their old tricks. It will take some prosecutions to change that. Let’s hope the Attorney General plans to follow through.\n\n3. Citigroup seems to have negotiated the government to a draw.\n\nCiti wants some bloggers and other financial types to buy the notion that it sold a much smaller number of mortgage-backed instruments than JPMorgan Chase, which came to a $13 billion deal. (Better Markets, an excellent bank reform organization, filed suit against that deal, maintaining that it was conducted with a lack of transparency that is against the public interest.)\n\nBut Citi wasn’t a minor player in the mortgage game. As Ben Protess, Jessica Silver-Greenberg, and Michael Corkery noted in the New York Times, “Citigroup … sold roughly half as many mortgage securities as JPMorgan had through its various subsidiaries.” (Their article addresses the public relations timing of today’s announcement.) That makes the $7 billion figure roughly proportional. So, while the Justice Department told reporters it rejected Citi’s argument that its fine should be based on relative market share, it sounds like Citi did pretty well.\n\nWhat’s more, since the Justice Department recently floated a figure of $10 billion, while Citi proposed $4 billion, it looks very much like they split the difference. That’s a pretty good deal for Citi, especially since there was massive evidence that one of the parties committed criminal fraud – and the other party was the United States government.\n\n4. This $7 billion settlement isn’t worth $7 billion.\n\nCitigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach told analysts on today’s earnings call that Citigroup may not pay out the entire $2.5 billion that it has agreed to provide in “consumer relief.”\n\nWhat’s more, while the $4 billion fine is not tax-deductible, the CFO told analysts that the $2.5 billion (or however much it offers) will be deductible. That means the taxpayer will be footing part of the bill for this deal. (See the Wall Street Journal’s “Citigroup to Get Tax Silver Lining in $7 Billion Settlement” for more.)\n\nThey may also be able to use this money as JPMorgan Chase has done: by presenting their construction work and other efforts as a charitable effort, earning community goodwill for what should be an act of penance – while taxpayers foot part of the bill.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, this isn’t really a $7 billion deal, once you factor in the loopholes and tax breaks.\n\n5. The “soft dollars” in these deals are funny money, anyway.\n\nThe government’s disastrous foreclosure fraud settlement was touted as a $25 billion deal. But as we saw in that instance, banks have many ways to game the “soft-dollar,” consumer relief portion of these deals. They have “forgiven” debts owed to investors, not themselves, and counted it against the total. And they have counted renegotiated deals that were in their own best interests – deals that they would have renegotiated anyway – against this amount. (See Travis Waldron for more.)\n\nNow, if Citi’s CFO is correct, they may also be able to get a tax break for those write-downs.\n\nWho negotiated a deal like that? An associate attorney general named Thomas J. Perrelli “led the Government’s efforts” in those negotiations, according to his law firm’s website – efforts that ultimately led to an error-ridden, bank-friendly deal. (Perrelli rejoined his former firm after leaving government service.)\n\n5. Half a billion dollars is going to the states – many of whom stiffed consumers in the last deal.\n\nThe states got to handle a big chunk of Perrelli’s “$25 billion” deal, too – and the money wound up being used for a lot of things besides helping consumers. (Homeowners’ groups recently filed a lawsuit against California Gov. Jerry Brown in an attempt to get the money back.)\n\nAnd Citi’s CFO tells us that this money will be tax-deductible, too.\n\n7. The agreed-upon “monitor” for this deal doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nThe parties agreed that Citigroup would hire a “monitor” to make sure it adhered to this terms of the deal. He’s the one who is supposed to look out for the interests of bank consumers and the general public.\n\nHis name? Thomas J. Perrelli.",

In the first two weeks on the job, the camera system helped investigators corroborate stories and apprehend a carjacking suspect in the intersection of Shary Road and Expressway 83, Garza said.\n\nThe video system consists of 32 cameras that have been placed in major city intersections and city parks that not only work as a crime deterrent but also aid emergency responders in learning about auto wrecks before citizens call 9-1-1, Garza said.\n\n“Our dispatchers will be monitoring these cameras,” he said. “This will allow us to respond to accidents right after they happen.”\n\nThe roughly $395,000 price tag for the 32 cameras was covered by asset-forfeiture funds.

He became known for his leading roles in Lawn Dogs (1997), Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), Matchstick Men (2003), The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), Moon (2009), and Seven Psychopaths (2012). He has also played supporting roles in The Green Mile (1999), Galaxy Quest (1999), Frost/Nixon (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Conviction (2010), and The Way, Way Back (2013).\n\nIn 2017, Rockwell's performance as a troubled police deputy in the crime-drama Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Golden Globe, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.[1][2][3][4] The following year, his portrayal of George W. Bush in the biopic Vice earned him his second Academy Award nomination in the same category.[5][6]\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nRockwell was born November 5, 1968 in Daly City, California.[7][8] He is the only child of actors Pete Rockwell and Penny Hess. After their divorce when he was five, he was raised by his father in San Francisco, and spent his summers with his mother in New York.[9] At age 10, he made a brief stage appearance playing Humphrey Bogart in an East Village improv comedy sketch with his mother.[10]\n\nHe started high school at the San Francisco School of the Arts with Margaret Cho and Aisha Tyler, but received his high school diploma from Urban Pioneers, an Outward Bound-style alternative school. Rockwell explained, \"I just wanted to get stoned, flirt with girls, go to parties.\" The school \"had a reputation as a place stoners went because it was easy to graduate.\"[11] The school ended up helping him regain an interest in performing. After appearing in an independent film during his senior year, he moved to New York to pursue an acting career.[12]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nEarly films [ edit ]\n\nAfter his debut role in the horror film Clownhouse (1989) (produced by Francis Ford Coppola's production company), which he filmed while living in San Francisco, he moved to New York and trained at the William Esper Studios with teacher Terry Knickerbocker.[13] His career slowly gained momentum in the early 1990s, when he alternated between small-screen guest spots in TV series like The Equalizer, NYPD Blue and Law & Order and small roles in films such as Last Exit to Brooklyn and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He also appeared as the title character in The Search for One-eye Jimmy (1994). During this time, Rockwell worked in restaurants as a busboy and delivered burritos by bicycle.[14] At one point, Rockwell even worked as a private detective's assistant. \"I tailed a chick who was having an affair and took pictures of her at this motel\", he told Rolling Stone in 2002. \"It was pretty sleazy.\" A well-paying Miller commercial in 1994 finally allowed him to pursue acting full-time.\n\nThe turning point in Rockwell's career was Tom DiCillo's film Box of Moonlight (1996), in which he played an eccentric man-child who dresses like Davy Crockett and lives in an isolated mobile home. The ensuing acclaim put him front and center with casting agents and newfound fans alike, with Rockwell himself acknowledging that \"That film was definitely a turning point...I was sort of put on some independent film map after 10 years in New York.\"[12]\n\nHe also received strong reviews for the film Lawn Dogs (1997), where he played a working-class lawn mower who befriends a wealthy 10-year-old girl (Mischa Barton) in an upper-class gated community in Kentucky; Rockwell's performance won him Best Actor honors at both the Montreal World Film Festival and the Catalan International Film Festival. In 1999, Rockwell played prisoner William \"Wild Bill\" Wharton in the Stephen King prison drama The Green Mile. At the time of the film's shooting, Rockwell explained why he was attracted to playing such unlikable characters. He said, \"I like that dark stuff. I think heroes should be flawed. There's a bit of self-loathing in there, and a bit of anger... But after this, I've really got to play some lawyers, or a British aristocrat, or they'll put a label on me.\"[9]\n\nHollywood recognition [ edit ]\n\nAfter appearances as a bumbling actor in the sci-fi parody Galaxy Quest (1999), as Flute in the Shakespeare adaptation A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999), and as gregarious villain Eric Knox in Charlie's Angels (2000), Rockwell won the biggest leading role of his career as The Gong Show host Chuck Barris in George Clooney's directorial debut, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002). Rockwell's performance was well-received, and the film earned generally positive reviews.\n\nRockwell has also received positive notices for his role opposite Nicolas Cage in Ridley Scott's Matchstick Men (2003), with Entertainment Weekly calling him \"destined by a kind of excessive interestingness to forever be a colorful sidekick.\"[15] He received somewhat more mixed reviews as Zaphod Beeblebrox in the film version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005). He then had a notable supporting role as Charley Ford, brother of Casey Affleck's character Robert Ford, in the well-received drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), in which Brad Pitt played the lead role of Jesse James. According to an interview on The Howard Stern Show, director Jon Favreau considered casting him as the titular character in Iron Man as the studio was initially hesitant to work with Robert Downey Jr., who had been considered for his role in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Rockwell eventually appeared in Iron Man 2, released in 2010, as Tony Stark's rival weapons developer, Justin Hammer. He is said to have accepted the role without reading the script. He had never heard of the character before he was contacted about the role and was unaware that Hammer is an old man in the comic books.\n\nIn addition to big-budget feature films, Rockwell has also appeared in indie films such as The F Word and played a randy, Halloween-costume-clad Batman in a short, Robin's Big Date, opposite Justin Long as Robin. He also starred in the film Snow Angels (2008) opposite Kate Beckinsale. He has worked on several occasions with the comedy troupe Stella (Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wain), making cameo appearances in their short films and eponymous TV series.\n\nRockwell played Victor Mancini in the film Choke (2008), based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. Critic Roger Ebert said of his performance that he \"seems to have become the latter-day version of Christopher Walken – not all the time, but when you need him, he's your go-to guy for weirdness.\"[16]\n\nIn 2007, Rockwell guest-starred in the web series Casted: The Continuing Chronicles of Derek Riffchyn, Greatest Casting Director in the World. Ever. He appears opposite Jonathan Togo as Derek and Justin Long as Scott. Rockwell plays an aspiring young actor named Pete Sampras.[17] In 2009, he starred in the critically acclaimed science fiction film Moon, directed by Duncan Jones. His performance as a lonely astronaut on a long-term solo mission to the Moon was widely praised, with some critics calling for an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination.[18] On May 3, 2010, it was announced that Rockwell would team up again with Iron Man 2 director Jon Favreau for Favreau's adaptation of the graphic novel Cowboys & Aliens. He played a bar owner named Doc who joins in the pursuit of the aliens.[19]\n\nRockwell also appeared in Martin McDonagh's Seven Psychopaths (2012),[20] as well as Nat Faxon and Jim Rash's The Way, Way Back (2013).[21] For his performance in The Way, Way Back, some critics felt he again deserved an Academy Award nomination.[22][23]\n\nIn January 2014, it was announced that Rockwell was cast in The Eel, in which he played an escaped convict. The film was produced by Kevin Walsh, Nat Faxon, and Jim Rash, marking Rockwell's second collaboration with all three.[24] Additionally, Rockwell starred in the 2015 remake of Poltergeist. On May 3, 2016, it was announced that Rockwell would voice Mortimer Ramsey in the action video game Dishonored 2. Rockwell was cast along with other Marvel Cinematic Universe actors.[25]\n\nRockwell re-teamed with McDonagh for the 2017 film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. His performance as an incompetent police officer Jason Dixon won several accolades, including his first Academy Award, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture,[26] two Screen Actors Guild Awards and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. In August 2017, Rockwell was cast to play George W. Bush in Adam McKay's Vice, a biopic of Dick Cheney. He received his second Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination for the film.[27]\n\nTheatre [ edit ]\n\nSince 1992, Rockwell has been a member of the New York-based LAByrinth Theater Company, where John Ortiz is a co-artistic director. In 2005, Philip Seymour Hoffman directed him in Stephen Adly Guirgis' hit play The Last Days of Judas Iscariot. Rockwell workshopped a LAByrinth production, North of Mason-Dixon, which debuted in London in 2007 and then premiered in New York later the same year. Other plays in which Rockwell has performed include: Dumb Waiter (2001), Zoo Story (2001), The Hot L Baltimore (2000), Goosepimples (1998), Love and Human Remains, Face Divided, Orphans, Den of Thieves, Dessert at Waffle House, The Largest Elizabeth, and A Behanding in Spokane.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nRockwell has never been married and stated in a 2007 interview, \"I definitely don't want to become a parent.

  "latent_3858": "by Michelle Fox\n\nIt’s been a wild ride in indie publishing the last few days. A media attack on erotica quickly spun out of control, shutting down book stores and wiping some indie authors off the face of the internet. Below, we recount the sequence of events wreaking havoc across the publishing industry.\n\nHow the Book Banning Started\n\nOn Wednesday October 9th, an article in UK ‘news publication’ Kernel Mag triggered a widespread banning and blocking of self-pubbed books. Action was taken across multiple booksellers, and, while the initial focus was on erotica, the problem soon spread to other genres.\n\nAuthors quickly discovered that the Kernel Mag piece misrepresented several individual authors, as well as the erotica genre as a whole. However, it was too late to stop other media outlets from spreading the misinformation, which caused Amazon, Kobo and WH Smith (who carries Kobo’s catalog of books) to react without a full understanding of the situation.\n\nInternet Marketers Use Erotica as a Cash Machine\n\nThe first flaw in Kernel Mag’s anti-porn campaign? The article portrayed the problem as (mostly self-pubbed) erotica and then featured books published primarily by internet marketers, not authors. Authors can easily spot these ‘marketeers’ because they study the erotica book listings in the course of their market research, an expertise that no media outlet has developed.\n\nInternet marketers routinely outsource story production to third world countries and are known to publish hundreds of stories at a time. The quality is low, the covers are in-your-face graphic and the titles are keyword stuffed to the point that even Google gags on all the search terms. It’s not an issue of genre, but a business model used by some marketers to extract profit with no concern for quality.\n\nThis isn’t the first time internet marketers have caused problems for booksellers and indie authors. Before they hit erotica, they slammed the non-fiction category. In 2011, Amazon struck back by deleting the mass produced non-fiction. Now that erotica is under attack, the profiteers will either move on to another genre or become more savvy about how to stay under the radar.\n\nMedia Accuses Legitimate Authors of Illegal ‘Fiction’\n\nOther indie books originally targeted by Kernel Mag, ones written by actual authors, were wrongfully accused of bestiality and rape. Two examples:\n\nDog Gone It by Chelsea Fox was singled out because of a dog on the book cover, not because ‘journalists’ read the content to verify their assumptions. When asked for a quote, Miss Fox said, “This is crazy. There is barely any sex at all in Dog Gone It. It’s amazing how they’re trying to destroy and control what we read or write. Pretty scary if you ask me.”\n\nOne of Tawny Black’s books was cited as “rape porn” by Kernel Mag. Miss Black spoke with Indiereader exclusively, and said of the situation, “Imagine my surprise, as the woman in the story is of legal age and participated in consensual relations with three men she is not related to in any way. To single out this story was not only irresponsible journalism, it amounts to libel since it is in no way “rape porn”.”\n\nClearly, the Kernel did not fact check the titles they publicly defamed, but that did not prevent Amazon from banning all the books in question. Apparently, Amazon doesn’t fact check either.\n\nAmazon Ramps Up Book Banning, Authors Scramble to Respond\n\nAmazon didn’t stop with the Kernel Mag’s list of books, either. They went on to ban other indie books, almost without logic. One author’s book was banned because the cover was deemed offensive. Where did they get the cover? From Amazon.com’s own graphic design program, which is made available to authors free of charge and consists of images that Amazon selects and supplies.\n\nMultiple self-pubbed authors had books blocked because of the word ‘virgin’ in the blurb or title. Books that were unblocked on appeal were immediately blocked again. Covers featuring only faces were deemed to be offensive and blocked. Fully clothed people on covers, alone, not touching anyone, were blocked. Author Alexx Andria resorted to creating ‘brown paper wrapping’ covers for her books, which were eventually reinstated.\n\nOther Booksellers Shut Down, Books Removed in All Genres\n\nUK news outlet BBC then picked up Kernel Mag’s rallying cry. They called out Amazon’s failure to filter content as well as examined some of the potential legal ramifications of not properly shielding the public from erotica. British law is such that Amazon’s lack of an adult filter may cause them legal problems in the future.\n\nBy Sunday October 13th, bookseller WH Smith, also in the UK, shut down their website, leaving up a notice that they would return once all “self-published” books had been removed from their site. This action was criticized by econsultancy.com, which took WH Smith to task for not anticipating the problem. Adult Filters and search engine coding can eliminate any shock factor of books available for sale. However, to date, the only online book retailer in the world with a functioning adult filter is Smashwords.com.\n\nThe chain reaction continued to Kobo, who supplies WH Smith with ebooks. On Monday morning (October 14th) Kobo began wiping indie published books off their website. Not just erotica, but all indie ebooks, including David Gaughan, who is well known for his how-to guides Let’s Get Visible and Let’s Get Digital.\n\nThe UK Legal Climate Facilitates Book Banning\n\nIt’s important to note that this latest round of self-pubbed book banning (there have been two previous large scale attempts to control fiction in the past three years) stems from the United Kingdom, which has some very controversial anti-porn and criminal laws up for vote. Police now have expanded powers to arrest anyone suspected of the potential of being a sex offender–no crime necessary.\n\nThe government also plans to block access to what they deem pornographic material from ever reaching individual internet connections. Essentially, the UK’s current paranoia about the evils of sex is traveling across the pond and forcing US and Canadian companies to conform to their agenda without any due process.\n\nSome Books Remain Despite Questionable Content\n\nMeanwhile, traditionally published fiction continues to be freely available without constraint or criticism. Consider these books:\n\nFifty Shades of Grey, which has titillated audiences worldwide with the submission of the virginal Anastasia to the dominant Christian Grey.\n\nTampa, a novel that covers, in explicit detail, sexual relations between a teacher and their minor student.\n\nFlowers in the Attic, the incest classic, which was recently re-launched and categorized as Romance on Amazon.com.\n\nLolita which celebrates an older man’s sexual interest in a young girl.\n\nThe Virgin Suicides also flourishes across bookseller platforms despite using the word “virgin”, the same word that causes indie authors to have books blocked and removed from sale.\n\nThe intent is not to cause any bookseller to ban the books listed above, but rather to illustrate the double standard and hypocrisy at play when it comes to indies. While it’s easy to say graphic covers and salacious descriptions or titles should be banned, it’s impossible to explain why books such as Chelsea Fox’s Dog Gone It are run off bookseller sites. There is no incest, taboo, or in-your-face erotic content. Also, when did the word virgin and the topics of incest and BDSM become the sole provenance of traditional publishing?\n\nFurther, Amazon.com still sells a wide variety of sex toys with no inhibitions. It seems, the only thing they won’t sell are books that the media–particularly British media–tells them not to.\n\nWhere Things Stand Now\n\nKobo sent an email out to indie authors on Monday night explaining they were quarantining and going through content on their website. They stated, “Our goal at Kobo is not to censor material; we support freedom of expression. Further, we want to protect the reputation of self-publishing as a whole. You have our promise that we will do all we can to ensure the exceptions that have caused this current situation will not have a lasting effect on what is an exciting new channel that connects Readers to a wealth of books.”\n\nSome authors report their books have been reinstated, but many are still unable to find their work for sale on Kobo. The “I Read Fantasy” Facebook page tracked fantasy authors whose accounts were suspended most of the day Monday and urged readers to contact Kobo to encourage them to reinstate those accounts.\n\nWH Smith’s website remains closed for business with no information as to when they may reopen.\n\nAmazon continues to erratically ban self-pubbed books, put them back up for sale only to ban them again, and generally act without any coherence.\n\nBy late Monday afternoon, Change.org had a petition up urging Amazon, Barnes and Noble and Kobo to stop removing erotica. Over 7000 readers signed within hours.\n\nSelena Kitt, owner of Excessica Publishing (which published Miss Fox’s book), and renowned erotica writer with over a million books sold said, “I’d just like to point out that erotica writers aren’t perverts. What we are writing is fantasy. Words, not actions. This is fiction, folks. It doesn’t hurt anyone. And the “but it might make someone DO those horrible things!” argument has been debunked again and again.\n\nBooks about serial killers don’t make people become serial killers. Books about rapists don’t make people become rapists. Books about incest (or pseudo-incest) don’t make people go have sex with family members. In fact, research shows that most people who do read incest erotica don’t, in fact, fantasize about actual family members. If you don’t like it, don’t read it. But telling other people they can’t write or read it crosses the line of personal and intellectual freedom. And that’s not okay.”\n\nThis is a fast moving story, with news breaking almost hourly, and this article represents what we know as of 7pm EST on October 14th 2013.\n\nImportant Note: Kernel Mag has changed the books on their site and their website no longer reflects the content published on 10/9/13. Some of the books originally targeted are still showing on the Daily Mail site.\n\n*************************************************************************",

  "latent_4196": "There was just that one little thing.\n\nDefence lawyer Marie Henein put it thusly to the witness, the third (and last) accuser to testify against Ghomeshi at his sexual assault trial : “You messed around and gave him a hand job. It happened at your place. It happened after the assault.”\n\nIn the witness’s hand. At her house. Consensually. A post-dinner manual stimulation. A couple of days after the then-CBC celebrity radio host had allegedly wrapped his own paws around the complainant’s throat and squeezed.\n\nIt’s getting monotonous, these testimony-bruising rewrites that sharp cookie Henein has elicited from the complainants. In this case, however, the witness got there first, pre-emptively, with her altered statement to detectives and the revelation, induced under examination in chief by Crown attorney Michael Callaghan.\n\nShe regrets the intimacy; Ghomeshi invited into her bed, the creep who’d hurt her not long before during another “make-out” session in the park, and suddenly tightened his fingers around her neck. More crucial, though, as far as this woman’s flagellated credibility is concerned, was her failure to disclose that romantic interlude to either police investigators or the Crowns who have been in her corner — at least not until last Friday, when the complainant, long belatedly, provided an amended statement.\n\nAccuser: “It was an absolute misjudgment, an embarrassment and one that a lot of women make.’’\n\n“He magically appears in your home, his penis ends up in your hand, he sleeps over …” Henein continued as the witness — who can’t be identified — fidgeted nervously on the stand, nearing the end of another problematic day for the prosecution, although some of the jaw-dropping zing has gone out of the proceedings as the trial staggers to a conclusion.\n\nBOING went the trial, as, for the first time on Monday, Ghomeshi’s penis was introduced into evidence, albeit not as formal exhibit — merely as party to events under dispute.\n\nThis witness was in the courthouse last Tuesday while the first witness was still testifying, because she was originally expected to be called second. She was not to follow media reports of the trial and, indeed, claims that’s not what happened.\n\nA pertinent detail which, Henein later charged, was slotted in only once the complainant realized that similarly damaging evidence had been presented to the two women who’d preceded her into the witness box – flirtatious emails and photographs and a hand-written letter sent to Ghomeshi after each had been purportedly subjected to violent mistreatment: slaps, punches, choking: considered the stuff of sex assault because the sudden, unexpected attacks occurred within a sexual context — passionate kissing.\n\nShe’d merely overheard part of a radio report on Friday, something about “emails,” which made the witness go back to check whether she had any such communication with Ghomeshi following the alleged assault, finding only one. It was just “curiosity” that sent her looking, she testified under cross-examination.\n\nBut the timing of the complainant’s amended statement — under oath — is provocative. It was only at that point she hastily added a reference to the consensual “sex act” at her house.\n\nWhat the witness originally told investigators, when she went to police with her allegation on Dec. 3, 2014 — 12 years after the alleged abuse — was that there had been three significant interactions with Ghomeshi that July.\n\nA walk in the park, one evening, after she had finished her performance in a free public engagement. Ghomeshi, whom she barely knew, had come up from behind while she was speaking to a group of girls and placed his elbows on her shoulders and made a weird comment: “We’re engaged.”\n\nWitness: “It was taking ownership of me in a way that was surprising.”\n\nThey went for dinner on the Danforth, sat on the patio, and she was struck by his apparent keenness to be spotted. “He seemed very aware of who was noticing him.’’ Otherwise, she remembered nothing else about that night.\n\nThe next time she encountered Ghomeshi was following another performance. They talked and drifted to a bench near the baseball diamond. “We were making out. Suddenly I felt his h-h-hands on my shoulder and his teeth and his hands were around my neck and he was squeezing. It all happened so fast. It was rough.’’\n\nBut no, she hadn’t attempted to get away from Ghomeshi. They never even spoke about it. The purported incident did, however, raise “warning bells.’’\n\n“I realized at that point there was something not right about that. It was a switch, not the person I’d been there with.’’\n\nCallaghan asked if she’d ever consented to the mistreatment. “I was never asked.”\n\nThereafter followed another dinner at an Indian restaurant on King St., and then they repaired to a bar. Ghomeshi introduced her to a man; she thinks the fellow may have been a reporter for the New York Times. In any event, Ghomeshi appeared quite preening about his friendship with this individual.\n\nThe guy asked if she and Ghomeshi were dating. To which Ghomeshi replied, as the witness recounted Monday: “Oh we’re not seeing each other. We are just f---ing.”\n\nWhich they hadn’t, the complainant was quick to testify. “Not then, not ever.’’\n\nThe mean crack made her feel small. “Well, it certainly put me in my place. It’s not nice. It’s pretty graphic. And it’s not true, more than anything. It was never true.”\n\nWhat the complainant didn’t tell police in her original videotaped statement — played in chunks for court yesterday — was that, despite his demeaning comment, she took Ghomeshi home that night. “That was not a relevant detail?” asked Henein. No, it wasn’t, because she’d never been asked about subsequent consensual sex with Ghomeshi by the cops. It was “a little thing,” unworthy of mention and irrelevant to her complaint, or so she thought then.\n\n“It wasn’t sex. It wasn’t sexual intercourse, is what I mean. Obviously a big mistake.”\n\nHenein: “Is it possible you wanted to keep that part hidden?”\n\nWitness: “I was embarrassed, very embarrassed, and I didn’t think that it was going to become relevant.”\n\nShe continued, in reference to this detail, appended on Friday, after her good friend Lucy DeCoutere had testified: “It wasn’t about getting caught. I figured this was something the Crown needed to know before you (Henein) did. It wasn’t about getting caught. It was about making sure that they wouldn’t be blindsided.’’\n\nHenein, reviewing the complainant’s testimony under Crown questioning on Monday: “Do you accept that you are being deliberately misleading?”\n\nWitness: Yes.”\n\nNor had she mentioned that intimate episode in the 5,000 messages she exchanged with DeCoutere between Sept. 23 and Oct. 29, 2014, as the Ghomeshi story was breaking in the media. Didn’t recount it either in the interview she gave to the Star’s Kevin Donovan, who had learned of her claims through a Facebook posting.\n\nThe complainant took issue with some of the language Donovan used in the story that resulted from that interview; insisted she’d never used the word “attack” to describe the assault, or “grope” in relation to the incident in the park.\n\nThe complainant was quite adamant, on Monday, that she’d never described the park episode as an attack when giving her statement to police. Further, she’d told police that her intention, after the alleged assault, had been to see Ghomeshi only in a public place, such as the King St. bar. Yet she had been with him alone, afterwards.\n\nHenein: “So that’s a lie?”\n\nWitness: “Sure.”\n\nHe’s stayed over, but not the entire night — he’d awakened, dressed and left.\n\nThe final occasion the complainant saw Ghomeshi socially was at a party. In that instance, said the witness, Ghomeshi had made hostile comments about her best girlfriend, called the woman controlling — best to get away from her.\n\nIt’s unclear how it happened, in the re-telling, but next thing — in her testimony — the complainant was in the car with Ghomeshi after this party and they were arguing about the friend.\n\n“I got out of the car, slammed the door, told him he was crazy, to lose my number and never call me again.”\n\nRosie DiManno usually appears Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.",

  "latent_4417": "The 2016 NFL free agency period is right around the corner, with teams set to begin negotiating with veteran free agents on March 7th. The free agent signings will certainly change the 2016 NFL Draft landscape, as team needs will shift according to the club’s activity in the free agent market.\n\nThe Chicago Bears hold the No. 11 pick in the first round of this year’s draft. Most media analysts project that general manager Ryan Pace will use the Bears’ first-rounder on a defensive player, likely one who can upgrade the talent on the defensive line.\n\nHere’s a look at who NFL Draft experts from around the web project the Bears to draft in the first round. To see each analysts’ full mock, click on the appropriate link:\n\nBleacher Report’s Matt Miller: Darron Lee, OLB, Ohio State\n\nFew players enjoyed as productive a week as Darron Lee had at the scouting combine. Weighing in at 6’1″ and 232 pounds, the freak linebacker ran a 4.43 in the 40 and vertical-jumped 35.5″. Lee, who many are comparing to former Ohio State linebacker Ryan Shazier, would be a nightmare for offenses in Vic Fangio’s defense.\n\nCBS Sports’ Dane Brugler: Darron Lee, OLB, Ohio State\n\nLee is a versatile run-and-hit linebacker who fits today’s NFL and transcends scheme, suiting the Bears’ 3-4 base defense.\n\nPro Football Focus’ Steve Palazzolo: Ezekiel Elliot, RB, Ohio State\n\nWith RB Matt Forte getting released, need and value match up well for the Bears as they get one of the best all-around players in the draft. Elliott posted the third overall grade among the nation’s running backs, showing well as a runner, receiver, and pass blocker while adding some lead blocking to the mix as well. He can cut on a dime and he maximizes runs by finishing well through contact, so expect Elliott to become an immediate three-down option at the next level.\n\nESPN’s Todd McShay: Shaq Lawson, DE, Clemson\n\nThe Bears need more impact players on defense, and Lawson — who led the FBS with 25.5 tackles for loss last season — fits the bill. He plays with a good mixture of relentlessness, technique and discipline. Lawson isn’t the best athlete on tape, but he tested well at the combine and has a good first step.\n\nCBS Sports’ Pete Prisco: Elie Apple, CB, Ohio State\n\nKyle Fuller is a good player at one corner, but they need more help at the other. Apple has a ton of talent, but some scouts are concerned about his easy-going approach. Does he love it? Bears coordinator Vic Fangio will make sure he does.\n\nNFL Network’s Daniel Jeremiah: Ronnie Stanley, OT, Notre Dame\n\nStanley is a Day 1 starting left tackle.\n\nNFL Network’s Lance Zierlein: A’Shawn Robinson, DL, Alabama\n\nVic Fangio benefited from a physical, tone-setting defensive front in San Francisco. Robinson gets Chicago a step closer to that type of defensive line.\n\nNFL Network’s Bucky Brooks: Reggie Ragland, LB, Alabama\n\nJohn Fox and Vic Fangio could view the Alabama standout as the ideal traffic cop to run the defense in the Windy City.",
  "latent_4453": "There was that incident with the condoms. Green member of German parliament Volker Beck received one, and so did fellow Green Party member Konstantin von Notz. They were accompanied by friendly greetings from the Young National Democrats, the youth wing of the National Democratic Party (NPD): \"For foreigners and select Germans,\" it said on the packaging.\n\nThere was also a letter containing the right-wingers' normal propaganda, which in the case of Volker Beck, meant accusing his politics of not being in the \"best interest of the German people.\" The Young National Democrats sent and distributed about 5,000 condoms during the 2013 German election, not only to politicians but also citizens who had immigrated to Germany. Beck condemns the action, saying it's based on \"racial biological thinking similar to the Nazi ideology of the Third Reich.\"\n\nThe Federal and State Working Group, which is exploring a possible ban of the NPD, clearly feels the same way. In the middle of October, it decided to include the prophylactic-mailing campaign as further evidence of party functionaries' racist activities. That and the recent ruckus in Berlin's Hellersdorf district, where a mob under the leadership of NPD members agitated against a planned home for refugees.\n\nThe representatives of Germany's federal states will need about a year to make up their minds about the contents of the motion. Now the third and presumably last version is to be presented on Dec. 4, in Osnabrück, to the Interior Ministers' Conference and will arrive this week, at the latest, at the Federal Constitutional Court.\n\nUncomfortable Politics\n\nAt the moment, the proceedings are the queasiest undertaking in German domestic politics. If the process is successful, it will be the first time in over a half-century that a political party has been banned in the country. The NPD would be kicked out of the German state parliaments in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Saxony.\n\nThe motion by the German states has three main points of emphasis, the first of which is the role of so-called \"confidantes,\" informers working for the police and intelligence service. In 2003, then Federal Minister of the Interior Otto Schily (SPD) failed to make his case at the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe in the first attempt to ban the party because it turned out the leadership level of the NPD had been infiltrated by intelligence service informants.\n\nIn order to prevent a repeat, the federal government and states decided in the spring of 2012 to deactivate their approximately 20 informers in the top levels of the right-wing party. The states' most senior representatives, lawyers Christoph Möllers and Christian Waldhoff of Berlin's Humboldt University, emphasize that the authorities no longer have any direct influence over the leadership of the NPD.\n\nRisky Documents\n\nThe more-than-1,000-page supporting collection of documents was revised several times. At first, the collected quotes, speeches and Internet posts were sorted into various categories independent of whether the information had come from confidantes. Now only information guaranteed not to have been obtained through intelligence service sources can remain part of the documentation. In order to increase the credibility of the motion, the interior ministers also agreed to provide a signature guaranteeing the material does not include any information provided by informers. But what happens if, during the trial, someone stands up and outs him or herself as an informer? Or takes credit for writing some crucial evidence?\n\nThe second focus of the ban initiative includes documents meant to prove the NPD's \"aggressive and combative attitude.\" Among them is a transcript of a speech given by the party's group leader in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania's parliament, Udo Pastörs, in 2009 in Saarbrücken. \"We want maximum damage to this particracy,\" he said.\n\nThe third focus is a legal argument: Why an NPD ban is proportionate and complies with the principles of the European court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The legal counsel refer to the \"historic decision of the Basic Law for a defensive democracy in response to the catastrophe of National Socialism,\" the Basic Law being Germany's constitution. And this should apply regardless of whether the party garners support of just 1.5 percent on a national level as it did in this year's federal elections, according to the Basic Law.\n\nSkepticism About Success\n\nBut Berlin remains skeptical that these arguments will convince the Constitutional Court. During recent negotiations to build a coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives following the election, two state interior ministers who are members of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), Boris Pistorius from Lower Saxony and Ralf Jäger from North Rhine-Westphalia, suggested the coalition approve the initiative. The party's parliamentary group also supports this idea.\n\nBut conservative Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich blocked this idea. \"We aren't doing it. The states will have to lose on their own,\" he said, according to a number of participants. This reportedly annoyed Jäger, who pointed out statements to the contrary made by Friedrich in the past. Friedrich declined to comment on the dispute upon request, saying that he would \"endeavor to support\" the process, which doesn't sound like a euphoric endorsement. Still, the SPD state interior ministers seem confident. \"In view of the collected material we are optimistic,\" Pistorius said.",
  "latent_4490": "Irish rock musician, guitar player of U2\n\nThis article is about the guitarist. For other uses, see The Edge (disambiguation)\n\nDavid Howell Evans (born 8 August 1961), better known by his stage name the Edge (or just Edge),[1] is an Irish musician and songwriter best known as the lead guitarist, keyboardist and backing vocalist of the rock band U2. A member of the group since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with the band as well as one solo record. As a guitarist, the Edge has crafted a minimalistic and textural style of playing. His use of a rhythmic delay effect yields a distinctive sound that has become a signature of U2's music.\n\nThe Edge was born in England to a Welsh family, and was raised in Ireland after the Evans family moved there. In 1976, at Mount Temple Comprehensive School he formed a band with his fellow students and elder brother Dik that would evolve into U2. Inspired by the ethos of punk rock and its basic arrangements, the group began to write its own material. They eventually became one of the most successful acts in popular music, with albums such as 1987's The Joshua Tree and 1991's Achtung Baby. Over the years, the Edge has experimented with various guitar effects and introduced influences from several genres of music into his own style, including American roots music, industrial music, and alternative rock. With U2, the Edge has also played keyboards, co-produced their 1993 record Zooropa, and occasionally served as co-lyricist. The Edge met his second wife Morleigh Steinberg through her collaborations with the band.\n\nAs a member of U2 and as an individual, the Edge has campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes. He co-founded Music Rising, a charity to support musicians affected by Hurricane Katrina. He has collaborated with U2 bandmate Bono on several projects, including songs for Roy Orbison and Tina Turner, and the soundtracks to the musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark and the Royal Shakespeare Company's London stage adaptation of A Clockwork Orange. As a member of U2, the Edge has won 22 Grammy Awards and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Several music publications have ranked the Edge among the greatest guitarists of all time.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nDavid Howell Evans was born at the Barking Maternity Hospital,[2] in the county of Essex in England, on 8 August 1961. He is the second child of Welsh parents Garvin and Gwenda Evans,[1] both of whom originated from Llanelli, a coastal town in South Wales. Garvin was an engineer who worked for the local electricity board, and subsequently worked for the electronics company Plessey.[1] The Edge has an elder brother Richard (often called Dik) and a younger sister called Gillian.[1]\n\nThe Evanses initially lived in Chadwell Heath, Essex. Around 1962, Garvin was offered a promotion and a transfer, and the family made the decision to move to County Dublin, Ireland to take it.[1]\n\nDuring his childhood in Dublin he possessed two differing accents to converse in, Welsh and Irish English, the former being used when he was in the family home and the latter when he was outside; as he later explained: \"The reason for this dual identity was mainly to be understood by my peers but also to be accepted.\"[1]\n\nHe received his initial formal education at St. Andrew's National School, in Malahide. As a child, he also received piano and guitar lessons, and practised music with his brother Richard.[1]\n\nU2 [ edit ]\n\nThe Edge performing at a U2 concert in Belfast in 2015\n\nWhilst the Evans brothers were at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin in 1976, they went along to a meeting in response to an advert posted by another pupil, Larry Mullen Jr., on the school's noticeboard seeking musicians to form a new band with him. Among the several other pupils who also responded to the note were Paul Hewson and Adam Clayton.[3] The band went through a number of reformations before becoming known as U2 in March 1978 (Richard Evans having left before this to join another band, leaving his younger brother as the lead guitarist).[4]\n\nEarly in the band's career, Evans was given the nickname \"The Edge\" by members of the Lypton Village surrealist street gang to which Bono belonged. The nickname was derived from the angular shape of Evans' head.[5][6] However, the origin of the name is disputed and other theories include a description of his guitar playing and his preference for not becoming fully involved and therefore remaining on the edge of things.[7]\n\nU2 began its public performance life in small venues in Dublin in 1977, occasionally playing at other venues elsewhere in Ireland. In December 1979 they performed their first concerts outside Ireland, in London, and in 1980 began extensive touring across the British Isles, developing a following. Their debut album Boy was released in 1980.\n\nIn 1981, leading up to the October Tour, Evans came very close to leaving U2 for religious reasons, but he decided to stay.[8] During this period he became involved with a group called Shalom Tigers, in which bandmates Bono and Larry Mullen Jr. were also involved.[9] Shortly after deciding to remain with the band, he wrote a piece of music that later became \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\".[8]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nEvans married his secondary school girlfriend Aislinn O'Sullivan on 12 July 1983.[10] They have three daughters: Hollie (born in 1984), Arran (in 1985) and 'Blue Angel' (in 1989).[9] The couple separated in 1990, but were unable to get legally divorced because of Irish laws regarding marriage annulment at the time; divorce was legalised in 1995, and the couple legally divided in 1996.[9] Evans is a Protestant Christian.[11]\n\nIn 1993, he began dating Morleigh Steinberg, an American professional dancer and choreographer whom he had met whilst she was employed as a dancer during the band's Zoo TV Tour. They have a daughter, Sian (born 1997), and a son, Levi (born 25 October 1999). The couple were married in 2002.[9]\n\nEvans has been criticised for his efforts to build five luxury mansions on a 156-acre (63.13-hectare) plot of land in Malibu, California.[12] The California Coastal Commission voted 8–4 against the plans. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy agreed to remain neutral on the issue following a US$1 million donation from Evans and a commitment to designate 100 acres of the land as open space for public footpaths.[12]\n\nMusical style [ edit ]\n\ndo mean something.

I don't like to be inefficient if I can get away with it. Like on the end of 'guitar heroes do.\" \"Notes actuallymean something. They have power. I think of notes as being expensive.

Like on the end of ' With or Without You '. My instinct was to go with something very simple. Everyone else said, \"Nah, you can't do that.\" I won the argument and I still think it's sort of brave, because the end of 'With or Without You' could have been so much bigger, so much more of a climax, but there's this power to it which I think is even more potent because it's held back... ultimately I'm interested in music. I'm a musician. I'm not a gunslinger. That's the difference between what I do and what a lot ofdo.\" —The Edge in 1991[13]\n\nGuitar playing [ edit ]\n\nAs a guitar player, The Edge has a sound typified by a low-key playing style, a chiming, shimmering sound (thanks in part to the sound of Vox AC30s) that he achieves with extensive use of delay effects and reverb. The repeat delay is often set to a dotted eighth note, and the feedback gain is adjusted until a note played repeats two or three times.[14]\n\nIn 1987's The Joshua Tree, The Edge often contributes just a few simple lead lines given depth and richness by an ever-present delay. For example, the introduction to \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" is simply a repeated six-note arpeggio, broadened by a modulated delay effect. The Edge has said that he views musical notes as \"expensive\", in that he prefers to play as few notes as possible. He said in 1982 of his style,\n\nI like a nice ringing sound on guitar, and most of my chords I find two strings and make them ring the same note, so it's almost like a 12-string sound. So for E I might play a B, E, E and B and make it ring. It works very well with the Gibson Explorer. It's funny because the bass end of the Explorer was so awful that I used to stay away from the low strings, and a lot of the chords I played were very trebly, on the first four, or even three strings. I discovered that through using this one area of the fretboard I was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way.[15]\n\nHis first guitar was an old acoustic guitar that his mother bought him at a local flea market for a few pounds; he was nine at the time. He and his brother Dik Evans both experimented with this instrument.[15] He said in 1982 of this early experimentation, \"I suppose the first link in the chain was a visit to the local jumble sale where I purchased a guitar for a pound. That was my first instrument. It was an acoustic guitar and me and my elder brother Dik both played it, plonking away, all very rudimentary stuff, open chords and all that.\"[15] The Edge has stated that many of his guitar parts are based around guitar effects. This is especially true from the Achtung Baby era onwards, although much of the band's 1980s material made heavy use of echos.\n\nVocals [ edit ]\n\nThe Edge in June 2005\n\nThe Edge also supplies the backing vocals for U2. U2's 1983 live album and video release, Under a Blood Red Sky and Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky are good reference points for his singing (as are the live DVDs from the Elevation Tour, U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle and Elevation 2001: Live from Boston). For example, he sings the chorus to \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" (Bono harmonises on the final 'Sunday'). U2 used this tradeoff technique later in \"Bullet the Blue Sky\" as well. His backing vocals are sometimes in the form of a repeated cry; examples of songs that use this approach include \"Beautiful Day\", \"New Year's Day\" and \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\". Another technique he uses in his backing vocals is the falsetto, in songs such as \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\", \"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\", \"A Man and a Woman\", \"The Wanderer\", live versions of \"The Fly\", and \"Window in the Skies\".\n\nThe Edge sings the lead vocal on \"Van Diemen's Land\" and \"Numb\", the first half of the song \"Seconds\", dual vocals with Bono in \"Discotheque\", and the bridge in the song \"Miracle Drug\".[9] He also sings the occasional lead vocal in live renditions of other songs (such as \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" during the PopMart Tour and \"Party Girl\" during the Rotterdam Zoo TV show when it was Bono's birthday),[16] and has sung the second verse of the \"Stand by Me\" cover on a few shows. A solo acoustic version of the song \"Love is Blindness\", that is featured in the documentary film From the Sky Down, is sung by him as well.\n\nOther instruments [ edit ]\n\nHe has played keyboards on many of the band's songs, including \"I Fall Down\", \"October\", \"So Cruel\", \"New Year's Day\", \"Running to Stand Still\", \"Miss Sarajevo\", \"The Hands that Built America\", and \"Original of the Species\" and others. In live versions of \"New Year's Day\", \"The Unforgettable Fire\", \"Your Blue Room\", \"Moment of Surrender\" and \"Raised By Wolves\", he plays both the piano and guitar parts alternately. In most live versions of \"Original of the Species,\" piano is the only instrument played during the song. Although The Edge is the band's lead guitarist, he occasionally plays bass guitar, including the live performances of the song \"40\" where The Edge and bassist Adam Clayton switch instruments.\n\nOther musical pursuits [ edit ]\n\nThe Edge performing in 2009\n\nIn addition to his regular role within U2, The Edge has also recorded with such artists as Johnny Cash, B. B. King, Tina Turner, Ronnie Wood, Jah Wobble, Holger Czukay, Jay-Z, and Rihanna. The Edge connected with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois collaborator Michael Brook (the creator of the infinite guitar, which he regularly uses), working with him on the score to the film Captive (1986). From this soundtrack the song \"Heroine\", the vocal of which was sung by a young Sinéad O'Connor was released as a single.\n\nHe also created the theme song for season one and two of The Batman. He and fellow U2 member Bono wrote the theme of the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. The Edge, along with Bono, composed a musical adaptation of Spider-Man. On 25 May 2011, a single titled \"Rise Above 1\" by Reeve Carney featuring Bono and The Edge was released digitally.[17] The music video was released on 28 July 2011.[18]\n\nIn 2008, the Edge participated in the Davis Guggenheim-directed documentary film It Might Get Loud. The film examines the history of the electric guitar, focusing on the careers and styles of the Edge, Jimmy Page, and Jack White. The film premiered on 5 September 2008 at the Toronto International Film Festival\n\nOn 29 April 2016, the Edge performed in the Sistine Chapel as part of a conference for the Angiogensis Foundation, making him the first rock artist to stage a concert at the site.[19]\n\nEquipment [ edit ]\n\nThe Edge plays electric guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboards, piano, bass guitar (on \"40\" and \"Race Against Time\") and lap steel guitar. Detailed gear diagrams of The Edge's U2 guitar rig for the 1981 \"October\" Tour,[20] the 1983 \"War\" Tour,[21] and the 2009 \"360°\" Tour[22] are well-documented. Key to his signature sound are the use of modulated delays, namely a Korg SDD-3000 delay unit made in the early 80's, as well as a special Herdim guitar pick, which Edge holds upside down to expose the \"dimples\" when hitting the guitar strings to achieve a raspier chime.[23] For his main amplification, The Edge uses a vintage Vox AC30 particularly a 1964 JMI-era \"Top Boost\" model chassis fitted into an early 70's cabinet.[22] In 2016, Fender unveiled a signature guitar model, The Edge Signature Stratocaster, which The Edge has been using on the most recent tours to replace his vintage 70's Stratocasters.[24]\n\nPhilanthropy [ edit ]\n\nThe Edge, Bob Ezrin and Henry Juszkiewicz co-founded Music Rising in 2005, a charity that helped provide replacement instruments for those that were lost in Hurricane Katrina. The instruments were originally only replaced for professional musicians but they soon realised the community churches and schools needed instruments as well. The charity's slogan is \"Rebuilding the Gulf Region note by note\" and has so far helped over a hundred musicians who were affected by Hurricane Katrina. The Edge also serves on the board of the Angiogenesis Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organisation dedicated to improving global health by advancing angiogenesis-based medicine, diets, and lifestyle.[25][26]\n\nLegacy [ edit ]\n\nIn 2011, Rolling Stone magazine placed him at number 38 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".[27] In 2012, Spin ranked him 13th on their list.[28] In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Bono and the Edge at number 35 on its list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.[29] At the 2017 Bonnaroo Music Festival, the Edge was honoured with the Les Paul Spirit Award by the Les Paul Foundation for being someone who \"exemplifies the spirit of the late, great Les Paul through innovation, engineering, technology and/or music\".[30]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFootnotes\n\nBibliography",

  "latent_4585": "The New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils drop the opening puck during a preseason game at Barclays Center. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)\n\nBy Daniel Friedman\n\nFor the Islanders and their fans, the last few weeks (and months) have ushered in the Brooklyn era. Early indications have been, aesthetically, it’s not getting off to a great start.\n\nWe all knew this day was coming. We all knew this team was going to Barclays Center and that making the transition would entail both positive experiences and growing pains. But we never expected this. We never expected much of the franchise’s charm and tradition to be left on Hempstead Turnpike.\n\nBarclays Center CEO Brett Yormark has promised time and time again to protect and continue the Islanders’ rich tradition. It’s even the central theme of the team’s marketing slogan for the inaugural season in Brooklyn: “Tradition’s New Home.”\n\nMORE: Schwartz: Islanders Fans Need To Relax And Stop Complaining\n\nAnd yet, you look at what’s transpired and details that have come to light recently and see little evidence to support that rallying cry.\n\nIn fact, what you see suggests that there’s been very little respect for tradition.\n\nOriginally, the plan was to completely rebrand the Islanders. After figuring out that fans would prefer that not happen, to put it mildly, the idea was scrapped.\n\n“I use social media, and fans are very adamant and very crystal clear about what they’re looking for as they continue to be fans of the Islanders as the team transitions to Brooklyn,” Yormark said. “During the course of the year, we spent a lot of time going to games (at Nassau Coliseum) to better understand the traditions of Islander hockey and see which should come with the team to Brooklyn.”\n\nIt took severe fan backlash to get all of the division and conference championship banners in the Barclays rafters. It took a massive reaction to scrap the idea of completely rebranding the team.\n\nThe new alternate jersey wasn’t such a big deal, but the new goal horn is brutal and, more importantly, it’s a new goal horn. There was no reason to change it. It was arguably the best one in the league and it’s something with which Islanders fans can (and want to) identify.\n\nAfter what these fans have been through, and how they’ve taken it upon themselves to try and embrace Brooklyn, they have the right to complain about a goal horn. They have the right to say this is a big deal, especially since Barclays Center brass initially told fans the original goal horn would be brought along to Brooklyn. It turns out that was just a bunch of baloney, so I don’t blame the fans one bit for being peeved.\n\nFans have also reportedly been turned away from lower bowl seats for warmups, unless they have tickets in those sections. That was a Nassau Coliseum pastime and, frankly, something that fans are allowed to do in most NHL arenas. It’s not just an Islanders tradition; it’s a hockey tradition.\n\nEven the division banner thing was a big deal. If you win the division and can’t hang a banner to recognize that feat in your home rink, it’s not much of a home rink.\n\nIf the Nets won the division, would they not hang a banner?\n\nYou’ll tell me the Isles aren’t the primary tenant and I’ll tell you that’s not the point. That’s not how you treat a co-tenant that plays just as many games in that building a season as you do. That’s not how you treat a fan base when you promised to maintain tradition. That’s simply unacceptable.\n\n“The banners of the team’s four Stanley Cup championships and the retired Islander jersey numbers will hang as permanent fixtures at the Barclays Center and will pay tribute to the rich history of Islanders hockey,” said Yormark. “We obviously want people to come into the building for preseason games and opening night and feel like, boy, nothing has really changed. Maybe the address has changed but the feeling you get hasn’t.”\n\nWe’re not up to opening night yet, but after a few preseason dress rehearsals, people have come into the building, and both the address and feeling have changed. The sentiment has changed. There’s uncertainty as to how far Barclays Center will go with these types of things, and just how long the team’s historic brand has left before it’s completely replaced. Yormark has promised that won’t happen, but you can’t help but fill in the word “yet” every time you hear him say that.\n\nThis is a fragile fan base right now. There needs to be a certain amount of respect and sensitivity shown towards Islanders fans and, so far, it hasn’t happened.\n\nBarclays Center had years to brush up and get ready for this team’s arrival, and it seems to me that Yormark & Co. have been woefully unprepared. They’re like that kid who realizes he has a test the next day and that he should probably study for it. How can you claim to have spent the last few years doing your homework, only to do things (or contemplate doing things) you know won’t go over well with Islanders fans?\n\nNever mind the fact this building should’ve been built for both sports all along. How could they not see this coming? As soon as they put a shovel in the ground I knew the Isles were either getting a new building in Nassau or going to Brooklyn.\n\nSome things do change when you move to a more controlled, more corporate environment. But some things – like tradition – are better left unchanged, depending on the situation.\n\nBarclays Center’s marketing machine has done some great things. It has marketed the Islanders more aggressively than anyone else has in decades, and it is committed to making a push. But mistakes have been made, and in too many cases already, tradition hasn’t been respected.\n\nThis fan base complains a lot, most of the time over nothing. Not this time. This time, it’s completely justified.\n\nBarclays Center promised to bridge the gap between Long Island and Brooklyn, and, like its scoreboard, it’s attempt has been off-center. Yormark is playing with fire, because he’s dealing with a fan base that is fiercely proud of its heritage and is passionate – but that passion can work both ways. If he wants to channel that energy in the right direction, he needs to be more sensitive and respectful of what those fans and the team they cheer for represent.\n\nTradition’s new home? I’ll believe it when I see it.\n\nFollow Daniel Friedman on Twitter at @DFriedmanOnNYI",
  "latent_4643": "Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement More than 40 people have been arrested during two political demonstrations in Manchester city centre. At least 2,000 people attended the protests, by the English Defence League (EDL) and members of Unite Against Fascism (UAF) on Saturday afternoon. Witnesses said \"ugly scenes\" broke out between rival protestors and police. Forty-eight people have been arrested, four among them were held on suspicion of affray. Most of the other arrests were for public order offences. 'Nasty' atmosphere Other people were detained on suspicion of racially-aggravated offences or over possession of weapons or drugs. A senior police officer said the day had \"proved a challenge\" for the force Protesters were herded towards railways stations by police officers as the protests came to an end. Many of them were moved away from the city centre on buses. One man suffered a head injury during the protests, but did not need hospital treatment, a police spokeswoman confirmed. About 700 members from the EDL and 1,400 members from UAF were separated by a line of riot police, dogs and mounted police in Piccadilly Gardens. Mat Trewern, from BBC Radio Manchester, said the atmosphere had turned \"quite nasty\" as the day progressed. He said: \"There had been some ugly scenes as protesters clashed with police, but it has started to calm down and the crowds are dispersing. \"At one point, earlier on, when it became extremely tense, members of the UAF tried to break the police line between the two groups, which in turn angered the EDL members. More than 2,000 protesters were thought to have been in the city centre \"Trouble had started when 100 members of the EDL arrived at Piccadilly Gardens and they were immediately met with shouts of 'racists' and 'off our streets' by members of the UAF, who had already congregated at Piccadilly.\" He said the number of protesters from the UAF outnumbered those from the EDL by about two to one. \"The disruption in the city centre has been on a large scale, shoppers and businesses have been affected by the protests.\" Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said the presence of so many protesters in the city had \"proved a challenge\" but that life in the city had gone on as normal. He said the police reaction had been necessary in order to tackle \"the few hell-bent on violent confrontation\" and described some of those arrested as \"agitators and trouble-makers\". 'Violent confrontation' He said: \"I would like to thank all those people who came to Manchester today and protested peacefully for their patience and understanding. \"I'd also like to commend the vast majority for demonstrating in a peaceful manner. Most of the arrests were for public order offences \"However, the history of protest has been marred, by those who came intent on violent confrontation.\" Greater Manchester Police confirmed a man, believed to be heading to the protest, had earlier been arrested in Birmingham on suspicion of distributing racially aggravated material. Muslim leaders had renewed appeals for people to avoid the demonstrations. Nanu Miah, a community leader from Oldham, said before the protests in Manchester: \"We are not encouraging people to go, we don't know who EDL is and what could happen.\" An EDL event in Birmingham in September led to counter-demonstrations and bricks being hurled at riot police. Up to 90 people were arrested.\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these? E-mail this to a friend Printable version",
  "latent_4652": "The Federal Reserve’s decision not to raise interest rates in June prompted a a sigh of relief on Wall Street Wednesday, but it wasn't enough to win over economists and activists concerned about sluggish wage growth.\n\nThe Fed said in a statement that it is keeping the federal funds rate -- the main interest rate it adjusts --at between 0 and 0.25 percent, where it has been since 2009. But in economic projections that accompanied the Fed's statement, 15 of 17 Fed board members and regional presidents agreed that economic conditions would warrant a rate increase before the end of 2015.\n\nMost analysts interpreted the announcement to mean that the Fed would increase rates in September.\n\nBut economists who have long pushed for the Fed to more aggressively encourage wage growth warned that a rate hike in 2015 would unnecessarily hit people in their wallets. These economists, along with the Center for Popular Democracy’s Fed Up campaign, are part of a growing movement pushing for monetary policy that prioritizes full employment, and the wage growth that comes with it, rather than concerns about price inflation.\n\n“I think 2015 is too soon at the current economic pace” for a rate increase, said Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the Economic Policy Institute. “There is strange eagerness to do it sooner rather than later, but the data just refuses to cooperate.”\n\nBivens noted that the same Fed projections that appear to show a consensus for raising rates in 2015 forecast slightly higher unemployment and slightly lower gross domestic product growth than previous estimates. Bivens said he wants the Fed to measure full employment on the basis of concrete wage growth, because wage growth accelerates when unemployment gets low enough that employers compete for workers.\n\nThe Fed has a firm 2 percent inflation target, Bivens observed, but the criteria it uses to measure full employment are \"not very firm.\"\n\nBivens and Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, said they would like the Fed to tie a rate increase to annual wage growth of 3.5 percent, before inflation. Wages are currently 2.3 percent higher than they were at this time last year.\n\nMeanwhile, jobs remain out of reach for many. There are 8.7 million people seeking work. Unemployment remains particularly high among African-Americans, with an official unemployment rate of 10.2 percent.\n\nEconomists aren't alone in urging the Fed to hold off on raising rates. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund both recently cautioned against a Fed rate hike in 2015.\n\nDean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, agreed that 2015 was too soon for a rate hike.

  "latent_4679": "Editor's Preface The present volume on anattaa concludes the treatment of The Three Basic Facts of Existence (or The Three Characteristics) within The Wheel series. Though the Buddha's teaching on not-self has been treated quite often in these publications it was felt that some more material from sources not easily accessible to the general reader should be offered here. From different angles, these essays and translations will throw light on that central teaching of Buddhism, anattaa. As the earlier books on anicca and dukkha, this volume, too, concludes with a concise and systematic treatment of the subject by the late venerable Ñanamoli Thera, which is a valuable guide to the source material as well as to a deeper study of this profound doctrine. The diverse renderings chosen by the individual authors for the key term anattaa or nairaatmya (Skt.) have been retained. Hence it should be understood by the reader that egolessness, soullessness, impersonality and not-self all stand for the Pali term anattaa (Sanskrit: anaatma or nairaatmya). — Nyanaponika Thera\n\nEgolessness (Anattaa) by Nyanatiloka Mahathera More and more the noble teaching of the Buddha seems to be on the way to conquer the world. More than ever before, the Buddhists are working for its propagation in nearly all the countries of the earth. Especially in India, the birth place of Buddhism, whence it disappeared for nearly a thousand years, Buddhism has again made its entrance and gained a firm footing, and with rapid strides it is ever gaining more and more ground. One therefore should rather think it a good omen that India, having regained its independence, has adopted as its emblem the Buddhist Four-Lion symbol of Emperor Asoka, and that, at the proclamation of the Indian Republic, behind the presidential throne, crowned with this Buddhist emblem, there appeared the Buddha's statue. Also all over Europe and America a mighty Buddhist wave is set in motion, which no longer can be kept back and suppressed and which, sooner or later, will flood the world with its beneficial influence. The world is no longer satisfied with dogmas based on blind belief. Everywhere in the world there is found today a striving for freedom and independence, externally and internally; and ever more the thinking man feels that the destinies of beings are not dependent on the omnipotence and infinite goodness of an imaginary creator, but that they rest entirely on the beings themselves. It is in Buddhism that one may find the true answers to many of the problems that are troubling men, and which they wish to get solved. Everybody knows that Buddhism is not a revealed religion and not based on blind belief, but that it is a doctrine to be realized by man's own understanding, a doctrine that makes man free and independent in his thinking, and assures him of happiness and peace. But of one thing I wish to warn all those who are working for the propagation of Buddhism, namely: not to allow themselves to be influenced or carried away by seemingly identical theosophical, Christian, or what is still worse, materialistic teachings. For all these are, in essence and substance, very often diametrically opposed to the Buddha's doctrines and prevent a real understanding and realization of the profound law discovered and proclaimed by the Buddha. The most crucial point for most men seems to be the Buddha's fundamental teaching of phenomenality, egolessness and impersonality of existence, in Pali anattaa. It is the middle way between two extremes, namely on the one hand the spiritualistic belief in an eternal ego-entity, or soul, outlasting death; on the other hand the materialistic belief in a temporary ego-entity becoming annihilated at death. Therefore it is said: There are three teachers in the world. The first teacher teaches the existence of an eternal ego-entity outlasting death: that is the Eternalist, as for example the Christian. The second teacher teaches a temporary ego-entity which becomes annihilated at death: that is the annihilationist, or materialist. The third teacher teaches neither an eternal, nor a temporary ego-entity: this is the Buddha. The Buddha teaches that, what we call ego, self, soul, personality etc., are merely conventional terms not referring to any real independent entity. And he teaches that there is only to be found this psychophysical process of existence changing from moment to moment. Without understanding the egolessness of existence, it is not possible to gain a real understanding of the Buddha-word; and it is not possible without it to realize that goal of emancipation and deliverance of mind proclaimed by the Buddha. This doctrine of egolessness of existence forms the essence of the Buddha's doctrine of emancipation. Thus with this doctrine of egolessness, or anattaa, stands or falls the entire Buddhist structure. Indeed, for anyone who wishes to engage in the study of the Buddhist scriptures, the best thing would be, from the very start, to get himself acquainted with the two methods, in which the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the world. The first method is the teaching in conventional language; the second method is the teaching in philosophically correct language. The first one relates to conventional truth, the second, to truth in the ultimate sense. Thus, whenever the Buddha uses such terms as I, person, living being, etc., this is to be understood as conventional speech, hence not correct in the highest sense. It is just as speaking of the rising and setting of the sun, though we know thoroughly well that this does not correspond to reality. Thus the Buddha teaches that, in the ultimate sense, amongst all these psychophysical phenomena of existence there cannot be found any eternal or even temporary ego-entity, and hence that all existence of whatever kind is something impersonal, or anattaa. In this connection I would like to emphasize the fact that this fundamental doctrine of egolessness and emptiness is not, as some misinformed Western Buddhists assert, only taught in the southern school of Buddhism, but that even in the so-called the Mahayana schools it forms a most essential part. Without this teaching of anattaa, or egolessness, there is no Buddhism; and without having realized the truth of egolessness no real progress is possible on the path to deliverance. The Buddha is, in every respect, a teacher at the golden mean, ethically as well as philosophically. From the ethical standpoint, for example, the Buddha rejects two extremes: the way of sensual pleasures and the way of self-torture. From the philosophical standpoint he rejects eternity, as well as temporariness of an ego entity. Just so he rejects belief in an absolute identity and an absolute otherness of the various stages of the process of existence. He rejects the determinism, as well as the belief in chance. He rejects the belief in absolute existence and absolute non-existence; likewise in freedom of will, as well as in unfreedom of will. All these things will become clear to one who understands the egolessness and conditioned nature of all phenomena of existence. On the understanding of these two truths depends the understanding of the entire doctrine of the Buddha. Hence the understanding and final penetration of the egolessness and conditionedness of all phenomena of existence are the necessary foundation to the realization of the noble eightfold path leading to deliverance from all vanity and misery, namely: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right bodily action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration of mind. Only this golden middle path, based on these two kinds of right understanding, namely of \"egolessness and conditionedness,\" can alleviate and destroy these vain illusions of \"self\" and craving, which are the root-causes of all war and bloodshed in the world. But without these two kinds of understanding there is no realization of the holy and peaceful goal pointed out by the Buddha. There are however, to be found various would-be Buddhists in the West who are attached to an imaginary Great Self, and who uphold that the Buddha did in no way reject the view of an \"eternal Atman,\" or soul, behind and independent of the phenomena of existence, and who believe that the Mahayana texts teach such a doctrine. Such assertions, however, do not in the least prove correct, for neither do the Pali texts, nor the early Mahayana texts proclaim an eternal self. Any reader, who is unbiased in mind and free from prejudices, can never from a study of the Buddhist scriptures come to the conclusion that the Buddha ever taught any such ego-entity within or outside the corporeal, mental and spiritual phenomena of existence. Nowhere in the world can there be found such an entity, as was clearly pointed out by the Buddha. Regarding the questions whether the Holy One will continue after death, or not continue etc., the Buddha says that all such questions are wrongly put. And why? Because what is called the \"Holy One\" is here only a conventional term and refers to no real entity while in reality there is only to be found a process of corporeal, mental, and spiritual phenomena. In another text, therefore the Buddhist asks a monk, whether he considered corporeality as the Holy One, or the feelings, or the perceptions, or the mental formations, or consciousness. Or whether he believed the Holy One to exist within these five groups of phenomena or outside thereof. Or whether all these phenomena heaped together were the Holy One. And denying all these questions, the Buddha further said that, even during lifetime, the Holy One could not be discovered in reality, and that therefore it would be wrong to ask whether the Holy One will continue or not continue after death, etc. Thus, no entities are existing in the world, but only ever-changing processes. The Buddha further says: Only because man does not understand corporeality, feeling and the other mental and spiritual phenomena being impermanent, unsatisfactory and impersonal (aniccaa, dukkha, and anattaa), and does not understand their conditioned origin, their extinction, and the path leading to their extinction, therefore he will think that the Holy One does continue, or does not continue after death etc. This, therefore, is the reason why the Buddha did not answer such questions. According to Buddhism, the whole of existence is comprised in the five groups of phenomena mentioned above, or still more briefly expressed in the three groups: corporeality, consciousness, and the mental factors. And within these three groups are comprised the only and ultimate things given, though also these again are mere fleeting and evanescent phenomena, flashing up for a moment, in order to disappear immediately thereafter forever. Thus whenever in the Buddhist scriptures mention is made of I, self, living being, etc., even of the Buddha, these expressions accordingly are used merely as conventional terms, without referring to any real entities. Therefore the Buddha has said: \"It is impossible, it cannot be that a man with real understanding should ever consider anything as a real entity.\" He who does not understand the egolessness of existence, and who still attached to ego-illusion, such a one cannot comprehend and understand the four Noble Truths of the Buddha in the true light. These four truths are: the truth of the impermanency, unsatisfactoriness and impersonality of existence; the truth that repeated rebirth and misery are rooted in self-illusion and craving for existence; the truth that through the extinction of all self-illusion vanity, and craving, deliverance from all rebirth will be attained; the truth that the eightfold path, based on right understanding, is the path leading to this goal. He who has not penetrated the ego-illusion and is still attached to self-vanity will believe that it is he himself that suffers, will believe that is he himself that performs the good and evil deeds leading to his rebirth, that it is he himself that will enter Nirvana, that is he himself that will bring the eightfold path to perfection. Whoso, however, has fully penetrated the egolessness of existence, knows that, in the highest sense, there is no individual that suffers, that commits the kammic deeds, that enters Nirvana, and that brings the Eightfold Path to perfection. In the Visuddhi Magga it is therefore said: Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found. The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there, Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it. The path is, but no traveller on it is seen. Therefore, wherever the doctrine of the egolessness of all existence is rejected, there the Buddha's word is rejected. But wherever, through penetration of the egolessness of all existence, the ego-vanity has reached ultimate extinction, there the goal of the Buddha's teaching has been realized, namely: freedom from all vanity of I and Mine, and the highest peace of Nibbaana.\n\nSelf by G.N. Lewis If something is yours you have power over it; you can make it into whatever you wish. It will change according to your plans. But have you power over your self? Can you make your body larger or smaller or let it be this or that as you desire? If it is not governed by your power but by its own laws and processes then it is not yours. If it were the body would not be involved in sickness for you would be able to make it be whatever you wished. Admittedly one has control over the body to an extent but not as much as one has over this house or any other possession. Why? Your body was once very much more delicate and smaller than it is now. Now it is bigger and stronger. It will get weaker and degenerate later on. This body which you call yours — has it developed and deteriorated according to your will? Or perhaps the question of ownership does not arise — the body being subject to the same laws of nature as everything else, i.e., birth, decay, and death. If this is so, should one be concerned or unconcerned regarding the body? If neglected, the natural processes of destruction act quickly, disease and death soon resulting. Therefore food, exercise, and clothing must be used to maintain it and to stop the natural processes being accelerated. Do people feed and dress the body for maintenance only, and, if not, why? Take a person who dresses only to keep his body protected from the elements. What's wrong with this? Should he be criticized and, if he is, for what? Because others don't dress similarly doesn't mean he's doing something wrong. Someone may say he looks ugly and unsightly but how did we learn what ugliness was in the first place? Is the person criticizing him or his clothes? Well, \"him\" is not the body; the person criticizing him is not taking offense at the body but just at the clothes. This is where opinion together with vanity creep in and facts become concealed. Leaving the body let us turn to another aspect of self — feeling. Say a man tries to grasp something which continually slips through his fingers. Can he say that thing is his? He tries to keep it but he can never clutch it solidly and he would never dream of calling that thing his own. But say he has a fountain pen. That really seems to be his own. It is always with him and it keeps its shape and doesn't change very much. How about feelings — happiness, indifference, and pain? Are not these like the first example? How can we ever say feelings are our own? If they were, happiness would be ours for the rest of our life and not an illusive thing which comes and goes against our wishes. Body is born, it decays and dies. Likewise we find on investigation that exactly the same is true for feelings. The body does not come from nothing. It starts off by the fusing of two cells from mother and father. By way of nourishment it grows and develops. Then it dies. Feeling is born of sense-impingement; e.g., eye and material shape lead to sense impingement, which leads to visual consciousness which leads to feeling — pleasant, indifferent or painful according to whether or not what has been seen is liked or disliked as a result of past experience. Thus we see how feeling is born. But this feeling changes. If a painful feeling arises we are not content but crave to get away from it. Alternatively if we have perceived something that gives a pleasing feeling we long to keep this feeling and try to possess whatever has caused it to arise. Why don't feelings last? Because the very things from which they arise do not last. Therefore if we do not grasp after feelings we never suffer. Feelings are continually born and continually die but the body takes a long time to do so. If we cannot call body our own, how much less so is this true of feelings? Let us now examine a third aspect of ourselves — perception. What do we perceive and is it we who actually perceive? Perception is the recognition of sense-impingements. How is it born? I hear a loud noise and recognize that a door has been slammed. What is the basis of this recognition? Firstly, without the ear no sound would be heard; therefore the ear is a necessary basis. The sound impinges on the ear, this being sensory impingement. From this perception arises, but like feelings it does not last and soon dies away, another rising in its place. Do I enter into this perception? Do I perceive the door slamming? No. We have definitely seen that perception arose of its own accord, with oneself not being involved at all. Well, if body, feeling and perception are not \"me,\" what is? Before this can be answered there is yet another aspect of ourselves and this is volitional action. Here surely we shall find our true self. I say to a friend \"I am going to do that\" and I keep to what I've said. Here it appears a deliberate choice has been made between doing two specific things: either I will or I won't. How does the will or act of choosing arise, or is it there all the time? Does it only come into force when we have to make a choice? On investigation we find that this is so; for example: I'm going to ride my bicycle tonight. This is a deliberate choice. I could have gone to the cinema or for a walk. Why did I choose riding? Does volition come into this at all? What other volitional tendencies are there? I have killed a man. Surely volition was there. But if I ask myself why I wanted to kill him, several interesting things come to light. For argument's sake let us say he murdered my wife. I was very attached to her. He took something away from me which I wanted. Missing the pleasurable feelings which were continually aroused by my wife's company, a painful feeling took its place when I lost her and I craved to get the former feeling back. The only satisfaction for me was to get rid of the object (the man) which caused the painful feeling to arise and therefore I killed him. So we see from this example that the volitional drive (the desire to kill) had a basis for arising and we see also that after arising it passed away on completion of its primary object (the death of a man). Volition therefore is a conditioned force directed specifically toward something, e.g., I can arouse myself to apply my mind to something. But, as just proved, volition is a conditioned phenomenon. Can I therefore be equated with volition? If so, I only exist when volition is present; when it passes away I die also. But we say we are present all the time — therefore I cannot be equated with volition. In conclusion we can state that if I say, \"I'm going to do this or that,\" what this really means is that this or that is going to be done, not by me but through cause and necessity. Well, we still have not found ourselves; yet there is only one more aspect of ourselves to consider — consciousness. Are you conscious, am I conscious? \"Yes,\" is the usual immediate answer. If this were not so you would say, \"I'd be unconscious.\" Can you be conscious without being conscious of anything? Most people would say not. Let us find out what are the factors involved in being conscious. Can one be conscious without a body? Not that we know of, so we can assume from this that consciousness arises dependent on the body. Will there be consciousness if no sense-organs are in the body? We can categorically state that there will not be. So our second step is that consciousness is dependent on the sense-organs. Will there be consciousness with body and sense-organs and no internal or external sense-impingement? Again we can say definitely, \"No.\" Given sense-impingement shall we be conscious? Yes, but it will not be a very meaningful consciousness. We shall see a conglomeration of colors, hear noises, smell things, have bodily sensations, and taste things, but not be able to recognize them. If perception is missing one cannot say, \"I am conscious.\" We have already discussed perception and shown that it is not one's real self. Sense-consciousness, together with perception, gives us our awareness of things, but is there an \"I\" who is aware? If you say, \"I am conscious of a vase of flowers on the table,\" are you really conscious of it? By our investigation we have tried to show that you do not enter into is at all and that consciousness, like all the other aspects of self, has birth, decay, and death. To fall into the delusion that the body, feelings, perception, volitional action, and consciousness are you is to suffer because unfortunately they are not of you and you are not of them, and you cannot expect them ever to give satisfaction for very long. In conclusion I would say that the more disgusted one becomes with compounded things the closer one gets to things that give lasting happiness. — From \"The Maha Bodhi,\" May 1964.\n\nPhysical and Biological Aspects of Anattaa by Edward Greenly The labors of a succession of devoted scholars, from Turnour to Rhys Davids, has now made impossible, at any rate for all serious students of religion, the cruder misconceptions of Buddhism that were current in Europe at the end of last century. Its deeply intellectual character, its unique and unsullied record of tolerance, its priority (relatively to the Mediterranean systems) of five centuries in promulgation of the higher ethic, all these things are now widely known. And yet in spite of all this, even among such as are devoid of prejudice, it is seldom that one meets with a real, penetrating understanding of the Teaching. To some its philosophy, to others its influence, appear alike unintelligible. Now the source of this perplexity, it may safely be affirmed, is, invariably, a failure to apprehend that characteristic and central doctrine or principle of Buddhism that is summed up in the Pali term anattaa. Without this, there must appear to be an unbridgeable gap in the Buddhist doctrine of causation, its power over the hearts and lives of men must seem incapable of explanation, its final goal still present the insoluble enigma that it has for long presented to the European mind. Anattaa once comprehended, however, all whether thought or practice, is clear and open. That is the key that unlocks the secret, the way to the heart of the Buddhist mystery. The term is generally explained as meaning \"denial of the soul\"; and yet such a translation is apt to be somewhat misleading to a European. For it involves, in a certain sense, both less and more than that. It does not by any means imply, for example, that \"death ends all\" in the sense of some of the Western schools. And on the other hand, the idea of a \"soul\" is but a part, though indeed the most important part, of the great body of conceptions which it denies. Taken in connection with aniccaa, the principle of impermanence, that which it denies is the idea of separate and abiding substance in anything whatever in the whole unbounded universe, whether psychical or physical. Psyche, of course, was the particular kind of substance which the Buddhist teachers had in view, and its proper treatment is, naturally, psychological. But every kind of substance comes under the same condemnation; and, as the Western mind of today is far more at home in, and thinks far more clearly and powerfully upon, physical affairs, a consideration of some of the physical and biological aspects of anattaa is likely to be the best possible preparation for an understanding of those psychical aspects of it which the Buddhist teachers so earnestly labored to convey, the more so as such cases are, it should most clearly be understood, not \"illustrations\" or analogies only; they are actual examples of the principle itself. Consider such a phenomenon as a rainbow. To the unsophisticated mind, a rainbow is just as real as any other object, much more vivid and real than the faint and distant hills that lie beyond it. A child, indeed, filled with longing, will beg that it may be given to him, that he may have and hold and possess for himself this beautiful and brilliant thing. Later on, he learns something of its real nature, learns that there is in it no \"thing\" whatever capable of being so held; that it is but a conditioning of certain rays of light and drops of water, and has no existence in itself at all.[1] That is precisely, the anattaa doctrine. The rainbow is anattaa. This step in sound philosophy every sane adult is taught to take. How many take any further steps? For most, \"the cares of life and the deceitfulness of riches\" — riches often of another world as much as of this — occupy the mind entirely, and there is no desire for further knowledge. Yet to some, one day to all, the question cannot but arise — \"If this be so, if the rainbow be but a conditioning, how about the things of which it is a conditioning? How about the light and water? Surely those are real enough?\" Very well, then. The light, first, what is that? Little as we all know, we know enough to answer that it is an undulation or vibration, a particular kind of very rapid movement of something. But what is this but just the very answer that was given to the child about the rainbow, given to the adult about the light? Just as that rainbow was a conditioning of the light and had no existence in itself, so now the light proves to be a conditioning in its turn, to have no more existence in itself than the rainbow had. The light, too is anattaa. Yet, if it be an undulation of what is it an undulation? Of the ether. [2] And what is this ether? Here we are getting near the limits of our knowledge. Yet this much can be said, that it is not matter. It is not this, it is not that, it is not the other — to any question concerning it, such are the replies: and yet it is not non-existence. Seek it, and it vanishes from the grasp of the mind, just as the rainbow and the light did in their turn. It is the very type of insubstantiality, of anattaa. The water, however: that at least is tangible and substantive enough. Here is existence in a way that cannot be denied. Go far enough to north or south, and water will react to even the Johnsonian fist. Nevertheless, let it but feel the touch of a lump of sodium, or even of a few inches of hot copper, and where is it? Vanished utterly, and in its place two things that are no more water than it or light were rainbow. Water in itself, then, is not and never was — nothing \"was\" but a particular conditioning of these other things, this hydrogen and oxygen, as we call them; and \"water\" is but a name for such conditioning. Nor need we even think that this water-conditioning is the rule, and the water-abolishing experiments mere curious exceptions. Throughout the whole vast universe that is visible to us, only in a score of tiny specks is that the case. Not for one fleeting moment in the great star that daily lights us, or in a single one of the millions of its peers in the depths of space, could the water-conditioning hold good. Both the constituents of the rainbow, therefore, are as truly anattaa as the rainbow itself. As in the case of the first constituent, however, the question leads us further. What of these elements, this hydrogen and this oxygen, into which the water has resolved itself? Well, it is true that, misled by the unsound views of the nature of things in which they were brought up, many, probably most, chemists did, for a long time, think that in the ultimate combining particle, the \"atom\" of such elements, real, separate, and abiding substance had at last been hunted down. Not all, indeed, were so deceived. Hardly had the atomic theory been formulated, when discerning minds began to seek, first by one means, then by another, for that of which the atom must be but a compounding. The time had not come, and they were baffled. How in the last few years they have been completely justified, how abiding substance eludes us no less in the atom than it does elsewhere, has been already told elsewhere. The hydrogen and oxygen, therefore, are in their turn nothing but conditionings of something else, and when we inquire concerning that of which they are conditionings, then, as we have done to the ether, we can give to it a name, we can show that it must behave in such and such a way; but the moment that we attempt to lay the profane finger of thought upon it, and say that it is this or that, it is gone. As of the rainbow, so of all things: process there is, conditioning there is, but nowhere the least trace of substance, nowhere the least trace of \"self.\" That is the anattaa doctrine as exemplified by matter. According to the theory of the soul, familiar to all of us from our childhood, each living body, at any rate each living human body, is inhabited and informed by a single psychic entity, the thinker of all its thoughts, doer of its deeds, and director of the organism generally. In Christianity, until very lately, such a soul was ascribed to human beings only; animals had no souls. For them death ended all, without even the hope of a future life in which might be redeemed some of their unmerited sufferings; and the present writer well remembers his passionate yearnings as a child after a larger hope for some of the dear animals he loved so well, and remembers the quenching of this hope by his orthodox instructors.[3] The Roman Catholic Church still holds valorously to this ancient orthodoxy,[4] but the rapidly-growing feeling of compassion for animal suffering that has sprung up in the Western world during the past hundred years, and is one of its kindliest and noblest features,[5] has, outside the Roman pale, begun to modify opinion, and souls are now postulated for at any rate the higher animals. Concurrently with this, an influence of a different kind has accelerated the movement of men's minds in the same direction. This comes from the acceptance, now general, of the theory of evolution. Fear for the existence of the human soul was the motive, indeed, of much of the early opposition to that theory, but now that resistance is no longer possible, it is coming to be felt that a worthier way out of the difficulty is to be found in the concession of a soul to these our fellow-beings. The inter-relationship and unity of all life left, indeed, no other way, if the soul theory was to be held at all. The unity of life, however, has other bearings very searching, some of them, upon the whole question and a consideration of these may throw some light upon animistic views in general. For there is no stopping at the higher animals, still less at those who are our especial friends and lovers. If we concede a soul to a dog, so must we also to a wolf; if to a cat, then also to a tiger. Nor can we call a halt at any place, as, passing from these sensitive and splendid beings, we descend lower and lower through the mammalia till we reach the very humblest of the primitive marsupials. But the mammalia form but one of the branches of the Tree of Life; bird, reptile, fish put in the same claim, and it cannot be denied to them. Not even the lowly Amphioxus brooks the refusal of a soul, and he, standing at the confines of his kingdom, opens the gates to the still vaster and dimmer armies of the life we call Invertebrate. To cut an almost endless story short, we find even here no place at which to stop, and are fain to concede at last that the microscopic protoplasmic cell-units called the protozoa are as able to make good their title as the lordliest of the mammalia. Besides, if we were inclined to pass them by with a De minimis non curat lex, they could reinforce their claim, by pointing out that man himself enters upon his existence as a protozoan unit indistinguishable from themselves, and that if this unit contains a soul, why should not each of them contain one likewise? There is another curious consideration. If my soul enters upon existence along with me, and is mine and no one else's, so also does any other being's even such as a protozoan's, and it is his soul and no other protozoan's. Now, man propagates his kind at an exceptionally slow rate, but the rate of increase in the lower ranks of life is prodigious. Statisticians amuse themselves sometimes by computations of the progeny of a single cod-fish in quite a moderate space of time, and the results are astonishing. But the multiplication of the protozoa proceeds by geometrical progression, so that, without books at hand, I am afraid to quote the shortness of the period in which one such will have given rise to millions. The influx of new souls into this world alone, therefore, is proceeding at a rate beyond all power of numbers to convey, and when we reflect that this has been going on throughout the whole of geological time, the conception is truly staggering. Well-found indeed must be the ship of speculation that can carry such a freight as that across the stormy seas of modern thought! So far we have considered the single soul in a single body, such as we ourselves have been taught we are endowed with. But there are cases not so simple. Among the coelenterata and the polyzoa there are, as well as a single hydroid animals, many species of compound ones, in which whole colonies of such beings are united by a \"coenosarc\" or flesh-body common to them all. What are we to say of the soul in a case of this sort? Shall we ascribe it to the individuals, to the coenosarc, or to the colony as a whole? The individual is just such another as any simple hydroid, yet if we assign to him a soul like that of the simple one, what becomes of the coenosarc, which is just as much alive? Or, if we assign it to the community, then why, to the hydra that is rooted in a coenosarc, should be denied that which is conceded to his cousin who is rooted on a stone? And, as if this were not perplexing enough, sometimes a member of such a community will detach himself from it altogether, and conduct his life on his own account. To return, however, to the higher beings, ourselves included, with a single body and its single soul. Closely bound up with the theory of evolution are the facts of histology, the structures and relationships, that is to say, of the microscopic units that compose the living being. Let us consider, first, the corpuscles of the blood. They are of the two kinds, the large white corpuscles, and the smaller red ones. Both are cells, but we will consider just now the white ones. They are minute specks of living protoplasm, constantly changing their shape, moving slowly about, and living upon what they meet with. Now, amongst the protozoa, animals consisting of a single cell, whose claims to a single soul we were obliged to admit capable of being made good with such irresistible effect, is a creature known as the amoeba. It is a speck of protoplasm that moves slowly about from point to point, changing its shape as it goes along, and living upon any suitable object it can meet with. The white blood-corpuscles, in short, and the amoeba are indistinguishable in composition, aspect and behavior. They differ in nothing but their habitat: the amoeboid corpuscle (as it is called) can make every whit as effective a claim to a single soul as the amoeba. The one, however, is an independent being; the other an integral part of a most essential portion of our own economy, essential, indeed, for without them the blood cannot perform its functions; and is not the blood, as we have long ago been told, \"the life\" (Deut. xii,23)? Even if we take refuge in the brain, and seek to locate the soul where thought goes on, to that retreat also they pursue us; for stop the blood, and in a few short minutes thinking ceases. Clearly there is something wrong. It is evident that the simple-seeming hypothesis of a single soul in a single body hides a world of perplexities and complications. The difficulty of the hydrozoan coenosarc has reappeared in a more subtle form than ever, and that within our own breasts, the very citadel of the soul-hypothesis. Nor is this even the end of the matter. The relations of the amoeboid corpuscle to the amoeba strike the mind at once, and the lessons that they teach are past mistaking. But the red corpuscle is no whit less a cell, which, were it found elsewhere than in the blood, would pass without challenge as one among many protozoan creatures. Nay, further still. If we watch through the microscope a drop of pond-water full of paramecium or any other simple animals, it will not be long before we see one of them constrict into a sort of \"waist,\" develop there a medial cell-wall, and part along that into two, each of which proceeds without more ado to go about its own business.[6] In paramecium and its congeners the new cells leave each other, but in slightly higher animals they remain united along the medial wall, dividing, perhaps, and redividing until we have a tissue or colony of several cells. The members of such a tissue are to the free separating cells as the hydroids of a coenosarcal community to the solitary hydroids. The inner nature of the cell remains the same. Now, all the tissues of the living body are neither more nor less than just such colonies. Modified in various ways according to the nature of the tissue, here for muscle, here for skin, there for bone, differently again for nerve, and finally in a special way for brain itself: the units of these tissues are, throughout the body, cells, alike in their essential nature, different only in their modifications. The blood corpuscles are just some of these cells which, in order to perform a particular function, remained detached and free to move, like the protozoa. And every activity of the being, physical or psychical, depends entirely on the co-ordinated activities, physical or psychical, of this vast multitude, which indeed no man can number. But each one of these is, as we now perceive, a being to whom, if we set out the hypothesis of souls, it is logically impossible to refuse a separate soul-unit of its own. Seeking in the first part of this article for the essential, inner self or being of the rainbow, light, water, and their elements, we found that there was not in any one of them any essential self or being whatsoever. Every one of them turned out to be, by its very nature, a conditioning of elements that were not itself, and this held good to the last stages of analysis that knowledge could apply. Every one of them had to be pronounced anattaa. What have we now found (using a biological analysis) to be the case of the living being? We have found it to be, more conspicuously if possible than even those other phenomena, a conditioning of a vast number of elements that are not one of them itself, dependent absolutely upon these elements, having apart from them and their activities no existence \"in itself\" whatever. Beginning with a phenomenon, the rainbow, with regard to which the Anattaa doctrine is already held by every sane adult, we have followed that doctrine and found it to apply to the highest form of existence that we know upon this earth. From the biological point of view, the living being is, and that in a superlative degree, anattaa. Further treatment of the anattaa subject is, of course, psychological. With that, this article is not concerned. But any sound psychology must be in harmony, not at variance, with biology and physics. Suffice it, then, to say here, that we may be sure that what is biologically compound will not prove to be psychologically simple. Were we ever inclined to regard the doctrines of anattaa and the khandhas as either fantastic or perverse, we may wonder rather at the discernment which perceived the one, long before biology and physics were, and at the moderation which gave us but five khandhas where modern science would give for one of them alone (viz. ruupa) something much more like five hundred millions! Far more marvellous, however, was that surpassing spiritual penetration that could see, in this compositeness of our nature, nothing less than the balm of sorrow, the justification of the Golden Rule, and life's liberation from the house of bondage. Parts of this article may have, perhaps, a somewhat polemical expression. Well, argument, if undertaken at all, should be made conclusive and convincing, if that be possible, and should result in intellectual conviction. But intellectual conviction is not religion, it may not even have religion as its consequence in life. Something more is needed. He who discerns not life's pathos and its sorrow, will not find out the Annattaa path of love to sorrow's utter ceasing. — From \"The Buddhist Review,\" Vol. III, No. 1 (1911). Notes 1. The writer can even now recall his own childish perplexity at being told that a rainbow was \"the sun shining upon drops of water.\" For what resemblance of any kind did it bear to either drops of water or the sun? 2. The theory of a \"luminiferous ether\" as the medium in which light — and all forms of electromagnetic radiation — propagates was dealt a mortal blow in the 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment. The final nails were hammered in its coffin by Einstein in 1905. The author, writing in 1911, was probably not aware of this. — ATI ed. 3. The great Bishop Butler, however, ventured to suggest some such hope. 4. With the sinister corollary that as animals have no souls, neither have they any rights. 5. In the Buddhist countries of Asia such a sentiment has long prevailed. 6. In passing, it may well be asked, what has happened with the soul. Has that divided also, or has a new soul arisen to animate one of the two bodies? And if so, which, for they are substantially equal and alike?\n\nThe Spell of Narcissism and the Anattaa Doctrine by M.W. Padmasiri de Silva \"Narcissism is a passion the intensity of which in many individuals can only be compared with sexual desire and the desire to stay alive. In fact, many times it proves to be stronger than either. Even in the average individual in whom it does not reach such intensity, there remains a narcissistic core which appears to be almost indestructible.\" — Erich Fromm, The Heart of Man The word \"narcissism\" is derived from a Greek legend. Narcissus in mythology is a beautiful youth who loved no one till he saw his own body reflected in water. Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection; finally he pined away, died, and was turned into the flower of like name.[1] Thus the word \"narcissism\" derived from this legend has been generally used to refer to a kind of morbid self-love.[2] The concept of narcissism was woven into psychological theory by Sigmund Freud. Freud himself borrowed this name from Paul Nacke, who used the term to describe a perversion, where \"an adult individual lavishes upon his own body all the caresses expended only upon a sexual object other than himself.\"[3] it was Freud, however, who grasped for the first time the tremendous significance of the concept of narcissism. Freud's essay on narcissism is one of the richest spots in his psychology, unfortunately neglected by his fellow psychiatrists and submerged by the popular image of Freud's work. Freud's essay on narcissism is a little gem which would have been pushed into an insignificant corner in the field of psychological theory, but for the efforts of Eric Fromm who remarks that, \"One of the most fruitful and far-reaching of Freud's discoveries is his concept of narcissism. Freud himself considered it to be one of his most important findings...\"[4] In this paper I shall very briefly refer to the Freudian concept of narcissism and then present Fromm's development on this against the background of the anattaa doctrine. Before his paper on narcissism appeared, Freud made a clear distinction between the sexual instinct (libido) and the ego instinct, or in more popular terms between \"love\" and \"hunger.\" But he came across an interesting category of patients whose condition presented a great challenge to this distinction between sexual and ego instincts. \"We became slowly accustomed to the conception that the libido, which we find attached to certain objects and which is the desire to gain some satisfaction in these objects, can also abandon these objects and set the ego itself in their place,\" says Freud.[5] More reflection on this point made him realize that a fixation of this kind to the subject's own body and his person was not something accidental, it is probable that this is the original condition of man (primary narcissism) out of which object love develops later without thereby necessarily affecting a disappearance of narcissism. This conception of narcissism was backed by evidence from a number of sources. In megalomania, we get the subjective over-estimation of self-importance, in dementia praecox we get the magical belief in the \"omnipotence of thought.\" Freud also studied the mind of the infant and the primitive man and here too discovered an expression of narcissism. There are also other situations in life like disease, after an accident, in old age etc., \"when the tendency to this withdrawal into self-preoccupation is apt to become pronounced.\" Normal love is also affected by a great deal of narcissism. The notion of narcissism was used to explain a wide range of distinct phenomena ranging from love, jealousy, and fear to mass phenomena. Continuing on these lines Fromm has worked out the spell of narcissism in group behavior, nationalism, and war. It was due to Fromm's insight that the concept of narcissism was salvaged from its limited base in the libido theory and given a more comprehensive interpretation. Narcissism in Buddhism and the Writings of Fromm Fromm himself makes a reference to Buddhism which is extremely significant for an understanding of narcissism. Fromm says that the essential teachings of all the humanistic religions in the world can be summarized in one sentence: \"It is the goal of man to overcome one's narcissism. Perhaps this principle is nowhere expressed more radically than in Buddhism.\"[6] Fromm concludes on these lines that if man sheds the \"illusion of his indestructible ego\" and the other objects of greed, only then can he be totally open, awake and be fully related to the world. The illusion of the indestructible ego that Fromm mentions is quite clearly a reference to the Buddhist doctrine of anattaa (egolessness). There is no ego entity existing apart and independently of those physical and mental processes that constitute life. The illusion of the ego has two basic forms: eternity belief and annihilation belief. The craving for selfish pursuits arises with a false conception of personality, based on the dogma of personal immortality (sassata-di.t.thi), and the craving for annihilation arises with a false conception of personality, based on the annihilationist view (uccheda di.t.thi).[7] An understanding of the doctrine of sakkaaya-di.t.thi (twenty forms of wrong personality beliefs) helps us to grasp the Buddhist doctrine of egolessness. Where there is a mere complex of corporeality, feeling, perception, dispositions, and consciousness, the individual being subject to the ego illusion assumes the existence of an ego: 1-5: Ego is identified with corporeality, feeling, perception, dispositions, and consciousness. 6-10: Ego is contained in them. 11-15: Ego is independent of them. 16-20: Ego is their owner. This does not mean that the ego is merely an intellectual construction. The roots of the ego illusion are strong and it is fed by deep effective processes.[8] These processes are dormant proclivities described in the Discourses of the Buddha as the latent desire for continued existence (bhava-raaga anusaya). Corporeal Overtones of the Ego Concept The origin of the Freudian concept of narcissism is the point at which Narcissus falls in love with his own body. In relating auto-eroticism to narcissism, Freud says that the ego is first and foremost a \"body-ego.\" Fromm also says that one of the most elementary examples of narcissism can be found in the attitude to the body exhibited by the average person.[9] The narcissistic relation to one's body has its parallel in the doctrine of the Buddha, where he discusses the operation of personality beliefs (atta di.t.thi) in relation to corporeality. The majority of the people who are not skilled in the doctrine of the Buddha are subject to the ego-illusion associated with their body. This ego-illusion is described in the suttas: These people who are untrained in the doctrine of the Buddha, \"regard body as the self (attaaa, Skr: aatman); they regard the self as having a body, body as being in the self, the self as being in the body. 'I am the body,' say they; 'body is mine'; and they are possessed by this idea.\" The Buddha also says that due to the excessive attachment to the body, when it alters and changes, sorrow and grief set in; thus the doctrine of anattaa is linked to the doctrine of dukkha (suffering). However, while the body-image concept of the ego dominates the thought of Freud, the Buddha offers a more comprehensive analysis, relating the ego-illusion to feeling, perception, dispositions, and consciousness. To use a phrase of Wolheim, \"the corporeal overtones of the ego concept\" prevented Freud from presenting a broad base for his theory of narcissism. In fact, Wolheim has pointed out a significant ambiguity in the Freudian analysis of narcissism. Sometimes Freud conceives narcissism as an attraction towards one's own person, and sometimes as an attraction towards one's own body. Fromm has not merely re-vitalized the Freudian concept of narcissism, but takes it very much beyond this, and brings it close to the doctrine of the Buddha. Not merely does Fromm offer a theory of narcissism which is of interest to the Buddhist, but he quite clearly refers to the doctrine of the Buddha: \"The 'awakened' person of whom Buddhist teaching speaks is the person who has overcome his narcissism, and who is therefore capable of being fully awake.\"[10] The Narcissistic \"Self-Image\" The narcissistic person is not only proud of his body but he has an exaggerated and inflated image of all aspects of his personality: his intelligence, his honor and his wealth, his social standing, etc. \"Just as the narcissistic person has made his 'self-image' the object of his narcissistic attachment, he does the same with everything connected with him. His ideas, his knowledge, his house, but also people in his 'sphere of interest' become objects of his narcissistic attachment.\"[11] As both Freud and Fromm point out, one's narcissistic image about oneself is projected on to the children. This is extended to identification with wider groups, culminating in nationalism. Karen Horney was quick to point out that at the root of this kind of narcissistic self-image is found a kind of \"self-inflation\" rather than \"self-love,\" with a need not for love but the admiration of others. At this point we see the relevance of the Buddhist concept of maana (self-conceit). Self-conceit, according to the Buddha, takes three forms: I am superior to others (seyyo' ham asmi-maana); I am equal to others (sadiso 'ham asmi-maana); I am inferior to others (hino 'ham asmi maana). Maana is one of the fetters that bind man to the ills of existence, and it varies from a crude feeling of pride to a subtle feeling of distinctiveness that prevails till the attainment of arahantship (sainthood). If a person is proud of his attainments, exaggerates them, and feels infuriated when someone gives a lower estimation of his doings, he suffers from an inflated sense of vanity (maana mada). If he feels frustrated, disappointed and underestimates his attainments he is subject to a kind of inferiority complex. This is similar to what Fromm describes as \"depression.\" \"The element of mourning in melancholia refers, in my opinion to the narcissistic image of the wonderful 'I' which has died, and for which the depressed person is mourning.\" Pride, vanity and conceit manifest clearly in interpersonal relations, as a reactive expression, as \"wounded narcissism.\" Its mechanism is similar to what Freud refers to as \"secondary narcissism.\" One's wounded narcissism gives way either to an ego collapse, depression and melancholy or to anger and fury. The Antinomy between Self-love and Love for Others Apart from discussing the pathology of narcissism and its crippling impact on healthy personality growth, Fromm raises the question whether there could be a kind of healthy self-love, a benign form of narcissism as different from malignant narcissism. Is a certain degree of narcissism necessary for survival? Is there a necessary antinomy between love of self and others? Part of the problem could of course arise due to the linguistic issues besetting the use of the word \"self\" in diverse contexts. A grasp of the subtle mechanisms that bear upon the psychology of human motivation can clear up another facet of this issue. Ultimately this might involve a whole philosophical perspective or a way of looking at the universe and man. Fromm's analysis of this question too can be presented against the background of the Buddhist analysis of the issues involved. The problem arises when we consider love for others and love for oneself as alternatives which are mutually exclusive.[12] Selfishness is not identical with mature self-love. In fact selfishness is caused by a real lack of genuine self-love. \"Love, in principle, is indivisible as far as the connection between the 'objects' and one's own self is concerned. Genuine love is an expression of productiveness and implies care, respect, responsibility, and knowledge. It is not an 'affect' in the sense of being affected by somebody, but an active striving for the growth and happiness of the loved person, rooted in one's own capacity to love.\"[13] Fromm says that it is only a \"symbiotic attachment\" which is rooted in one's narcissism. Symbiotic attachment takes two basic forms: that of passive submission (to use a clinical term, masochism), and active dominance (sadism). The masochistic person escapes from the unbearable feeling of separation and isolation by making himself a part and parcel of another person; the sadistic person wants to escape from his aloneness by making another person part and parcel of himself. From the Buddhist standpoint, a clear distinction could be made between self-devoting motives and self-centered motives. The practice of metta-bhaavanaa is the finest expression of the fusing of self-love and love for others in Buddhism. The meditation of loving-kindness is first developed towards oneself and then radiates towards others. One first starts with the thought, \"May I be happy,\" and then extends it to the welfare and happiness of others. Even, where a person makes a sacrifice and forgoes certain material benefits for the sake of others, it merely strengthens his self-development. The very nature of the good is such that no one can seek the salvation of others without seeking his own. It is extremely important to mention that Buddhism considers the life of renunciation as the highest expression of the other-regarding instincts. This is very well expressed in the Kindred Sayings: He who of both is a physician, since Himself he healeth and the others too. In the suttas, there is a classification of beings into four types: He who is neither bent on his own profit nor on the profit of another; he who is bent on the profit of another but not his own; he who is bent on his own profits not another's; and he who is bent on the profit both of himself and another.[14] The Buddha considers the last category as the best. The context in which the Buddha made the analysis cited above may be a little different from the context in which Fromm has made a case for genuine self-love. But I do not see any fundamental difference between the approaches in Buddhism and that of Erich Fromm. It is true that the Buddha was basically concerned with the life of renunciation, and the other-regarding virtues in Buddhism are based on a deeper doctrine of compassion. But if we present the basic human relations presented in a homily to Sigaala, it will be quite clear that even in limited social situations, the Buddha advocates mature human relations which deny any symbiotic attachment[15] of abnormal domination or dependence. There is however a wider dimension in which the Buddhist analysis of self-love has to be presented. A layman who has made a necessary compromise with life will find it difficult to handle the obtruding ego, while the recluse committed to the path of renunciation will have at his command a more effective therapeutic control over the spell of narcissism. The only way to bridge the gap is to discover significant similarities between the techniques used by the psychiatrist in special \"clinical situations\" and that the recluse who has made a life-long commitment to a therapeutic procedure of his own. This short paper is essentially a response to a psychiatrist with vision who has opened a significant dialogue with humanistic religions. Notes 1.

The concept of \"symbiotic attachment\" could be understood in terms of the Buddhist notion of upaadaana (clinging).\n\nExtracts from the Samyutta-Nikaya\n\nDealing with Egolessness Compiled and translated by Nyanatiloka Mahathera When certain things we find combined, We speak of \"chariot,\" speak of \"car.\" Just so when all Five Groups appear, We use the designation \"man.\" 'Tis naught but woe that does arise; And that exists and passes off. Nothing but suffering appears, Nothing but woe that vanishes. — SN 5.10 The \"five groups\" are a classification, in which the Buddha has summed up all the physical and mental phenomena of existence, and in particular, those which appear to the ignorant man as his ego, or personality. They are: corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness. It is said in the Visuddhi Magga: \"Whenever different parts, as axle, wheels, frame, pole, etc., are combined in a certain manner, we use the conventional designation 'chariot.' But if we examine one part after the other, we cannot, in the ultimate sense, discover anything that can be called a chariot.\" It is likewise with the five groups of existence (khandha). If they are present, one uses the conventional designation \"being\" or \"personality,\" etc. But if we examine each phenomenon in its ultimate sense, there is nothing that can form a basis for such conceptions as \"I am\" and \"I.\" Hence in the ultimate sense only mental and physical phenomena exist. (Through sense-impression is conditioned feeling — thus it is said in the formula of Dependent Origination (paticca-samuppaada): \"But who, Venerable One, is it that feels?\" \"This question is not proper,\" said the Exalted One. \"I do not teach that there is one who feels. If however the question is put thus: 'Conditioned through what, does feeling arise?' then the answer will be: 'Through sense-impression is feeling conditioned... through feeling, craving; through craving, clinging...'\" — SN 12.12 But what are old age and death, and to whom do they belong? I do not teach that there is one thing called old age and death, and that there is someone to whom they belong. Verily if one holds the view that life (jiiva: life principle, soul, etc.) is identical with the body, in that case there can be no holy life. And if one holds the view that life is one thing but body another thing, also in that case a holy life is impossible. Avoiding both of these extremes (i.e., complete identity and complete otherness), the Perfect One has taught the doctrine that lies in the middle, namely: Through rebirth conditioned are old age and death;... Through the (karmical) process of becoming, rebirth;... through clinging the process of becoming;... through craving, clinging;... through feeling, craving; etc. — SN 12.35 (Through sense-impression is conditioned feeling — thus it is said in the formula of Dependent Origination (): Visuddhi Magga quotes: From woe and sorrow springs delusive thinking. No first beginning of existence can be seen. No doer can be found, nor one that reaps the fruits And twelvefold empty is the cycle of rebirth, And steadily the wheel of life rolls on and on. Better it would be to consider the body as the \"ego,\" rather than the mind. And why? Because this body may last for 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 years, even for 100 years and more. But that which is called \"mind,\" \"consciousness,\" \"thinking,\" arises continuously, during day and night, as one thing, and as something different again it vanishes. Now, here the learned and noble disciple considers thoroughly the Dependent Origination: If this is, then that becomes. Through the arising of this, that comes to arise; through the extinction of this, that becomes extinguished, namely: Through ignorance conditioned arise the karma-formations; through the karma-formations, consciousness (in next life); through consciousness, corporeality and mind;... through the extinction of ignorance, the karma-formations become extinguished; through the extinction of the karma-formations, consciousness... etc. — SN 12.61 Corporeality... feeling... perception... mental formations... and consciousness are impermanent...woeful... egoless, be they of the past or the future, not to mention the present. Understanding thus, the learned and noble disciple does no longer cling to things past, and he enters the path leading to the turning away therefrom, to detachment and extinction. — SN 22.9-11 The five groups of existence are impermanent, woeful, and egoless. And also the causes and conditions of the arising of these groups of existence are impermanent, woeful, and egoless. How could that which has arisen through something impermanent, woeful, and egoless as its root, be itself permanent, joyful, and an ego? — SN 22.18-20 All those ascetics and priests, who again and again in manifold ways belief in an ego (attaa), they all do so with regard to the five groups of existence, or to one of them, namely: There the ignorant worldling... considers one of the five groups as the ego; or the ego as the owner of that group, or that group as included in the ego, or the ego as included in that group. — SN 22.47 Now, someone holds the view: This is my \"ego,\" this is the world. After death I shall remain permanent, steady, eternal, and not be subject to any change. This eternity-view is one karma-formation. (This is the second link in the formula of the Dependent Origination, and signifies here the unwholesome volitional action accompanied by wrong views and ignorance.) But through what is this karma-formation conditioned? It is the craving which has arisen in the ignorant worldling while being impressed by a feeling conditioned through an infatuated sense-impression. It is through this craving (ta.nhaa) arisen hereby, that the karma-formulation has arisen. Hence that karma-formation is impermanent, created, and has conditionally arisen. In one who thus understands, thus sees, the immediate extinction of biases (aasava) takes place. Again, someone holds the view: \"May I not be! May there nothing belong to me! I shall not be! Nothing will belong to me!\" Also this annihilation-view is a karma-formation... is impermanent, created, and conditionally arisen. In one who thus understands, thus sees, the immediate extinction of biases takes place. — SN 22.81 To the monk Yamaka once the following wrong view had arisen: \"Thus do I understand the doctrine shown by the Blessed One that he in whom all Biases have vanished at the dissolution of the body after death, will become annihilated and will no longer exist after death.\" [Sariputta:] \"What do you think, Brother Yamaka, are corporeality... feeling... perception... mental formations... or consciousness permanent or impermanent?\" \"Impermanent, venerable sir.\" \"Now, do you consider corporeality etc., as the Perfect One?\" \"No, venerable sir.\" \"Or do you consider the Perfect One as contained therein?\" \"No, venerable sir.\" \"Or do you consider all these groups combined as the Perfect One?\" \"No, venerable sir.\" \"Or do you think that the Perfect One is without corporeality, or without feeling, without perception, without mental formations, without consciousness?\" \"No, venerable sir.\" \"Now, since you cannot, even during life-time, make out the Perfect One according to truth and reality, how can you rightly maintain that the Perfect One will, at the dissolution at the body, become annihilated and no longer continue after death? \"Should someone asked me, what will become of the Holy One, I should answer thus: 'Corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness are impermanent; and what is impermanent, that is woeful; and what is woeful, that will become extinguished and annihilated.'\" — SN 22.85 (Hence, it is only these five groups of phenomena embracing all existence whatever, which are here to be considered, while the designations \"Perfect One,\" \"I,\" \"ego,\" \"self,\" \"person,\" \"man,\" \"animal,\" etc. are merely conventional terms, not referring to any real entities. And the so-called pure ego is merely a metaphysical fiction or hypothesis.) Five groups of existence forming the objects of attachment have been taught by the Blessed One: corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness. With regard to these five groups I do not find any ego (attaa), or something \"belonging to an ego\" (attaniya), but still I am not yet a Holy One, not yet freed from biases. Also concerning these groups of existence liable to attachment, I am no longer subject to the thoughts of \"I am,\" or \"this I am.\" — SN 22.89 The world, as a rule, is fettered by attachment and clinging to things, and is firmly adhering to them. But the learned and noble disciple does no longer attach himself, cling, and firmly adhere and incline to the thoughts: \"I have an ego (attaa),\" and he knows: \"Merely woe is it that arises, merely woe that vanishes.\" — SN 22.90 Suppose a man who is not blind beheld the many bubbles on the Ganges as they drive along; and he watched them, and carefully examined them. After carefully examining them, they will appear to him empty, unreal, and unsubstantial. In exactly the same way does the monk behold all corporeal phenomena, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and states of consciousness, whether past, present, or future; one's own or external; gross or subtle; lofty or low; far or near. And he watches them, and examines them carefully; and after examining them, they appear to him empty, unreal and unsubstantial... The body's like a lump of foam, The feeling like a water-bubble, Perception like a void mirage, Formations like a plantain tree, And consciousness like jugglery. — SN 22.95 There is no corporeality, no feeling, no perception, no mental formation, no consciousness that is permanent, enduring, and lasting, and that, not subject to any change, will eternally remain the same. If there existed such an ego that is permanent, enduring, and lasting and not subject to any change, then a holy life leading to complete extinction of suffering will not be possible. — SN 22.96 Once the contemplation of impermanency has been developed and has attained full growth then it will overcome all craving for sensuous existence, all craving for fine-material existence, all craving for immaterial existence; it will overcome and uproot all conceit of \"I am.\" — SN 22.102 (Only on reaching perfect Holiness, all conceit of \"I am\" will disappear forever.) The learned and noble disciple does not consider corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations or consciousness as the ego; nor the ego as the owner of one of these groups, nor this group as included within the ego, nor the ego as included within this group. Of such a learned and noble disciple it is said that he is no longer fettered by any group of existence, his own or external: Thus I say. — SN 22.117 ...It is possible that a virtuous man, while contemplating the five groups of existence as impermanent, woeful... empty, egoless, may realize the fruit of stream-entrance... — SN 22.122 The noble disciple who out of faith has gone forth from home to the homeless life, has with regard to the five groups of existence, to fulfil the task of living in contemplation of their impermanency, woefulness, and egolessness. And while penetrating these things, he becomes freed therefrom, freed from rebirth, old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, grief, and despair, becomes freed from suffering: thus I say. — SN 22.147f \"What must exist, and what must be the condition, that such views may arise as 'This is my ego, this the world. After death I shall continue, be everlasting, eternal, not subject to any change'?\" \"The five groups of existence must exist... that such views may arise.\" \"What do you think: Are these five groups permanent or are they impermanent?\" \"Impermanent, venerable sir.\" \"But what is impermanent, is that joyful or woeful?\" \"Woeful, venerable sir.\" \"But based on that which is impermanent, woeful, and subject to change, may (rightly) arise such views as: 'This is my ego, this the world.

Here, however, the same is said with special reference to the eternity-views.) The visible objects are egoless (anattaa); sounds, odors, tastes, bodily impressions, and mind-objects are egoless.

All things one has to comprehend fully [first truth], all things one has to overcome [second truth], all things one has to know directly... — SN 35.45-49 It is said that the world is empty. But why does one call the world empty? Because the world is empty of an ego (attaa), and of something belonging to the ego (attaniya), therefore the world is called empty.

Empty of an ego are eye and visible objects, ear and sounds, nose and odors, tongue and tastes, body and bodily impressions, mind and mind-objects. — SN 35.85 One should not imagine oneself of being identical with the eye, should not imagine oneself of being included within the eye, should not imagine oneself of being outside the eye, should not imagine oneself: \"The eye belongs to me.\" One should not imagine oneself of being identical with the visible objects, should not imagine oneself of being included within the visible objects, should not imagine oneself of being outside the visible objects, should not imagine: \"The visible objects belong to me.\" One should not imagine oneself of being identical with eye-consciousness, should not imagine oneself of being included within eye-consciousness, should not imagine oneself of being outside of eye-consciousness, should not imagine: \"The eye-consciousness belongs to me.\"... One should not imagine oneself of being identical with the totality of things... Thus not imagining any more, the wise disciple clings no longer to anything in the world.

[Extracts from Anattaa-Dipani. Adapted from the translation by U Sein Nyo Tun. From The Light of Dhamma (Rangoon), viii, 2.] I shall show here the advantages arising from the realization of the characteristic of not-self (anattaa). If one can clearly perceive the characteristic of anattaa, one achieves the knowledge pertaining to the path of stream-entry (sotaapatti-magga-~naa.na), wherein ego-delusion (atta-di.t.thi) and personality belief (sakkaaya-di.t.thi) are totally eradicated. Anattaa Realization and Past Kamma All beings who drift and circle in the long and beginningless round of rebirths called sa\"msaara rarely encounter the teachings of a Buddha. They may not encounter them for the time of even a hundred thousand world-cycles. They may not get the opportunity of hearing of a Buddha's teachings even once while an infinite number of world-cycles elapse. The number of existences and world-cycles in which beings have been afflicted by evil and error predominate. Hence, in the mental make-up of a being, there is always an infinite number of unwholesome actions (akusala-kamma) that can result in its falling into a world of utmost torment (avici-niraya), or in being reborn in other worlds of woe. Ego-delusion is the foremost of the unwholesome kamma of old and accompanies beings incessantly. As long as personality-belief exists, these old unwholesome actions are fiery and full of strength. Though beings may be enjoying happiness and splendour as deities, as divine rulers (Sakka) or in the fine-material or immaterial Brahma worlds, yet they necessarily exist, as it were, with their heads forever turned towards the four worlds of woe (apaaya). Palm fruits in a palm grove have an ever-existing tendency to fall to the ground, even though they may be attached to the very top of a palm tree. So long as the stalks are firm the fruits will remain on the tree; but as soon as the stalks weaken they will inevitably fall to the ground. In the same way, deities and Brahma gods afflicted with ego-delusion will be able to exist in their respective worlds only as long as the \"stalks\" of vital life force as deities and Brahmas remain intact. But when these \"stalks\" of vital life force are severed, they inevitably fall into worlds below, just like the palm fruits. This happens because personality-belief, which is ever present in the mental make-up of a being, is a great burden — heavier than even the Mount Meru — inasmuch as personality-belief gathers in its fold an infinite number of unwholesome kamma accumulated in the past. Thus beings who harbor within themselves this personality-belief are continually under pressure to gradually descend or directly to fall towards the worlds of woe although they may be living in the highest of the Brahma worlds. The cases of beings living in the lower Brahma worlds or in the celestial or human world, are much worse and need no further comment. Although such beings may exist as the rulers of Brahma worlds or of celestial worlds, yet their mental makeup contains, ready-made, the eight great hells, the lesser hells, the worlds of ghosts and demons and the animal realm. It is because these beings do not know that the tendency towards those misery-filled lower realms is always present in their mental make-up, that the Brahma kings and divine kings can afford to derive pleasure and enjoyment from their form of existence. But all the old unwholesome actions that have accompanied beings throughout the long and beginningless round of rebirths, will be extinguished completely when their head and chief, personality-belief (sakkaaya-di.t.thi), has been made to disappear entirely. Apart from that old unwholesome kamma that had accompanied beings since time immemorial, even in the case of the numerous unwholesome actions committed in the present existence (such as killing or stealing), their (rebirth-producing) tendencies entirely disappear as soon as their head and chief, the personality-belief, becomes completely extinguished. For such beings there may remain occasion to fear affliction by vermin, but there no longer remains any occasion for them to fear the resultants of the infinite number of past unwholesome actions.[1] Beings whose mental make-up is entirely freed from personality-belief have, as it were, their heads turned towards the higher planes of the celestial and Brahma worlds even though they may be living in the human world. And if living in the lower celestial and Brahma realms, their heads are always turned towards the higher planes of those worlds. They resemble the vapors that invariably rise upwards from forests and mountains during the latter part of the rainy season. This shows the greatness of the advantages arising from the extinction of personality-belief as far as relating to past kamma. Anattaa Realization and Future Kamma Human beings, deities and Brahmas, who have personality-belief in their mental make-up, may be good and virtuous beings today, but any time later they may commit an unlimited number of evil deeds, even grave offences like matricide, parricide, killing of arahants, etc.; and this may happen to them tomorrow or the day after, next month or next year, or in following existences. Today they may be devotees within the fold of the Buddha's Dispensation, while tomorrow or the day after, etc., they may be outside its pale or even become enemies and destroyers of the Buddha Saasana. Those beings however, human or divine, who well perceive the characteristic of not-self (anattaa) and thus have entirely extirpated personality-belief from their mental make-up, will cease to commit evil deeds and other unwholesome kamma even in their dreams, although they may continue to circle in sa\"msaara for many more lives to come. From the day of freeing themselves from personality-belief until their final existence before their attainment of Nibbaana, they will always remain within the fold of the Buddha's Dispensation, wherever they are reborn. They will never appear in a form of existence or in a world where the Buddha's Dispensation is absent. This shows the greatness of the advantages arising from the extinction of personality-belief as far as relating to future kamma. How Past Kamma Becomes Inoperative How the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the past become inoperative[2] at the moment when personality-belief is extinguished, may be illustrated as follows: In a string of beads where a great number of beads are strung together by a strong silk thread, if one bead is pulled all the others will follow the one that is pulled. But if the silk thread is cut or removed, pulling one of the beads will not disturb the other beads because there is no longer any attachment between them. Similarly, a being that possesses personality-belief harbors a strong attachment to the series of the aggregates (khandha) arisen during past existences and past world cycles, and transforms them into an ego. Thinking, \"In the past I have often been a human being, a deity, or a Brahmaa,\" he acquires the thread that is personality-belief. It is thus that the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the past which have not yet produced resultants, will accompany that being wherever he may be reborn. These unwholesome actions of the past resemble beads that are strung and bound together by a strong thread. Beings, however, who clearly perceive the characteristic of not-self and have rid themselves of personality-belief, will perceive that the bodily and mental aggregates that arise and disappear even within the short period of one sitting, do so as separate phenomena and not as a closely interlinked continuum. The concept of \"my self\" which is like the thread, is no longer present. Those bodily and mental processes appear to them like the beads from which the thread has been removed. They clearly perceive that the unwholesome actions of the past committed by them, are not \"persons\" nor \"beings\" not an \"I\" nor \"my actions,\" but that they arise and disappear in an instant. That is why that past unwholesome kamma disappears as soon as personality-belief disappears. It should be known, however, that only unwholesome (akusala) kamma disappears. Wholesome (kusala) kamma of the past does not disappear through the mere disappearance of personality-belief. It is only when the stage of the path of sainthood (arahatta-magga) is reached and when craving (ta.nhaa) is completely eradicated that wholesome kamma of the past becomes inoperative. The Evil of Personality Belief Personality-belief is an evil that is extremely deep-rooted and far-reaching. A person who commits an evil deed and thus becomes extremely agitated and worried over the prospect of being reborn in states of woe, transforms that evil deed of his into a \"self\" (attaa) and becomes greatly distressed by such firmly held thoughts as, \"I have done wrong. I have gravely erred.\" But if that being fully comprehends and realizes the characteristic of not-self and thereby can abolish attachment to such thoughts as, \"I have gravely erred,\" that kamma (unless it is a weighty one) will no longer have the power of producing resultants (in a future rebirth) so far as that being is concerned. But, generally, beings do not discard their attachment to such thoughts. Although that kamma does not, as it were, desire to accompany that being nor to produce resultants, yet it is forced to do so by the fact that being takes possession of it by harboring such thoughts as, \"I myself have committed that deed. It is my kamma.\" Because of this forcible possessive act that kamma is obliged to produce its resultants. To this extent are beings possessing personality-belief deluded and erring in their ways. It is the same in the case of unwholesome kamma of the past that remains operative. It is because of the forcible possessive act of personality-belief that this kamma accompanies beings throughout their samsaric wanderings and will produce its resultants in due course. Beings find that they cannot discard their unwholesome actions though being oppressed by their resultants, and suffering great privations in the process. They think, \"I have committed those evil deeds,\" and thus (identifying themselves with them) they take, as it were, possession of them. Thus these unwholesome actions cannot help to produce resultants and continue to do so, disabling those beings to achieve release. To this extent, personality-belief is profoundly evil and erroneous. Beings are very much afraid of the dangers of disease, old age, and death. But, through harboring such fear, they become attached to the past incidents of disease, old age, and death by identifying themselves with those experiences in the thought, \"For a long time in the past I have suffered these ills.\" Thus they find it impossible to relinquish even such fearsome phenomena. Hence these phenomena of disease, old age, and death continue to accompany them, as it were, against their own will, and continue to cause oppression. To this extent, too, is personality-belief profoundly evil and erroneous. In this present existence, too, when external and internal dangers are encountered or disease and ailments occur, beings attach themselves to them through such thoughts as, \"I feel pain; I feel hurt,\" and thus take a possessive attitude towards them. This becomes an act of bondage that later may obstruct beings from ridding themselves of those diseases, ailments, and dangers. Because this bondage through personality-belief is so strong, beings have often found those diseases, ailments, or dangers to be their inseparable companions through many existences up to the present day. Thus, personality creates a possessive attachment even to diseases, ailments, and dangers though these are so greatly oppressive. Also fears of encountering disease, ailments, and dangers in future, will produce such a bondage. And as long as there is personality-belief, beings will certainly meet such eventualities also in future. This is a brief description of how personality-belief is profoundly evil and erroneous. Superficial and Deep Attachment The attachments of craving (ta.nhaa) and conceit (maana) are not necessarily attachments of wrong views (di.t.thi). Craving develops an attachment for all the (physical and mental) phenomena in the three spheres of existence, in the form, \"It is my property.\" Conceit develops a proud attachment for them in the form, \"It is I who owns it\" or \"It is I who has those great qualities.\" In the case of beings who have personality-belief, craving and conceit follow the lead given by personality-belief. In the case of stream-winners, once-returners, and non-returners who have eliminated personality-belief, craving and conceit follow the distortion of perception (sa~n~naa-vipallaasa) and the distortion of consciousness (citta-vipallaasa). The attachments produced by these distortions are superficial; but those produced by personality-belief are deep. This ends the description how unwholesome actions of the past totally cease with the disappearance of personality-belief. Notes 1. This means that the unwholesome actions of the past can no longer generate a new rebirth, though they might cause resultants (vipaaka) to appear in the present life times of stream-winners and even of arahants. — (Editor, The Wheel)] 2. I.e., inoperative as to producing rebirth.\n\nIs There a Self or Not? Vacchagotta the Wanderer went to visit the Exalted One, and said: \"Now, master Gotama, is there a self?\" At these words the Exalted One was silent. \"How, then, master Gotama, is there not a self?\" For a second time the Exalted One was silent. Then Vacchagotta the Wanderer rose from his seat and went away. Now not long after the departure of the Wanderer, the Venerable Aananda said to the Exalted One: \"How is it, lord, that the Exalted One gave no answer to the question of the Wanderer Vacchagotta?\" \"If, Aananda, when asked by the Wanderer: 'Is there a self?,' I had replied to him: 'There is a self,' then, Aananda, that would be siding with the recluses and brahmins who are eternalists. \"But if, Aananda, when asked: 'Is there not a self?' I had replied that it does not exist, that, Aananda, would be siding with those recluses and brahmins who are annihilationists. \"Again, Aananda, when asked by the Wanderer: 'Is there a self?,' had I replied that there is, would my reply be in accordance with the knowledge that all things are impermanent?\" \"Surely not, lord.\" \"Again, Aananda, when asked by Vacchagotta the Wanderer; 'Is there a self?,' had I replied that there were not, it would have been more bewilderment for the already bewildered Vacchagotta. \"He would have said: 'Formerly indeed I had a self, but now I have not one any more.'\" — SN 44.10\n\nThe Search for a Self or Soul Chas. F. Knight In the Sa\"muytta-Nikaaya is the story of Vacchagotta the Wanderer, the man who was concerned with the existence or non-existence of his \"self.\" In the Digha-Nikaaya is the story of Po.t.thapaada, an inveterate asker of questions, in search of a \"soul.\" It is of interest to note the different response these two inquirers received from the Buddha. Vacchagotta's questions remained unanswered, while Po.t.thapaada's doctrinal questions were discussed and answered in full. Both of these inquirers have their counterparts in the West today — those who are concerned with a \"self,\" and those who are concerned with a \"soul.\" While the two terms self and soul are often used as synonyms and interchangeable, I think that those who use them in reference to themselves have a differential conception of the two words. The seeker for a \"self\" is more concerned with the preservation of his ego in the here and now, whereas the would-be possessor of a \"soul\" is perturbed as to survival after death. It is empiric that the protagonists of the self theory, or concept, are by nature extrovert and egotistic. On the other hand, those who most ardently cling to the soul concept, are less concerned with asserting themselves before others, but are concerned mainly with their inmost nature — natural introverts. Yet these too in their quiet way are also egotistical, in that they desire to preserve their \"identity.\" While the Asian Buddhist world unanimously accepts and adheres to the doctrine of anatta — the absence of an abiding and stable entity — it is by no means uncommon to find nominal \"Buddhists\" in the West who are unable to shake off 2000 years of indoctrination of the \"soul\" concept, and, as a consequence, bring to their \"Buddhism\" preconceived views, often bolstered up by a syncretic admixture of other Indian beliefs. The story of Vacchagotta precedes this article. His questions are akin to asking a man if he has stopped beating his wife. The man may have not have lifted his hand against her at any time, but if he answers \"Yes,\" the inference is that he had previously beaten her. If he answers \"No,\" the inference is that he still beats her. Had the Buddha agreed that Vacchagotta had a self, for the Buddha did not deny the existence of phenomenon, Vacchagotta could have taken it as a confirmation of the brahmin belief in an eternal atman, or spark of the Divine to survive after death. Had the Buddha agreed that there was not a \"self\" in the ultimate sense, Vacchagotta could have taken the reply as an endorsement of the view held by the annihilationists — that nothing survived after death. Vacchagotta was not asking questions idly, but this was an occasion on which confusion could have arisen, and so the Buddha maintained the noble silence and left Vacchagotta to ponder further on the point that was bothering him. He still had not grasped the higher truths of karma and aniccaa under which the conventional \"self\" is but a momentary manifestation of ever-changing components to be cast aside at death, and without a stable entity to be carried forward to a new birth. Later, Vacchagotta did grasp these truths, and he finally became one of the arahants. Those who are fond of quoting this dialogue between the Buddha and Vacchagotta to support their theory of a soul seldom, if ever, go on to the Buddha's final explanation to Aananda which closes the passage, and which, incidentally displays one of those flashes of the Buddha's humor that peeps out here and there in his dealings with inquirers. It would be stretching the argument beyond reason to presume that the Buddha was not capable or not inclined to make an assertion on the \"soul\" if it really existed, in the light of his many expositions of its non-existence. The commentator, Kumaralabdha, quoted by Dr. Malalasekera in the Encyclopaedia of Buddhism, puts it in a nutshell: If there was an \"atta\" (soul), what on earth was there to prevent the Buddha from saying so? For our purpose we can dismiss the \"self\" seekers, for while they insist on having a \"self\" to satisfy their ego, many of them give at least lip-service to the anattaa doctrine. They have their \"self\" that thinks, writes, or teaches, to present to the world. They have their \"self\" that strives to lift the \"self\" still higher in man's estimation, till it equals or becomes part of the \"SELF,\" and some go on to the \"Overself,\" or Godhead by another name. These people see themselves as gods in the making, and their word is final — so far as they are concerned. Their concepts are usually derived via Theosophy from pre-Buddhistic Brahmanism, even though they may call themselves \"Buddhists.\" Brahman, the First Cause, or Great SELF, was personified as Brahma the Creator, the Self, and all beings were, or had in them, a spark of the Divine, a lesser self, which was still essentially of the same substance as the Great SELF, to which it eventually returned when purified by rites and ceremonies. On the question of a \"soul,\" Po.t.thapaada and his friends were discussing the importance of consciousness, its arising and its ceasing. One had put forward the theory that: \"States of consciousness come to a man without reason and without a cause, and so also do they pass away. At the time when they spring up in him, then he becomes conscious.\" This was rejected by a second speaker who protested: \"That, sirs, will never be as you say. Consciousness, sirs, is a man's soul (attaa). It is the soul that comes and goes. When the soul comes into a man, then he becomes conscious; when the soul goes away out of a man, he becomes unconscious.\" Seeing the Buddha approaching they decided to ask his opinion on the matter, and Po.t.thapaada outlines the pith of their discussion and the various arguments that have been put forward. The Buddha refuted the former view by stating that it was precisely through a reason, by means of a cause, that states of consciousness come and go. \"By training some states of consciousness arise. By training others pass away.\" Through training one sort of consciousness arises, and through training another passes away. The Buddha illustrates his meaning by a lengthy discourse on training, showing the causal origination of consciousness as a consequence. He then goes on to the cessation of consciousness dependent on the cessation of ideas as the adept in meditative practices achieves the various trance states of the jhaanas. \"To him neither thinking anymore, nor fancying the ideas, the states of consciousness he had pass away, and no others, coarser than they, arise. So he enters in jhaana. Thus it is, Po.t.thapaada, that the attainment of the cessation of conscious ideas takes place step by step.\" The first proposition of the independent arising of ideas leading to consciousness having thus been disposed of by the Buddha, Po.t.thapaada admits to not having heard this explained before, \"but I now understand what you say.\" He then proceeds to the second opinion that had been expressed by his fellow mendicants: \"Is then, Sir, the consciousness identical with a man's soul, or is consciousness one thing and the soul another?\" \"But what then, Po.t.thapaada? Do you really fall back on the soul?\" queries the Buddha. Po.t.thapaada replies that he takes for granted the existence of a soul of some kind. Maybe a material soul, he suggests tentatively, but without much conviction. Failing that, what about a soul the exact copy of the body, but so subtle in texture that it could only be described as being \"made of mind.\" No? Well then a soul without form, and made of consciousness. To all of these suggestions the Buddha has but one reply. Suppose you did have a soul conforming to any of these descriptions, still some ideas, some states of consciousness, would arise to the man, and others would pass away, so \"you can see how consciousness must be one thing, and the soul would be another.\" However Po.t.thapaada was still not convinced that he was totally lacking in a soul. On that point he had a closed mind as is shown by his next question. He does not ask: \"Is there, or is there not, a soul?,\" but is it possible for him to ever understand what the soul is. \"Is it possible for me to understand whether consciousness is the man's soul, or is the one different from the other?\" The Buddha's reply to Po.t.thapaada is equally applicable to the \"soul-seekers\" of today; those who accept the Buddha's teachings with reservations — the right to reject what does not fit in with their preconceived notions, beliefs, and views. \"Hard it is for you, Po.t.thapaada, holding as you do different views, other things approving themselves to you, setting different aims before yourself, striving after a different perfection, trained in a different system of doctrine, to grasp this matter.\" Po.t.thapaada abandons his search for a definition of his soul, to which he still clings, and changes the subject by propounding ten questions on the imponderables. The Buddha bears patiently with him, and in answer to each question replies it is not a matter on which he had expressed an opinion, for such questions were not calculated to profit, were not concerned with his Dhamma, nor to the attainment of Nirvana. But Po.t.thapaada has not exhausted his propensity for asking questions. \"Then what is it that the Exalted One has determined?\" \"I have expounded what Dukkha is; I have expounded what is its origin; I have expounded what is the cessation of Dukkha; I have expounded what is the method by which one m",

It was the second incident authorities have described as terrorism in New York City since late October.\n\nThe president noted that the individual involved in October's deadly incident came to the U.S. through the visa lottery program, and that the individual in this week's attack arrived based on a family connection to an American citizen.\n\nTrump vowed to end both immigration programs quickly. \"The lottery system and chain migration, we're going to end them fast,\" he said, calling on Congress to \"get involved immediately.\"\n\nThe 2018 defense bill allots about $634 billion for core Pentagon operations and nearly $66 billion for wartime missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.

It also grants troops a 2.4 percent pay raise, slightly higher than what the Pentagon sought.\n\nTrump's 2018 request sought $603 billion for basic functions and $65 billion for overseas missions.\n\nThe defense legislation includes $12.3 billion for the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency and orders a more rapid buildup of the nation's missile defense capabilities \"as we continue our campaign to create maximum pressure on the vile dictatorship in North Korea,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We're working very diligently on that, building up forces,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump thanked the bill's chief sponsors, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry of Texas, who joined Trump at the White House, and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain of Arizona, who did not.\n\nMcCain issued a written statement afterward that called on Congress and the White House to work \"expeditiously\" on a budget agreement that secures the increased $700 billion for the military following years of spending cuts.",
  "latent_4940": "The 2016 Philadelphia Union finished with 11 wins, 14 losses, 9 draws, a -3 goal differential, and a playoff appearance.\n\nThe 2017 Philadelphia Union finished with 11 wins, 14 losses, 9 draws, a +3 goal differential, and no playoff appearance.\n\nSo.. they improved? Or they didn’t..\n\nWait, what?\n\nJim Curtin’s team clobbered Orlando 6-1 on Sunday evening, a visiting team that phoned it in so badly that I could have sworn they were match fixing. It was the Union’s biggest margin of victory in franchise history and only the second time the team had ever scored six or more. C.J. Sapong set the record for most goals in a single Union season and the retiring Brian Carroll was sent out in winning fashion.\n\nIn a way, that performance was the perfect end to another bland campaign, meaning that they played well when it didn’t matter. The Union needed results from March through September and didn’t get it done, beginning the season with zero wins through eight games and slumping to a miserable 1-10-6 road record. Questions of Jim Curtin’s job security were casually brushed off even as teams with similar records were axing their managers.\n\nIt was business as usual in Chester, where the season’s inevitable outcome was determined less than halfway through. Young players were benched, others regressed, and the team played the same damn formation before finally getting experimental when the season was lost. One step forward, one step back for a franchise that can’t seem to get out of its own way.\n\nThe positives are few.\n\nRookie Jack Elliott surprised everyone with his intuitive and veteran style of play. Sapong, who started the season on the bench, had a career year. Haris Medunjanin wound up being a great signing and Andre Blake again proved his case for a European transfer. Folks continued the treck to Talen Energy Stadium despite onset apathy and continuing mediocrity, showing me that this fan base remains recession-proof and dedicated.\n\nThe future is foggy because of owner Jay Sugarman, who simply does not spend the money required to create a competitive team. Sporting Director Earnie Stewart does not have the resources required to assemble a playoff-caliber squad. The Union tried to play Moneyball in 2017 while expansion Atlanta spent millions of dollars on talented players and shattered MLS attendance records en route to a year-one postseason berth. Philadelphia has played (and lost) three playoff games in eight seasons.\n\nIf this team is going to get it done, they need to shed those middle of the road, $500,000 contracts and play the high/low game with academy talent backing up three game-changing designated players. Using DP slots on a million-dollar midfielder and striker should be doable if their backups are $65,000 youngsters like Anthony Fontana and Adam Najem. That’s how you skate through on the cheap while pushing your academy model and fielding a competitive team at the same time. You kill three birds with one stone and give fans something to be hopeful for, but it starts with gutting half of the existing roster.\n\nGo:\n\nMaurice Edu, Roland Alberg, Ilsinho, Chris Pontius, Warren Creavalle, Ray Gaddis, Andre Blake, Ken Tribbett, Charlie Davies, Brian Carroll, Fabinho, Jake McGuire, Oguchi Onyewu\n\nI believe Alberg and Ilsinho both have option years coming up. I’d decline both and let them move on. Neither showed enough during the past two seasons to warrant a 2018 roster spot.\n\nCharlie Davies confirmed he’s out on Twitter. His Union tenure ends with eight appearances and zero goals, which makes his trade one of the worst in franchise history. I’m just glad he’s okay after beating cancer and dealing with health scares involving his children. Some things are bigger than soccer.\n\nBrian Carroll retired, so good on him for an underrated, trophy-winning career.\n\nI’d sell Andre Blake, assuming the red tape is cleared up, and use the money on one of the DPs.\n\nChris Pontius can become a free agent, Fabinho’s contract is up, and I’d move on from the rest on that list if possible. I don’t know the contract status of some of those guys, like Gaddis, Creavalle, and Onyewu.\n\nMaurice Edu should go to expansion Los Angeles on a safe deal to try to get his career back on track.\n\nStay:\n\nJack Elliot, Josh Yaro, Auston Trusty, Richie Marquez, Haris Medunjanin, Alejandro Bedoya, John McCarthy, Keegan Rosenberry, Fabian Herbers, C.J. Sapong, Aaron Jones, Marcus Epps, Derrick Jones, Fafa Picault, Jay Simpson, Adam Najem, Anthony Fontana, Giliano Wijnaldum\n\nI’m pretty sure they’re locked in on another year of Jay Simpson, since most foreign guys sign 2+1 deals. His second year I believe is guaranteed.\n\nYou still have a nice young core of defenders, even if this year did absolutely nothing for Keegan Rosenberry, Richie Marquez, and Josh Yaro. Those three didn’t help themselves at all, nor did the coaching staff, but they are still going to have to be part of the conversation moving forward.\n\nMcCarthy remains the backup and I believe everybody else I listed is under contract for next season. Marquez I’m not sure actually, so we’ll see what happens there. I’ve had one foot off the beat for at least six months now.\n\nNo clue:\n\nEric Ayuk\n\nHe spent the season on loan. Maybe he comes back as wing depth if Pontius becomes a free agent.\n\nThe Sons of Ben disagree with me on Blake’s future, but THEY’RE WRONG!\n\nOffseason signings –\n\nDP attacking midfielder, DP striker, TAM-level center back, starting goalkeeper, right wing depth, backup left back\n\nThe biggest need is a DP #10, assuming they’re married to this 4-2-3-1 formation that never changes. They flirted with Elias Aguilar and Nicolas Martinez in the summer but decided not to sign either one. They need to be in the one million to 1.5 million range for this player and let Najem and Fontana be the cheap backups. You just can’t skimp on a playmaking number ten.\n\nStriker is another story, because you’ve already got Sapong and Jay Simpson eating up $800,000 in this slot, and the Union only play one striker anyway. If you signed a $1,000,000 DP attacker, you’re spending $1.8m on a position where two of the guys are going to be on the bench. It’s a problem area created by the $500,000 Simpson signing. I don’t know what they do here.\n\nIf Blake goes, you can find a decent goalkeeper for $150k or $250k. We actually produce decent stoppers in this country, so no need to go the foreign route.\n\nYou’ll need another LB to replace Fabinho. Maybe you bring up Matt Real from Bethlehem Steel. If Gaddis goes, Aaron Jones can back up Keegan Rosenberry. I think you can get away with a wing combination of Picault and Herbers in 2018, assuming the former improves his finishing and the latter plays like he did at the tail-end of 2016.\n\nAt center back, I’m not sure. I still believe in Yaro or Marquez as a third CB, but a veteran TAM-level guy would be a nice complement to Jack Elliott. Onyewu had a really nice season and proved a lot of doubters wrong, but he’s not the future.\n\nWay too early 2018 depth chart:\n\nstriker: new designated player, C.J. Sapong, Jay Simpson\n\nattacking mid: new designated player, Adam Najem, Anthony Fontana\n\nright wing: Fabian Herbers, Marcus Epps, Eric Ayuk\n\nleft wing: Fafa Picault, Marcus Epps, Eric Ayuk\n\nDM #8: Alejandro Bedoya, Derrick Jones\n\nDM#6: Haris Medunjanin, Derrick Jones\n\nLeft back: Giliano Wijnaldum, Matthew Real\n\nCenter back: TAM-level signing, Jack Elliott, Richie Marquez, Josh Yaro, Auston Trusty\n\nRight back: Keegan Rosenberry, Aaron Jones\n\nGoalkeeper: new signing, John McCarthy, new signing\n\nI wrote this up assuming it’s the same old 4-2-3-1 again. You’d have Sapong backing up the new DP, who is playing in front of the other new DP. Picault and Herbers on the wings with Bedoya and Medunjanin behind them. I don’t know what Derrick Jones does next year, since having both Medunjanin and Bedoya on the roster keeps him on the bench, unless they decide to try that 4-1-4-1 again and flip the triangle. They tried a Jones/Bedoya/Medunjanin trio earlier this year and it didn’t work since Bedoya is not a number 10.\n\nThe only other thing I could see is that Bedoya goes back over to right wing and Jones plays next to Medunjanin. They won’t do that, but it’s a way to get Bedoya into better crossing and attacking positions while putting a true #6 on the field and allowing Medunjanin a little more space to roam.\n\nPreferred 2018 lineup assuming no tactical changes:\n\nIf you go through the suggestions I listed above, this is what your team looks like next season. They can get into the playoffs as the 5th or 6th seed with this grouping if they don’t whiff on the DP signings.\n\nIt’s the same 4-2-3-1 that we’ve always seen, this time pairing Elliott with a veteran CB and improving the #9 and #10 positions.\n\n“Go big or go home” lineup that will never happen:\n\nIt’s a 3-5-2 using Wijnaldum and Rosenberry as wingbacks to amplify their attacking ability and mitigate their defensive liability.\n\nMedunjanin can play the Andrea Pirlo regista role and spray the ball around from deeper positions while Bedoya and a new midfielder play box-to-box roles ala 2013 Juventus. Medunjanin, Bedoya, and the new DP would basically function like a poor man’s trio of Pirlo, Claudio Marchisio, and Paul Pogba. Sapong stays on the field with the new DP to get a pair of attackers on the field and justify dedicating that much cap space to the striker position.\n\nSomething different, but feasible\n\nIf you really can’t find a DP #10, don’t play with a DP #10.\n\nHere you’ve got a 4-1-4-1 with Jones behind Medunjanin and a box-to-box DP midfielder. Bedoya goes over to his natural right wing and Picault is on the left behind a DP striker. You saw them have a little bit of success flipping the triangle later in the season, and something like this could at least be a nice adjustment if Curtin insists on playing with a back four and a single striker for the entirety of 2018.\n\nAnyway, it’s a start. I think the Union created some good offseason momentum by obliterating a pathetic Orlando squad yesterday, so they should drop that press release with the roster moves ASAP and keep the train rolling.",

  "latent_5229": "Unless you're a die-hard Phillies fan, you might not grasp just how good Jeremy Hellickson has been since the start of 2016.\n\nHellickson, who allowed one run in six innings Thursday to improve to 4-0 with a 1.80 ERA this season, hasn't just been solid — he's legitimately been one of the best pitchers in the National League.\n\nSome stats to back it up:\n\n• Hellickson has a 1.11 WHIP the last two seasons. That's a better mark than Noah Syndergaard, Johnny Cueto, Cole Hamels, David Price, Dallas Keuchel, Jose Quintana and Chris Archer have.\n\n• Over the last calendar year, Hellickson's 3.29 ERA ranks ninth-best in the NL. Over that span, he has a lower ERA than some really good pitchers like Jake Arrieta, Zack Greinke, Carlos Martinez, Hamels, Quintana and Rick Porcello. It's almost identical to Chris Sale's 3.26 ERA over that span.\n\n• Hellickson over the last calendar year has walked 2.03 batters per nine innings. That's fifth-best in the NL behind only Mike Leake, Bartolo Colon, Madison Bumgarner and Syndergaard. (Jerad Eickhoff is a spot below Hellickson at 2.05 and then comes Max Scherzer at 2.08).\n\n• How has Hellickson been so effective with so low a strikeout rate? He's thrown exactly 250 pitches since 2016 on the low-outside corner and low-inside corner. That's fifth-most in the majors, behind only Jon Lester, Zach Davies, Keuchel and Kyle Hendricks. Paint.\n\nThis stat refers to zones 17 and 19 in the image below.\n\nOf course, Hellickson has done this with an extremely low strikeout rate. He's never been a big strikeout guy, but he did say Thursday he's been a bit surprised to have this much success in 2017 with his lowest career K rate.\n\nHellickson has a very low batting average on balls in play, which will regress closer to his career average, but it's not as if luck is the sole factor here. As mentioned above, he's hit spots as well as almost anyone in the majors.\n\nAnd the changeup, his elite pitch, gets some swings and misses but more often results in weak contact and quick outs. The worm will turn at some point, but Hellickson shouldn't be expected to fall off a cliff and revert back into a pitcher with a high-4.00s ERA.\n\nThe Phillies did well with this acquisition two offseasons ago and may have been fortunate things with Hellickson worked out the way they did. He has even more trade value now than he did a year ago.",

As pointed-out in the show, he’s additionally made reference to the Marketplace, to upcoming new starter avatars (which were likely a work-in-progress prior to Ebbe joining, just as the decision to axed Creatorverse, Versu and dio was something started prior to his arrival), and also on the matter of the August 2013 Terms of Service change.\n\nHarvey Crabsticks makes a welcome return to the show to chat about Ebbe’s comments. Harvey is someone I’ve only known a short time in Second Life, and I have to confess to admiring his insight as well as his (and Canary Beck’s) creative skills, and it was good to hear him to express views he and I subsequently batted around during a conversation we had after the recording for this podcast had been made.\n\nThe subject of audience, demographics and marketing is touched upon, which in turn edges towards issues of help and assistance for users. Drax mentions the Ebbe said he was unclear as to what had been done by the Lab along these lines; this may be a part of his learning-curve as Rod Humble (and others) have in the past been pretty clear that the Lab does carry out investigations into demographics, what people do in SL, why the leave, etc., and as Harvey points out, the Lab must have a clearer idea as to what SL users do within the platform just for the wealth of data they can gather on our activities on and interactions with the platform. However, as Harvey – and indeed Ebbe, during the meet-and-greet – also states, it’s unclear as to how scientifically that data is mined and used.\n\nMarketing-wise the question of high-profile campaigns is discussed, with Drax pointing to the very recognisable World of Warcraft TV / Internet spots (I was the one who, entirely tongue-in-cheek, mentioned William Shatner and WoW at the meeting with Ebbe). Harvey suggests that any really high-profile campaign would be better suited to a time when user retention is clearly on the upswing; something I’d tend to agree with, which is not to say all marketing should be held-off until that happens…\n\nThe “Ebbe meeting” and the interview with Harvey take up most the show, leaving everything else planned as a series of links on the blog page – which is no bad thing.

It calls for “a day of global civil disobedience” to mark Guy Fawkes Day in support of the Occupy Wall Street movement. The video urges to ‘relight the flame of protest’ and claims that unions from around the world are supporting actions of Anonymous and the Occupy movement, adding ‘austerity means war.’\n\nNovember 5 commemorates Guy Fawkes' failed 1605 Gunpowder Plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament in London.\n\nLast year’s protest on November 5 launched by Anonymous gathered hundreds of supporters in London’s Trafalgar Square, according to RT’s London Bureau, for Operation Vendetta - a march to the Houses of Parliament.\n\nPeople were carrying banners that read “We are Anonymous. We are the legion” and “Stop creating imaginary debt!”\n\nA rash of cyber-attacks were reported the same day on Australian government sites and Argentina’s government bank.

To qualify as a video game, you have to have to pass one major test: Can you play the game on a standard home TV set or a TV monitor ?\n\nBy definition, video games use video displays (ordinary TV sets or TV monitors). Higginbothams apparatus was that small Donner analog computer hooked up to an oscilloscope. It involved no video signals, being a strictly point-plotting circuit arrangement. All Higginbotham built was to attach a switch to the analog computer for user interaction. He then programmed the computer to create the ballistically-moving spot and its reversal upon intercept. His was one-time physics demo for an open-house occasion. No effort was made to commercialize that demo nor was it thought of as a commercial product at the time. Nor were patents applied for. Nobody thought it was a big deal until Nintendos lawyers dragged it up in court in 1985 to prove a point. They lost.\n\nIf this arrangement of hardware still qualifies in anyones mind as a video game, then he/she might wish to look into much earlier interactive uses of random access displays such as a scope. During and shortly after WW II both the US and the German army used such displays for missile tracking... definitely an interactive use....but were these video games?

We won that suit like all others we pursued over a period of 15 years.\n\nHigginbotham's lab demo of what amounts to a physics demonstration of a bouncing spot was never consciously meant to be a product....and would never have been heard from again, if it hadn't been for that lawsuit which dragged the story out from oblivion.\n\nSo, how do you categorize Higginbotham ?....he built a lab-demo for an open house to be played by visitors. It was done with the aid of a large analog computer and a standard lab oscilloscope. Then it wasn't heard from again for 20 years until the lawyers dug it up. No one, including me, knew of that physics demo. And even if I had known about it, would that have suggested the use of a home TV receiver to play games ? Hardly! So what does that make Higginbotham...the Father of a lab curiosity? In my considered opinion, W.H. is a straw man put in the spotlight by a fluke of history. There is another, more generic point that needs to be made in this connection: It is physically and logically impossible to be the Father of anything unless there is child! And unless that child is nurtured grows up to be someone of importance, neither the child or the father will make it into the worlds consciousness. Higginbothams work died the day his demo was disassembled. He never made any effort to support his child from that day on...and for a good reason: He did not recognize the germ of a product (never mind o whole industry) in what he was doing.\n\nGuys like Bushnell and Baer had to come along later, think creatively about the subject of playing games on a monitor in an arcade, or on a TV set and then put forth the effort required to make this What if? into real hardware and, even more difficult, into a real business.\n\nNow think about this: No one has suggested calling Steve Russell (who designed Spacewar, the first computer games on a PDP-1 in the 50's), the Father of Video Games. He was certainly the first person to program and play a game using a refrigerator-sized PDP-1 computer at MIT; his display was an analog CRT display just like a 'scope...no one is calling that a video game despite the fact that it uses a CRT. Nevertheless Russell certainly deserves the title of Father of Computer Games. Hundreds of engineers got access to and copied Russell's code and started playing games on their companies' computers. He did something that lived on, recognized its value and made it available to others. That effort turned into actual products 20 years later when Nolan Bushnell extended that concept to the arcades.\n\nThere are only two individuals who can claim to have invented video games: Nolan Bushnell and Ralph Baer.\n\nBushnell built an arcade game (Computer Space) in 1969 which used a raster-scan TV monitor display. The game was not a success.\n\nHowever, it clearly qualifies Bushnell for the title of the Father of Arcade Video Games.\n\nI came up with the concept of playing games on a standard TV set or TV monitor in September of 1966. The idea was to make an alternate, interactive use of tens of millions of home TV sets then in homes world-wide. The final equipment we built at Sanders Associates in 1967 (the Brown Box) was licensed to Magnavox in 1970 and appeared as the Odyssey 1TL200 on the market in the US in May of 1972. Approximately one-hundred-thousand of these video game systems were sold that year by Magnavox. There was invention, development of the idea, marketing of the idea and follow through to see it into significant production.\n\nHence, I am equally clearly the Father of Home Video Games.\n\nIncidentally, Bushnells company, Atari, was the first to take a license under my patents in the 70's. The fact that Nolan Bushnell developed PONG after he played a ping-pong game on an Odyssey 1TL200 at a L.A. Magnavox dealership demo in May of 1972 is also well-known.\n\nI strongly recommend that websites dedicated to Video Games - and the History of Video Games in particular - should reflect the facts as they are and not rewrite history based on faulty information.\n\nRalph H.

  "latent_6112": "Protesting Trump anti-labor policies in Chicago. Getty Images\n\nSo many offenses against human decency, so little time. Just in time for Labor Day, we note the \"death by a thousand cuts\" that are curbs, stalls, rollbacks and \"staggering\" assaults on workers' rights and protections - many engineered by so-called labor officials who turn out to be racists, oligarchs or brazenly anti-union crusaders whose credentials come from conservative Christian correspondence courses, so we know just how good they are. Some of the damage to date: Cuts to measures helping victims of discrimination, a halt to Obama-era reporting by large companies to address gross pay inequity, threats to overtime pay and a pullback by OSHA on previously vital actions like reporting injuries and issuing news releases.\n\nThe latest travesty: Last week, under loathsome cover of Harvey - and using the same slimy method of making things like climate change and sexual awareness just go poof from websites - OSHA scrubbed from their home page a longtime running list of workers killed on the job, because, really, who wants to know about that? The list, which included the worker's name, date of accident and cause of death, disappeared Friday just as Little Donny was making his unpresidentedly surreal visit to wish Harvey victims, \"Have a good time, everybody!\" Gone was also the list's preface, noting that, \"More than 4,500 workers lose their lives on the job every year....OSHA’s mission is to prevent workplace injuries, illnesses and deaths.” Also gone: a video telling workers they have the right to speak up about safety conditions, without reprisal.\n\nThe list did reappear, sort of: It was buried on an internal page deep within the site. It bears no names, just numbers. It only includes those fatalities at companies that received citations. It only includes workers at companies covered by OSHA, thus excluding most public employees and many thousands of contractors, free-lancers, workers at farms or small businesses etc. In Georgia, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution found the changes would eliminate mention of all but two of the state's 32 work-related deaths last year. Anyone seeking to learn more now has to dig through various incident reports, summaries and investigations. A Labor Department spokesman said the change was made to ensure \"more accurate\" information.\n\nOn its front page, OSHA replaced the grim, icky list of deaths with a back-slapping feature, “OSHA Working With Employers,” which offers “a few examples of our cooperative programs\" highlighting all the great companies trying not to kill more than their share of workers. Alas, the new focus on voluntary cooperation fails to recognize that risks to workers are far greater at lousy companies that don't care how many people they kill and thus have no interest in voluntarily cooperating. But we guess that's what Dear Leader meant when he once declared, \"The well-being of the American citizen and worker will be placed second to none.” In other words, \"The Chamber of Commerce is fully in charge at OSHA.\"\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts\n\nThe OSHA video explaining their rights to workers.

What we found was rather startling to say the least.\n\nThen one person confirmed it; as did several others less than an hour later.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/THVmlKH.jpg\n\nSomeone with a tag made a video of it because some Shitizens (abusive & toxic anti-social Star Citizen fans) were claiming the whole thing was fake.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXD7JKT6bcE\n\nIn my case, they gave me a special tag. This is a dump direct from the page via Javascript and JSON. From the main CS page, you could just go to the page > View Source > search for “Greetings sourcecode lurker!”\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/o0UJmfc.png\n\nA forum thread “Publicly tagging customers in CIG CS?” that appeared on the CIG website was not only closed, it was completely removed. Archive.is capture: http://archive.is/L2G1k\n\nNot only was CIG caught using customer information given to them, then matching it against information (e.g. a Goon is a denizen of the SA forums) they pulled elsewhere, but they were also using it to determine the level of service and attention given to backers who have thus far given them almost $115 million.\n\nRight off the bat, the backer who originally spotted this and posted it on Reddit was accused - by Shitizens - of faking the whole thing.\n\nOthers weren't as dismissive:\n\n===\n\nThats very unlikely to be a spoof, Brown Hornet is an early backer and one thing he never does in his posts is joke around. He also mentioned this when challenged in the reddit thread http://imgur.com/1GJd3AS . Look at the fourth paragraph of the kickstarter, it absolutely states every single ship we sell over the next 48 hours will 'never' be sold again. Mr Hornet complained about this and got marked a 'difficult customer' . This is where the problems started, I mean what is it if its not pure rotten lies? LTI was another one that was reintroduced after saying the complete opposite, controller agnosticism was a bait and switch with zero-order gimbal controls despite backers being assured that wouldn't happen. Star-marine ready in weeks?\n\nHow could you believe anything they say at this point, I know I don't. I would respect them if they stopped selling ships and said we have raised enough money until launch and are targeting such and such a date for MVP. There is currently no scheduled release date for a game thats 2 years late! Here is feedback on 2.4 from a regular tester on why 2.4 is nowhere near ready for backers even for alpha testing.\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/malogos9/v/70427493\n\nFrom a 2 hour play through and here's the list of issues:\n\n- 16 fps (worse in dogfights)\n\n- Rubberbanding\n\n- Walking through walls\n\n- Invisible spawning\n\n- NPCs bog down server and spawn x4 at each Comm Array\n\n- Spawning into a wall\n\n- Bugged out FPS weapons\n\n===\n\nThis comment pretty much sums up CIG:\n\n===\n\nUnder normal circumstances it would be hard to believe that a company with funding of $114m had taken the time to link customer accounts to social media and discussion boards and felt this information was important enough to record. But then this is Star Citizen so it is not very surprising. It barely even ranks on the long list of bewildering things they have done. But it is another yet another indicator that something is rotten in Chris Roberts’ house.\n\nThe narrative from diehard sc grognards has always been that this stuff is fake or exaggerated. Part of a plot (with as yet undetermined goals) orchestrated by the hated Derek Smart and his minions. But the more that’s revealed about the people working at CIG and the way they operate the less water this holds. The Escapist article was dismissed as scurrilous rumour because they used anonymous sources (even though this is a common and normal practice). There was no way Sandi was as crazy as the article claimed, nor could the company’s culture be as poisonous as it appeared. Ridiculous.\n\nThen the beer emails reveal that the VP of marketing can’t even conduct herself professionally in communications with a customer. Those again were dismissed as fake, never mind that would have been a lot of effort for something that could have easily resulted in legal action. Just like was threatened with The Escapist. So far there have been no legal repercussions for either case.\n\nNow we discover that CIG is tagging its paying customers to track their identity across the Internet. The only reasonable conclusion is that this is done so they don’t expend unnecessary effort on certain groups of people who are viewed as being harmful to the project. This has parallels to the behaviour of cults like Scientology.\n\nAnd surprise surprise, one of the categories is “snowflake”, a term used by Sandi in an email as a derogatory term for people she feels are entitled and unnecessarily demanding. Never mind that they’ve funded her and her husband’s extravagant lifestyle for the past four years.\n\nAt this point anyone who can’t see that there’s something very wrong with CIG’s culture which affects both its employees and customers is being wilfully blind.“\n\n===\n\nReply · Report Post",

Whiting\n\nCarol and Lilac prepare to carry a smol, tuckered out Milla home after a long day of _insert activity here_\n\nAlso, I do believe we have gone from headcanon to full on AU (alternate universe) territory with Freedom Planet! At least when it comes to my version of these three's designs. XD I originally planned to draw the game-canon Lilac but after looking back at my Freedump Planet: Lilac Concepts so many times, I've grown a huge soft spot for my Dash Dragon Lilac. I might even draw her like this from now on because it's honestly super fun to draw and I'm content with the concepts behind it that I managed to put together.\n\nIf you don't like it, I'll remind you that every single other artist who does FP fanart draws Lilac the way she looks in the game so there are those you can like heh.\n\nSo! Some quick points about this:\n\n~ This image shows an idea of mine where since Milla was a lost child who had been without her parents for a long time (I assume they died ), she kind of started to see Carol and Lilac as parental guardians a little while after they took her in due to how they took care of her, comforted her, and taught her their ways. Carol and Lilac (Who y'all know is my FP OTP) also develop a maternal bond with Milla but their dynamic works in a way similar to Steven Universe and the Crystal Gems where though they have moments that show their parents-to-child bond, they're still a fun little group of the closest friends and adventure companions!\n\n(I kind of see this trio this way in the games, too XD and I know Carol would love the idea of someone looking up to her like a guardian/teacher)\n\n* Despite how Lilac is a few years older, I like to imagine that she's still a bit petite compared to Carol XD\n\nThey're also older here than in the game canons, being young adults.\n\n* I like to think of Milla as a very young little puppy. It may be why I feel uncomfortable when I see fanart of her with the breasts of an older teen or in slightly suggestive situations/poses. I mean, I know she's still a kid ( in FP2 she's barely a preteen) but I see her as, like, perhaps 5-6 like Cream the Rabbit from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. I decided to show this by how I scaled her down to be as small as she is in this drawing.\n\nI don't mind seeing her aged up but that doesn't seem to be the case in some illustrations I've seen. Ahh, fandoms and their questionable members.\n\n* I made Milla's ears fluffy with the idea that she's a Basset hound/Spaniel mix? Maybe her father was a Basset hound (or mainly so) and her mother was a Cocker Spaniel, which would explain the fluffy tail? I also think those green ear piece things would work like hair clips in this case instead of whatever they are in her canon design (they look like piercings if they're not just somehow sticking to her ears o.o).\n\nGosh I love making fake anime screenshots XD\n\nOriginal character design by Ziyo Ling\n\nOriginal character redesigns by Tyson Tan\n\nFreedom Planet © GalaxyTrail .",

  "latent_6449": "A Georgia man is being charged with necrophilia after cops made a shocking discovery during a robbery investigation earlier this week. According to the Ledger-Enquirer, Columbus police arrested Domonique Smith on Monday for a robbery that happened on Sunday night. Cops found a bike stolen from a funeral home in his possession at the time of his arrest.\n\nThe robbery happened overnight at the Hill Watson Peoples Funeral Service. Video footage from the scene helped police identify the suspect, and the same footage revealed the man sexually assaulted the corpse of a dead woman at the funeral home.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Police Maj. Gil Slouchick shared more details about the case with the media.\n\n“The results of our investigation and the forensic examination gave us probable cause to believe that this individual had indeed sexually assaulted a dead body.”\n\nPolice did not reveal what sexual act took place, but there was enough evidence from the video footage to file a charge of necrophilia against the man on Thursday. He will appear in court on Monday for the charge.\n\nSmith was found in an abandoned home on Monday, and the stolen bike was not all he had in his possession. Inside the unoccupied home, police found TVs and guns.\n\nHomeless man charged with necrophilia at funeral home: http://t.co/6sNN15ttaz pic.twitter.com/vz2SMm4Khd — KSLA News 12 (@KSLA) February 14, 2015\n\nBefore the addition of the necrophilia charge, police charged Smith with “second-degree burglary, entering an unoccupied dwelling, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and theft by receiving stolen property.”\n\nThe identity of the dead woman assaulted by Smith was not released by the funeral home, but the owner, Cedric Hill, told the media that her family was immediately contacted.\n\n“We hold our families dear. We look for the best protection and security for the families we have served in this community for 65 years.”\n\nNecrophilia is not common. Capt. Gordon Griswould of the Columbus Police told the media that he could not remember the last time someone in the area was charged with the crime. It is “extremely rare.”\n\nIf convicted, Domonique Smith can spend up to 10 years in prison. He had already pleaded guilty to the other charges against him during his two previous court appearances earlier this week.\n\nEven with the rarity of the crime, this is not the first necrophilia case to make headlines in recent months. Back in December, Gregory Graf was arrested for the murder of his stepdaughter, Jessica Padgett. After he killed her, he had sex with her corpse. He murdered her specifically to commit these acts with her dead body.\n\nNorthampton County District Attorney John Morganelli spoke about the case, according to a previously released story by the Inquisitr.\n\n“We’re very confident in the strength of our case. We do have overwhelming evidence. As I indicated in court today, the defendant did confess to this crime, he led investigators to where the body was located and he filmed the sexual acts he was performing on Ms. Padgett. And we’re in possession of all that evidence.”\n\nGraf’s defense attorney revealed that he planned to use a mental health defense for his client.\n\nIn the case of Domonique Smith, he did not know the victim. What do you think of this shocking Georgia crime?\n\n[Photo: Google Maps]",
  "latent_6552": "Counterfeit NFL jerseys continue to be a big problem for the NFL and licensed apparel vendors, but fans are willing to take a risk on fake jerseys because of the cost savings. (7:01)\n\nThe NFL, in cooperation with government authorities, announced on Thursday that it had seized a record $13.6 million worth of counterfeit NFL merchandise this season in a nationwide enforcement effort called \"Operation Red Zone.\"\n\nThat total included a bust in Warwick, R.I., in September, when the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations, with an assist from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Postal Inspection Service, seized 226 boxes containing 4,016 counterfeit jerseys. It also includes 160,000 Super Bowl-related pieces of memorabilia discovered in recent days.\n\n\"Organized criminals are preying on that excitement, ripping consumers off with counterfeit merchandise and stealing from the American businesses who have worked hard to build a trusted brand,\" said ICE director John Morton, in a statement. \"The sale of counterfeit jerseys and other sports items undermines the legitimate economy, takes jobs away from Americans, and fuels crime overseas. No good comes of counterfeiting American products -- whether NFL jerseys, airbags, or pharmaceuticals -- and we must go after the criminals behind it.\"\n\nAll this is just the tip of the iceberg, as an \"Outside The Lines\" investigation that will air Sunday has discovered. In the past couple of years, stopping counterfeiting has gotten more challenging as more websites, mostly coming out of China, have gone directly to the consumer. It is only a crime to sell counterfeit gear, not to buy it.\n\nCounterfeiters have also done more business as the price of jerseys has risen. A knockoff of a stitched official Nike jersey that retails for $135 sells on these sites for as little as $20 and often includes free air shipping from Asia that allows a consumer to have the package in eight to 10 days. Nike is in the first year of supplying jerseys to the NFL. Counterfeiters also offer variations of products that licensees don't, such as camouflage jerseys with team logos on them.\n\n\"If you were to say who is our largest competitor, I would say counterfeit,\" Jamie Davis, president of Fanatics, one of the largest online sports retailers, told \"Outside the Lines.\" The company, which runs many official online stores, including the NFL site, projects it will do $1 billion in business this year.\n\nDavis says that, while counterfeiters often use the same pictures to mislead consumers, what fans get when it arrives on their doorstep is a different story, ranging from misspellings to loose stitches to colors that fade with a single wash. Davis showed ESPN a Victor Cruz jersey that was ordered from China that had a Super Bowl XLV patch on it. Cruz and the New York Giants played in Super Bowl XLVI. When these mistakes occur, Davis says there's often no recourse, as many counterfeit businesses don't have any customer service.\n\nCatching counterfeiters has proved to be a near-impossible task. Although the NFL told ESPN it shut down an astounding 4,200 websites this season, it didn't completely shut down all those businesses.\n\n\"It's a big game of Whack-A-Mole, where we try to go after counterfeiters and they pop up somewhere else,\" said Anastasia Danias, the NFL's vice president of legal affairs.\n\nEric Feinberg, founder of the consumer advocacy group FAKE (\"Fans Against Kounterfeit Enterprise\"), says that, after sites are disabled, they pop up in as soon as 48 hours, adding a word -- or even just a couple of letters -- to the old website address. The businesses are even harder to track down, Feinberg said, because domain names are often registered to fake addresses, and domain registry sites -- lured by the business of selling another name -- continue to sell what the counterfeiters want.\n\n\"It's out of control,\" Feinberg said.\n\nWhile one could make the argument that fewer consumers are being tricked -- and instead are knowingly taking their chances with counterfeit websites -- Feinberg says he is concerned with sites like eBay, Amazon and Facebook, which take limited responsibility for counterfeit merchandise being sold on or through their sites.\n\nBoth Amazon and eBay have won court decisions in recent years that don't obligate them legally to shut down counterfeit auctions. Feinberg showed \"Outside the Lines\" counterfeit ads that not only appear frequently on Facebook pages of those who identified themselves as NFL fans, but also come directly through the email tied to the Facebook account.\n\nMuch of the communication through the league and authorized dealers has been regarding how not to be duped by counterfeiters, but the challenge is that many fans today know exactly what they are doing when they go to these sites.\n\nPreston Burns is one of those fans. He and his friends have ordered many jerseys from a counterfeit website. His latest purchase, a stitched Colin Kaepernick jersey and an Aldon Smith camouflage jersey, cost him $70, including free shipping.\n\n\"Pretty much everyone at the stadium would think this is an authentic jersey purchased for over $200 from some official NFL outlet,\" Burns said of the Kaepernick jersey.\n\nThe biggest difference? You can't even buy an official stitched version of a Kaepernick jersey. Due to his late emergence on the scene, Nike only has the lowest-tier jersey for Kaepernick, the screen-on name and number jersey, available to the public for $100.\n\n\"I think this one puts me closer to the gameday experience,\" Burns said. \"Closer to what the players are wearing on the field.\"\n\nNike spokesman Kejuan Wilkins said the company does what it can to protect itself and retailers against counterfeiters, but also wants to protect the fan.\n\n\"We believe that we make the best product for every stage of the game,\" Wilkins said, in a statement provided to \"Outside the Lines.\" \"NFL fans deserve the same level of design and execution as the pros.\"\n\nDanias, the NFL's counsel, says the league hears from plenty of fans each year who receive inferior products from counterfeiting sites. But the scary part is the number of people who are ordering fake jerseys that the league isn't hearing from.\n\nGuys like Burns and his friends order counterfeit jerseys that are pretty close to the real thing and show up with tags with holograms on them.\n\nAt his tailgate before this year's playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, Burns was pointing out all the people wearing jerseys that he thinks were purchased from sites selling them illegally.\n\nSaid Burns: \"I think a lot of people at 49ers games today are wearing jerseys from China, probably more people than are wearing the real thing.\"",

  "latent_6698": "Share. Empty net Empty net\n\nHockey is my favorite sport. I played year-round throughout my childhood, and I watch it religiously (go Islanders!). One of the reasons I love hockey so much is because it's fast, strategic, and dynamic on so many different levels. The good news is that NHL 15 understands this. It's fun to play on a moment-to-moment level, and it's accessible to anyone that can hold a controller; should you want to delve into its finer points, there are complex techniques like poke checking, throwing your body around, and winning battles in the corners.\n\nNHL 15 8 IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 OF 08 01 OF 08 NHL 15 Download Image Captions ESC\n\nThe bad news is that on a big-picture level, NHL 15 foregoes and forgets much of the minutia that hardcore hockey fans really care about. For as solidly as it plays, some of the series' most important hooks - some of which inspired me to cheer it on in past years - have completely disappeared. On the ice, NHL 15 shines. But everything around it feels a tad bit empty.\n\nEA's NHL series typically totes strong gameplay, and it's as impressive as ever in NHL 15. Better yet, it's highly customizable. Camera angles can be altered, pre-determined difficulty settings can be tinkered with, and you can even set how arcadey or simulation-like you want the overall experience to be. Hate icing? Shut it off. Going offside the bane of your existence? Eliminate it completely. You can even determine how often a fight happens, the likelihood of a player breaking his stick, or whether you want to deal with injuries. And of course, you can pick your control style. It's cool that you can make something as meaningless as an exhibition game with your friend all your own by editing so many different facets, even if many of these options aren't exactly new.\n\nSpeaking of modes, NHL 15 is noticeably lighter than old-gen iterations on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (and, in fact, the old-gen version of NHL 15, which is a clone of last year's), and this is where the overall package begins to diminish. Online Team Play is gone, as is EA Sports Hockey League, which were two community lynchpins. You can still play single ranked or unranked games online -- everything goes very smoothly when connected, with reasonable load times and no noticeable lag -- and you can bring your Ultimate Team online, too. Hockey Ultimate Team is still enjoyable in its own right, with the ability to create unique squads with a hodgepodge of players from different teams, leagues, and skill levels. It might just be NHL 15's meatiest and most substantial option.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nAs a single-player-centric gamer myself, I've always gravitated towards offline modes, which is where the lack of content really started to sink in. NHL 15 doesn't even have a Season Mode, which was originally introduced in the Super Nintendo and SEGA Genesis era. To play a season, I had to actually jump into Be A GM Mode... only to find that it’s been stripped of some of its own features, including basic online functionality. Be A GM Mode is actually awesome; I've enjoyed it in years past and it's always made me want a fully fleshed-out NHL game where you're a general manager. But it's really unfortunate that you have to extract Season Mode out of it instead of keeping them separate. I'm confused why I can't play a single season as a team of my choice without having to jump through hoops. It's 2014, not 1994.\n\nBe A Pro mode has also taken multiple hits. You can no longer be drafted by an organization and work your way up through the ranks from lesser, ancillary leagues and into the pros. Now, you're drafted by an organization and you immediately -- and mysteriously -- make the team. I created a pro that was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens. As I played, I was as confused as to why I couldn't skip forward to my next shift automatically as I was confused by how I -- a young rookie on the periphery of the roster -- could just jump on the ice whenever I wanted. Be A Pro still has deep customization options, but it also felt hollow and half-baked.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nWith all of that said, EA Sports has certainly created a pretty game, to the point where multiple people in the IGN office told me that from afar, they thought I was watching a real hockey game for a moment. Naturally, NHL 15 still suffers from some awkward animations and occasional glitchiness, but I was impressed by the relatively lifelike player faces and the flow of their sweaters. There are lots of little touches, from a center approaching the circle while looking behind him and chattering with his defensemen, to goal celebrations like jumping into the glass in the corner as teammates crowd around. Slow-mo replays of awesome goals are heightened by the realistic craziness of the crowd behind the glass. The crowd’s a bit more awkward at full speed, though. The camera often cuts to identical fans executing identical animations, and I've never seen so many ****-talking away-team fans in real life as I saw in NHL 15. I'm pretty sure a Senators fan wouldn't make it out of Toronto alive if he was taunting the home crowd like that.\n\nEA Sports has also nailed the sounds of hockey; the slash of a skate on fresh ice, the bounce of a puck into the boards, the collision of rubber on the crossbar. When I think about playing hockey, I think about the smell of the locker room, the sound of the Zamboni laying a fresh sheet down, and all of those aforementioned noises of the game. I'm so pleased that the telltale audio cues of hockey were captured so realistically, even if the crowd noise itself leaves something to be desired.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nI also mostly enjoyed NHL 15's integration with NBC's hockey telecast. First of all, I'm a huge, huge fan of Doc Emrick. I think he's the best in the business. So hearing him, alongside Eddie Olczyk and \"Chicken Parm\" Ray Ferraro is a real treat. Still, Doc’s delivery feels a bit stilted. There are none of his quintessential freak-out moments, and his famously vast vocabulary isn't utilized well. Olczyk throws in a few memorable lines, but Ferraro's lines seem rushed. They also collectively seem off the mark fairly often. Doc will announce that a perfect pass just occurred as I threw a puck into traffic in the slot, losing it to an aggressive defenseman. A goalie can be scrambling in the crease, making multiple acrobatic saves, as Doc notes that those saves were \"easy.\" Ferraro in particular seems off-kilter; he made comments multiple times during Be A GM Mode games that made it seem like I was in the 50th game of the season, not the 3rd. Little things like this are minor, but they can be grating if you're looking for immersion and realism.\n\nLikewise, using real video imagery of Doc and Eddie against fake, in-game footage was jarring. It was cool to hear that music, see the same scoreboard graphics, and witness the intros to each city, with helicopter shots of the arenas, skylines, and other geography. But slow-mo recaps of goals and other memorable moments are ruined by sharp edits between scenes that have the action stop for split seconds at a time. The most awkward recaps of them all are for fights, when you see that gloves are dropped by both players in literally one or two frames. These scenes in particular look so weird and unrealistic.",
  "latent_6717": "Photo Credit: Joshua L. Jones\n\nCandidates for Athens-Clarke County mayor and commission faced off at a Federation of Neighborhoods-sponsored forum Monday night at the Melting Point. While there weren't any fireworks, and there wasn't much that folks who've been following the races haven't heard already, a few statements caught my ear. So I've spent the day finding out whether they're true. Here's what I came up with:\n\nClaim: Mayor Nancy Denson said that she has only refused to put two items on the commission's agenda, one of which, the Complete Streets: Prince Avenue road diet demonstration project, was put in front of her just \"10 days before a public meeting.\" At another point, she said she was given \"a two-week notice.\"\n\nFacts: Nancy's timeline is a bit off. Supporters of the demonstration project initially met with her on Jan. 31 and asked for a vote at the Mar. 4 or Apr. 1 commission meeting. That means she was asked to put it on the agenda for discussion at either the Feb. 20 or Mar. 20 agenda-setting meeting—20 or 50 days away.\n\nClaim: Nancy also said that a proposal to move the crosswalk on Prince from The Grit to a safer location would cost $10,000.\n\nFacts: According to Transportation and Public Works Director David Clark, \"there would be approximately $10,000 in material cost incurred by staff to move the crosswalk, including removing the current crosswalk and [Americans with Disabilities Act] ramp in front of The Grit, installing new ADA ramps [including relocating a water meter], relocating the flashing beacon posts and applying the necessary thermoplastic pavement and crosswalk markings.\"\n\nHowever, it's also noteworthy that ACC has $25,000 in its budget that's already earmarked for crosswalk improvements and hasn't been spent. In addition, Clark's department recommended moving the crosswalk to the other side of Newton Street because it would be safer.\n\nClaim: There was a lot of discussion about how the commission can override the mayor and put something on the agenda for discussion. Everyone was under the impression it takes seven votes, except lawyer and District 3 candidate Dustin Kirby, who said he read the charter, and the mayor's power to set the agenda is \"absolute.\"\n\nFacts: EHHHHHH. Sorry. County Attorney Bill Berryman directed me to Section 2-104(e) of the ACC code, which gives five (5) commissioners the power to call a special meeting with no less than 24 hours' written notice. Commissioners have threatened to do this a handful of times but, as best I can recollect, in each instance the mayor has acquiesced and put said item on the agenda. [Update: Commissioner Jared Bailey just reminded me that the mayor refused to put a discussion of the home occupation ordinance on the agenda—even after he brought her a letter signed by all 10 commissioners saying they supported it.]\n\nClaim: Mayoral challenger Tim Denson said it would only cost $600,000 to make Athens Transit free.\n\nFacts: Non-UGA farebox revenue is expected to be about $650,000 next year, so that figure is pretty close to accurate. However, it's unclear whether UGA would still be willing to contribute to Athens Transit's budget when its students and employees could hop on a city bus for free regardless of whether UGA reimbursed Athens Transit or not. File this one under… maybe.\n\nClaim: Nancy said that Clemson's bus system isn't comparable to Athens' because Clemson is much smaller and has more students than full-time residents. \"Free buses have never been achieved in a city like ours,\" she said.\n\nFacts: Clemson Area Transit doesn't just serve Clemson; it serves Anderson County and the cities of Seneca, Central and Pendleton as well. That area has a total population of about 210,000 people, compared to Athens' 115,452. Clemson University's enrollment is 21,303, compared to UGA's 34,475.\n\nChapel Hill, NC, another city with free bus service, is home to the University of North Carolina and, along with next-door neighbor Carrboro, has a population of 77,000.\n\nNancy's figures don't add up. Clemson and Chapel Hill are both fairly similar to Athens.\n\nClaim: Nancy addressed a vague call for a \"progressive property tax\" that Tim had made during another forum, calling it \"absolutely wrong,\" \"devastating,\" and \"illegal.\" It would require a change to the state constitution, and she'd be surprised if Tim could muster one vote to do so, she said.\n\nFacts: That was kind of dirty pool, since Nancy said it during her closing statement and Tim didn't have a chance to respond. But I caught up with him later so he could elaborate on his plan.\n\nEssentially, Tim wants a higher homestead exemption for low-income homeowners, so a family with a household income below the poverty line would get an additional tax break.\n\nWhile Tim isn't aware of any city or county in Georgia with a homestead exemption for low-income homeowners, there's some precedent. Some local governments in the Northeast do it, and here in Georgia, many cities and counties have tax exemptions for seniors and veterans.\n\nSuch a plan would not require changing the state constitution. However, it would require the approval of a majority of legislators and a local referendum, according to Clint Mueller of the Association County Commissioners of Georgia. That's still a high hurdle, but much less difficult than getting the two-thirds vote in the legislature plus statewide voter approval needed to change the constitution.",

But one historic brewery owner is going against the grain.\n\nEric Trump, the GOP presidential hopeful’s middle son, visited D.G. Yuengling & Son Brewery in Schuylkill County, Penn. Tuesday. It’s America's oldest brewery and remains family-owned after nearly two centuries in operation.\n\nAccording to Reading Eagle, Trump toured the brewery with Richard “Dick” Yuengling, the plant’s fifth-generation owner.\n\n\"This is an amazing American success story,\" Trump said during a news conference outside the brewery. \"We need a lot more of these.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Because of a great company like Yuengling, workers can educate their kids and live a prosperous lifestyle.\"\n\nRELATED: The most American beers ever?\n\nFounded in 1829, Yuengling is also one of the country’s largest beer companies, producing 2.8 billion barrels annually. Dick Yuengling is credited with turning the relative small operation into a national powerhouse. They now operate three beer making facilities-- Pottsville, Penn., East Norwegian Township and Tampa, Fla.\n\nNow, the notoriously hard-working brewery owner appears to admire another man who went into the family business to build an empire.\n\n\"Our guys are behind your father,\" Yuengling reportedly told Eric Trump. \"We need him in there.\"\n\nBut some fans of Yuengling don’t seem to share the brewmasters’ views. This week, dozens of social media posts have popped up citing Yuengling's alleged Trump endorsement, with many vowing never to touch the iconic American beer again using the hashtag #BoycottYuengling.\n\nOn Wednesday, state representative Brian Sims, one of Pennsylvania’s first openly gay state legislators, wrote a Facebook post criticizing the company. He says he's been drinking the beer for 17 years but has since called on others-- particularly those in the LGBT community-- to stop drinking the beer.\n\n“D.G. Yuengling & Son, Inc. believes that an agenda that is anti-woman, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBT, anti-racial minority and anti-equality is best for them and that tells me all I need to know about what they think is best for their own customers.\"\n\nThroughout the week, Sims has doubled down on his call for a boycott of the multi-generational institution.\n\nSome, however, shared their support of Yuengling’s outspoken praise of The Donald.\n\nRELATED: Inside the food fight between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton\n\nAccording to FOX 8, Yuengling Jr.’s support thus far is only verbal as he is not listed as a Trump donor. In the past, he has given money to both Republican and Democratic congressional campaigns. According to OpenSecrets.org, his last presidential donation was to George W. Bush in 2000.\n\nWhen reached for comment by Forbes, Dick Yuengling said he would certainly welcome Hillary Clinton to tour the brewery facilities but would elaborate on his comments about Trump, declaring,“I’ve said enough.”\n\nNumerous attempts to reach a brewery representative were not returned.",

  "latent_6973": "Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could displace central banks and the current banking system. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has said virtual currencies should not be dismissed, explaining they might be the future.\n\nPeople \"may prefer\" cryptocurrencies\n\nLaagarde commented on the rise of cryptocurrencies during a conference at the Bank of England this week. Her viewpoint is fairly unusual in the industry as other banking leaders have vocally claimed Bitcoin, Ethereum and others have no place in the conventional banking system.\n\nLaagarde doesn't share the scepticism. Urging banks to invest in digital coins, she warned that new technologies cannot be swiped aside for offering something fundamentally different to current processes.\n\n\"Not so long ago, some experts argued that personal computers would never be adopted, and that tablets would only be used as expensive coffee trays,\" the Foundation for Economic Education reports Laagarde said. \"I think it may not be wise to dismiss virtual currencies. Instead, citizens may one day prefer virtual currencies.\"\n\nWhy all the hype?\n\nVisionaries are giving cryptocurrencies so much attention because they possess characteristics that address some of the biggest issues with regular banking.\n\nThe most significant feature is the presence of the underlying blockchain tech, a publicly accessible chain of transaction references. It constitutes an open ledger of every coin exchange ever made in the cryptocurrency, which could help to reduce fraud and improve economic transparency.\n\nBeijing's decision to shut down bitcoin trading platforms has left investors scrambling to cut their losses and threatens to deprive the crypto-currency of a crucial market.\n\nIn the long term, cryptocurrencies could be safer to use than regular currencies. During her talk, Laagarde said cryptocurrencies \"may one day be easier and safer\" to obtain than forms of physical money. Particularly in remote regions or less developed nations, established cryptocurrencies could also afford access to a more stable economy. In this capacity, cryptocurrencies might improve global economic security.\n\nWhat are the problems?\n\nIt's not all plain sailing though. In their current forms, cryptocurrencies are still notoriously volatile. They're also relatively unknown, untested and viewed with suspicion from some quarters.\n\nThe risks involved in dealing with cryptocurrencies are too high a barrier for most financial institutions to get involved. Some regions are viewing digital coins more favourably than others. China's recent suspension of cryptocurrency exchanges provided another reminder that cryptocurrencies cannot yet be relied upon as a global economy.\n\nStacks of computing power gives bitcoin miners a shot at harvesting crypto currencies\n\nThere are more mundane challenges to solve too. Many people still view cryptocurrencies as an opaque technical concept with limited real world applications. So far, there has been no broad effort to educate wider audiences on blockchain tech or its possible positive impacts.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nThis doesn't necessarily spell the end for cryptocurrencies as a future economy. As Laagarde reminded in her speech, nobody foresaw the impact of computers before they were widely available. Initially, they were confined to a small set of knowledgeable individuals and industries.\n\nThis is the mark cryptocurrencies have currently reached. We know from experience that the impacts of new technologies are rarely appreciated or apparent until a few years after they're widely available.\n\nAlthough digital economies aren't yet a truly viable proposition, the rising interest from banks should be taken as a sign of their potential. With even the IMF now taking cryptocurrencies seriously, it's increasingly apparent that the future economy might be based on different models to those we know today.\n\nDigital Journal",

For an average 2030 van, they would be up to about €900.\n\n\"However, these additional costs are significantly lower than the fuel savings from which consumers will benefit over a vehicle's lifetime,\" the Commission said.\n\n'More confident'\n\nThe Commission said the incentives for manufacturers to produce more alternative vehicles were designed to boost the EU's competitiveness in the global car manufacturing market.\n\n\"The EU automotive industry risks losing its technological leadership in particular with respect to zero- and low-emission vehicles, with the US, Japan, South Korea and China moving ahead very quickly in this segment,\" it said.\n\nIt noted that China had recently introduced mandatory zero- and low-emission vehicle quotas for manufacturers from 2019, and that some US states had established a \"regulatory instrument to enhance the uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles\".\n\nInternal Market Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska said the EU's car industry was \"at a turning point\".\n\n\"To maintain its global leadership, and for the sake of our environment and public health, the car industry needs to invest in new and clean technologies,\" she added.\n\nThe proposals would also see the Commission making up to €800m available to go towards improving charging infrastructure and €200m for battery development.\n\nEU governments and the European Parliament will need to agree to the Commission's proposals.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAnalysis: Theo Leggett, business correspondent\n\nEnvironmental campaigners and consumer advocates seem pretty unimpressed by the Commission's proposals - even though the proposed limits on CO2 emissions are considerably lower than what we have today.\n\nThat's partly because the proposals don't include minimum quotas for the production of zero and low emission vehicles - hybrids, electric cars and hydrogen vehicles. There will be incentives for manufacturers to meet specific targets, but no penalties if they fail.\n\nIf Brussels gossip is to be believed, the proposal was watered down due to high level lobbying from Germany's car industry association, the VDA - which found sympathy in high places, particularly among German officials.\n\nSo is the Commission's plan worthwhile? Well, the industry is currently working towards an earlier stage of CO2 emissions targets, due to come into force in 2021. When adopted, these were also derided as being too weak.\n\nNevertheless, they have been widely credited with encouraging major carmakers to develop a range of new electric and hybrid models. And if carmakers are building them, then they will want us to buy them.\n\nSales of electric vehicles and hybrids in Europe are already increasing rapidly. The chances are the proposals, if adopted, will only accelerate that process, but perhaps not as quickly as some might have hoped.",
  "latent_7104": "The woman who accused two New York City police officers of rape released a statement on Tuesday expressing her disappointment in the jury’s verdict. The officers were acquitted of rape, but were convicted of three counts of official misconduct for entering her apartment. What follows is the statement from the woman, who requested that her name not be used:\n\nI know that in a criminal trial a verdict of not guilty does not necessarily mean the defendants were found innocent, but I am devastated and disappointed by the jury’s decision. I have waited two and half years for closure that will now never come. Hearing that verdict brought me to my knees; it brought me back to my bedroom on that awful night when my world was turned upside down by the actions of two police officers who were sent there to protect, but instead took advantage of their authority and broke the law.\n\nEverything they say about the difficulties of a rape trial is sadly true. One’s word is not enough in these days of C.S.I. and DNA. Even if people believe you, you are tested beyond what any crime victim should have to endure. While on the witness stand, the defense attorneys seek to shame and humiliate you for hours, even days, with deeply personal questions about your body, your intimate life and your social life simply because you dare to come forward. How saddening, how utterly disheartening.\n\nI want people to know I take great comfort and express my thanks in the swift action from Mayor Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Kelly to fire Misters Moreno and Mata from service immediately following the verdict. Thank you both for making such a strong statement that this city will not tolerate criminal actions by its police officers. Not a single officer in uniform sat behind the defendants when I testified. That speaks volumes. I know there are thousands of real and good New York City police officers who would have acted very differently that night.\n\nI want to especially thank Coleen Balbert, Edward Tacchi, Randolph Clarke, Dianne Spence and the entire District Attorney’s Office. I cry as I write this because I know they are hurting just like me, and because I know that beyond just doing their jobs, they are real people who care. I have spent countless hours over two and half years with these people and I am blown away by their dedication to fight for truth and justice. Before the jury went into deliberation, I told Coleen this has been personal for me, and their endless efforts to help me has meant the world. And even after this shocking ending, I mean that still, I will love them forever. When Ed told me after the verdict, “I am saddened for this injustice, and so sorry to you for this failure,” I lost it. My heart broke. What I can only say about Ed, Randolph and Coleen is that they did the best for me, they are the best to me, and to so many others they have touched. What sets them apart, makes them best-in-class, is their heart. They gave me a voice after a night when I had none.\n\nTo my friends and family, you are the silver lining of this, you keep me going. I am also so amazed and touched by the thousands of people who have expressed their outrage at what happened to me. How amazing are the people of New York City, and all over the country, to speak up in my honor. Thank you so much. I am overwhelmed by your support. I want you to know that if I could I would shake your hand, I would hug you, and I hear you. For me, public opinion will be the ultimate verdict.",

Seriously, trying to do anything in this town is bonkers; I both love and hate LA. =) So, why are we here? Because we’re bringing our upcoming team-based FPS, LawBreakers, to PS4 on August 8th (that’s right, an actual release date), and we just had to let everyone see it here at E3. So yeah, we braved the craziness to be here at E3 to have LawBreakers playable on the show floor… ON PS4 for the first time EVER. Pretty awesome to give console players a taste of the high-skill, gravity-defying combat at our booth. We’re showcasing the latest content, including recent additions: our triple-jumping Wraith Role and buzzer-beating Blitzball mode.

We built seven different prototypes during the first two years – none of them felt right. So it’s a bit of an understatement to say that we’re excited to officially announce Unto The End. It’s a game with skillful combat, featuring a non-hero protagonist and an action-crafted narrative. Underpinning it all is an effort to refine the 2D adventure-combat experience by stripping away anything that might distract the player. No HUD, no gold, no leveling, just player skill determining success. Our PS4 target is 2018. Expect to hear much more from us as we push towards our final release.

Dead Alliance lets players customize and upgrade their loadouts with an arsenal of high-powered, military-grade weapons and advanced zombie-controlling tech called zMods. These zMods can be active or passive, and examples include the Enrager, a pheromone grenade that turns a single zombie into an ally of superior strength and resistance; the PAM grenade, which puts four zombies to work for you, but does not increase their damage resistance; and the Templar, which drives zombies away from you and de-frenzies any that have been pammed by the enemy. Use these and many more zMods available in the game to get the undead to join forces with you!\n\nExtinction\n\nIron Galaxy\n\nPS4\n\nFrom time immemorial, the world has been at war.

From sun to heavy rain, every change will decisively influence the rider’s visibility and the highly-deformable ground, putting even the most expert player to the test.

  "latent_7185": "LONDON (Reuters) - British researchers have come up with a new body scanning device that gives accurate measurements and could boost online clothes shopping.\n\nShoppers are still nervous about ordering clothes online because they often do not fit and, some say, there will never be a substitute for trying something on - one reason why the boom in online retail has not had the same impact on clothing as on music, books and electronics retailing.\n\nIn the United States, for instance, the consultancy ComScore estimated that only 14 percent of online spending went on clothes and accessories in the year to June.\n\nThe new scanner is being developed by the London College of Fashion, video imaging researchers at the University of Surrey and the company Bodymetrics.\n\nThe company already has in-store scanners that use the motion sensors from Microsoft Corp’s Kinect gaming device in Bloomingdale’s (part of Macy’s Inc) in the United States, Selfridges and New Look in Britain, and Karstadt in Germany.\n\nSome firms, including Berlin-based Upcloud, are already offering home scanners that use a webcam, but the British developers say their system is able to measure in unprecedented detail.\n\nPhilip Delamore from the London College of Fashion estimates that 30 to 60 percent of clothes bought online are returned.\n\n“It’s common for online shoppers to order two or three different sizes of the same item of clothing at the same time as they’re unsure which one will fit best,” he said.\n\nWith the new system, a shopper inputs his or her height as a reference and can then take a single full-length picture with a webcam or smartphone from which all their other measurements are calculated.\n\nIt uses the measurements combined with a person’s overall proportions to build a 3D image.\n\nCombining this with sizing information from retailers, the system would also overcome the problem of variable sizing, which can mean a shopper is a “medium” in one store but a “large” in another.\n\nThe technology builds on previous work by the University of Surrey that was used to create animated characters in games like the Sims.\n\nAdrian Hilton, who is working on the technology at the University, told Reuters that while some shoppers may still enjoy the experience of browsing in stores and trying on clothes, for others an improvement in the reliability of shopping online will be welcome.\n\n“For the male market, I think we’re there,” he said.",
  "latent_7296": "This was supposed to be the year that everyone banded together to end campus sexual assault by any means necessary — even if it meant improperly branding young men across the country as rapists.\n\nThe focus on sexual assault in 2014, which began in January when President Obama announced a task force to combat the issue on college campuses, can be no coincidence. The “war on women” narrative worked quite well for President Obama and Democrats in 2012, and the 2014 midterms were expected to be challenging for the party. Combine that with the fact that young, unmarried women overwhelmingly voted for Democrats two years ago and it becomes clear why there was such an intense focus on the issue.\n\nIn April, the task force released its recommendations for colleges and universities, claiming that “one in five women is sexually assaulted in college.” That claim, based on a Justice Department study of just two universities that had a low response rate, was splashed in headlines across the country — thus beginning a media meltdown akin to the McMartin Preschool child sex abuse hysteria of the 1980s.\n\nShortly after the task force’s recommendations cited that statistic, American Enterprise Institute scholar Christina Hoff Sommers and Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler each took it apart. But the desire for action persisted, and it wasn’t until solutions to the supposed epidemic were proposed that people really started to notice just how dangerous the hype had become.\n\nIt started in July when eight U.S. senators introduced the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, which included a list of instructions for how schools should handle sexual assault but included no due process rights for students accused. At the end of September, California passed its “ yes means yes” law, which defined consent so narrowly as to make nearly all sexual activity illegal unless no one reported it as such.\n\nCriticism of that legislation, as well as tales of students railroaded by campus kangaroo courts and growing numbers of young men suing their universities for denying them due process, turned the tables on radical activists who determined that convicting more young men, regardless of innocence, was the best way to eradicate sexual assault.\n\nEven though Democrats won female voters in the midterms, it wasn’t enough to claim victory for the party or for the “war on women” narrative.\n\nFollowing Democrat losses at the polls, the remaining narrative on campus sexual assault revolved around the inability of universities to handle felonies. No matter how lofty its goals, a campus disciplinary hearing cannot be an effective place to adjudicate sexual assault. For the accusers, the best they could hope for was that the accused would be expelled, meaning he would still be walking the streets free to prey on others. For those wrongly accused based on the account of one person without any corroborating evidence or due process, the situation would be detrimental to their future and their mental health.\n\nThen came salvation for proponents of the sexual assault pandemic: A Rolling Stone story so perfectly illuminating rape culture that it read like the script for an after-school special. A woman, Jackie, was brutally gang-raped as part of a fraternity initiation at the University of Virginia. When she called her friends to help her, they seemed more concerned with their social status than the health of their friend. When she turned to her university, administrators showed little emotion and did nothing to bring her justice.\n\nActivists rallied around the story, seemingly gleeful that they had a tale to cite as representative of what was happening on campuses across the country, and anxious to impose draconian measures to alleviate the problem. Of course, a few observers pointed out that the solution being proposed to combat sexual assault wouldn’t do much help to Jackie, especially if, as was thought at the time, the university didn’t seem interested in helping her. The best she could have hoped for under these new policies was for the gang-rapists to be kicked off campus.\n\nThe story did not turn out to be as advertised. Jackie, who told Rolling Stone she had a date the night she was allegedly gang raped, made up the story about the man who supposedly took her to the frat party — even creating fake cellphone numbers and sending her friends pictures of an old high school classmate, according to three friends who said they rushed to her aid the night of the alleged attack. That night, her friends recalled, Jackie said she had been forced to perform oral sex on a group of five men. By the time the story made it into Rolling Stone, she claimed she had been gang-raped by seven men.\n\nActivists quickly tried to shift the narrative, claiming that the accuracy of Jackie’s story didn’t matter and that sexual assault really was as big a problem as they insisted. Anyone who disagreed was called a “rape apologist.”\n\nThen came another blow: The Bureau of Justice Statistics released a report showing that one in 41 women were raped or sexually assaulted while attending college, not one in five. Everyone agrees that one is too many, but some also believe that one false accusation is too many as well. Others do not, claiming that false accusations are rare (based on decades old studies or anecdotes that don’t take into account what is now being considered sexual assault). The implication being that the falsely accused don’t matter.\n\nSo, what does this mean for 2015? Next year the focus probably will continue to be on due process rights for the accused, especially given the growing number of lawsuits against universities by accused students that could move forward or be settled. And with more people realizing just how damaging the responses have been to the mythical statistic that 20 percent of women will be raped during their college years, policies may change.",
  "latent_7310": "CSIRO Parkes radio telescope has discovered around half of all known pulsars.\n\nThis article was originally published at The Conversation. The publication contributed the article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.\n\nA pulsar is a small, spinning star – a giant ball of neutrons, left behind after a normal star has died in a fiery explosion.\n\nWith a diameter of only 30 km, the star spins up to hundreds of times a second, while sending out a beam of radio waves (and sometimes other radiation, such as X-rays). When the beam is pointed in our direction and into our telescopes, we see a pulse.\n\n2017 marks 50 years since pulsars were discovered. In that time, we have found more than 2,600 pulsars (mostly in the Milky Way), and used them to hunt for low-frequency gravitational waves, to determine the structure of our galaxy and to test the general theory of relativity.\n\nRead more: At last, we've found gravitational waves from a collapsing pair of neutron stars\n\nWhat is a pulsar?\n\nThe discovery\n\nIn mid-1967, when thousands of people were enjoying the summer of love, a young PhD student at the University of Cambridge in the UK was helping to build a telescope.\n\nIt was a poles-and-wires affair – what astronomers call a \"dipole array.\" It covered a bit less than two hectares, the area of 57 tennis courts.\n\nJocelyn Bell Burnell, who discovered the first pulsar. (Image: © CC BY-SA)\n\nBy July it was built. The student, Jocelyn Bell (now Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell), became responsible for running it and analysing the data it churned out. The data came in the form of pen-on-paper chart records, more than 30 metres of them each day. Bell analysed them by eye.\n\nWhat she found – a little bit of \"scruff\" on the chart records – has gone down in history.\n\nLike most discoveries, it took place over time. But there was a turning point. On November 28, 1967, Bell and her supervisor, Antony Hewish, were able to capture a \"fast recording\" – that is, a detailed one – of one of the strange signals.\n\nIn this she could see for the first time that the \"scruff\" was actually a train of pulses spaced by one-and-a-third seconds. Bell and Hewish had discovered pulsars.\n\nBut this wasn't immediately obvious to them. Following Bell's observation they worked for two months to eliminate mundane explanations for the signals.\n\nBell also found another three sources of pulses, which helped to scotch some rather more exotic explanations, such as the idea that the signals came from \"little green men\" in extraterrestrial civilisations. The discovery paper appeared in Nature on February 24, 1968.\n\nLater, Bell missed out when Hewish and his colleague Sir Martin Ryle were awarded the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nA pulsar on 'the pineapple'\n\nCSIRO's Parkes radio telescope in Australia made its first observation of a pulsar in 1968, later made famous by appearing (along with the Parkes telescope) on the first Australian $50 note.\n\nAustralia's first $50 note featured the Parkes telescope and a pulsar. (Image: © By Source, Fair use.\n\nFifty years later, Parkes has found more than half of the known pulsars. The University of Sydney's Molonglo Telescope also played a central role, and they both remain active in finding and timing pulsars today.\n\nInternationally, one of the most exciting new instruments on the scene is China's Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST. FAST has recently found several new pulsars, confirmed by the Parkes telescope and a team of CSIRO astronomers working with their Chinese colleagues.\n\nWhy look for pulsars?\n\nWe want to understand what pulsars are, how they work, and how they fit into the general population of stars. The extreme cases of pulsars – those that are super fast, super slow, or extremely massive – help to limit the possible models for how pulsars work, telling us more about the structure of matter at ultra-high densities. To find these extreme cases, we need to find lots of pulsars.\n\nPulsars often orbit companion stars in binary systems, and the nature of these companions helps us understand the formation history of the pulsars themselves. We've made good progress with the \"what\" and \"how\" of pulsars but there are still unanswered questions.\n\nAs well as understanding pulsars themselves, we also use them as a clock. For example, pulsar timing is being pursued as a way to detect the background rumble of low-frequency gravitational waves throughout the universe.\n\nPulsars have also been used to measure the structure of our Galaxy, by looking at the way their signals are altered as they travel through denser regions of material in space.\n\nPulsars are also one of the finest tools we have for testing Einstein's theory of general relativity.\n\nRead more: Explainer: Einstein's Theory of General Relativity\n\nThis theory has survived 100 years of the most sophisticated tests astronomers have been able throw at it. But it doesn't play nicely with our other most successful theory of how the universe works, quantum mechanics, so it must have a tiny flaw somewhere. Pulsars help us to try and understand this problem.\n\nWhat keeps pulsar astronomers up at night (literally!) is the hope of finding a pulsar in orbit around a black hole. This is the most extreme system we can imagine for testing general relativity.\n\nJocelyn Bell Burnell describes how she discovered pulsars.\n\nFinally, pulsars have some more down-to-earth applications. We're using them as a teaching tool in our PULSE@Parkes program, in which students control the Parkes telescope over the Internet and use it to observe pulsars. This program has reached over 1,700 students, in Australia, Japan, China, The Netherlands, United Kingdom and South Africa.\n\nPulsars also offer promise as a navigation system for guiding craft travelling through deep space. In 2016 China launched a satellite, XPNAV-1, carrying a navigation system that uses periodic X-ray signals from certain pulsars.\n\nPulsars have changed our our understanding of the universe, and their true importance is still unfolding.\n\nGeorge Hobbs, Team leader for the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project, CSIRO; Dick Manchester, CSIRO Fellow, CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, CSIRO, and Simon Johnston, Senior research scientist, CSIRO\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

If you're really clever, you'll figure out how to apply some of the principles outlined in our Perfect Prime Rib recipe and tests on how often you should flip a burger to ensuring that your steak is cooked perfectly evenly from edge to center (hint: warm it up first, flip it over and over as it cooks). Want the ultimate in even cooking and tenderness? Try cooking it in a beer cooler, using this sous-vide steak primer for temperature guidelines.\n\nYeah, I like beef, I guess.\n\nBut, if being married has taught me anything, no matter how much of an expert you are in a given subject, there's always more to learn. Take memorizing dates, for example. Apparently just anniversaries aren't good enough—I've also got to find room in my head for birthdays. Luckily, hers falls two days before Dumpling's (which is today!). This makes it both an easy date to remember, and a very hard date to remember on time. D'oh! Happy belated birthday, dear.\n\nAnyhow, today, we move on to discuss a few more of my favorite steak related things: salting, poking, and searing, in that order.\n\nWhen to Salt Steak\n\nRead a half dozen cookbooks or listen to a half dozen celebrity chefs, and you're likely to hear at least as many different responses as to when you should salt your meat. Some claim salting immediately before putting it in the pan is best. Others opt not to salt the meat at all, instead salting the pan and placing the meat directly on top. Still others insist on salting and resting for up to a few days in advance. Who's right?\n\nTo test this, I bought myself a a half dozen thick-cut bone-in ribeyes (I love the smile butchers get in their eyes when you do this) and salted them at 10 minute intervals before searing them in a hot skillet. So the last steak went into a pan immediately after salting, while the first steak went in a full 50 minutes after salting. All of the steaks were allowed to rest at room temperature for the full 50 minutes, ensuring that they were all at the same starting temperature before cooking began.\n\nThe results? The steaks that were salted immediately before cooking and those that were salted and rested for at least 40 minutes turned out far better than those that were cooked at any point in between. What was up with those 10, 20, and 30 minute steaks?\n\nHere's what's going on.\n\nImmediately after salting the salt rests on the surface of the meat, undissolved. All the steak's juices are still inside the muscle fibers. Searing at this stage results in a clean, hard sear.\n\nthe salt rests on the surface of the meat, undissolved. All the steak's juices are still inside the muscle fibers. Searing at this stage results in a clean, hard sear. Within 3 or 4 minutes the salt, through the process of osmosis, will begin to draw out liquid from the beef. This liquid beads up on the surface of the meat. Try to sear at this point and you waste valuable heat energy simply evaporating this large amount of pooled liquid. Your pan temperature drops, your sear is not as hard, and crust development and flavor-building Maillard browning reactions are inhibited.\n\nthe salt, through the process of osmosis, will begin to draw out liquid from the beef. This liquid beads up on the surface of the meat. Try to sear at this point and you waste valuable heat energy simply evaporating this large amount of pooled liquid. Your pan temperature drops, your sear is not as hard, and crust development and flavor-building Maillard browning reactions are inhibited. Starting at around 10 to 15 minutes, the brine formed by the salt dissolving in the meat's juices will begin to break down the muscle structure of the beef, causing it to become much more absorptive. The brine begins to slowly work its way back into the meat.\n\nthe brine formed by the salt dissolving in the meat's juices will begin to break down the muscle structure of the beef, causing it to become much more absorptive. The brine begins to slowly work its way back into the meat. By the end of 40 minutes, most of the liquid has been reabsorbed into the meat. A small degree of evaporation has also occurred, causing the meat to be ever so slightly more concentrated in flavor.\n\nNot only that, but I found that even after the liquid has been reabsorbed, it doesn't stop there. As the meat continues to rest past 40 minutes, the salt and brine will slowly work their way deeper and deeper into the muscle structure, giving you built-in seasoning beyond just the outer surface you'd get from cooking right after salting or salting the skillet.\n\nIndeed, the absolute best steak I had was one that I had salted on both sides then allowed to rest on a rack overnight in the refrigerator uncovered. It appears to dry out slightly, but it's only superficial—the amount of drying that occurs from an overnight rest (about 5% moisture loss) is negligible compared to the amount of moisture driven off during cooking anyway (upwards of 20%, even more in the hard-seared edges). As the salt makes its way back into the meat, you'll probably also notice that it becomes a deeper color. That's because the dissolved proteins scatter light differently than they did when they were still whole.\n\nMoral of the story: If you've got the time, salt your meat for at least 40 minutes and up to overnight before cooking. If you haven't got 40 minutes, it's better to season immediately before cooking. Cooking the steak anywhere between three and 40 minutes after salting is the worst way to do it.\n\nSearing for the Perfect Crust\n\nThere's not all that much new ground to cover here—we all know that searing absolutely positively does not \"seal in juice,\" right? It serves as a means of adding color and flavor and enhancing texture. That's all. We also know that the absolute best way to sear is to flip your meat frequently as it cooks so that it cooks evenly from both sides, cooks faster, and develops less of the gray, overcooked zone that you get from a traditional one-side-then-the-other-side sear, right?*\n\n* See the links at the top if you don't believe me.\n\nBut what's the best medium to sear in? Butter, or oil? Some claim that a mixture of both is best, often using the excuse that butter alone has too low a smoke point—it begins to burn and turn black at temperature too low to properly sear meat in. Somehow, cutting the butter with a bit of oil is supposed to raise this smoke point. Unfortunately, that's not true. It's because when we say that \"butter is burnt,\" we're not really talking about the butter as a whole—we're talking specifically about the milk proteins in butter. The little white specks you see when you melt it. It's these milk proteins that burn when you get them too hot, and believe me—they couldn't care less whether they're being cooked in butterfat or in oil. Either way, they burn.\n\nWhat all this means is that the best cooking medium for a steak is actually plain old oil. At least to start. Adding butter to the pan just a minute or two before you finish cooking is not a bad idea. This is just enough time to allow the buttery flavor and texture (butter is creamier tasting than oil because it has a higher percentage of saturated fat) to coat the meat, but not so long that it will burn excessively, producing acrid undertones.\n\nSo for searing, let me explain. No, there is too much. Let me sum up: Get oil smoking hot in a heavy pan. Add salted and peppered steak and cook, flipping every 15 to 30 seconds until the desired internal temperature is almost reached. Add butter to the pan and continue to cook until the steak is done. Remove from pan.\n\nFollow that summary, and what you've got is a steak that's nearly perfect. What's missing, you ask?\n\nWell, assuming you like your steaks as thick as I do, there's a significant edge that sees little to no direct action during the entire searing process, and that edge is often the fattiest, most delicious part of the steak. It deserves love just as much as the next guy.\n\nHere's what you do:\n\nGot it? Good.\n\nChecking if Your Steak is Done\n\nWatch a Johsonville Brat commercial, and you'll be told that poking with a fork is one of the cardinal sins of sausage cookery, and they're right—a sausage has an impermeable casing for a reason: to keep all of those rendered fats and juices right in there with the meat. Pierce it, create a hole, and you'll see a fountain of golden juices spring forth like out of a kid after a long car ride. A steak, on the other hand, has no such casing to protect it, so is it ok to poke or not?\n\nI cooked two steaks of known weight side by side. The first, I carefully turned with tongs each time. The second, I used a fourchette de cuisine (that's fancy-pants for one of those two-pronged forks) completely indiscriminately, mercilessly (though not excessively) poking the steak this way and that as I flipped it. Afterward, I weighed both steaks again. The result? Exactly the same weight loss.\n\nThe thing is, with steaks, moisture loss is due to one thing: muscle fibers tightening due to the application of heat and squeezing out their liquid. Unless you actually manage to completely pierce or slash these muscle fibers, the moisture they lose is directly proportional to the temperature to which you cook your steak. A fork is simply not sharp enough to harm muscle fibers in any significant way. Yes, you'll see a minuscule amount of juices seeping their way out of the fork holes, but it's a really negligible amount. Indeed, that's why the many-bladed tenderizing tool known as a Jaccard is able to tenderize your meat without causing it to lose any excess moisture—it separates muscle fibers, but doesn't actually cut them or open them up.\n\nWhat about that most-shunned of techniques, the old cut-and-peek? Surely, actually slashing a cooking steak open with a knife and looking inside is going to have a detrimental affect on it, right?\n\nWell, yes and no. Yes, a knife actually severs muscle fibers, allowing them to leak their contents to the outside world. But the amount of moisture loss is really very minimal. Cut-and-peek too many times, and you run the risk of shredding your steak. In reality though, one or two peeks won't really be detectable in the end product.\n\nBut there's a bigger problem with the cut-and-peek method: It's not accurate. Because of the fact that juices get squeezed out quickly from hot meat, when you cut into the center of a still-hot steak (like one that's sitting in the pan), it'll appear to be much rarer than it really is. If you continue to cook your steak until it appears right by the cut-and-peek method, it'll be overcooked by the time you actually eat it. That thick steaks continue to rise in temperature even after being removed from the pan.\n\nWhat does that mean? It means that if you haven't yet, you should go out and get yourself a good, accurate digital thermometer, duh!\n\nNow that is a steak worth fretting over!\n\nGet the Recipe Perfect Pan-Seared Steaks View Recipe »\n\nThis post may contain links to Amazon or other partners; your purchases via these links can benefit Serious Eats.

  "latent_7559": "Photo\n\nAt 14, it was easy to like Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones. And I did. These bands were like audio-visual packages tailored explicitly for my hormone and confusion levels, spackle kits for my hole-ridden sense of self. Because straight-up, blues based rock and roll is the prima materia of teen rebellion. So it was then, and so shall it be until the end of Spotify.\n\nBeing a Yes fan, though, was something more complicated, and the death on Saturday of Chris Squire, the group’s co-founder and bassist for more than 45 years, reminded me of that.\n\nYes was a staple of prog(ressive) rock, already an established force by the time I entered high school in 1977, when airwaves were still musically integrated. Like most, I was lured by their 1971 hit “Roundabout,” that seemed to get airplay for years after its release. It was not long before I owned every album and began painstakingly copying the Roger Dean logo — the YES like a snake swallowing its own tail — on all of my notebooks.\n\nYes was based not in macho blues, but in refined classical music. It had movements, soaring melodies, plenty fancy Bach-infused keyboard and guitar passages, some nakedly suggestive of gamboling with sprites in forest glades. I did not exactly wear this on my sleeve. But as tough and bluesy as I wished to appear, this music spoke to a part of me. On the outside I was all “Street Fighting Man.” On the inside I was humming the bass line from “Total Mass Retain.”\n\nSquire, who was well known for being the band wild man, was a virtuoso of sorts who also poured a Stones-like street fighting spirit into Yes’s ethereal music, and saved many a song from descending into Hobbit-land (being human, he wasn’t always successful). Out of the mist of organ tones and castrati vocals would come a growl, disconcerting, oh-so-low, almost too low to be music, a primordial beast raising itself from the mud with a giant yawn. It was impolite, indelicate, wrong, and soon to be funky.\n\nTo better understand Squire, go ahead, listen to “Roundabout” (it’s easy now): As the intro’s slow dance between the organ and Segovia-like guitar passages finally slides into tempo Squire delivers not something refined or even vaguely British, but a mean, nasty, funky, almost Bootsy-like bass line that will not quit. It may be the only Yes song a rhythmically self-respecting person could dance to, and in my mind, the key to the song’s longevity. A conventional bass line on “Roundabout” would have doomed it, and maybe the band, to obscurity.\n\nSquire is often said to be one of the musicians who “reinvented” the bass in popular music. Like other visionary bassists, such as Scott La Faro and Charlie Haden in jazz, and at times, Paul McCartney in pop, Squire asserted his right to full expression on the instrument of his choice by ignoring the supporting role ascribed to the rhythm section in popular music.\n\nChris Squire bass lines were often melodic and beautiful, “high art” beautiful, but also rude and assertive in a way that showed me that musical expression was not uniform. It did not always pay to color inside the lines.\n\nA few years ago, I went with a high school friend to see a Yes concert (thanks, Joe). I didn’t jump out of my seat at the first notes of “Siberian Khatru” the way I used to but I enjoyed pretty much all of it. The best part, though, was Squire — tall, wild-haired, kicking his leg up on the big notes, strutting the stage like a pirate, living the dream and still nailing the lines. He seemed like a god of rock as they used to be made. Like he could have held his own in a street fight. Like he could have been hanging out later with Mick or Keith.",
  "latent_7564": "War Crime: Regime Helicopters Dropping Chlorine Barrel Bombs\n\nfirst published on October 26, 2016 by Josh\n\n2.8k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nWar Crime: Video evidence shows members of the Assad Regime dropping barrel bombs, filled with chlorine gas, on targets in Al-Lataminah, Syria.\n\nIn the past, we have underestimated the Assad Regime, and the Syrian Arab Army. We know they drop barrel bombs on locations that still contain civilians, this in and of itself is a war crime. However, recent video footage has been released that shows the regime using barrel bombs full of chlorine gas.\n\nIf you think this isn’t a big deal, you’re wrong. Here’s a quick quote from the 1917 book “Medical Diseases of the War” by Arthur Hurst, M.A., MD (Oxon), FRCP.\n\nThe first effect of inhalation of chlorine is a burning pain in the throat and eyes, accompanied by a sensation of suffocation; pain, which may be severe, is felt in the chest, especially behind the sternum. Respiration becomes painful, rapid, and difficult ; coughing occurs, and the irritation of the eyes results in profuse lachrymation. Retching is common and may be followed by vomiting, which gives temporary relief. The lips and mouth are parched and the tongue is covered with a thick dry fur. Severe headache rapidly follows with a feeling of great weakness in the legs; if the patient gives way to this and lies down, he is likely to inhale still more chlorine, as the heavy gas is most concentrated near the ground. In severe poisoning unconsciousness follows; nothing more is known about the cases which prove fatal on the field within the first few hours of the “gassing,” except that the face assumes a pale greenish yellow colour. When a man lives long enough to be admitted into a clearing station, he is conscious, but restless; his face is violet red, and his ears and finger nails blue ; his expression strained and anxious as he gasps for breath; he tries to get relief by sitting up with his head thrown back, or he lies in an exhausted condition, sometimes on his side with his head over the edge of the stretcher in order to help the escape of fluid from the lungs. His skin is cold and his temperature subnormal; the pulse is full and rarely over 100. Respiration is jerky, shallow and rapid, the rate being often over 40 and sometimes even 80 a minute ; all the auxiliary muscles come into play, the chest being over-distended at the height of inspiration and, as in asthma, only slightly less distended in extreme expiration. Frequent and painful coughing occurs and some frothy sputum is brought up. The lungs are less resonant than normal, but not actually dull, and fine riles with occasional rhonchi and harsh but not bronchial breathing are heard, especially over the back and sides.\n\nDoesn’t exactly sound like a walk in the park to me. If this video doesn’t convince you, here’s a few links you can check out about the UN accusing Syria of conducting these actions in the past before there was video evidence of it happening on the battlefield.",

REUTERS/Kym Yano, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Handout File Photo\n\nCleveland Volcano, a 5,676-foot (1,730-metre) peak on the uninhabited Chuginadak Island, about 940 miles (1,504 km) southwest of Anchorage, was raised to orange from yellow by the Alaska Volcano Observatory.\n\nThe orange code, the second-highest on the scale, is issued when a volcano is “exhibiting heightened or escalating unrest with increased potential of eruption,” according to the observatory. A red code is issued when an eruption is imminent or under way.\n\nThe observatory said that an explosion was detected on Cleveland by both infrasound and seismic data and heard by residents of Nikolski, a settlement of less than 50 people on Umnak Island about 45 miles (72 km) to the east.\n\nInfrasound instruments measure air pressure around the volcano.\n\nScientists said that cloudy weather obscured Cleveland’s peak in satellite images but that no evidence of an eruption cloud had been detected at a height of 28,000 feet (8,534.4 meters).\n\nPrevious explosions have spewed ash emissions, according to the observatory.\n\nThe volcano, named after U.S. President Grover Cleveland, is one of the most active of Alaska’s scores of volcanoes and its ash cloud could pose a threat to aircraft when it erupts.\n\nIt forms the western portion of Chuginadak Island and has been intermittently producing small lava flows and explosions since 2001, the observatory said.\n\nChuginadak Island is part of Alaska’s Aleutian archipelago, a geologically active chain of volcanic islands that is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and is very prone to earthquakes.\n\nEarlier this year Mount Pavlof on the Alaska Peninsula erupted with little advanced warning, spewing an ash cloud up to 20,000 feet (6,096 meters) high that prompted aviation warnings across the region.\n\nPavlof is currently at yellow on the alert scale, meaning that it is “exhibiting signs of elevated unrest” but not erupting, according to the observatory.\n\nThe Alaska Volcano Observatory is a joint program of the U.S. Geological Survey, the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the State of Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys.",
  "latent_7856": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed into law legislation completing the annexation of Crimea, calling it a \"remarkable event.\"\n\nThe Kremlin signing ceremony took place after the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament, voted unanimously to incorporate the Crimea region into Russia. The lower house ratified the treaty on Thursday, just four days after Crimean residents voted in a referendum to break away from Ukraine and join Russia.\n\nPresident Putin and Crimean leaders signed the treaty on Tuesday, and the Kremlin said the treaty came into force on the date it was signed.\n\nIn a meeting Friday with his advisory Security Council, Mr Putin said for now, Russia will hold off on imposing sanctions on the United States in retaliation for U.S. sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis.\n\nHowever, his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters separately that Russia will respond in kind to the latest U.S. sanctions, which target Russian officials and members of President Putin's inner circle. \"We will respond every time,\" Peskov said.\n\nAnd the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday that Russia will \"respond harshly\" to the latest round of U.S. sanctions.\n\nU.N.

On Thursday, Mr. Ban met with President Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. Mr. Ban said he urged the Russian leader to prevent \"any unintended incident\" in or near Ukraine that could aggravate tensions in the volatile region.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama announced further sanctions against Russia. Speaking at the White House, Mr. Obama said he is penalizing more individuals and a bank involved in Russia's occupation of the Black Sea peninsula. Earlier, the United States limited travel and the economic activity of several key Russians involved in the Crimea takeover.\n\nThe president also said he is considering more penalties to entire sectors of the Russian economy, as well as specific individuals. He said those plans are being formulated in conjunction with European allies.\n\nIn Brussels, meanwhile, European Union leaders added 12 people -- all Russian or Crimean -- to a list of those subject to travel bans and asset freezes. The new names were not immediately released, but the move raises the number of people subject to EU sanctions to 33.\n\nMoscow retaliated against the U.S. sanctions with travel bans on nine Americans, including Republican Senator John McCain, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner.\n\nIn another development, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke for nearly an hour with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. A Pentagon spokesman says Hagel asked why Russian troops are deploying along Ukraine's eastern southern borders. The spokesman said Hagel was assured that the troops are conducting maneuvers and have no plans to enter Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian officials say armed pro-Russian forces seized three Ukrainian warships in Crimea's Sevastopol Bay Thursday.\n\nUkraine authorities said Tuesday that Kyiv has drawn up plans to evacuate Crimea, and will seek U.N. support in turning the peninsula into a demilitarized zone.

  "latent_7930": "HAINES — Nattaphon \"Ice\" Wangyot dressed like a girl long before she moved to Haines.\n\nBut when her mother, Tukta Panyawong, brought her from Thailand in August 2014, Ice wasn't sure how a rural Alaska town of roughly 2,500 would react to her identification as transgender. Born male, she reverted to dressing like a boy.\n\n\"I should make myself like everybody (else),\" Ice remembers thinking at the time. After one or two months, she couldn't take it anymore. \"I would like to show up, and I don't care what people are going to say, because I want to be myself.\"\n\nIce is 18 now and graduated from Haines High School this month. She's tall and slim, with caramel-colored skin, high cheekbones and sleek, shoulder-length black hair.\n\nIce spoke little English when she moved to Haines but has been picking it up.\n\nWhen she was a first-grader in Bangkok, Ice started to express an interest in makeup, dancing and dresses. Ice knew she wanted to be a girl, but as she grew older, she suppressed her femininity to appease her traditional grandmother.\n\nTukta found out her daughter was transgender in a very modern way: through Facebook. When Ice was 10, she posted a photo of herself in girls shorts, striking a very feminine pose with a friend. \"I forgot I was friends with my mom on Facebook,\" she said.\n\nIt took Tukta a while to wrap her head around what she saw in the photo. Ice's grandmother had also gotten wind of the image and phoned Tukta.\n\n\"My mother called me and said, 'What are you going to do with that?'\" Tukta said. \"She wants Ice to be a boy. In her mind, he (is) a boy. You cannot be a girl. And this is hard for me, for Ice, for everybody.\"\n\nBut Tukta realized it wasn't her choice to tell Ice what she could or could not be. \"You are a mom. You give birth to a boy, and you expect to have a boy. But for me, I think the world (has to be) open. I couldn't do anything. I can raise her only (in) body, not her heart, her mind.\"\n\n\"What you have to do is be a good person, do good grades, make me proud,\" Tukta told her daughter.\n\nTukta grew up in Thailand and gave birth to Ice when she was 19. She ran away from home due to a difficult relationship with her mother, and divorced Ice's father a year later. As a single mother, she worked long hours in restaurants to provide for her family and consequently missed parts of Ice's childhood.\n\nTukta moved from Thailand to Haines when she was 28. Ice stayed behind and lived with her grandmother while her mother worked to earn enough money to show the government she could support bringing her daughter over.\n\nAn ocean apart, Ice would call her mother crying, which Tukta said \"made her heart drop.\"\n\nTukta earned the money she needed and brought Ice to Haines late in the summer of 2014. Though Ice had started consistently dressing as a girl when she was 12, she switched back to boys clothes at school for a couple months before deciding to test the waters with a black skirt, red sweater and boots.\n\n\"All the people kept looking at me,\" Ice said. \"(I thought) 'Am I doing something wrong?' I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just dressing (like) a girl.\"\n\nStudents didn't ask her about the change in appearance and continued to be friendly and respectful, Ice said. The same went for the teachers.\n\n\"I feel like they support me and help me with everything,\" she said.\n\nPara-educator Suzanne Newton, who has traveled with Ice over the past two years for school activities, said she would describe Ice as gentle, confident and open-minded.\n\n\"I am kind of in awe of her,\" Newton said. \"We've had a lot of long conversations and I look at her and think, 'What an amazing young woman.'\"\n\nNewton, who coached cheerleading last year, said Ice would often spend time with her squad when they traveled throughout Southeast. (Ice played a baritone horn in the pep band.)\n\n\"She liked to come over and sit and talk to the cheerleaders, so she kind of hung with us and watched movies. She was just really a lot of fun,\" Newton said.\n\nIce is also very straightforward, Newton noted. \"When people question her, she answers. She doesn't hide. Whether negative or positive things come at her, she accepts both and just goes, 'OK.'\"\n\nLast fall, Ice decided to join the high school volleyball team. In Thailand, she played on the girls team. She nervously approached school secretary Lori Giddings to ask if that would be possible in Haines too.\n\n\"I asked Lori, 'Can I play volleyball with them?' And then I got afraid about she's going to say no. But (she said), 'Yeah, Ice, you can play volleyball, but you should talk to the coach.'\"\n\nAbout a year ago, the Alaska School Activities Association began discussing how transgender students would be accommodated in interscholastic athletics.\n\n\"They kind of refused to take a firm stand, and what they have determined is basically that each individual school district will have to make a decision about transgender (students),\" said school superintendent Rich Carlson.\n\nThe only caveat the ASAA had was that a student could not change gender identification during their high school career.\n\nIn October, Ice and Tukta sat down with principal Rene Martin and developed guidelines and policy regarding use of bathrooms, showers and other travel logistics.\n\n\"As we were developing the policy, we met with all the staff and basically (said), 'You may or may not agree with this, but we're going to do this professionally, with dignity and with care.' And I think the staff has really done that,\" Carlson said.\n\nAccording to the school's formal policy, district programs and activities must be free from discrimination with respect to gender identity. \"For the purposes of gender identification for interscholastic activities, the district will consider the gender identity based on the student's consistent declaration of gender identity, their actions, attitude, dress and mannerisms,\" the policy reads.\n\n\"Everybody doesn't understand, and that's OK,\" said principal Martin. \"But you still have to show respect, and we work together and we talk about things and we try to make it respectful for everybody.\"\n\nIce said she uses a single-occupancy bathroom at the school and arranges for shower time when the other stalls aren't in use, while a coach makes sure nobody will interrupt.\n\nSophomore Gabi Miller played volleyball with Ice this year.\n\n\"We would hang out and talk, and I heard about her story and stuff like that. It's pretty inspiring to hear because not a lot of people go through what she has gone through, what she is going through,\" Miller said.\n\nWhen asked if it makes a difference to her knowing Ice is transgender, Miller replied, \"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Even if she wasn't (transgender), it's not a big deal to me. I care about her no matter what,\" Miller said. \"I've seen a couple people that aren't as accepting, but for the most part people do accept her and they do care about her.\"\n\nAfter volleyball season, Ice joined the basketball team and is now participating in track, where she is drawing attention because of her success. She competes in the 100- and 200-meter dashes, and recently ranked seventh and fourth statewide, respectively.\n\nSuperintendent Carlson said he has received some complaints about Ice competing on the girls track team. Carlson expects the issue will draw additional scrutiny because of the heightened level of competition at regional and state competitions in Juneau and Anchorage.\n\n\"There's no question that this is going to come out in the next week or two simply because (Ice) is doing really well in track. And we're going to support that,\" Carlson said.\n\nIce said she personally hasn't heard from anyone objecting to her participation on the girls teams, including track.\n\n\"I have a lot of friends from Sitka too, so they have fun with me and they support me. I have friends everywhere because we met in volleyball and basketball,\" she said.\n\nIce said she thinks she is getting more attention for being transgender on the track team because it's an individual sport, unlike volleyball and basketball. \"They think transgender, like me, is a boy, and (when) the boy plays with the girl, who's going to win?\"\n\nBut Ice said she doesn't have an advantage over the other girls who are competing. She takes female hormones and additional drugs to suppress her body's testosterone.\n\n\"The people who are going to think, 'It's not fair to play with the boys' — well, you don't know that. It's not easy,\" she said. \"It's not like I wake up and 'OK, I'm a girl right now.'\"\n\nTrack coach Keri Ewing said Ice has been \"great to work with.\" She qualified for the state track and field meet scheduled for Friday and Saturday in Anchorage.\n\nIce said she wants to support other Alaska transgender students and encourage them to participate in activities.\n\nTukta said she hopes her daughter – by publicly speaking about her experience – will embolden transgender students and set an example of acceptance for other Alaska schools to follow.\n\n\"You don't have to be afraid,\" Tukta said. \"If you are transgender, you should be yourself. There's nothing wrong. You're still human. You're a good person.\"",

  "latent_8241": "Adil Charkaoui (in Arabic عادل الشرقاوي born 1974) is a Morocco-born Canadian citizen who was arrested by the Canadian government under a security certificate in May 2003.[1]\n\nBefore issuing the certificate, evidence was submitted that he had trained in an anti-Soviet Jihadist camp in Afghanistan. The court was also not satisfied with his reasons for visiting Pakistan for six months in 1990. Evidence that he practiced Karate was also among the submissions. Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) testimonies included opinions that he would also \"have been trained in such areas as: operating rocket-propelled grenade-launchers, sabotage, urban and assassination.\" CSIS also alleged that \"[i]t was noteworthy that one of those who participated in the hijacking of [the September 11 attacks in 2001] had taken martial arts training in preparation...\" and suggested that Charkaoui represented a sleeper agent.[2] This led to the issuance of the security certificate by the two responsible government ministers after which he was detained, and such evidence was also enough to uphold the certificate by Federal Court upon review.\n\nPersonal history [ edit ]\n\nBorn in Morocco in 1973, Charkaoui joined his sister and parents in moving to Montreal, Quebec in 1995.[3] He has been a Canadian citizen since July 2014.[4][5]\n\nCharkaoui graduated with an MA from Université de Montréal and is an Arabic-language teacher, who now styles himself as a sheik,[6] and an imam.[7] He is married and has three children, and is a combat sport group leader, as well as a skilled backwoodsman.[7] He is also the director at the Centre communautaire islamique Assahaba.[3][7] Charkaoui is the President of the Quebec Collective Against Islamophobia,[8][9][10] an advocacy rights group he established in 2013.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Charkaoui associated with hard-line Montreal Muslims who had turned up in Bosnia, Afghanistan, the Sudan, and other violence-prone areas.[11]\n\nIn 1998, he flew to Pakistan to study religion for a book he was hoping to write;[12] the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) believes he slipped across the border into Afghanistan and attended Khalden training camp under the name Zubeir Al-Magrebi, although he denies the allegation.[13] According to friends, he knew Raouf Hannachi well enough that the two would \"shake hands when they crossed paths\".[13]\n\nThe government later stated that he had not accounted for \"a period of his life, from 1992 to the end of that decade\".[2]\n\nArrest and release [ edit ]\n\nAdil Charkaoui is represented in a 2004 protest outside the Toronto office of CSIS.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, Charkaoui operated a Montreal pizzeria, where the CSIS first approached him in the wake of 9/11. He refused to account for his whereabouts or reason for travel to Pakistan. Moroccan authorities stated that Charkaoui provided funds and resources to an Islamic insurgent group.[11]\n\nCharkaoui was arrested under a security certificate in May 2003, which was co-signed by Solicitor General Wayne Easter, and Immigration Minister Denis Coderre.[14] He was detained without charge or trial in Rivière des prairies Detention Centre. The Coalition Justice for Adil Charkaoui was formed in defense of his rights, with Coalition launching a campaign for his release.\n\nHe was released from prison on C$50,000 bail on 18 February 2005. His bail conditions included a curfew, electronic monitoring, designated chaperones for leaving his home, restriction to the island of Montreal, 24-hour police access to his home without warrant, and a prohibition on access to the internet, on the use of cell phones and on the use of any telephone except the one in his home.\n\nNot long after his release, Charkaoui unsuccessfully tried to help Bloc Quebecois candidate Apraham Niziblian defeat Coderre in the Canadian federal election, 2006, saying:[15]\n\n“ It's not a question of being anti-Coderre. We are citizens before anything, we have the right to have political ideas and to have choice. Gone is the time when the Liberals could take the ethnic vote for granted. ”\n\nRestrictions on his conditional release were gradually lifted to be cancelled in September 2009.[9] A helpful timeline of his arrest and events subsequent was produced by The Globe and Mail,[16] on his final release order by Federal Court Judge Danièle Tremblay-Lamer: \"There will be an order all conditions be revoked immediately.\"[11]\n\nCharkaoui opened on 22 February 2010 a $24.5 million lawsuit against the Canadian government in Quebec Superior Court in which he demanded compensation for wrongful arrest and detention. He sent a letter asking for an apology, Canadian citizenship and compensation for lost income and legal fees after a federal judge quashed a security certificate against him. Past federal ministers Denis Coderre and Wayne Easter, Diane Finley and Stockwell Day were named in the suit.[17][18]\n\nDefender of unpopular causes [ edit ]\n\nIn August 2013, Charkaoui defended the right of two foreign Islamic hate-preachers to spread their message in Montreal, even if they held sexist and misogynist views of women in society. Citing security concerns, the event was cancelled by the convention centre where it was supposed to be held. Charkaoui maintained that it was Islamophobia to ban their visit to Canada.[5]\n\nActivities at Collège de Maisonneuve [ edit ]\n\nFor a time prior to 2015, Charkaoui rented classroom space every Sunday from Collège de Maisonneuve, a Montreal Cegep near the Olympic Stadium, for Muslim education and Arabic language studies,[6] which he calls l'École des compagnons.[7] Charkaoui also rented classroom space at the nearby Collège de Rosemont, also a Cegep.[7] It was reported in February 2015 that six of his young students had absconded to Syria, allegedly with intent to join an Islamic terrorist group, either ISIS or the Nusra Front.[6] Of these, four students were following his guidance at the de Maisonneuve location, and at least one teenager, Mohammed Rifaat, he knew through the Rosemont location.[7]\n\nBefore the week was out, Charkaoui threatened to sue both Colleges because they had terminated the arrangements under which he leased the classroom spaces.[7][10] At a press conference, he deemed the termination unacceptable and dishonest.[10]\n\nAn interview of Charkaoui by ICI RDI's Anne-Marie Dussault sparked quite a bit of controversy the following week.[19] Dressed in a djellaba, Charkaoui presented himself as a victim and rejected calls for him to condemn violent jihadism and the Islamist project.[20] Instead he accused occidental politicians of promoting violence against Muslims in a degenerate, Islamophobic culture.[20] Charkaoui maintained that ISIS was a creature of the US government, and on his website he hyperlinks to other websites that offer praise of Osama bin Laden.[20] He rejects any interference of the wider community in which he lives on his religious rights; he finds this argument to be nefarious.[20] One commentator was shocked because of what his position meant in the context of his pedagogical pursuits.[20]\n\nCourt challenges to security certificate [ edit ]\n\nCharkaoui has consistently denied the allegations against him and has challenged the legitimacy of the security certificate regime. Canadian authorities and the Federal Court have refused to disclose the case against Charkaoui, relying on provisions in the security certificate process that allow evidence to be kept from the defence and the public.\n\nCharkaoui's certificate has not undergone a court review and thus has not been upheld. The case has been suspended since March 2005, pending a new decision on protection by the Minister of Immigration.\n\nCharkaoui has been at the centre of a public campaign against the extension of state power in the name of the \"war on terror\". In February 2006, Amnesty International reminded Canada, \"His fundamental right to liberty and security of the person accords him the right to due process or release from the restrictive bail conditions that have been imposed on him.\"\n\nIn February 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision of Charkaoui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) on the appeals Charkaoui, Hassan Almrei, and Mohamed Harkat. The Court ruled that the certificate process violated sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and struck down the security certificate legislation (sections 33 and 77 to 85 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act). However, the judgment will not take effect for one year.\n\nIn March 2007, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a second challenge by Charkaoui, this time relating to the destruction of evidence in Charkaoui's case. Government lawyers revealed in January 2005 that CSIS had destroyed evidence in Charkaoui's file. The situation raised concerns about the accuracy of the secret evidence before the court. The Supreme Court will hear the challenge in January 2008.\n\nIn April 2007, Charkaoui submitted a leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in a third challenge; in this instance to the law permitting deportation of non-citizens when there is a risk of torture. The Canadian government's position is that legal safeguards against being sent to torture do not apply to people who are subject to a security certificate, basing this policy on their interpretation of the 2002 Supreme Court Suresh decision. Charkaoui is challenging the legal framework permitting deportation to torture, the lack of due process, as well as the fact of being subject to the threat of deportation to torture and excessive procedural delays.\n\nA CSIS agent identified only as J.P., the Deputy Chief of Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation in the Ottawa Regional Office as of 2005, testified against the petitions for release by Hassan Almrei, Mahmoud Jaballah and Charkaoui.[21]\n\nIn June 2008, Charkaoui managed to have the Supreme Court of Canada overturn as unconstitutional the security certificate. The ruling is known as Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2008 SCC 38. CSIS was ordered by the SCC to stop destroying its tapes and notes in terrorism investigations. For the previous 25 years CSIS had interpreted their constitutional law as obliging the destruction of such records - a procedure that largely kept CSIS intelligence out of open court - but this was ruled by the SCC a fundamental mistake. Given spies were becoming closer to police in the post-9/11 world, they had to disclose their investigations just like police do. The judges ruled \"The only appropriate remedy is to confirm the duty to disclose Charkaoui's entire file to the designated judge and, after the judge has filtered it, to Charkaoui and his counsel.\"[11]\n\nIn motions filed the next summer in Federal Court, lawyers arguing for CSIS said it could not abide by such vast disclosure without jeopardizing its source and methods, which CSIS considers the lifeblood of national security. The Crown pulled all of the wiretaps it used against Charkaoui, and half of its human sources, leaving it with insufficient evidence to meet the security certificate's test that there is a \"reasonable suspicion\" that Charkaoui is a threat to Canadian national-security. The judgment proceeded accordingly in September 2009.[11]\n\nIn May 2013 federal prosecutors produced evidence that Charkaoui may have been plotting a terrorist attack in the Montreal metro in 2002. The memo also mentions CSIS surveillance where Charkaoui was spotted stealing valuables from parked cars.[22]\n\nAhmed Ressam withdraws his allegations [ edit ]\n\nFabrice de Pierrebourg of the Journal de Montreal testified in Federal Court on 22 August 2007 that, in correspondence, Ahmed Ressam had withdrawn his allegations against Adil Charkaoui;[23] the former had written to the latter, who is also known as the Millennium Bomber for his failed plot to bomb LAX airport,[11] in the course of writing a book about terrorism in Montreal.\n\nRessam was convicted in the United States and held under an unusual arrangement whereby he was offered a reduced sentence in exchange for information. Under this arrangement, over a period of some years, he fingered 130 people as \"members\" of the \"extremist Islamist network linked to Bin Laden\". Two cases in the United States were dismissed after Ressam's evidence proved worthless. Earlier in Charkaoui's case, Charkaoui's lawyer introduced an arrest warrant for Ahmed Ressam for an incident that occurred in Montreal at a time when Ressam claimed, under oath in another case, to have been in a training camp in Afghanistan. Ressam is known to have suffered a mental breakdown while in prison.\n\nAfter learning that Mr. Ressam was supposed to have named him, Charkaoui repeatedly asked to be able to cross-examine him in court, but the motion was not granted.\n\nIn the original charges against Charkaoui, two government ministers mistakenly referred to martial arts having been used by a hijacker aboard \"American Airlines Flight 93\", a mistaken reference likely meant to refer to United Airlines 93 or American Airlines Flight 11.[2]",

  "latent_8573": "In space, no one can hear you second-guess yourself. And you'll be doing a lot of that in Out There, which launches today on iOS and Android. It's a game that has you exploring the furthest reaches of space in order to get back home, with nothing to get you there but your ship, whatever resources you can scrounge along the way, a bit of quick thinking, and hopefully some luck. You'll constantly have to make tough choices — when your ship is low on fuel, do you travel to a new star system to find more, or risk destroying your ship to skim some energy from a nearby star? Out There originated with a near-universal obsession: like many of us, the game's developers are fascinated by space, and the vastness it entails.\n\n\"The thing is,\" says artist and programmer Michael Peiffert, \"it offers nothing but death.\"\n\nOut There puts you in the space boots of a stranded engineer. While on a routine trip to Jupiter, you awaken from a cryogenic sleep to find yourself in an unknown part of the universe. It's sort of like Star Trek: Voyager, except you're all by yourself. Your only real goal is to get back home.\n\nThe actual game plays out sort of like a strategy game mixed with a choose-your-own-adventure novel. You'll travel from one star to the next, and each one will feature different planets and other objects orbiting it. You can send probes to gas giants in order to collect fuel and mine terrestrial planets in search of useful minerals. Some planets also have life, letting you briefly interact with strange alien creatures, and every so often you'll stumble across abandoned ships so you can upgrade your ride to something bigger and better. The strategy elements are relatively simple, but force you to deal with very limited supplies: your ship can only hold so much at one time, and your fuel, oxygen, and ship's hull are constantly being depleted as you explore.\n\nYou have to deal with very limited supplies\n\nIt sounds simple enough, but Out There constantly throws random events at you, which can both help and hinder your plans to get home. You might stumble across a massive space worm, for instance, and have to decide whether to blast out of there or follow its trail to learn more about it. There's an obvious risk in most of these decisions, but they can also come with unexpected payoffs. You might discover a useful new technology by investigating an abandoned library, or you might take serious damage when you get caught in an asteroid field. Sometimes you don't actually get a choice: when something smashes into your ship, you'll simply have to figure out how to repair it and move on.\n\nThe fact that these scenarios — there are around 300 events in total — pop up randomly is what makes the game so interesting. There's no set path through Out There. Each time you play you'll see different planets, meet different aliens, and experience different random events. As you learn how the game works you'll become better accustomed to dealing with these scenarios, but their random nature makes the game challenging in every playthrough. \"We tried to put the player in situations where he must decide between taking risks to explore or running away from a certain death,\" says Peiffert. You'll also get a score after each game, so you can compete with friends as you would in a puzzle game like Threes.\n\nOut There is also, perhaps surprisingly, an ideal mobile game. You'll die a lot — sometimes in a matter of a few minutes — but this just makes you want to hop back in and try to do things differently and better the next time. When you die, it's almost always the result of a bad decision you made. The game manages to capture that amazing feeling of being alone in space, but packages it in a way that makes it satisfying even in quick bursts. Every time you play the hope is to get a little further than last time, and the wonderful, comic book-style art will only make you want to explore further. The alien and ship designs in the game are fantastic and though you'll spot some distracting spelling and grammatical errors, the writing does a good job of pulling you into the world.\n\nThe game will be coming to Windows and Mac later on as well, and the developers are also planning to expand on the fictional universe with future updates later in the year. \"We have interesting ideas we would like to explore,\" Peiffert says. In the meantime, you'll need to figure out how to stay alive long enough to actually see the end. After playing the game for days, I still haven't made it home.",

They burned kerosene fuel and hydrogen peroxide. Their construction was based on a common combustion chamber design, used either singly or in clusters of up to eight.\n\nThey were developed by Armstrong Siddeley in Coventry, which later became Bristol Siddeley in 1959, and finally Rolls-Royce in 1966.[7]\n\nEngine static testing was carried out at High Down Rocket Test Site, near The Needles on the Isle of Wight ( ).[8][9] (Spadeadam in Cumbria wasn't used for testing until Blue Streak, after Gamma).\n\nAdvantages of kerosene / peroxide engines [ edit ]\n\nUse of kerosene / hydrogen peroxide engines has been a particularly British trait in rocket development, there being few comparable engines (such as the LR-40) from the USA.[10]\n\nThe combustion of kerosene with hydrogen peroxide is given by the formula\n\nCH 2 + 3H 2 O 2 → CO 2 + 4H 2 O\n\nwhere CH 2 is the approximate formula of kerosene (see RP-1 for a discussion of kerosene rocket fuels). This compares with the combustion of kerosene and liquid oxygen (LOX)\n\nCH 2 + 1.5O 2 → CO 2 + H 2 O\n\nshowing that the exhaust from kerosene / peroxide is predominantly water. This results in a very clean exhaust (second only to cryogenic LO 2 /LH 2 ) and a distinctive clear flame.[11] The low molecular mass of water also helps to increase rocket thrust performance.[12]\n\nThe oxidiser used with Gamma was 85% high-test peroxide (HTP), H 2 O 2 . Gamma used a silver-plated on nickel-gauze catalyst to first decompose the peroxide.[13] For higher concentrations of H 2 O 2 another catalyst would have been required, such as platinum. No ignition source was required since the very hot decomposed H 2 O 2 is hypergolic (will spontaneously combust) with kerosene. Due to the high ratio (8:1) of the mass of H 2 O 2 used compared to the kerosene, and also its superior heat characteristics, the H 2 O 2 may also be used to regeneratively cool the engine nozzle before combustion. Any pre-combustion chamber used to power the pump turbines needs only to decompose H 2 O 2 to provide the energy. This gives the efficiency advantages of closed cycle operation, without its usual major engineering problems.\n\nAll of these characteristics lead to kerosene / hydrogen peroxide engines being simpler and more reliable to construct than other liquid propellant chemistries. Gamma had a remarkably reliable service record for a rocket engine. Of the 22 Black Knight and 4 Black Arrow launchers, involving 128 Gamma engines, there were no engine failures.[12]\n\nStentor [ edit ]\n\nThe Gamma began as the smaller cruise chamber of the two-chamber Stentor rocket engine produced by Armstrong Siddeley for the Blue Steel stand-off missile.[14]\n\nGamma 201 [ edit ]\n\nBristol-Siddeley developed this stand-alone four-chamber engine from 1955 to 1957 for the Black Knight test vehicles.[15] Gamma 201 was used for the first twelve Black Knight launches (14 in total), Gamma 301 for most of the later flights.[16]\n\nThe initial Black Knight vehicles were single-stage rockets designed to test prototype re-entry heads for the proposed Blue Streak strategic ballistic missile. Testing of the Black Knight began at Woomera, Australia in 1958, but the Blue Streak project was cancelled in 1960. The rockets continued to be tested until 1965, as part of a planned two-stage space launcher, using the Gamma 201 for the first stage until August 1962, when it was replaced by the more powerful Gamma 301.[17][18][19][20][21][23][24][25][26][27]\n\nGamma 301 [ edit ]\n\nThis was basically the same as the Gamma 201, but had automatic mixture-ratio control for improved thrust.[28] There were nine initial test firings of the Gamma 301 engine at High Down from 16 April to 31 May 1957, all of which were largely successful. Black Knight launches BK16 and BK18 used the Gamma 301. These two were the beginning of the Project Dazzle high-speed re-entry vehicle trials, where a solid fuel Cuckoo was mounted pointing downwards in the second stage, so as to increase re-entry speeds. Eight Gamma 301 launches were made in total.[16]\n\nGamma 2 / Double Gamma [ edit ]\n\nA two chamber version of Gamma, used for the second stage of the Black Arrow satellite launch vehicle. As the only Gamma not required to operate at sea level, the nozzles were extended to allow better expansion.[18][29]\n\nGamma 8 [ edit ]\n\nThis was an 8 chamber development of Gamma, used for the first stage of the Black Arrow satellite launch vehicle. Gamma thrust chambers were mounted in pairs radially, each pair on a one-axis tangential gimbal. Collective movement gave roll control, differential movement pitch.[29]\n\nGallery [ edit ]\n\nBristol Siddeley Gamma rocket engines\n\nGamma 201 engine behind a Black Knight re-entry vehicle\n\nGamma 2 rocket engine, used on the Black Arrow 2nd stage\n\nThe recovered remains of Stage 1 of the Black Arrow R3 rocket, successfully launched from the Woomera Rocket Range in October 1971.",

Check back to see who’s #1!\n\nThese are Ultiworld’s 2014 College Open Division preseason Power Rankings. You can always check the latest rankings by clicking on the tab in the navigation bar.\n\n***\n\n25. Ohio: After a peak year that saw Mitch Cihon and Connor Haley pack the stats columns at the College Championships, Ohio is in for a tougher haul. Cihon has graduated, though Haley is considering a fifth year. Will some new stars rise to the occasion?\n\n24. Cornell: Metro East teams never cracked the Ultiworld Top 25 last year, but Cornell is looking strong this season. Jake Stevelman returns for his 2nd year captaining and the always well-rounded team adds some weapons in Joe Thompson (2012 1st team All-Region, FOTY at Syracuse) and Matt Chun, a top O line cutter that took last year off.\n\n23. Georgia: Elliot Erickson (Chain Lightning) is back for Jojah, which is otherwise a team dealing with a lot of turnover this season. But the depth of their program should keep them in the mix in the Southeast as usual.\n\n22. Iowa: After scoring the biggest upset at Regionals last season, Iowa will look to extend that into a return to Nationals this year. Jake Kersten is going to be a matchup nightmare for everyone this season.\n\n21. UNC-Wilmington: The Seamen lose captain Tommy Lamar, but return a strong cast of athletic role players. Robert Goode, who was already strong last year, should be a force this season.\n\n20. Florida State: FSU loses top playmakers Ben Stringer and Jordan Huston, but 2nd year captain Chris Larocque (who did this last year) is back. They will likely be battling Florida again for a berth at Nationals; will they have enough firepower to make it back to Nationals for the 2nd year in a row?\n\n19. Luther: The surprise qualifier out of the North Central last season is only going to get better this year after not losing a single player to graduation. Josh Johnson is one of the country’s best players.\n\n18. Stanford: Although Ben Funk moves on, Stanford has always been known for its depth. Cody Mills should be 1st team All-Region talent this season and hopes to lead Bloodthirsty back to the show.\n\n17. Washington: Khalif El-Salaam will look to soften the blow of the departure of Duncan Linn as the Sundodgers try to make it to their fourth straight College Championships. Some strong incoming talent should help their efforts.\n\n16. Arizona: Sunburn hopes to get back out to a hot start like they did in 2013 with Callahan nominee and Southwest POTY Brice Dixon leading the squad. Can you say diamond zone?\n\n15. UC Davis: Nobody saw Davis coming last year, but they exploded late in the season and made their way into the quarterfinals thanks to strong coaching and brilliant play from Eli Kerns, who returns this season. With great returning depth, they will be the frontrunner in the Southwest this year.\n\n14. Dartmouth: Although Dartmouth loses their top playmaker Ian Engler, the team has been developing some great players who should help fill his shoes. Steady coaching from Brook Martin will keep this team near the top of the New England Region.\n\n13. Florida: Last year’s Florida team was very young and still almost made it to Nationals. With a year of experience and Bobby Ley (Florida United), a player to build around, in his junior year, they hope to rise back to supremacy in the Southeast.\n\n12. Texas A&M: Texas A&M couldn’t quite do enough last season to bring home a third bid for the South Central, but this year’s team should be up to the challenge. They bring back Dalton Smith and Matt Bennett, one of the Region’s best duos, and will be better prepared to clash with the nation’s best.\n\n11. Tufts: One of the most consistent programs in the Northeast will be looking to bounce back after a disappointing 2013 campaign left them out of Nationals (after making semis at the Stanford Invite!). Gene Buonaccorsi and Carter Thallon will pace their 2014 efforts.\n\n10. Harvard: Jeremy Nixon has been on fire in the early season and rookie John Stubbs will make an immediate impact for Red Line, who will be the favorite to repeat as New England champions. Harvard just beat Tufts in the finals of Huck A Hunk, a bellwether Northeast tournament.\n\n9. Carleton: Few teams have the consistency of Carleton, so despite losing some outstanding talent (including Simon Montague and Nick Stuart), they will still be near the top by May. They will look to Justin Lim and Jesse Bolton to step into larger roles.\n\n8. Wisconsin: Every year, Wisconsin turns a fresh set of rookies into serious contributors. Though they lose Callahan nominee Brian Hart, Colin Camp, their MVP at the 2013 College Championships, is back. Fifth year Jordan O’Neill will be their primary option downfield on offense.\n\n7. Pittsburgh: Pitt won’t be the same without Tyler Degirolamo and Alex Thorne running the show on offense, but they still have great depth and an outstanding program. Marcus Ranii-Dropcho is ready for stardom as a rookie class highlighted by Jonah Wisch (Spinners) will make key contributions.\n\n6. Minnesota: Grey Duck will be looking to start with a clean slate after a devastating performance at North Central Regionals last year left them out of Madison. Josh Klane (Sub Zero) is going to be one of the college division’s most dangerous throwers. With the lightning fast Reese Hornnes returning from an ACL tear that kept him out all of last season, Minnesota is set for a big year.\n\n5. Texas: Will Driscoll and Mitchell Bennett are both back for TUFF, meaning that the team will lose hardly anyone from their 2013 iteration. That will make for a dangerous 2014 team — one that will be better prepared to get into the bracket at Nationals.\n\n4. Colorado: Much like the Doublewide/Johnny Bravo roster battle this year, Colorado matches Texas step for step by bringing back a huge lineup of superstars: Jimmy Mickle, Tim Morrissy, Hidde Sneider, and more. With the keys to the offense handed over to the team’s younger players and the Bravo contingent leading the defense, Mamabird is poised for a return to the top of the college division.\n\n3. Oregon: 2013 Callahan winner Dylan Freechild is back with Ego this season and hopes to lead the team to a Nationals title, not just a #1 seed. No Aaron Honn (studying abroad) could make things challenging for Oregon, but they have a very deep bench. A retooling of the offense could be just what the team needs to break through past semis.\n\n2. North Carolina: With one of the premier defenses in the country plus a very dangerous Christian Johnson leading the way on offense, UNC is poised for their best season in years. They do graduate Callahan nominee Tristan Green, but it was Johnson (10G, 16A) who was the MVP at Nationals for Darkside last year. A big, strong, physical team, UNC won’t be happy with anything less than a semifinals appearance this season.\n\n1. Central Florida: So often in ultimate, you have to get to the big game before you win it. That’s good news for Central Florida, who played one of the best games of the 2013 College Championships in their win over Carleton in the semifinals before crumbling against Pittsburgh in the finals. They are the best positioned to win that game this year. Nearly all of their top contributors (save for Michael Hickson) return this season, including Mischa Freystaetter, Mike Ogren, and John Best.

For the color model, see XyY\n\nXYY syndrome is a genetic condition in which a male has an extra Y chromosome.[1] Symptoms are usually few.[3] They may include being taller than average, acne, and an increased risk of learning problems.[1][3] The person is generally otherwise normal, including normal fertility.[1]\n\nThe condition is generally not inherited from a person's parents but rather occurs as a result of a random event during sperm cell development.[1] Diagnosis is by a chromosomal analysis.[3] There are 47 chromosomes, instead of the usual 46, giving a 47,XYY karyotype.[1]\n\nTreatment may include speech therapy or extra help with schoolwork.[3] Outcomes are generally good.[3] Prevention is not possible.[2] The condition occurs in about 1 in 1,000 male births.[1] Many people with the condition are unaware that they have it.[2] The condition was first described in 1961.[4]\n\nSigns and symptoms [ edit ]\n\nPhysical traits [ edit ]\n\nPeople with the 47,XYY karyotype have an increased growth velocity from early childhood, with an average final height approximately 7 cm (3\") above expected final height.[5] In Edinburgh, Scotland, eight 47, XYY boys born 1967–1972 and identified in a newborn screening programme had an average height of 188.1 cm (6'2\") at age 18—their fathers' average height was 174.1 cm (5'8½\"), their mothers' average height was 162.8 cm (5'4\").[6][7] The increased gene dosage of three X/Y chromosome pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) SHOX genes has been postulated as a cause of the increased stature seen in all three sex chromosome trisomies: 47,XXX, 47,XXY, and 47,XYY.[8] Severe acne was noted in a very few early case reports, but dermatologists specializing in acne now doubt the existence of a relationship with 47,XYY.[9]\n\nPrenatal testosterone levels are normal in 47,XYY males.[10] Most 47,XYY males have normal sexual development and have normal fertility.[6][11][12][13]\n\nCognitive and behavioral traits [ edit ]\n\nIn contrast to the other common sex chromosome aneuploidies—47,XXX and 47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome)—the average IQ scores of 47,XYY boys identified by newborn screening programs were not reduced compared to the general population.[14][15] In a summary of six prospective studies of 47,XYY boys identified by newborn screening programmes, twenty-eight 47,XYY boys had an average 100.76 verbal IQ, 108.79 performance IQ, and 105.00 full-scale IQ.[16] In a systematic review including two prospective studies of 47,XYY boys identified by newborn screening programs and one retrospective study of 47,XYY men identified by screening men over 184 cm (6'½\") in height, forty-two 47,XYY boys and men had an average 99.5 verbal IQ and 106.4 performance IQ.[15][17][18][19]\n\nIn prospective studies of 47,XYY boys identified by newborn screening programs, the IQ scores of 47,XYY boys were usually slightly lower than those of their siblings.[6][20] In Edinburgh, fifteen 47,XYY boys with siblings identified in a newborn screening program had an average 104.0 verbal IQ and 106.7 performance IQ, while their siblings had an average 112.9 verbal IQ and 114.6 performance IQ.[17]\n\nApproximately half of 47,XYY boys identified by newborn screening programs had learning difficulties—a higher proportion than found among siblings and above-average-IQ control groups.[6][13] In Edinburgh, 54% of 47,XYY boys (7 of 13) identified in a newborn screening program received remedial reading teaching compared to 18% (4 of 22) in an above-average-IQ control group of 46,XY boys matched by their father's social class.[17] In Boston, USA 55% of 47,XYY boys (6 of 11) identified in a newborn screening program had learning difficulties and received part-time resource room help compared to 11% (1 of 9) in an above-average-IQ control group of 46,XY boys with familial balanced autosomal chromosome translocations.[18]\n\nDevelopmental delays and behavioral problems are also possible, but these characteristics vary widely among affected boys and men, are not unique to 47,XYY and are managed no differently from in 46,XY males.[11] Aggression is not seen more frequently in 47,XYY males.[6][11]\n\nCause [ edit ]\n\nDiagram showing XYY syndrome formation. MI and MII are the stages of meiosis, while the blue and pink circles are male and female cells respectively, and the blue and pink bars are Y- and X-chromosomes respectively. The purple cell has 2 Y-chromosomes and 1 X-chromosome due to fusing with a male cell with 2 Y-chromosomes, which was due to division problems in MII of the male.\n\n47,XYY is not inherited, but usually occurs as a random event during the formation of sperm cells. An incident in chromosome separation during anaphase II (of meiosis II) called nondisjunction can result in sperm cells with an extra copy of the Y-chromosome. If one of these atypical sperm cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra Y-chromosome in each of the body's cells.[21]\n\nIn some cases, the addition of an extra Y-chromosome results from nondisjunction during cell division during a post-zygotic mitosis in early embryonic development. This can produce 46,XY/47,XYY mosaics.[21]\n\nDiagnosis [ edit ]\n\n47,XYY syndrome is not usually diagnosed until learning issues are present. The syndrome is diagnosed in an increasing number of children prenatally by amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling[22] in order to obtain a chromosome karyotype, where the abnormality can be observed.\n\nIt is estimated that only 15–20% of children with 47,XYY syndrome are diagnosed within their lifetime. Of these, approximately 30% are diagnosed prenatally. For the rest of those diagnosed after childbirth, around half are diagnosed during childhood or adolescence due to developmental delays or learning difficulties. The rest are diagnosed for a variety of reasons including a small percentage due to fertility problems (5%).[23]\n\nEpidemiology [ edit ]\n\nAround 1 in 1,000 boys are born with a 47,XYY karyotype.[6][11] The incidence of 47,XYY is not known to be affected by the parents' ages.[6][11]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\n1960s [ edit ]\n\nIn April 1956, Hereditas published the discovery by cytogeneticists Joe Hin Tjio and Albert Levan at Lund University in Sweden that the normal number of chromosomes in diploid human cells was 46—not 48 as had been believed for the preceding thirty years.[24] In the wake of the establishment of the normal number of human chromosomes, 47,XYY was the last of the common sex chromosome aneuploidies to be discovered, two years after the discoveries of 47,XXY,[25] 45,X,[26] and 47,XXX[27] in 1959. Even the much less common 48,XXYY[28] had been discovered in 1960, a year before 47,XYY.\n\nScreening for those X chromosome aneuploidies was possible by noting the presence or absence of \"female\" sex chromatin bodies (Barr bodies) in the nuclei of interphase cells in buccal smears, a technique developed a decade before the first reported sex chromosome aneuploidy.[29] An analogous technique to screen for Y-chromosome aneuploidies by noting supernumerary \"male\" sex chromatin bodies was not developed until 1970, a decade after the first reported sex chromosome aneuploidy.[30]\n\nThe first published report of a man with a 47,XYY karyotype was by internist and cytogeneticist Avery Sandberg and colleagues at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, New York in 1961. It was an incidental finding in a normal 44-year-old, 6 ft. [183 cm] tall man of average intelligence who was karyotyped because he had a daughter with Down syndrome.[31] Only a dozen isolated 47,XYY cases were reported in the medical literature in the four years following the first report by Sandberg.[32]\n\nThen, in December 1965 and March 1966, Nature and The Lancet published the first preliminary reports by British cytogeneticist Patricia Jacobs and colleagues at the MRC Human Genetics Unit at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh of a chromosome survey of 315 male patients at State Hospital in Carstairs, Lanarkshire—Scotland's only special security hospital for the developmentally disabled—that found nine patients, ages 17 to 36, averaging almost 6 ft. in height (avg. 5'11\", range: 5'7\" to 6'2\"), had a 47,XYY karyotype, and mischaracterized them as aggressive and violent criminals.[32][33][34][35] Over the next decade, almost all published XYY studies were on height-selected, institutionalized XYY males.[11]\n\nIn January 1968 and March 1968, The Lancet and Science published the first U.S. reports of tall, institutionalized XYY males by Mary Telfer, a biochemist, and colleagues at the Elwyn Institute.[36] Telfer found five tall, developmentally disabled XYY boys and men in hospitals and penal institutions in Pennsylvania, and since four of the five had at least moderate facial acne, reached the erroneous conclusion that acne was a defining characteristic of XYY males.[36] After learning that convicted mass murderer Richard Speck had been karyotyped, Telfer not only incorrectly assumed the acne-scarred Speck was XYY, but reached the false conclusion that Speck was the archetypical XYY male—or \"supermale\" as Telfer referred to XYY males outside of peer-reviewed scientific journals.[37]\n\nIn April 1968, The New York Times—using Telfer as a main source—introduced the XYY genetic condition to the general public in a three-part series on consecutive days that began with a Sunday front-page story about the planned use of the condition as a mitigating factor in two murder trials in Paris[38] and Melbourne[39]—and falsely reported that Richard Speck was an XYY male and that the condition would be used in an appeal of his murder conviction.[34][40] The series was echoed the following week by articles—again using Telfer as a main source—in Time and Newsweek,[41] and six months later in The New York Times Magazine.[42]\n\nIn December 1968, the Journal of Medical Genetics published the first XYY review article—by Michael Court Brown,[43] director of the MRC Human Genetics Unit—which reported no overrepresentation of XYY males in nationwide chromosome surveys of prisons and hospitals for the developmentally disabled and mentally ill in Scotland, and concluded that studies confined to institutionalized XYY males may be guilty of selection bias, and that long-term longitudinal prospective studies of newborn XYY boys were needed.[32]\n\nIn May 1969, at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, Telfer and her Elwyn Institute colleagues reported that case studies of the institutionalized XYY and XXY males they had found convinced them that XYY males had been falsely stigmatized and that their behavior may not be significantly different from chromosomally normal 46,XY males.[44]\n\nIn June 1969, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency held a two-day XYY conference in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[45] In December 1969, with a grant from the NIMH Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency, cytogeneticist Digamber Borgaonkar at Johns Hopkins Hospital began a chromosome survey of (predominantly African-American) boys ages 8 to 18 in all Maryland institutions for delinquent, neglected, or mentally ill juveniles, which was suspended from February–May 1970 due to an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawsuit about the lack of informed consent.[46][47] Concurrently, through 1974, psychologist John Money at Johns Hopkins Hospital experimented on thirteen XYY boys and men (ages 15 to 37) in an unsuccessful attempt to treat their history of behavior problems by chemical castration using high-dose Depo-Provera—with side-effects of weight gain (avg. 26 lbs.) and suicide.[46][48]\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, screening of consecutive newborns for sex chromosome abnormalities was undertaken at seven centers worldwide: in Denver (Jan 1964–1974), Edinburgh (Apr 1967–Jun 1979), New Haven (Oct 1967–Sep 1968), Toronto (Oct 1967–Sep 1971), Aarhus (Oct 1969–Jan 1974, Oct 1980–Jan 1989), Winnipeg (Feb 1970–Sep 1973), and Boston (Apr 1970–Nov 1974).[49] The Boston study, led by Harvard Medical School child psychiatrist Stanley Walzer at Children's Hospital, was unique among the seven newborn screening studies in that it only screened newborn boys (non-private-ward newborn boys at the Boston Hospital for Women) and was funded in part by grants from the NIMH Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency.[50] The Edinburgh study was led by Shirley Ratcliffe who focused her career on it and published the results in 1999.[51][52]\n\n1970s [ edit ]\n\nIn December 1969, Lore Zech at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm first reported intense fluorescence of the A T-rich distal half of the long arm of the Y chromosome in the nuclei of metaphase cells treated with quinacrine mustard.[53] In April 1970, Peter Pearson and Martin Bobrow at the MRC Population Genetics Unit in Oxford and Canino Vosa at the University of Oxford reported fluorescent \"male\" sex chromatin bodies in the nuclei of interphase cells in buccal smears treated with quinacrine dihydrochloride, which could be used to screen for Y chromosome aneuploidies like 47,XYY.[54]\n\nIn June 1970, The XYY Man was published—the first of seven Kenneth Royce spy novels whose fictional tall, intelligent, nonviolent XYY hero was a reformed expert cat burglar recruited by British intelligence for dangerous assignments—and later adapted into a thirteen-episode British summer television series broadcast in 1976 and 1977.[55] In other fictional television works, a January 1971 episode \"By the Pricking of My Thumbs ...\" of the British science fiction TV series Doomwatch featured an XYY boy expelled from school because his genetic condition led him to be falsely accused of nearly blinding another boy,[56] a November 1993 episode \"Born Bad\" of the American police procedural TV series Law & Order portrayed a 14-year-old XYY sociopathic murderer,[57] and the May 2007 season finale episode \"Born To Kill\" of the American police procedural TV series CSI: Miami depicted a 34-year-old XYY serial killer.[58] The false stereotype of XYY boys and men as violent criminals has also been used as a plot device in the horror films Il gatto a nove code in February 1971 (dubbed into English as The Cat o' Nine Tails in May 1971) and Alien 3 in May 1992.[34][35]\n\nIn December 1970, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), its retiring president, geneticist H. Bentley Glass, cheered by the legalization of abortion in New York,[59] envisioned a future where pregnant women would be required by the government to abort XYY \"sex deviants\".[46][60] Mischaracterization of the XYY genetic condition was quickly incorporated into high school biology textbooks[46][61] and medical school psychiatry textbooks,[46][62] where misinformation still persists decades later.[35]\n\nIn 1973, child psychiatrist Herbert Schreier at Children’s Hospital told Harvard Medical School microbiologist Jon Beckwith of Science for the People that he thought Walzer’s Boston XYY study was unethical; Science for the People investigated the study and filed a complaint with Harvard Medical School about the study in March 1974.[35] In November 1974, Science for the People went public with their objections to the Boston XYY study in a press conference and a New Scientist article alleging inadequate informed consent, a lack of benefit (since no specific treatment was available) but substantial risk (by stigmatization with a false stereotype) to the subjects, and that the unblinded experimental design could not produce meaningful results regarding the subjects' behavior.[50] In December 1974, the Harvard Standing Committee on Medical Research issued a report supporting the Boston XYY study and in March 1975, the faculty voted 199–35 to allow continuation of the study.[50] After April 1975, screening of newborns was discontinued—changes to informed consent procedures and pressure from additional advocacy groups, including the Children's Defense Fund, having led to the discontinuation of the last active U.S. newborn screening programs for sex chromosome abnormalities in Boston and Denver.[50]\n\nIn August 1976, Science published a retrospective cohort study by Educational Testing Service psychologist Herman Witkin and colleagues that screened the tallest 16% of men (over 184 cm (6'0\") in height) born in Copenhagen from 1944–1947 for XXY and XYY karyotypes, and found an increased rate of minor criminal convictions for property crimes among sixteen XXY and twelve XYY men may be related to the lower intelligence of those with criminal convictions, but found no evidence that XXY or XYY men were inclined to be aggressive or violent.[63]\n\n1980s and later [ edit ]\n\nThe March of Dimes sponsored five international conferences in June 1974, November 1977, May 1981, June 1984, and June 1989 and published articles from the conferences in book form in 1979, 1982, 1986, and 1991 from seven longitudinal prospective cohort studies on the development of over 300 children and young adults with sex chromosome abnormalities identified in the screening of almost 200,000 consecutive births in hospitals in Denver, Edinburgh, New Haven, Toronto, Aarhus, Winnipeg, and Boston from 1964 to 1975.[49][64] These seven studies—the only unbiased studies of unselected individuals with sex chromosome abnormalities—have replaced the older, biased studies of institutionalized individuals in understanding the development of individuals with sex chromosome abnormalities.[11][65]\n\nIn May 1997, Nature Genetics published the discovery by Ercole Rao and colleagues of the X/Y chromosome pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) SHOX gene, haploinsufficiency of which leads to short stature in Turner syndrome (45,X).[66] It was subsequently postulated that the increased gene dosage of three SHOX genes leads to tall stature in the sex chromosome trisomies 47,XXX, 47,XXY, and 47,XYY.[8]\n\nIn July 1999, Psychological Medicine published a case-control study by Royal Edinburgh Hospital psychiatrist Michael Götz and colleagues that found an increased rate of criminal convictions among seventeen XYY men identified in the Edinburgh newborn screening study compared to an above-average-IQ control group of sixty XY men, which multiple logistic regression analysis indicated was mediated mainly through lowered intelligence.[67]\n\nIn June 2002, the American Journal of Medical Genetics published results from a longitudinal prospective cohort Denver Family Development Study led by pediatrician and geneticist Arthur Robinson,[68] which found that in fourteen prenatally diagnosed 47,XYY boys (from high socioeconomic status families), IQ scores available for six boys ranged from 100–147 with a mean of 120.[69] For the eleven of fourteen boys with siblings, in nine instances their siblings were stronger academically, but in one case the subject was performing equal to, and in another case superior to, his siblings.[69]\n\nSociety and culture [ edit ]\n\nSome medical geneticists question whether the term \"syndrome\" is appropriate for this condition[6] because many people with this karyotype appear normal.[6][11]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

He is described as feeling passionately for Pokémon battles and Pokémon strength. He is also a doting older brother to his sister; he hates Team Plasma because they stole a Purrloin his late grandfather had caught for his sister. For that reason, Hugh travels across Unova and challenges its Gyms so he and his Pokémon can become strong enough to topple the new Team Plasma. He considers both his Pokémon and the player to be his partners, and battles with and against them at several points during their journey.\n\nHugh is extremely quick to anger, and has difficulty forgiving the deserters of Team Plasma in Driftveil City.

Pokémon live everywhere, don't they?\"\n\nIf talked to for the fourth time\n\n\"If you don't get strong, you can't protect the things that are important to you!\"\n\nIf talked to for the fifth time onwards\n\n\"Don't worry about me! Let's hurry and find Team Plasma!\"\n\nApproaching the Team Plasma Grunts\n\n\"Hey!\" \"Team Plasma! You villains!\" \"Liberate? Ha! You're just ordinary Pokémon thieves! And what's more, you use those stolen Pokémon like they're tools!\" \"Let's do this, <player>!\"\n\nAfter the battle\n\n\"Tch! They run away like Patrat! OK! Let's go farther inside! There might be more in there!\" \"Could you be Gym Leader Burgh?\" \"Is that...so?\" \"Huh... Didn't you and the other Gym Leaders fight Team Plasma two years ago?\" \"Thanks for your help. Here, use this! I'll find those other Team Plasma punks! I... I'll never forgive Pokémon thieves! No way!\"\n\nUpon first being seen with Team Plasma:\n\n\"Hold it! What are you guys up to here anyway!\" \"You didn't do anything. Not to me, at least... But I can never forgive Pokémon thieves like you! Just to let you know... You're about to feel my rage!\" \"<player>! Cover me!\"\n\nAfter the grunts are defeated and leave:\n\n\"Five years ago... Team Plasma stole my little sister's Purrloin. It had been given to her as a present. I was only a little kid... I couldn't do anything... So... So that's why I have to get stronger!\" \"Good work! I knew you had good instincts! Well then...\" \"Listen up! You fill up that Pokédex. Keep getting stronger and stronger, and back me up! I'll be counting on you from here on out, too!\"\n\nUpon player's arrival in city\n\n\"Hey!\" \"Start talking, you Team Plasma trash!\" \"You're not getting away!\"\n\nUpon entering the Team Plasma warehouse\n\n\"You guys are all Team Plasma too, right? Tell me, what makes you different from the Team Plasma back there?!\" \"I'm Hugh. From Aspertia City... Five years ago, Team Plasma--I mean you--stole my little sister's Pokémon. I'm the pathetic trainer who wasn't able to stop you. \"Separated\"? What a joke! YOU were the thieves who STOLE them!\" \"Just an apology? That's it?! Where's my sister's Pokémon?! Purrloin! WHERE'S PURRLOIN?\" \"Enough already! Apologizing isn't going to get my sister's Pokémon back! <player>! I'm going to the Pokémon Gym! I'll get stronger and crush every single member of Team Plasma!\"\n\nIn front of the Gym, before battling Clay\n\n\"Challenging the Gym, huh? Nice! Keep getting stronger! Let me tell you, though, Clay's tough! Even if all you have to use against Ground types is Water-type Pokemon, you might still be in for a rough fight!\"\n\nAfter battling Clay\n\n\"You got a Gym Badge, too! I knew you could do it! You know... my partners are the reason I was able to get that Badge. But I'm sure there's more connecting us to each other than Poke Balls! If that's all there is, the stolen Purrloin's feelings will never be what they were!\" \"Wait! I just remembered. Clay... Why? What's the reason? Why have you forgiven Team Plasma?\" \"Hmph... Is that one of those compromises adults are supposed to make? Whatever! I'm gonna fight Team Plasma! Oh yeah, what were you wanting to show us?\" \"A tournament to decide who's strongest, huh? Right on! It's time for some special training!\"\n\nBefore battle (first time only, after the rematch in Undella Town)\n\n\"What? I heard that Team Plasma left many Pokémon behind when they fled. And I'm helping find their real Trainers... That aside... Since you're here, you should have a battle with me before you go!\" No: \"Well, that's all right too, I guess!\" Yes: \"Here I come!\"\n\nSubsequent visits\n\n\"Hey, <player>, have a battle with me before you go!\" No: \"Well, that's all right too, I guess!\" Yes: \"Here I come!\"\n\nAfter the first non-KO hit\n\n\"My Pokémon seems to be in pain! My partner's pain is my pain!\"\n\nWhen the last Pokémon is at critical health\n\n\"I can feel it! Our minds are one right now, me and my partner's!\"\n\nBeing defeated\n\n\"Just as I'd expected! You are really drawing forth your Pokémon's power!\"\n\nAfter being defeated\n\n\"I suppose that's it. If winning in battles is strength, then believing that your Pokémon will come back and waiting for its return is also strength. Doing what you think is right no matter what anyone else says, like these guys do, is strength, too. <player>! Come back tomorrow! I'll take you on again! That's my way of saying thanks!\"\n\nAfter the Driftveil Tournament\n\n\"What was that just now?!\" \"I'm going after him! <player>, cover me!\" \"The Pokémon I'm looking for--my little sister's Purrloin--it might be with them!\"\n\nIn the lobby, before registering for the tournament\n\n\"Me, too!\" \"<player>. C'mon! Let's have some fun. We'll battle, plain and simple!\"\n\nBefore battle\n\n\"Clay sure likes things loud and flashy, doesn't he? Well, whatever... It's time to go all out!\"\n\nBeing defeated\n\n\"Man! I lost... You've become way too tough! But, I'm gonna get stronger, too!\"\n\nIf the player is defeated\n\n\"What's wrong? That's not like you, man...\"\n\nAfter being defeated\n\n\"Still... Your Pokémon sure look like they're having a lot of fun when they battle.\"\n\nAfter winning\n\n\"C'mon, man! You're going to help me when I take on Team Plasma, so you'd better get it together!\"\n\nIn the lobby, after the tournament\n\n\"Aww... I wanted to win the tournament the first time I participated!\"\n\nBefore the ambush\n\n\"This ship... Why is it so cold?\"\n\nAfter the ambush\n\n\"You guys... Seriously, is this Team Plasma's base?\" \"Is this all? I think you need more backup.\" \"Hey, just to let you know... I'm about to unleash my rage!\"\n\nBefore Cheren's battle\n\n\"This is a piece of cake! Go back up Cheren!\"\n\nBefore Multi Battle\n\n\"I'm gonna end this, so back me up! OK, Plasma punk, are YOU the thief who stole a Purrloin in Aspertia five years back?\"\n\nAfter the battle\n\n\"That's the last of 'em! Well now... Why don't you tell me everything you know about Purrloin?\"\n\nAfter getting kicked out by the Shadow Triad:\n\n\"The Shadow Triad? What's their deal, anyway! AAAAH! Team Plasma! Where did you vanish to!\"\n\nBefore battle\n\n\"Wait up!\" \"Let's see how well we've raised our Pokémon!\"\n\nAfter the first non-KO hit\n\n\"Let's do it, partner!\"\n\nLast Pokémon is at critical health\n\n\"I'm counting on you!\"\n\nBeing defeated\n\n\"I couldn't even draw out my team's real strength... How pathetic!\"\n\nAfter being defeated\n\n\"Great! If we're this strong, Team Plasma will run screaming when they see us!\" \"I won't let 'em get away, though! Her Purrloin... I'll get it back for sure!\" \"So, <player>! Keep helping me out! Also, continue to work hard on the Pokédex! You're the one who was officially asked to complete it, after all!\"\n\nBefore battle (rematch)\n\n\"What?! It isn't like I came here because I heard rumors about Cynthia being here and I wanted to challenge her or anything... I was interested in the Abyssal Ruins! See! Here's proof! You can have it!\" \"It's Dive! If you have a Pokémon that knows it, you can dive to the ocean floor. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have found my sister's Purrloin... Or should I say her Liepard... OK! <player>! Let's see who are Aspertia's strongest Pokémon!\" No: \"What's the deal? Don't act all cool.\" \"Ok! <player>! Let's see who are Aspertia's strongest Pokémon!\" Yes: \"Go get 'em, guys!\"\n\nAfter the first non-KO hit\n\n\"Battling against you always gets me riled up!\"\n\nWhen the last Pokémon is at critical health\n\n\"Like I'd lose to you!\"\n\nBeing defeated\n\n\"This bitter...yet refreshing feeling.\"\n\nAfter being defeated\n\n\"<player>... I'm really glad you're my friend!\"\n\nUpon first talking to him\n\n\"What's up? Have you seen Team Plasma anywhere around here? I heard a rumor to that effect...\" \"Shut your mouth. All I want is to get back a stolen Pokémon! <player>! Give me a hand! You ready?\" No: \"Got it! Go get ready and then come back here! Being careful against opponents like these isn't a bad thing!\" \"Are you ready to pitch in? OK, let's go!\" Yes: \"Just so you know... You're about to feel my rage!\"\n\nAfter defeating the Grunt and Zinzolin\n\n\"Get back here!\"\n\nXtransceiver conversation\n\n\"<Player>! A strange ship was flying toward Opelucid City, right?!\" \"Cheren! That's Team Plasma's ship, isn't it?\" \"OK, I'll leave things to you! <Player>! If you run into any trouble, call me!\"\n\nIf the player went to the Marine Tube\n\nXtransceiver conversation\n\n\"<Player>! Where are you? Undella Town? Got it! From there, go through the Marine Tube and come straight to Humilau City!\"\n\nIf the player went to Undella Bay\n\nXtransceiver conversation\n\n\"<Player>! Where are you? Close to Seaside Cave? Man, you sure picked the long way around! Whatever. Your call, I guess. Anyway, make up for that time, and get here now! You know you can get to Humilau City from Undella's Marine Tube, too, right?\"\n\nHumilau City \"We'll get the DNA Splicers back for sure! So you should focus on defeating the Gym Leader first!\"\n\nIf spoken to\n\n\"After you get the Badge, we'll look for Team Plasma! I'm not gonna let the Unova region become an ice sculpture!\"\n\nAfter the player defeated Marlon\n\n\"You got all of the Badges! You're really something! Usually, you'd go to the Pokémon League now, but... dealing with Team Plasma comes first!\" \"Team Plasma does things like steal my sister's... I mean people's Pokémon. They plan on conquering Unova by using Pokémon to freeze it solid! They're really evil! Haven't you heard about them, Marlon?\" \"Man, I don't know if that guy is laid back or just irresponsible. That kinda got me down, but our opponent is Team Plasma! We have to focus! But, before that, we have to find where they are! OK! We'll split up! You check Route 22! Got it?\"\n\nUpon locating the Plasma Frigate\n\n\"You found them! I knew you could do it! But... How do we get in?\" \"I thought you weren't going to fight Team Plasma?\" \"Thanks...\" \"What was that?! The guy sure doesn't follow through! Well, I guess he was being kind in his own way... All right, I'm going in!\"\n\nUpon arrival\n\n\"Take care of that guy! He's no problem for you, right?\" \"OK! This time we'll check out the ship! When we were in Driftveil City, Zinzolin came from this direction!\" \"This is the place... OK! I'm going!\"\n\nInside the northern room\n\n\"Just to let you know... You're about to feel my rage!\" \"They didn't have Purrloin with them! Barriers, huh...\" \"The Team Plasma member was saying... Oh, I got it. We should press the switches to deactivate the barriers! <Player>! Let's split up and look for them! B2 /And there's a device where you enter a password here... That means... We either have to find the password, or get it out of Team Plasma, to deactivate the barriers. <Player>! Let's split up and find that password! W2 \"\n\nB1 Floor\n\n\"Again?!\" \"It must be a hard job, keeping an eye on your former allies. Say, you don't know anything about a Purrloin stolen in Aspertia, do you?\" \"That's what I figured. I wouldn't expect someone from a group bent on world domination to be all that quick on the uptake.\"\n\nUpon Zinzolin presenting Kyurem to the player\n\n\"Not with me around, you won't! Thanks for removing the barrier! That was a big help!\"\n\nAfter they are defeated\n\n\"I'm not going to lose to Team Plasma! By the way, what is this place? That Pokémon... It's so icy... Could that be the source of the attack on Opelucid City?\" \"That should be obvious! I'll do whatever it takes to get my sister's Pokémon back! Are YOU the one who stole a Purrloin in Aspertia five years ago?\" \"That's the ONLY Purrloin in the world that my late grandpa caught for my little sister!\" \"Don't mess with me! You were the one who lost!\"\n\nRoute 21 \"Team Plasma! No matter where you fly, I won't let you get away! But, what's over there anyway?\" \"The Giant Chasm! That's deep in Route 22, right? OK, I'm going! <Player>! You come too! That Pokémon... Kyurem, was it? Its cry sounded lonely somehow.\"\n\nUpon arrival\n\n\"You're already here, huh? Anyone who tries to block us will go running away with their tail between their legs!\" \"You're all alone now... So, which one of us are you gonna tackle?\" \"Oh, yeah... I remember you. Being ex-Team Plasma is really rough, eh?\" \"Well, I suppose... If we don't crush Team Plasma, then guys like you and that N guy will always be treated like villains. OK! I'm outta here, <player>!\"\n\nIn the Crater Forest\n\n\"Come here. Wait a sec. He said he wants to talk to them so his old allies won't get hurt.\" \"Well, that didn't work. Hey!\" \"Let me through!\" \"I'm going to get a stolen Pokémon back! I'm not gonna listen to villains like you! Rood! Ex-Team Plasma! Why do you have Pokémon by your sides? To protect what's important to you, right? Even if your precious Pokémon are hurt, even if your ideals are damaged, the time to fight is NOW!\" \"<player>! As usual, take the other one!\"\n\nAfter defeating the Grunts\n\n\"Thanks...\" \"I'm passing through! Oh, it looks like their backup has arrived.\" \"Got it! If I rescue it, that helps you absolve your guilt, doesn't it? Guess I'll help you out!\"\n\nIf talked to (near the entrance of the Frigate)\n\n\"Go on ahead! I'm going to make them tell me about the Shadow Triad! If you find Purrloin or the Shadow Triad, let me know!\"\n\nIf talked to again (before finding the Shadow Triad)\n\n\"You... Where are the Shadow Triad?\"\n\nUpon entering the Ghetsis's room\n\n\"Wait... You're one of the Shadow Triad, right? Tell me about the Purrloin that was stolen in Aspertia.\" \"Wh-what? Don't mess with me... That's someone else's Pokémon!\"\n\nIf talked to (before the Shadow Triad are defeated)\n\n\"Sorry... This situation is messing with my head... I just don't know what to do... I finally found my sister's Pokémon, but now it's glaring at me... Why?!\"\n\nAfter the Shadow Triad are defeated\n\n\"... ... Hey... <player>... If we let Team Plasma do whatever we want... There'll be more sad Pokémon like Purrloin and Kyurem...\"\n\nGiant Chasm (Cave's Deepest Part) \"Team Plasma's ship flew away... Is it over?\" Yes: \"I see... So it's finally over.\" No: \"I suppose... You have to be the one who decides when it's over.\" \"More importantly, you rescued Kyurem from Team Plasma, right? You're really something!\" \"I'm...gonna make sure Purrloin gets back to my sister! Still can't take it out of the Poké Ball yet, though...\" \"What are you gonna do? ... ... He said to go to the Pokémon League? That's a great idea! I mean, now you're the strongest in Unova, right? Go prove it! Do you remember where we first met in the Giant Chasm? If you follow the path from there, it goes out onto Route 23. Victory Road and the Pokémon League are just past there!\"\n\nBefore battle\n\n\"Wait up!\" \"I'll battle with you before you take on the Pokémon League. The more Pokémon battles you have, the stronger you get, right?\"\n\nAfter the first non-KO hit\n\n\"I saw that move coming from miles away!\"\n\nWhen the last Pokémon is at critical health\n\n\"We will put everything on the line for this move! Right, partner?!\"\n\nBeing defeated\n\n\"...Phew! You're really something!\"\n\nAfter being defeated\n\n\"<player>! Thanks to you, I accomplished what I set out to do during my journey! I wish I could've shown you my little sister's huge smile! This is my thanks!\" \"I think you're really amazing! So become the Champion! Get the proof that you're a Trainer your Pokémon can be proud of! See you!\"\n\nXtransceiver\n\nCall\n\n\"Yeah?\" \"What?\"\n\nI'd like to talk\n\n\"You have to protect what's important to you on your own!\" \"I don't care what the reason it. If you take other people's stuff, you're nothing more than a dirty thief!\" \"I'm thinking about what Pokémon I should have to make up for my other Pokémon's weaknesses.\" \"If you believe in yourself and have Pokémon by your side, even being lost is fun!\" \"When it's night, and everything's quiet... If you listen carefully, you can hear the footsteps of Pokémon. I really like that.\" \"I like spending time thinking about how to raise my Pokémon and make them stronger.\"\n\nSomething's up?\n\nAfter registering him in Xtransceiver \"Where am I now? I'm searching every corner of Castelia City for Team Plasma! You haven't found them either, right? We HAVE to find them! Got it?!\"\n\nAfter meeting up with him and Iris on the Thumb Pier \"Come to the sewers! Let's look for Team Plasma!\"\n\nAfter meeting up with him in the sewers \"The sewers, huh... If Team Plasma's hiding there, we have to find them. Otherwise, I'm sure they'll cause trouble for the Pokémon living there.\"\n\nAfter leaving the sewers, before battling Team Plasma Grunts \"OK! Got it! Waiting in the sewer isn't fun!\"\n\nAfter battling Team Plasma Grunts in the sewers \"Thanks for helping back there! I'm going to keep looking for Team Plasma in Castelia City. Why don't your head to the Pokémon Gym?\"\n\nAfter defeating Burgh \"You won the Insect Badge from the Castelia City Pokémon Gym? Well then, you should go to Nimbasa City and take on the Gym Leader there!\"\n\nAfter defeating Elesa \"You know the next Pokémon Gym after Nimbasa City is Driftveil City, right?\"\n\nAfter meeting up with Team Plasma Grunts in Nimbasa City, before battling them \"Leave it to me! I won't let Team Plasma escape from Nimbasa City!\"\n\nAfter defeating Team Plasma Grunts in Nimbasa City \"You were a big help back there! Guess Driftveil City's next!\"\n\nAfter meeting up with Team Plasma Grunts on the Driftveil City's bridge \"There was one more Team Plasma member. Hey, go listen to what he has to say!\"\n\nAfter battling Rood \"What do you want? Have you challenged the Driftveil City Pokémon Gym yet? If you haven't, just go already! Hey, apparently the Gym Leader uses Ground-type Pokémon!\"\n\nAfter defeating Clay, before leaving the Gym \"Brilliant! Nice work getting the Gym Badge!\"\n\nAfter meeting up with Clay outside the Gym \"Clay just told you to participate in the Driftveil Tournament, right? I hear the tournament takes place to the south of Driftveil City!\"\n\nAfter entering the PWT building, before participating \"The Pokémon World Tournament! A Trainer who wins on the first try must be really good!\"\n\nAfter participating in the PWT, before leaving the building \"No matter what kind of tournament it is, winning's impressive!\"\n\nAfter visiting the Plasma Frigate for the first time \"Actually... You're strong enough that you can probably even beat Mistralton City's Gym Leader. Well, I've already won my Jet Badge, though!\"\n\nAfter defeating Skyla, before meeting up with Professor Juniper \"You know Celestial Tower? It's on Route 7! Go train there if you want!\"\n\nAfter meeting up with Professor Juniper \"I've got one word for you... Reversal Mountain. Oh, wait, that's two words...\"\n\nAfter meeting up with Bianca in Reversal Mountain \"Are you somewhere near Undella Town now? Maybe I'll go there and battle with you. It's been a while!\"\n\nAfter a battle in Undella Town \"It's just a rumor, but I heard Team Plasma was in Lacunosa Town...\"\n\nAfter delaying the battle with Zinzolin \"It's OK! I won't let Team Plasma escape from Lacunosa Town! So do whatever you need to prepare!\"\n\nAfter battling Zinzolin \"Opelucid City's Gym Leader was really tough!\"\n\nAfter defeating Drayden \"Huh! You even beat Drayden! You're really something!\"\n\nAfter Team Plasma freezes Opelucid City \"Good! You're OK! I'm in Humilau City, so I can't get there right away, but I'm sure you can handle it!\"\n\nAfter defeating a Shadow in Opelucid City \"I'm looking for Team Plasma, but I can't find a trace of them! Go to Humilau City. The Gym Leader's named Marlon. Hurry up and go beat him!\"\n\nAfter defeating Marlon, before leaving the Gym \"Have you beat Marlon yet? Don't keep me waiting too long!\"\n\nAfter meeting up with Marlon outside the Gym \"Didn't I just tell you?! Let's split up and look for the Plasma Frigate!

He was first seen running with Nate to go meet Bianca in Aspertia City. Later, he is seen battling Team Plasma aboard the Plasma Frigate alongside Nate and Cheren.\n\nPokémon\n\nVoice actors\n\nLanguage Voice actor Japanese 皆川純子 Junko Minagawa English Sean Schemmel European Spanish Fernando Cordero\n\nIn the manga\n\nIn the Pokémon Adventures manga\n\nHugh in Pokémon Adventures\n\nHugh as a child in Pokémon Adventures\n\nHugh debuts in the Black 2 & White 2 chapter. He is a student at the Aspertia City Trainers' School, alongside his classmates Blake, Whitley, Leo, Yuki, Yuko, and Maya. Despite having a home of his own in Aspertia City, Hugh lives in the school dormitories, where he shares a room with Leo. Hugh is obsessed with getting stronger, which tends to put him at odds with his classmates, who tend to focus on things other than battling.\n\nHugh is first seen berating Blake and Leo for coming late to school. When their new teacher, Cheren, sees the argument, he forces the three to sit in the halls as a punishment for disrupting class. Later, Cheren hosts a small group battle between the boys and girls of the class. Hugh's first opponent on the boys side is Leo, who he easily defeats despite the latter being someone who competed in the previous Unova League. Eventually, Hugh is defeated by Blake, who receives a Pokédex alongside Whitley, who won the battles on the girls' side.\n\nLater, the group travels to Pokéstar Studios. much to Hugh's annoyance as he questions how movies can help make him stronger. He is proven wrong when he finds out that despite the movie dialogue being scripted, the battles they have are actually real. He later watches as the Mecha Tyranitar from another set goes berserk and has to be stopped by Blake. Afterward, he overhears a group of his girl classmates excitedly talk about what to do about their upcoming culture festival. He gets angry at the girls, which offends them into commenting that they feel sorry for Hugh's younger sister due to her brother being unable to understand girls. This infuriates Hugh even further, who retaliates by attacking them. After Leo stops him and the girls have left in disgust at his actions, Hugh notices one of them dropped a locket with a memory card inside.\n\nHugh later checks out the memory card and finds out that it contains a list of Pokémon and their Trainers. When he finds his name inside the list, Hugh flashes back to five years ago. Back then, a younger Hugh obtains a Pidove, a Tynamo and a Purrloin from his grandfather, an Artist. From the three Pokémon, Hugh decides to give the Purrloin as a birthday gift for his sister for her birthday. As it refuses to listen to him, Hugh is forced to wrap the Purrloin itself rather than wrap its Poké Ball. He later gives it to his sister, who the Purrloin instantly takes a liking to despite attacking Hugh earlier. Hugh attempts to force his sister into training the Purrloin against her wishes, which gets them the attention of two Team Plasma Grunts. The Grunts attack Hugh, and despite his attempts to defend, he is easily defeated and Purrloin is stolen. As he lies on the ground unconscious, Hugh wonders if he didn't force his sister to train Purrloin, then it would not have been stolen. He quickly changes his mind to say that if he was stronger, he wouldn't have been defeated. He wakes up and swears revenge against Team Plasma.\n\nBack in the present, Hugh realizes that the memory card contains a list of Pokémon liberated by Team Plasma and that he was the very first one they attacked. He also guesses that since it belonged to a girl in his class, one of them must be a member of Team Plasma and swears to reveal her true identity.\n\nLater, Hugh competes in the Autumn Choir Tournament as a member of Team Jigglypuff alongside Blake, Whitley, Leo, Yuki, Yuko, and Maya. Due to his sister being a part of the audience, Hugh forces himself to act nicer to his female classmates, much to his annoyance. After a hard battle against Team Sawsbuck, Team Jigglypuff emerges as the winners of the tournament with the help of Blake's Dewott. As a reward for their performance, Roxie has her father take the winning team and their class to Castelia City to participate in the Unova Choir Tournament.\n\nAs they travel, Hugh discovers that his sister has managed to stow away onto the ship. Hugh's sister reveals that she did so because she was worried about Hugh, who she had little time to interact with after he started attending the Trainers' School. In order to keep his sister from worrying, Hugh lies about finding the memory card and claims he was busy with schoolwork. He then tells her to keep herself hidden until they reach their destination. Shortly after arriving, Hugh's sister exits her hiding place to look for her brother. When she sees Leo running down the stairs, the sight of his Deino scares her, causing her to fall overboard. After Leo manages to save Hug's sister, Hugh thanks Leo and begs him not to tell anyone that his sister stowed away.\n\nUpon reaching their destination, Hugh and Leo attempt to sneak away while being careful to let no one see Hugh's sister with them. At Castelia City, Roxie discovers a member of the executive committee for the Unova Choir Tournament. The executive reveals that a group of villains attacked him and stole his Karrablast in an attempt to \"liberate\" it. Recognizing the term, Hugh immediately knows that it must be Team Plasma and sets out with Blake, Whitley, and Roxie in order to confront them. They track the attackers to the Castelia Sewers, but are attacked by a group of Muk shortly after entering the area. When Hugh sees that the Trainers commanding the Muk are Team Plasma members, he flies into a rage and begins attacking them. Hugh's attack fails and the Muk immediately begin swarming after everyone, forcing the group to scatter. As he hides from the rampaging Muk, Hugh is approached by a figure, which he believes to be Team Plasma. It actually turns out to be Looker's Croagunk. Looker talks to Croagunk with his Xtransceiver, but due to it being hidden by Croagunk's hat, Hugh assumes that Croagunk is actually the one talking. Looker attempts to get Hugh to reveal what he knows about the situation, but Hugh refuses to talk to the police and runs off.\n\nHugh leaves the Sewers and returns to Prime Pier, where he meets up with his class. He reveals to everyone that Team Plasma had returned and that he fought against them. He also reveals that one of the girls in the class is a member of Team Plasma and presents the pendant he found as proof. Hugh tells everyone that he plans to leave the Trainers' School to continue his pursuit of Team Plasma, but is stopped by Whitley, who was keeping herself hidden. The class, finding Whitley's behavior suspicious, begin to suspect she may be the person Hugh was talking about, but are put to sleep by Foongy's spores. Hugh confronts Whitley and confirms that she is in fact the Team Plasma member in their class.\n\nWhen Whitley asks to get the pendant back, Hugh agrees, but only on the condition that she return his sister's Purrloin. Whitley states that she has never seen a stolen Purrloin among the Pokémon liberated by Team Plasma, but Hugh refuses to believe her. Whitley reveals that despite her being a part of Team Plasma, she was never truly aware of their crimes and apologizes to Hugh for what happened to him. Hugh tells Whitley to take him to the Team Plasma house she stayed at two years ago in the hopes that Purrloin may still be there. The two are soon distracted by a crowd of people who point at a flying ship approaching Castelia City. The ship reveals a cannon and fires a beam of energy at Castelia City, instantly freezing several buildings as well as the people who spotted the ship. Although Hugh and Whitley manage to avoid getting frozen by the beam, Hugh ends up getting knocked unconscious.\n\nPokémon\n\nOn hand\n\nStatus unknown\n\nPidove Pidove was given to Hugh by his grandfather, along with a Tynamo and a Purrloin.

  "latent_9065": "During the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries, former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas denounced rival Gov. Bill Clinton (D-Ark.) as a \"pander bear\" who \"will say anything, do anything to get votes.\" Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) is clearly following in her husband's electoral footsteps by proposing a \"gas tax holiday\" for the summer driving season. When primary votes are at stake, who needs to heed the laws of economics or even good sense?\n\nClinton's idea, which is also endorsed by Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), is to suspend the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax for three months in order to give cash-strapped motorists relief at the pump. Assuming that dropping the tax would actually lower the price per gallon by the full 18.4 cents, how much would this actually save the average family?\n\nLet's make a rough calculation, using an average commute of 20 miles per day in an automobile with a 15 gallon tank getting the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) mileage of 27.5. A commuter would then fill up every 20 days. There are 98 days between Memorial Day and Labor Day, so that means five fill-ups over the summer. Five 15 gallon fill-ups at 18.4 cents per gallon less would mean that motorists would save a total of $13.80 for the summer. Let's double that for vacation driving and shopping and that comes to a grand total of $27.60 in savings. About enough to buy five Big Mac Combos.\n\nBut would prices actually go down by 18.4 cents? Not likely. As the Tax Foundation reports, most economists assume \"that a temporary gas tax holiday would merely increase the profits of the oil industry due to the inability of domestic supply to respond to increased demand in the short run.\"\n\nIn addition, if the federal gas tax is dropped for the summer, the highway trust fund that pays for the upkeep of our crumbling roads and bridges will be short $10 billion. Not to worry, says Sen. Clinton: We'll make up for that fiscal shortfall by taxing the excess profits of Big Oil.\n\nClinton clearly hopes that primary voters will want to stick it to the greedy oil companies. After all, Exxon Mobil just announced $10.9 billion in profits for the final quarter of 2007. So Sen. Clinton says she'll take away some of those profits to pay for her gas tax holiday. And Clinton's not alone. Her Democratic rival, Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) is also calling for a windfall profits tax on oil companies. But will it work?\n\nThe last time the United States imposed a windfall profits tax on oil companies was in 1980 and it lasted until 1988. The result, according to a 1990 Congressional Research Service analysis, was that the tax on oil company profits decreased domestic production by 3 percent to 6 percent and increased dependence on foreign oil by 8 percent to 16 percent. Keep in mind that the big private oil companies actually control only about 6 percent of the world's known oil reserves—the rest are owned by gigantic foreign national oil companies. And just where do private oil companies get the billions they invest in projects to increase supplies? That's right; their profits. In other words, Clinton actually ends up sticking it to consumers when she tries to stick it to Big Oil.\n\nSen. Clinton may be feeling the pain of motorists right now, but once she's in the White House, she plans to inflict more pain at the pump. In fact, all three presidential hopefuls plan to do this. Why? Because Clinton champions \"the most aggressive approach to reducing global warming out there.\" She wants to cut the emissions of greenhouse gases that warm the planet by 80 percent by 2050. To do this she favors a cap-and-trade market on carbon dioxide emissions. The Progressive Policy Institute has calculated that a relatively modest $15 per ton price for carbon dioxide emissions would boost the price of gasoline by 15 cents per gallon. But Sen. Clinton is counting on voters failing to connect the dots between gasoline prices and her global warming policies.\n\nThis past weekend, on ABC News' Sunday talk show, \"This Week,\" Sen. Clinton was asked by host (and former Bill Clinton aide) George Stephanopoulos, \"Can you name one economist, a credible economist who supports the suspension?\" Sen. Clinton replied, \"I'm not going to put my lot in with economists.\" For their part, economists are certainly not putting their lot in with Clinton. According to Bloomberg News, 200 prominent economists, including four Nobelists, have signed a petition denouncing Clinton's gas tax holiday as a \"bad idea.\" Even the New York Times' Clinton votary economist Paul Krugman grumbled that her ploy is \"pointless, and disappointing.\"\n\nWe will find out soon if Democratic Party primary voters are really stupid enough buy into this cynical Clinton pander.\n\nRonald Bailey is reason's science correspondent.

  "latent_9150": "The New York Post has an explosive report on the infamous “dossier” that tried to smear Donald Trump in order to swing the presidential election to Hillary Clinton. The source of the dossier is a Democratic Party opposition research firm called Fusion GPS:\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month threatened to subpoena the firm, Fusion GPS, after it refused to answer questions and provide records to the panel identifying who financed the error-ridden dossier, which was circulated during the election and has sparked much of the Russia scandal now engulfing the White House.\n\n***\n\nFusion GPS was on the payroll of an unidentified Democratic ally of Clinton when it hired a long-retired British spy to dig up dirt on Trump. In 2012, Democrats hired Fusion GPS to uncover dirt on GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. And in 2015, Democrat ally Planned Parenthood retained Fusion GPS to investigate pro-life activists protesting the abortion group.\n\nNo surprise there. What is shocking is the FBI’s apparent involvement in the effort to smear Trump with false rumors:\n\nThe FBI received a copy of the Democrat-funded dossier in August, during the heat of the campaign, and is said to have contracted in October to pay Steele $50,000 to help corroborate the dirt on Trump — a relationship that “raises substantial questions about the independence” of the bureau in investigating Trump, warned Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.\n\nIt raises more questions than that. Why was the FBI meddling in a U.S. presidential election? Partisan interference in the election by public agencies like the FBI and major news sources like NBC are far more worrisome than anything Russians allegedly might do from afar.\n\nThe FBI, too, is trying to stiff Congress’s investigation into the fake dossier:\n\nSenate investigators are demanding to see records of communications between Fusion GPS and the FBI and the Justice Department, including any contacts with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, now under congressional investigation for possibly obstructing the Hillary Clinton email probe, and deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, who is under investigation by the Senate and the Justice inspector general for failing to recuse himself despite financial and political connections to the Clinton campaign through his Democrat activist wife. Senate investigators have singled out McCabe as the FBI official who negotiated with Steele. Like Fusion GPS, the FBI has failed to cooperate with congressional investigators seeking documents.\n\nIt appears that the Democratic Party has successfully corrupted the FBI as well as the CIA.",
  "latent_9186": "Terry Firma\n\nWe learned today that the older of the two brothers suspected of bombing the Boston marathon was called Tamerlan Tsarnaev.\n\nThat means he was named after the 14th-century Turkic ruler Tamerlane (also spelled Tamburlaine, but more commonly Temur or Timur) who called himself “the Sword of Islam.” Tamerlane/Timur, says Wikipedia, was known for his butchery and his “systematic use of terror.” His empire stretched thousands of miles, encompassing parts of (among other countries) Turkey, India, Iran, Afghanistan, and also Kyrgyzstan, where the Boston suspects were born.\n\nTimur was a devout Muslim who referred to himself as the Sword of Islam, converting nearly all the Borjigin leaders to Islam during his lifetime. His armies were inclusively multi-ethnic. During his lifetime Timur would emerge as the most powerful ruler in the Muslim world after defeating the Mamluks of Egypt and Syria, the emerging Ottoman Empire and the declining Sultanate of Delhi. Timur had also decisively defeated the Christian Knights Hospitaller at Smyrna. … Timur’s armies were feared throughout Asia, Africa, and Europe, sizable parts of which were laid to ruin by his campaigns. Scholars estimate that his military campaigns caused the deaths of 17 million people, amounting to about five percent of the world population. Taking advantage of his Turco-Mongolia heritage, Timur frequently used either the Islamic religion or the law and traditions of the Mongol Empire to achieve his military goals or domestic political aims.\n\nHe not only consolidated his rule at home by the subjugation of his foes, but sought extension of territory by encroachments upon the lands of foreign potentates. His conquests to the west and northwest led him to the lands near the Caspian Sea and to the banks of the Ural and the Volga. Conquests in the south and south-West encompassed almost every province in Persia, including Baghdad, Karbala and Northern Iraq.\n\nHis incursion into Persia was notable in part for what Tamerlane ordered his troops to do after the brief siege of the city of Isfahan.\n\nWhen Isfahan surrendered to Timur in 1387, he treated it with relative mercy as he normally did with cities that surrendered. However, after the city revolted against Timur’s taxes by killing the tax collectors and some of Timur’s soldiers, Timur ordered the massacre of the city’s citizens with the death toll reckoned at between 100,000 and 200,000. An eye-witness counted more than 28 towers constructed of about 1,500 heads each. This has been described as a “systematic use of terror against towns…an integral element of Tamerlane’s strategic element” which he viewed as preventing bloodshed by discouraging resistance. … He justified his campaign towards Delhi as a religious war against the Hindu religion practiced in the city and also as a chance for to gain more riches in a city that was lacking control. By all accounts, Timur’s campaigns in India were marked by systematic slaughter and other atrocities on a truly massive scale inflicted mainly on the subcontinent’s Hindu population.\n\nHe massacred 100,000 captives at Delhi, and at least 20,000 more at Baghdad. The Baghdad death toll came after\n\nTimur ordered that every soldier should return with at least two severed human heads to show him. (Many warriors were so scared they killed prisoners captured earlier in the campaign just to ensure they had heads to present to Timur.)\n\nThen he turned his attention to Ankara and Anatolia (present-day Turkey).\n\nTimur’s army ravaged Western Anatolia, with Muslim writers complaining that the Timurid army acted more like a horde of savages than that of a civilized conqueror. But Timur did take the city of Smyrna, a stronghold of the Christian Knights Hospitalers, thus he referred to himself as ghazi or “Warrior of Islam”.\n\nIn all,\n\nThe conquests of Timur are claimed to have caused the deaths of up to 17 million people; an assertion impossible to verify. Timur’s campaigns sometimes caused large and permanent demographic changes. Northern Iraq remained predominantly Assyrian Christian until attacked, looted, plundered and destroyed by Timur, leaving its population decimated by systematic mass slaughter.\n\nTimur’s devotion to Islam, especially in his waning years, was never in question, but in his earlier adulthood he seems to have been more of a religious opportunist who just loved to subjugate and plunder. Notes one reviewer of Justin Marozzi’s biography Tamerlane: Sword of Islam, Conqueror of the World:\n\nTemur rationalised his conquests by appeal to Islam, but he rates as one of the greatest butchers of Muslims of all time. His forces were hired and kept loyal with generous shares of the spoils of conquest, and the cynical deal was, “No jewels, no jihad.” If a city were rich enough to merit plundering, it would qualify as a city of bad Muslims to be blessed with Temur’s corrections and a pretext found. If it happened to be filled with Crusaders or Hindus, all the better. The Ottomans themselves, fresh from annihilating the flower of Christian knighthood at Nicopolis, were swept aside almost without effort. Clearly, Temur’s blessings to his religion were equivocal. Campaigns against Delhi and Christian enclaves in Asia Minor allowed a slightly more convincing pretext of religious war, and in his later years he directed his energies more consistently against non-Muslims as he felt immortality approach, but his campaigning character seems to have been defined by the lust for conquest.\n\nOf course, that one of the apparent Boston bombers was named after the Sword of Islam may mean nothing. The Tsarnaev boys’ aunt claims they were unfailingly good and kind:\n\nMy nephews cannot be part of this terrible, horrible act that was committed in the streets of Boston. I know these two nephews, smart boys, good boys, they have no motive for that, they have no ideas to be going to this kind of act. It’s just not the case, it cannot be true.\n\nWe‘ll see.\n\n[top photo via Business Insider; middle photo via National Geographic; bottom image via Aapna Punjab]",

BGR gave the world its first look at the unannounced handset in mid-April, and we followed up with exclusive details surrounding the phone’s unique 3D interface and gesture-based controls. Then, we revealed that “Prime Data” will be one of the device’s key weapons in the crowded U.S. smartphone market.\n\nNow, BGR has exclusively obtained a new image of Amazon’s smartphone that reveals the handset’s design for the first time ever.\n\nFrom earlier: Exclusive photos of Amazon’s first smartphone, everything you need to know about the Amazon’s phone’s custom software, and details on the Amazon phone’s secret weapon, Prime Data.\n\nWhen BGR published live photos of Amazon’s smartphone prototype for the first time, we noted that the device was covered by a protective housing designed to prevent unauthorized people from seeing the phone’s hardware. As a result, the phone’s physical appearance remained a mystery.\n\nThat is no longer the case.\n\nThe image above is the first to reveal the design of Amazon’s debut smartphone. Multiple trusted sources have verified the authenticity of the image, which was created for internal use by graphic designers at Amazon.\n\nAs can be seen in this new image published exclusively by BGR, Amazon’s phone will feature an overall look that is similar to many full touch smartphones currently on the market. In fact, it appears to take design cues from several existing smartphones including Apple’s iPhone, Samsung’s Galaxy S lineup and even the HTC One, which has a polished, chamfered bezel much like the one seen on Amazon’s phone.\n\nIn terms of size, we’re told that the phone is a bit large but is reasonably comfortable to use with one hand. Amazon’s unique gesture controls were designed in part to make one-handed operation of a large phone as easy as possible, and one source tells us the phone definitely succeeds in that regard.\n\nAs BGR reported earlier, the device pictured here will be the first of several smartphones Amazon is planning to release, and it will be unveiled in the late spring or early summer.\n\nOur sources tell us the device will feature specs including a 4.7-inch display with 720p HD resolution, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM, six individual camera modules and a highly customized version of Google’s Android operating system similar to the one seen on Amazon’s various Kindle Fire tablets.\n\nIt will rely on Amazon’s own mobile app store for third-party software distribution.\n\nThe first Amazon smartphone will also feature a novel interface with 3D effects enabled by four front-facing infrared cameras that track the position of the user’s head in relation to the device’s screen. Coupled with some additional sensors, these cameras also facilitate unique gesture-based controls used to access menus and additional information.\n\nOne of the handset’s key selling points will be a special data plan Amazon refers to as “Prime Data.”\n\nIt is unclear exactly what Prime Data will offer users, but our sources suggest that the phone could be an AT&T exclusive and Prime Data may be a monthly data package that includes a certain amount of Prime video and music streaming free of charge. These details have not been confirmed, however.\n\nAccording to several of our trusted sources and a separate report from The Wall Street Journal, Amazon plans to launch its first phone sometime in the third quarter this year.\n\nDon’t miss our earlier coverage: Exclusive photos of Amazon’s first smartphone, everything you need to know about the Amazon’s phone’s custom software, and details on the Amazon phone’s secret weapon, Prime Data.",

Janoris is not a bad guy by any means. The defensive unit developed a strong camaraderie with Jenk during the year, and Cortland Finnegan plays a huge role in his development into the NFL.\n\nJenkins has a ways to go in pass coverage. His occasional lapses cost the Rams dearly. Jenkins has a -11.4 score in pass coverage from Pro Football Focus.

Johnson has good coverage skills, and he got better the more he played outside. Johnson finished with 2 interceptions and 8 passes defended against, but he had about five dropped interceptions.\n\nSome project Johnson as a safety, but Jeff Fisher shot that down.\n\nChris Givens B+\n\nGivens established himself as a legitimate deep target for Sam Bradford. He had a five-week span where he caught a pass over 50-yards.\n\nGivens finished with a team-high 698 yards receiving on 42 receptions with three touchdowns.\n\nGivens developed his underneath game as the season went on.\n\nRokevious Watkins NO GRADE\n\nRok opened the season as the starting left guard before a season-ending ankle injury.\n\nGreg Zuerlein B\n\nZuerlein was the team MVP early on, connecting on his first 15 kicks before enduring a rough game in Miami.

Sign in or Sign up today!\n\nDETROIT (ChurchMilitant.com) - Islamic countries are notorious for persecuting non-Muslims; what is less well known is the record of abuse from Buddhists across the world.\n\n\"In the West, Buddhism is synonymous with peace, compassion, wisdom and ecumenical brotherhood,\" observes Vaticanista Sandro Magister. \"Moreover, Buddhism has a reputation as a persecuted religion, and Tibet is the emblem of this.\"\n\nBut in recent years, reports have emerged containing \"striking evidence of a contrary nature.\"\n\n\"In almost all of the Asian states in which Buddhism is the majority religion,\" Magister notes, \"there is cruel religious repression. And this strikes all of the non-Buddhist religions.\"\n\nThe most recent example of this came ahead of the Vatican's announcement last week that Pope Francis will head to South Asia in November to visit Bangladesh and Myanmar.\n\nDuring his August 27 address in St. Peter's Square, the Pope condemned attacks against Myanmar's largely Muslim Rohingya community.\n\n\"Sad news has come about the persecution of a religious minority, our Rohingya brothers,\" said Francis. \"I would like to express all my nearness to them. And let us all ask the Lord to save them and to raise up men and women of good will in their aid, who will give them their full rights.\"\n\nIn Myanmar, 80–90 percent of the population adheres to Buddhism. The country ranks 23rd on Open Doors USA's World Watch List of countries most hostile to Christians.\n\nChristians make up roughly 8.5 percent of Myanmar's population, but according to a 2016 report by Christian Aid Mission, \"Professing allegiance to Christ alone is seen as angering the very spirits both villagers and urban dwellers hope to placate.\"\n\nNationalist religious movements have increased in Myanmar in recent years, with Buddhist nationalists pressing the government to enact laws to stem conversions to Christianity and prevent interfaith marriages.\n\nIn 2016, Myanmar held its first democratic elections in a quarter-century. During the campaign period, the army continued attacks on ethnic minorities. In addition, \"an organization of Buddhist radical monks (Ma Ba Tha) increased their campaigns against religious minorities and successfully helped introduce four laws for the 'Protection of Race and Religion,' building insurmountable hurdles for conversions and religiously mixed marriages.\"\n\nProfessing allegiance to Christ alone is seen as angering the spirits.\n\nPersecution of Christianity and other non-Buddhist faiths is not limited to Myanmar. Across Asia, Buddhist countries routinely oppress the religious rights of non-Buddhists.\n\nPersecution against Christians is increasing in Vietnam, with reports of arrests, beatings and land-grabbing on the rise. According to Open Doors, \"Converts to Christianity from Buddhist or ethnic-animist backgrounds face the strongest persecution, which comes not only from the authorities but also from families, friends and neighbors.\" The plight of Vietnam's Christians worsened last November, when the Communist government passed a new law, the Law on Belief and Religion, which seriously undermined religious freedom for Christians.\n\nIn nearby Laos, meanwhile, where the Communist People's Revolutionary Party has held sway since 1975, Buddhist temples serve as \"centers of social and religious life\" and \"most Lao men are expected to spend some time serving in a temple.\" Other faiths are regarded as alien and \"Christians refusing to participate in Buddhist practices are perceived as foreign and a threat to traditional culture.\" Laotian Christian leaders are subject to arbitrary arrest; some have even been killed.\n\nBhutan views Buddhism as the kingdom's spiritual foundation and regards Christianity as a foreign threat. The country's Christians are persecuted for leaving Buddhism, and religious services have been forced underground, \"especially in rural areas, where Buddhist monks fiercely oppose the presence of Christians.\"\n\nIn Sri Lanka, a campaign of violence is being waged against Christian believers. According to Release International, Christians are targeted by Buddhist monks and the government. Worship services have been disbanded and churches closed. Monks have even prevented Christians from burying their dead in public cemeteries.\n\nRelease International chief executive Paul Robinson notes, \"You don't normally associate Buddhism with violence, but time and again we hear that it is Buddhist monks who are leading the attacks against the churches. And our partners have found the monks are being aided by pro-Buddhist authorities.\"\n\nHave a news tip? Submit news to our tip line.",
  "latent_10189": "With the AHL and NCAA regular seasons getting kicked off this past week now nearly every Jets prospect has seen game action. In this prospects update we’ll take a look at how the first weekend went for the Moose 2.0 as well as the rest of the hopeful future Jets.\n\nAHL\n\nAfter a 4 year lapse the Manitoba Moose regular season got under way this past weekend with a pair of games against the Toronto Marlies.\n\nThough the Moose ended up losing both games they were able to take one to a shootout against a strong Marlies team and showed a marked improvement in play from the beginning of the first to the end of the second.\n\nThe Moose were heavily outshot in both games and required a very strong game from Comrie along with a late 3rd period goal to wrestle a single point away from the Marlies. While things didn’t go quite as well for Hellebuyck in his game, he’s already shown to be capable of carrying the load at this level and the Moose look to have a great goaltending tandem with these two.\n\nUp front we saw some of the Jets camp standouts continue to bring their strong play in the AHL. JC Lipon, Ryan Olsen, and Chase De Leo all stood out in my viewings while others like Armia, Kichton, and Kosmachuck were able to chips in points as well.\n\nThis Moose team is quite young and has no real established AHL scorers so it will likely have to be a bit of a group effort unless one of the kids really steps up.\n\nEurope\n\nSami Niku continues to log minutes on the senior team and establish himself in the professional game. For Kraskovsky the points aren’t there yet but the ice time is creeping up which would indicate he’s becoming more comfortable and being afforded more trust by his coaches. Nothing noteworthy to report with Telegin, he continues to play a depth role in the KHL.\n\nCHL\n\nLemieux saw his suspension finish and he was able to get into a couple games. While he hasn’t shown up on the scoresheet yet, he is generating shots and with the ice time he’s getting its only a matter of time.\n\nSpacek’s hot play continued as he was able to pick up an assist in each of the games he played and kept his point streak dating back to the beginning of his season alive. Nogier saw his ice time cut into with the return of Haydn Fluery but is still heavily leaned upon by Red Deer and will continue to play an important role in the team’s top 4 defense.\n\nGennaro was able to pick up his first couple points of the season and continues strong play in a somewhat limited role for the Raiders.\n\nHarkins had a strong weekend with 3 points in 2 games and should see his offense continue to improve the amount of time he plays.\n\nNCAA\n\nThough the NCAA season has begun not all of the Jets prospects have seen game action yet. Kyle Connor, C.J. Franklin and Jamie Phillips all had the weekend off while Erik Foley sat out his team’s games after suffering an injury during pre-season play.\n\nFor those who did play it was a strong start for recent first rounder Jack Roslovic. Roslovic scored a goal and added an assist in 2 games played while displaying the hockey IQ that earned him such a high selection.\n\nAlso drafted this past offseason, Mason Appleton was able to make a quick contribution picking up 2 assists in his first two NCAA games. In addition to them, two defense prospects in Jack Glover and Tucker Poolman got into their first game action though they recorded no points.These two will be interesting to follow this year as they both should be given more time to play at their natural position this season, after spending time last season playing forward due to strong defensive depth.\n\nOther\n\nMarcus Karlstrom got in to a couple more games with the Austin Bruins but was unable to record any points. It’s obviously still early in the season and things could change but given that he was already a long shot, it’s looking less and less like Karlstrom will be able to earn himself a contract with the Jets organisation.\n\nNote: All stat data sourced for this article comes from chlstats.com or eliteprospects.com.",
  "latent_10317": "While partisans try to diminish the role radical Islam plays in fueling global terrorism, a new report released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) finds that \"The most prolific religious terrorist groups are almost exclusively Islamic.\"\n\nThe IEP's 2012 Global Terrorism Index rates 158 countries related to terrorism from 2001-11 using data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which is collected and collated by the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START).\n\nSTART is directly affiliated with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\n\"The rise of religious extremism is well-documented,\" the report says, with Islamic groups being the most prolific. It notes a decrease in attacks from nationalist/separatist groups since 2008, but adds that some Islamist groups like \"the Taliban or Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) have nationalist/ separatist aspirations.\"\n\nThe nationalist characteristics of such Islamic terror groups do not, however, negate their violent Islamist nature.\n\nFor such Islamist/nationalist groups, \"'True' Islam only exists when it is the primary source of governance, manifest today by the implementation of a fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law,\" the report says. \"It supersedes tribe, or nationality today, it is to be defended everywhere it exists, and when it exists it is an ascendant force. According to this logic, in the current moment of extended crisis Muslims are duty-bound to follow the example of the Prophet and emigrate from places of persecution to a place where they can fight on behalf of 'true' Islam. If they cannot make that journey, they are to fight where they live.\"\n\nThe report ranks 158 countries by the terrorist violence it suffered, both the raw number of attacks and the resulting casualties. The top 5 are Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Yemen.\n\nIt is a refreshingly candid, data-driven assessment from a group which describes itself as a \"non-profit research organization dedicated to shifting the world's focus to peace as a positive, achievable, and tangible measure of human well-being and progress.\"",
  "latent_10338": "The Wild opens its six-game exhibition slate tonight at Xcel Energy Center at 7 p.m.\n\nI cannot say this enough: The preseason is NOT televised. The only game you'll be able to see without attending is Tuesday's game at Winnipeg. It will be replayed on NHL Network at 5 a.m. and 5 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nAll games can be heard on KFAN and on the Russo Twitter Network at www.twitter.com/russostrib\n\nFollow me there.\n\nOtherwise, I'll have postgame blogs and notebooks in the paper where I gloss over the games. But I typically don't write full gamers on exhibition games.\n\nFor instance, in Tuesday's paper will be a big feature on Thomas Vanek, a story you'll be interested in because he's pretty forthright about why he thinks his transition to the Wild has been harder than envisioned.\n\nIf you missed my articles the past few days during your busy weekend:\n\nZach Parise and Ryan Suter are ready to turn the page from a heartbreaking season a year ago\n\nJason Pominville is hungry to regain scoring touch\n\nThe Wild vows improvement on the power play\n\nToday's coverage:\n\nMike Reilly's no longer being wooed. He's just a normal Wild rookie now and roster hopeful\n\nFans can get a peek at 3-on-3 overtime tonight\n\nIf you didn't see tonight's lineup against Buffalo, see the previous blog.\n\nThis morning, the Wild unveiled a bit of a look at what the setup may be for this season. Obviously, the units that will be in tonight aren't exact because guys like Vanek and Matt Dumba aren't playing, but if you read the power play story above, the veterans wanted to set up from the left side and that's the way it was worked today.\n\nJason Pominville tonight will be the net-front guy, Mikko Koivu is in the slot, Mikael Granlund will set things up from the left wall, Ryan Suter is up top looking to take one-timers or set up Zach Parise from the right circle.\n\nThe second unit tonight will be Jason Zucker-Zack Mitchell-Nino Niederreiter-Jared Spurgeon-Mike Reilly.\n\nMike Yeo grimaced when a questioner (me) insinuated the veterans got the setup they desired.\n\n\"Just to be clear, this is what we wanted, too,\" Yeo said. \"We spent a lot of time in the summer going through video, and obviously we knew the status quo was not going to work. We've got a few different plans that we're going to be looking at and obviously we felt this was a good opportunity to get to that one tonight just as far as threats and trying to get some guys that when they receive the puck, they're more of a threat. I think that we've got that there.\"\n\nIt is interesting. As below average as the Wild power play was last season, there's going to be some guys where there just won't be room for on the power play initially.\n\n\"We're going to have good players that are not on the power play,\" Yeo said. \"It's pretty clear what the message is here. Everything will be fair. If we're going to have success, then we're going to need to have both groups and both units contributing, and good teams have that.\"\n\nIf Granlund and Koivu play the same power play unit, the second unit needs a center. If Yeo does want to have Niederreiter and Zucker on that unit, there's a chance there won't be a natural center on that unit. Yeo indicated there's wingers on the team that could take faceoffs there.\n\nThat being the case (if Granlund and Koivu are on the same unit), maybe Pominville actually goes to \"center\" the second unit and Vanek goes to the No. 1 unit as a net-front guy. Pominville is a shooter and seems kind of miscast taking cross-checks and slashes in front of the net.\n\nThe other question is where does Matt Dumba go. First unit or second. The Wild wants Granlund on that left wall on the first unit because it feels he's a half wall guy.\n\nLots of moving parts here.\n\n\"We've got a few different plans and we have to see how it all unfolds,\" Yeo said.\n\nParise said on the vets wanting to set up on the left side and getting that in at least preseason Game 1, \"That's the way it looks like right now.\"\n\nAs for where he sets up, Parise said, \"I like being around the net, but at the same time, I think this spot allows me to come in on that second wave and get rebounds. We'll see. It's the first game. It's about having the options. Ryan alone, I think, up top getting one-timers and Granny sitting on the wall, he's looking at three one-timers (Koivu, Parise and Suter). It will be a lot tougher to defend. I think we all trust Granny to make good plays from that side. He's going to have a lot of options from there.\"\n\nGranlund said, \"I like it. I feel like on that side it's easier to find those passing lanes because you're on your forehand all the time. You can get a little bit more movement on that side. Obviously I can't shoot a one-timer from there, but even a wrister might be a little easier. The angle might not be that good, but it's a little easier.\"\n\nKoivu on being in the slot, he said, \"It changes a lot. I've been there in the past on and off. I did like it a lot. It changes a little bit. You get to mix more, you get more in front of the net and get into those battles, which gets you into the game a lot more than sometimes when you're on the half wall. It's going to take a little time I'm sure with timing and reading off where the pucks going to go and whether you move toward the net or away from it. But I've got good experience from the past and we just have to work on it and be patient with it. Games are the best way to work on it.\"\n\nKoivu said it's going to change throughout the year and on a nightly basis because you have to read off what the opponent's penalty kill does.\n\nOn him maybe getting one-timers from Granlund, he said that's an option, but he noticed today it's very tight for him to get that shot off with a penalty killer right in his face.\n\n\"It's just trying to more than anything, if it's not there, it's about leaving something else open,\" Koivu said. \"It's a good thing when you have one-timers all around on that side and Pommer in front of the net for tips and his forehand there. There's a lot of good options.\"\n\nIf we get the full lineup for tomorrow's game in Winnipeg, I'll update the blog.",

In celebration of this great milestone, Nucleus Gallery is hosting an art exhibition from March 7th - 22nd! http://www.gallerynucleus.com/gallery/462/exhibition/ Here’s my submission to the show titled “After the end of all things”. To me personally, this piece allowed me to revisit the Korra world once again after the last BG I turned in back in July 2014. Especially towards the end of production, everyone had so much work to do with so little energy left, that the only thing that kept us going was the love we have for the show and support from each other (thanks fellow Krew!). As BG designers, our final assignments were challenging because of the scale of Republic city and all the buildings that interact with the characters in the epic finale. It was tough but somehow we made it though (way to go Christine!). So to me, this was indeed after the end of all things.\n\nThe artwork is 11x14in and it’s done in Pen&Ink!\n\nCome see the show!\n\nEdit: Woot! thanks to everyone who showed up at the gallery!

  "latent_10463": "Posted on by Mentally Interesting\n\nMental illness isn’t the bogeyman.\n\nI’ve been quite quiet here. It’s not as though I haven’t been trying.\n\nThose drafts were mostly interrupted by bouts of exhaustion and blankness. I’d tried to write something funny and light, but it felt quite forced.\n\nWhat’s prompting me to write today is the heartbreaking death of Charlotte Bevan and her four day old daughter, Zaani. What’s known is that Charlotte had a history of mental health issues- namely schizophrenia and depression, according to her family- was severely sleep deprived and had stopped taking her medication as she wanted to breastfeed. She left the hospital in clinical slippers without a coat, her baby wrapped in a blanket. They both died, in this freezing December, near the Clifton Suspension Bridge, a common suicide spot.\n\nI’m not going to speculate. I’m not going to say that I recognised- viscerally- the hollowness in her eyes as she walked past a series of CCTV cameras. Nor wax, too much, about my own terror of visiting that lonely place. I’m not going to pontificate on mental illness or womens’ agency, paternalistic attitudes or breastfeeding. I’m not even going to post a screed on the woeful provision of perinatal mental health services in this country.\n\nServices and support which should be available everywhere- to every woman- who is pregnant or has given birth. I’m not going to talk about the senselessness of this when a woman’s risk of suicide is highest in the year postpartum. Nor that it’s any woman- not just a woman with a known history of mental illness.\n\nSo what I’m going to do instead is tell you- maybe selfishly- about my own experiences of being a pregnant woman with bipolar disorder, whose mother had postpartum psychosis, who is therefore under the perinatal mental health and considered a high risk pregnancy. I’m going to explain how that feels for me, and about the kind of choices I’ve had to make. I’m going to talk to you about what’s happened to me since I peed on the stick and found out I am expecting a son (not a daughter- that was a bit of surprise at the anomaly scan. I have grown a penis. Whole other blog in that and how I shamefully have far more gendered ideas than I thought I had).\n\nOne of the reasons I’ve kept my pregnancy related bibblings confined to my Twitter and Facebook is because this blog is, and always has been, a mental health blog. And my mental health has governed my life for the past decade. Every major life event has been impacted in some way. I only got 7 GCSEs because I had a breakdown. I was then kicked out of college because I was a rambling, nonsensical whirl of mania. I moved to London in its midst. My father’s death was followed by my admission to hospital. A series of job losses, four years on benefits. I dropped out of my mental health nursing degree partly because I had become suicidally depressed. The good stuff, too. I won an award for a play based on this blog. Not me, and not my life, but my own fractured narrative of mental illness. I’ve had writing opportunities because I write about mental health in a way that people enjoy and relate to (thank you). But that’s all anyone has ever really been interested in about my writing. Or about me.\n\nHere I am, pregnant. And it’s such an abstract thing, though increasingly less so over the weeks. 29 have passed- from a feeling, a line, a long stretch of sickness (which is also why I have been more comfortable with the microblogging of Twitter- constantly vomiting and general exhaustion doesn’t render you the most capable of stringing together a….se), to now experiencing flutters and rolls and bumps. It’s still so strange to me that this “being pregnant” will become, “giving birth” (argh!), to a newborn, a tiny little stranger, who will become my son, and I will become their mother. And they’ll have words, mannerisms, be a sovereign human being in their own right, have memories of me, and I’ll have memories of them. Hopefully one day we’ll talk about them together. And they’ll have a name.\n\nAnd this is mine. It’s all mine.\n\nIt doesn’t belong to a doctor, it doesn’t belong to a CPN, a diagnosis, a theory, a plan, a pathology, a movement. It belongs to me, and to my husband, and to the people we love who are sharing in this with us. Of course, it’s pregnancy, a highly medicalised event. It has its own language, it’s own pathology, its own plans. But they have been so reassuringly, wonderfully, vividly familiar to me. Here is a path my mother walked down. And you. And you. As disempowering as the experience can be, as lonely, as radicalising to my feminist ideas of myself as a woman and a female, it is ordinary. It is so ordinary that when I vomited my breakfast in a yellow arc onto the black and white tiled floor of my local cafe, the women who worked there didn’t flinch. “It’s okay, we’ve been there, we remember what it’s like”. I felt part of some great tradition, and here was the initiation ceremony.\n\nBut Charlotte Bevan’s tragedy can’t help but make me think of my fear of the future. I haven’t been the perfect pregnant woman by a long stretch. She is slim, she eats organic food (except eggs, cheese and raw fish), she doesn’t drink, nor smoke, nor get stressed. She does 30 minutes of gentle exercise a day (maybe yoga or pilates), she doesn’t dye her hair nor pet her cats. She doesn’t take any medication, not even for one of the numerous headaches she’s likely to have. She does all this not just because she is told to, nor because she is “good”, but because she became a mother at the moment of conception. She’s the selfless mother, the ideal woman. She’s not a person but a habitat from when sperm meets egg. That’s the perfect pregnant woman, and she’s still not perfect enough.\n\nI am so far from that ideal that it’s hard not to feel like a failure already. I’m obese from years of psychiatric medications. It doesn’t matter that I have no weight related problems (as rigorous testing, hypotension and seemingly endless urine and blood samples will confirm). It was enough for me to be told, almost accusingly, that I WILL get gestational diabetes and pre eclampsia and that they’ll need to keep an eye on what I eat (which was pretty easy- just check the floor of the train at Tulse Hill station). I smoked and drank, I drink more caffeine than recommended because for half of the day I am in a fugue from the antipsychotic medication I’m still taking. I get stressed and more than that, I have a diagnosis of mental illness, I am struggling to exercise due to exhaustion and I cuddle my two silly, wildly affectionate cats. I don’t feel like a mother yet, and I wonder when I will. I don’t think in terms of, “little angel”. I didn’t undergo some sort of transformation as soon as I became pregnant. I still haven’t.\n\nI have been reminded so frequently of my own imperfections as a woman that I have felt that my, “maternal habitus” is a cesspit. I have, at every stage, thought, “This is when I lose it”. Blighted ovum, then miscarriage and now I’m petrified of stillbirth, after that, it’ll be SIDS. So I’ve been afraid to bond with the little Bean in there, even though he’s growing wonderfully, booting away and, usual pregnancy niggles aside, I’ve had a pretty easy go of it. The anxiety has at times been so bad that my psychiatrist has added a brand new diagnosis to my pregnancy notes- generalised anxiety disorder. The anomaly scan was supposed to be a turning point, and it was. It looked like they had a rare and serious birth defect called esophagal atresia. We spent the next few days, waiting for a rescan, in a fog of terror. My husband ran ahead from me as we returned from hospital to hide the little leopardprint coat we’d bought them and to put away the box of baby stuff that had been donated to us. All our images of taking our baby home after the birth, the mundanity of feeding and changes, were replaced with immediate operations, long stays in the NICU and a possibility our baby would have a potentially life-ending chromosomal disorder. (The rescan was clear. Subsequent ones have been, too, but we still can’t relax).\n\nAs much as this does not belong to mental illness, mental illness does belong to me. I can’t, as much as I want to, separate that from the seismic physical and emotional changes I’m going through right now. The problem with being in the mental health system for a long time is you’re told so many different things are wrong that eventually, you believe nothing is. And you can be a bit shocked when others don’t share that belief. Initially, I resented their intrusion. Imagine what I would be writing if they didn’t exist in my area.\n\nIn the beginning\n\nDue to the, “holy fuck, what is this, am I dying” nausea I experienced until 23 weeks, I knew i was pregnant pretty quickly. I got a positive test at 5 weeks. The first thing I was worried about was my medication- I had no idea if it was safe to take, but also no idea how I’d cope without it. The first few weeks were the hardest emotionally. We’d just been told we were being evicted and had to find somewhere else to live. That stress coupled with the (happy) shock of being pregnant and the hormonal surge meant I spent the first month oscillating wildly. But it wasn’t really anything unusual- it was a reaction to the situation we were in and biological fuckery. (What is unusual for you? Write that shit down now. Give a copy to the people close to you).\n\nI went to see my GP, who congratulated me, said she couldn’t definitely advise me on my medication and referred me to the perinatal psychiatry team. She told me to continue to keep taking my medication, and so I did (and still do). At the moment I’m only on Quetiapine, which is an antipsychotic. She didn’t seem fatalistic or concerned, which cheered me up. I’ve written before about some of the fears I had about pregnancy. Mostly, they’ve been unfounded, but I’m still afraid.\n\nThe perinatal psychiatry team\n\nMidwife number 1\n\nRisk, risk, risk. You have a high risk pregnancy. No fancy home birth for you (fuck that, I want TEH DRUGS). Your BMI is over 30, you’ve smoked and you’re mental. The midwife took my history as I shrank into my chair. She wrote, “SLASHES ARMS SINCE AGE 14”, something which shocked me so much I asked her to correct it. It’s inaccurate- I haven’t self harmed in 5 years- and the word, “slash” is such an ugly, deforming word that I didn’t want associated with me, or my pregnancy. She apologised and changed it, saying she wanted me to be comfortable.\n\nA few weeks later, wearing my Baby on Board badge with my sleeves rolled up in the sweltering heat on the tube, I saw people clock- with disgust- my scarred arms and the badge. And realised that I now have the rest of my and my child’s life with this. Flashes of bringing them to the swimming pool and being stared at. School gates. Grief.\n\nFuck ’em.\n\nThe perinatal nurse\n\nI had to give a different history to the perinatal nurse who came to visit me at home. This was the story of my life, told, lightheaded from nausea, in my garden. It was summer then, and we were just getting settled into our new flat. Robert was asleep upstairs after a nightshift. I offered tea, which she refused. She has that light, almost incredulous way of speaking that some mental health nurses do. I’m already familiar with them- I did a few days with the perinatal nurses when I was a student, and they seem altogether more gentle than their CMHT counterparts. She said, “Oh, what a lot you’ve been through. It’s no wonder you’re so anxious and worried about getting attached”. At this point, I was correcting people who said, “You’re having a baby!” with, “No, I’m pregnant. It’s different”. I wasn’t really sure what to say to that. I know people mean well, but my life hasn’t been that bad and I don’t like it when people head-tilt (the IRL version of italics) or feel sorry for me.\n\nShe taught me some breathing exercises for panic attacks (my panic attacks abated somewhat for a while. Being so busy does that. They’ve returned a bit lately) which don’t seem to come close to controlling the death terrors I experience at night, and made an appointment with the psychiatrist for me.\n\nBefore she left, I felt like I needed to ask.\n\nWill I be referred to social services?\n\nMidwives can sometimes be a little cautious with women who have mental health issues, she admitted. But no, the midwife hadn’t made that call. “Are you planning to?” No, not at the moment. If we’re worried that you might need more help in coping then it’s something we can talk about.\n\nI still haven’t been referred, though my psychiatrist admitted that when I called them (having to reschedule that first appointment as I didn’t receive the letter with the date), they had considered doing so. But I am coping, and if I continue to, good. “Will they take my baby away if you call them?” No, that’s not what they’re there for. Sometimes, we can need a bit of practical support. We want to keep you and baby together, not separate you. It’s usually better for both mum and baby to stay together. We’re here to support you in staying well.\n\nWhile I’m glad I didn’t get an automatic referral, I know this may be partly due to my diagnosis. My perinatal psychiatrist believes that bipolar I disorder is the right diagnosis, and that’s what we’re working with. I tend (these days) to be okay for ages, then get kicked right up the hole with it. That’s where the, “risk” largely is- bipolar disorder has a high relapse rate during pregnancy, tricky management and is more likely than depression to lead to postpartum psychosis. My mum also experienced psychosis after birth, which kicks my risk up past 50%. So, it’s a pretty shit diagnosis to have during pregnancy. It does have an advantage- throwing medication at it can work quite well (as long as you aren’t stupid enough to throw just an antidepressant in there) Everyone’s different, but depression, mania and psychosis generally have quite obvious triggers, and well tested treatments. It’s not more or less “real” than other mental health issues. There’s no, “real” one, really. We still don’t know what causes any of them, but some are viewed as more biologically based than others, and that makes them, if not easier, then more predictable to doctors..\n\nSome women I know who are as functioning as I am, but who have a diagnosis of personality disorder, have been referred to social services. This isn’t fair, and I think it’s partly to do with the stigma surrounding it, and partly because it might be viewed as less predictable than bipolar disorder. It could also simply be their trust, doctor and nothing to do with their diagnosis. I did actually have borderline personality disorder as a diagnosis in the past, but it hasn’t been one I’ve ever been treated for. I don’t believe I have it, nor does the perinatal mental health team, who noted it was historical, not a concern and that I seemed stable. I felt like an arse for being glad about this. It’s partly due to the fact that when it’s flashed up on the screen in the past, I’ve had a lot of irrelevant, tedious questioning about self harm (not in years) etc. You may as well be asking me about a decade-old leg break.\n\nBut these means that women who have been referred and monitored very closely might have a different story to me. I’ve been largely okay so far, but that’s the shitpantsingly scary thing about mental illness and particularly mental illness in pregnancy- it can descend with terrifying swiftness and brutality.\n\nThe mental health midwives\n\nWhen I was referred to perinatal psychiatry, my care was transferred from the community midwives to a specialist team called the Brierley midwives. They’re 8 community midwives who specialise in two things:\n\n1) Home births\n\n2) Women who have a history of mental health issues\n\nI felt pretty smug as half the yummy mummies in East Dulwich want the Brierley midwives and I got them automatically for being mental! Some perks of the job, eh.\n\nThey’re a small team, split in two. So I essentially have 4 midwives. I have my named midwife, my first port of call. Throughout my pregnancy, I’ll meet all the rest in the team of 4, so when I go into labour, the midwife won’t be a stranger to me. That’s pretty good and a relief for someone like me who has been struggling with anxiety and likes to know things in advance.\n\nI have the normal midwife appointments with them, but can also have a few extra if I’m nervous. They’re not trained in the same way mental health nurses are. They’re more holistic in their approach, and take care of your emotional health as well as the health of the pregnancy. They’ve been great, and are always very keen to let me listen to that lovely little horsehoof heartbeat sound. They’re not hugely different from ordinary community midwives.\n\nThe perinatal psychiatrist\n\nThe perinatal psychiatry team are situated in the same hospital as the maternity unit. It’s a rather unpleasantly long walk down a thousand blindingly shiny corridors that seem to swim and shimmer to the exhausted, teary-from-vomiting eyes. The reception area has always been empty when I’ve arrived. There’s only about six seats and my burgeoning behind means I need two.\n\nI’m instinctively, defensive around psychiatrists. I’ve worked with them professionally so I know they’re human beings. Mostly, they’re also compassionate human beings. As doctors, though, they are drawn to the mechanical and the explainable. It’s sometimes disturbing to feel you’re a puzzle to be solved rather than a human being, too. They have so much power over the lowly mental that it’s extremely hard to let your guard down. This time was, at least, quite different from when I’ve seen psychiatrists attached to the CMHT. I hadn’t been summoned there like a naughty child to the headmaster’s office. I was well and there to take advantage of their support- conversely, it meant I was also a little resentful of having it forced upon me.\n\nAlongside quite a few leaflets. I keep them in the living room for easy reading for us both. Got a spare minute with a cup of tea and want to terrify yourself?\n\nCan I take psychiatric medication throughout pregnancy? Can I breastfeed?\n\nWhen talking about medication, I told her that I’d tried to come off it numerous times but suffered such awful withdrawal (insomnia, itching, eventual quasi psychosis from sleep deprivation) that I’d always returned to it. She frowned and said Quetiapine didn’t have any withdrawal symptoms. As I tried to elaborate, she picked up a copy of the BNF and began flicking through it to disprove me. That was a strike.\n\nAs fat as I am due to it (Quetiapine doesn’t cause weight gain, she said. Strike 2! Tell it to the people suing the company that makes it for their diabetes), it’s the one medication that has helped me stay sane, and largely because it means I can sleep. I am a natural insomniac and very prone to hypomania and hyperactivity because of it. Getting regular sleep has been the lynchpin. Although I went into the appointment to argue my case for coming off it, I was secretly hoping she’d tell me it was okay and I should stay on it, as the thought of going through withdrawal and insomnia was unbearable.\n\nShe did. Quetiapine is a category C medication in pregnancy. It means risk can’t be ruled out, and it can’t be ruled out because it’s unethical to test on pregnant women. Case studies so far indicate the risks are gestational diabetes and diabetes 2 (I have been tested twice for GD- I don’t have it and won’t be tested again) which can cause a high birthweight. Confusingly, the consultant obstetrician (I get one of those due to being a high risk pregnancy), says it can cause low birth weight. So go figure. There’s also evidence that it can cause slight respiratory problems after birth, sedation and babies may be a little behind developmentally for a few months, but catch up. Their APGAR score is generally 9 or 10, which is great.\n\nThese are all scary sounding things and I’m still scared of them. I do feel a sense of failure and wish I was, “normal” and didn’t take psychiatric medication. I think about how sedated and dopey I am and feel a huge sense of guilt for what it might be doing to my baby. And because there’s no long term studies, I also have no idea what it’s doing to their developing brain.\n\nBut. I have to try and put my faith in…something. Myself to keep well, which cannot be done by willpower alone and especially not now. In the perinatal team. As much as she initially rubbed me up the wrong way (I warmed to her a lot in subsequent appointments. It’s never easy to go in and tell your whole life story to a stranger), she is the consultant and I trust her opinion. Most importantly, I’m being closely monitored- and so will Bean when they’re born and afterwards.\n\nSo, breastfeeding.\n\nBreastfeeding is great. Boobs make milk! How mad is that? You’ve had them your whole life and then, when you’re pregnant (or taking Risperidone), they inherit this magical superpower. MILK! It’s food! Holy shit!\n\nBut some women’s boobs don’t make milk. Some women find it too uncomfortable, painful or downright weird to breastfeed. Some can’t, some don’t want to, and that’s all fine. Because you know what else is great? Making our own choices about our own bodies. Breastfeeding is not the be all, end all, and the medical establishment- and frankly, other women- have a lot to answer for in downright shaming women about breastfeeding.\n\nIt’s better than formula in some ways (and not as good in others- formula has added vitamins our bodies don’t make, formula is very convenient too). It does help with things like shrinking your uterus back (ping!) and as for bonding, I don’t know. You can still do skin to skin contact with a bottle and bond that way. Breastfeeding doesn’t give you nor your baby immortality. But I can understand why women- even if you sort-of discount that intense societal and medical pressure- really want to breastfeed. I do. I want to do to it because I haven’t done it before and it’s a new experience. I want to do it for the benefits it does have. I want to do it because it’s cheap and we’re skint. I want to do it because boobs, milk, weird.\n\nThe general blanket advice for women taking medication, particularly psychiatric ones, is don’t breastfeed. Please get a specialist opinion on this if you can. Some resources include Drugs in Breastmilk from the Breastfeeding Network. If you know someone who is facing this question who isn’t getting good advice, try to help them find it. Because it’s a big one. Women are being encouraged- and deciding themselves out of pressure, desire, guilt, complex, personal reasons I would never want to judge or belittle in any way- to stop taking medications which are potentially keeping them safe and stable so that they can breastfeed. This is wrong. I don’t mean medically, I mean morally. Women should be encouraged to put their health first. Believe me, I understand that, especially when you’ve struggled with your mental health, you so want to do the, “right” thing, the, “natural” thing, the thing to bond and connect. But formula is not going to kill a baby, whereas a relapse could kill the mother. That’s as brutal as it gets, but it’s true.\n\nI got specialist advice from my psychiatrist who says I can breastfeed. A very tiny concentration of the medication will be in the breastmilk. This study reports 0.1% of my dose and no adverse effects. I’m on the lowest dose of quetiapine I can get away with, but it’s likely that’s going to increase as it’s working less effectively as time goes on. So again there is a little risk with breastfeeding. I’ll be monitored (awful word) and if it’s having effects on the babe, then I’ll switch to formula. Will be upset and disappointed? Probably. But what I am repeating to myself, in my rational mind, is my health first. I can’t look after my baby if I’m unwell.\n\nThe Birth Planning Meeting- making a mental health advance directive\n\nI last saw my psychiatrist about 10 days ago. I’m doing pretty well so we won’t have any more appointments individually, nor will I be seeing my perinatal nurse again unless I ask to. I will be seeing them on the 15th of December to have a birth planning meeting.\n\nThis is essentially where your whole “team” (including your future health visitor) gets together to talk about your birth plan and what you want to happen afterwards, especially if you become unwell. As rationally as I’m writing this, as ticking-along as it’s been, that’s a possibility. What do I want to happen, what do I not want to happen? Would I be okay with an increase in antipsychotics, and if so, are there ones I don’t want to take? (This may largely be out of my hands if I do get sick, but my wishes will be taken into account). We’ll also discuss treatment options should I get sick, such as the mother and baby unit. There will also be general discussion about labour, like with any woman.\n\nI’ll know more about this when I actually attend it, but I feel quite reassured by it. Robert will be there too, and no doubt find it all quite bizarre.\n\nWhat will be happening is that I will continue taking medication after the birth. And there is a huge concession here- it means my husband has to give up work when the baby’s born. You can imagine how financially shattering this will be, it’s maternity leave (I can only take 6 months at the very most, and that’s a huge struggle) on one salary. But he works nights exclusively, and hasn’t been able to find a day job. I work full time and want to return to work. The “team” agrees that although I’m likely to have sleep deprivation like any new parent, it is completely essential that I get as much sleep as possible to stay well, and this means Robert will have to stay at home with me and do nights with the baby so I can take my medication and sleep. My doctor and midwife are pretty worried about me going back to work so soon, but I don’t really have a choice as we can’t afford otherwise. I only get 3 months maternity pay and have been saving up otherwise.\n\nThe Fear\n\nWhen I got home from work tonight, I broke down crying for the first time in months. Despite all this planning and all this support, I am terrified of becoming unwell after the birth, terrified of it happening now, too. It does feel so frighteningly out of control, even after writing 5000 words as to how it isn’t. I feel like I don’t really have control over anything.\n\nI am scared of how quickly women become ill after pregnancy and scared it’ll be me. Scared I won’t be able to ask for help, scared I’ll be beyond even recognising I need it. Scared Robert won’t be able to cope, scared of being alone (it is the loneliest place in the world), scared of not being able to care for my baby. Scared of being a failure. Scared of not being able to bond. Scared of feeling trapped, scared of what I’d do if I did. Scared of the fact I have made the one irreversible decision of my life. Scared of a lot of things a lot of women are scared of. That spiky sea urchin in my brain is a saboteur and a liar and I make a conscious effort not to listen to them.\n\nBut having support does help. It does make a difference. I have a partner, which is support a lot of women don’t have. I have an understanding workplace, too. I have the perinatal team. I have these clear things in my head, here, and in my notes. It isn’t the quivering inarticulate terror of when I became pregnant. It isn’t the kind of fear and uncertainty I imagine many women who don’t have support feel. I don’t know what support Charlotte Bevan had. I hope her family have some support right now for what they’re going through.\n\nAll women need and deserve support when they’re pregnant and afterwards. A check up at 6 weeks is not good enough. A questionnaire will not cut it when we are so ashamed of how we’re feeling and so afraid. Feel free to ask me anything here or on Twitter- ms_molly_vog. If you’re pregnant right now, or thinking about it, please reach out if you’re struggling. To someone- your GP, your midwife, a friend, even a forum or Twitter if you need to talk. I apologise for you in advance if your GP or midwife are shit, if your mental health provision is shit. It’s not right, it’s not fair, and it’s not how it should be.\n\nIt’s 1am now. Tears largely dried. Time to sleep, if searing heartburn allows. I am feeding Bean a fine selection of curries when he’s 18. Sweet revenge. Night.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nTumblr\n\nReddit\n\nFacebook\n\nLike this: Like Loading...

  "latent_10484": "Samsung today announced that its new Gear S2 smartwatch will be available for purchase in the US starting this Friday, October 2nd. The Gear S2 comes in two versions, a sportier standard model and a dressier \"Classic\" version, and they will be priced at $299.99 and $349.99, respectively. You'll be able to buy it direct from Samsung's website, in addition to Amazon, Best Buy, and select Macy's stores.\n\nRead next: The Samsung Gear S2 watch review.\n\nThe Gear S2 is Samsung's first round smartwatch, following the footsteps of Motorola's Moto 360, LG's G Watch R and Watch Urbane, and the Huawei Watch. But unlike those models, the Gear S2 doesn't run Android Wear; instead, Samsung's proprietary smartwatch software built on Tizen is what powers it. The S2 also features a unique rotating bezel, which in addition to a standard touchscreen, provides a way to navigate the interface. The watch is compatible with all Android phones that run Android 4.4 or higher and have 1.5GB or more of RAM, though Samsung says it will have more functions (such as mobile payments) when it's paired with a Samsung Galaxy device.\n\nThe pricing for the Gear S2 is inline with Moto 360, which also starts at $299.99, and lower than the Huawei Watch or Apple Watch, making it an attractive option in an increasingly crowded smartwatch market. Our initial time spent with the S2 left us impressed, but we'll reserve judgement on it until we're able to perform a more complete review.",
  "latent_10587": "“Passengers” is the tale of a lonely guy in space, the drama of an ethical conundrum, a love story featuring two of the hottest actors on the planet, and a turbulent sci-fi action-adventure — and for all of that, it manages to be not a very good movie. The two stars, Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, are both intensely gifted and easy on the eyes, and the film takes off from a not-bad idea, but the setup is way better than the follow-through. The director, the Norwegian-born Morten Tyldum, made the accomplished WWII brainiac spy thriller “The Imitation Game” (2014), but he turns out to be the wrong filmmaker for an amorous space opera. You can see why when he stages a scene that’s supposed to take us out of this world, but doesn’t.\n\nWe’re on the Avalon, a corporate starship that’s shaped like a spidery double helix. The spacecraft, which is headed for a prefab interplanetary colony called Homestead II (in the future, it seems, off-world lands will become franchises for those tired of life on earth), is carrying 255 crew members and 5,000 volunteer passengers, all of whom are in a state of suspended animation and set to stay that way for 120 years. That’s how long the voyage will take. But two of the passengers get woken up early: Jim Preston (Pratt), a mechanical engineer who’s jostled to consciousness in his hibernation pod after the ship hits a meteor, and Aurora Lane (Lawrence), a journalist whom Jim deliberately rouses from her slumber so that he’ll have someone to keep him company.\n\nThe two have all the food, alcohol, and entertainment they could want; there’s a basketball court, a video dance floor, and an elegant if empty bar presided over by a red-jacketed android named Arthur, played by Michael Sheen like the chipper robot cousin of Lloyd the bartender in “The Shining.” But unless either Jim or Aurora manages to live another 90 years or so, this voyage is going to eat up the remainder of their existence, and they’ve got no one but each other to keep each other company. Since they happen to look like Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt (stranded in space, you could do worse), it starts to seem like things will work out.\n\nThey get to know each other and go on a “date,” at which point Jim tells Aurora that he’d like to take her to a place that’s “the best show in town.” He’s talking about a deep-space walk. The two don heavy-duty suits and, hanging by a tether, venture outside the ship, into the starry vastness, at which point you may flash back to other visions of flying human rapture — Christopher Reeve whisking Margot Kidder through the night sky in “Superman,” or George Clooney and Sandra Bullock (though they were just pesky colleagues) bobbing around in the awesome void of “Gravity.” In different ways, both those movies made your heart skip a beat. But in “Passengers,” the big romantic spacewalk is so perfunctory and visually rote that it’s about as stunning as a glimpse out the window of an airplane cruising over Cleveland. The scene is a harbinger of what’s to come, since the two actors spend the rest of the movie going through the motions of what turns out to be a flavorless and rather predictable fable.\n\nToo bad! Because for its opening 45 minutes or so, “Passengers” is a reasonably cunning slice of commercial sci-fi, even as it overtly recycles the strategies of films like “The Martian” and “Moon.” When Jim first wakes up, he thinks the voyage of the Avalon is complete (the passengers are scheduled to come out of hibernation four months before the end of the journey). It doesn’t take long for him to realize, though, that something is amiss. He’s surrounded by chirpy holograms and talking food dispensers — but there’s no other live human.\n\nThe Avalon is like an abandoned cruise ship, and the movie serves up some witty tweaks of top-down corporate culture, like the way that Jim can’t order a first-rate cup of coffee (because he’s not a Gold Star passenger), or the fact that he can’t get through to anyone back on earth, because everything on the ship is programmed to stonewall you. (No information leaks out, even if your life depends on it.) The situation Jim finds himself in is a gnawing nightmare; it’s as if he’d been sentenced to die alone, in 50 years, of boredom. Pratt, beneath the jock sexiness, is a fine actor who lets his eyes dance with playful intent, and with a dash of panic. Jim tries to make a go of things, but after too many days of eating, drinking, and one-man hologram dance-offs, he enters his Jim Morrison-on-the-skids phase. The question is: Will he rouse a fellow passenger, 90 years before she’s scheduled to wake up, in order to save himself?\n\nHe knows that doing so is indefensible (it’s like playing God), but he also knows that if he doesn’t make the decision to screw someone else over, he’s going to go crazy. The way that “Passengers” forces Jim to weigh his choice, and puts the audience in his shoes, seems responsible enough. Yet that still doesn’t make it an infectious thing to build a movie around. Jim’s whole relationship with Aurora is based on a selfish and rather creepy act, as well as a lie (the implication that she woke up accidentally, the same way he did). He’s crafty about it, but we’re waiting for their romance to crash. Lawrence and Pratt match up nicely, because they’re such naturally responsive actors; they’re fast, with mutual radar. Lawrence, though a bit less vivid when she’s this blonde, gives Aurora a core of survivalist moxie. She will do what the circumstances demand. But can Jim keep his secret?\n\nThere’s only one place for “Passengers” to go, and once it gets there, Jon Spaihts’s script runs out of gas. That won’t necessarily hurt the movie commercially, since it offers the kind of big-star mashup that every holiday movie season needs. Tyldun handles the dialogue almost as if he were doing a stage play, but he turns out to be a blah director of spectacle; he doesn’t make it dramatic. (He does create one cool image, though, of a swimming pool freed from gravity.) There isn’t much to “Passengers” besides its one thin situation, and there are moments when the film could almost be “a very special episode of ‘Star Trek,'” because Pratt, with his golden-boy smirk, has a Kirkian side, and the voyage they’re on is grandiose yet amorphous (like the Enterprise’s). The ship itself has a variety of chambers and communal spaces, but it all seems overly familiar and sterile. What’s lackluster about “Passengers” isn’t just that the movie is short on surprise, but that it’s like a castaway love story set in the world’s largest, emptiest shopping mall in space.",
  "latent_10589": "A world first robot called the 'Ladybird' is being trialled among the onions, beetroots and spinach rows, of a farm in the New South Wales' central west.\n\nIt was a successful first trial for the University of Sydney's prototype, which cost about $1 million and a year's worth of scientific development.\n\n\"We've given it that name because it looks a little bit like one [a ladybird beetle], it has red covers with black spots from the solar panels.\n\n\"It's a solar powered, electric driven robot, with a variety of different sensors that we think are going to be useful for precision agriculture into the future,\" said Dr James Underwood.\n\nDr Underwood is a Senior Research Fellow from the university's Australian Centre for Field Robotics and developed the sensory equipment on the robot.\n\nThe ground robot is purpose-designed for the vegetable industry, to help farmers collect intelligence on nutritional information, autonomous farm surveillance, mapping, classification and detection of pests and, eventually, autonomous weeding and harvesting.\n\n\"The first phase for us out here near Cowra has been to test the ability of the robot to drive itself around the farm.\n\n\"It's a fully autonomous vehicle, it's capable of driving up and down the rows of the farm with very good precision, it went really well and basically worked straight out of the box.\"\n\nThe different sensors that Dr Underwood has developed will gather a wide range of farm intelligence.\n\n\"We've been testing what sort of information we get from a variety of different sensors that we have on board the platform.\n\n\"We have various different types of optical sensors such as stereo cameras, and hyper-spectral sensors and some laser range finders; with a combination of that data we can build up a 3D, very detailed type of picture, and map the farm down to the individual plant.\n\n\"It's our hope that with that data, and some algorithms that we design back in the lab, we can process that information to produce useful data for farmers to manage their crop.\"\n\nPeak vegetable industry body, AUSVEG, awarded The Ladybird's lead researcher Professor Salah Sukkarieh Researcher of the Year for his work, at their recent annual conference in Cairns.\n\nEd Fagan owns the farm in Cowra in central-west NSW where the Ladybird is being trialled.\n\nThe vegetable grower says that the Ladybird robot's intelligence gathering around pests and crop nutrition will be invaluable for farmers,\n\n\"A lot of the time in horticulture, if you're short of an element in the plant, by the time you see a symptom it's too late, they will be able to pick up a nutrient deficiency before we see any symptoms.\n\n\"Secondly, you can use it at night at 2 o'clock in the morning and go out and do an insect survey, so things like cutworm popping out at night time, slugs, worms, things like that.\n\n\"Instead of getting out of bed at 3 o'clock in the morning and wandering around with a torch and looking at about five square metres, this thing could do two or three hectares at night and then in the morning you can just see what you've got,\" Mr Fagan says.\n\nBut Dr James Underwood says that it's about the big picture too.\n\n\"Ultimately, we hope that we can really maximise what you can get out of a unit of area of land in terms of growing produce, in terms of the quantity of yield but also the quality and food security,\" she says.",
  "latent_10649": "By Bobby Caina Calvan, The Associated Press\n\nHELENA, Mont. — The Blackfeet Indian Reservation rolls across the plains just east of Glacier National Park. There’s a hotel and casino. There are gas stations, a few eateries and a museum to learn about the culture and history of the people that have occupied the territory long before the arrival of the U.S. Cavalry and the hordes of modern-day visitors who roll into the nearby mountains.\n\nBut despite its proximity to the national park, little of the money spent by tourists end up in the business tills of the reservation’s communities.\n\nWhile Montana might be known internationally for recreational jewels such as Glacier and Yellowstone national parks, Native Americans say the state needs to do more to develop and promote its vast tribal lands as tourist destinations.\n\nSome lawmakers want the state to invest more into drawing visitors to places of historical and cultural importance to the state’s Indian tribes — not only to spark entrepreneurship but also help outsiders better understand Native Americans.\n\n“Folks want to come, and they want to see Native American people, and see our culture, and learn about our history. I think that’s going to create income when they come flying in,” said Democratic state Sen. Lea Whitford, who represents Browning and the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. “It’s just going to increase the flow of dollars into the state.”\n\nTourism is one of the Montana’s most important and lucrative industries, generating more than $4 billion annually from 12.3 million visitors and supporting nearly 55,000 jobs. Little of that money or jobs go to the state’s tribal members.\n\nWhitford and other members of the Legislature’s Native American caucus want improved representation on the state’s tourism advisory council, which she said might not be aware of the potential for cultural tourism. They also want a sliver of money generated by lodging facility taxes to go toward tribal economic development.\n\nTo be sure, many of Montana’s Native American communities lack the infrastructure — like hotels, restaurants and well-developed attractions and amenities — to begin marketing themselves as tourist attractions. But tribes haven’t received much help to identify and develop opportunities, said Rep. Sharon Stewart-Peregoy, a Democrat from the Crow Indian Reservation.\n\nThey say it would be a modest step toward incubating entrepreneurship on tribal and help combat the rampant joblessness on the state’s seven Indian reservations.\n\n“Everything seems to be about Yellowstone and Glacier. But there’s other places Little Bighorn Battlefield and other historical places, which have stories to tell — and should be told — but can’t be fully appreciated because the spotlight isn’t there,” Stewart-Peregoy said. The battlefield marks the site of one the last clashes between the U.S. Army’s 7th Cavalry and the Sioux and Cheyenne Indians.\n\n“It’s Main Street Native America that will bring forth the economic vitality to each of the tribes,” she said. “It’s not going to be the tribal government. It’s going to be the citizens of those tribes that when they are empowered to become entrepreneurs and businesspeople, then Main Street Crow Agency, Main Street Browning and Main Street Rocky Boy will begin to flourish.”",
  "latent_10659": "A report published by SuperData Research (via GamesIndustry International) claims The Elder Scrolls Online had 772,374 subscribers in June.\n\nIt's not explicitly clear where the figure comes from but SuperData's MMO earnings data is compiled from \"the monthly spending of 36.9 million digital gamers, worldwide, collected from developers, publisher and payment service providers\". Presumably the ESO figure comes from the same place.\n\nHa!\n\nGame-publisher Bethesda hasn't released sales or subscription data for The Elder Scrolls Online, and as its parent company ZeniMax Media is privately held, doesn't really have to.\n\nOnly the PC version of The Elder Scrolls Online has been released so far, with PS4 and Xbox One versions to follow... at some point. The console games were delayed by six months back in May, which puts them roughly in November's ballpark. Will ongoing improvements to the PC game impact that? We haven't heard anything for a while.\n\nThe SuperData report also highlighted Star Wars: The Old Republic, which is making quite a lot of money don't you know - $165m in 2013, apparently.\n\nThe leader of subscription-based MMOs - those with a subscription as well as micro-transactions and all that stuff - is, by a country mile, World of Warcraft, dominating 36 per cent of the market and earning more than $1bn in 2013.\n\nLineage - to put that into perspective - is second with $253m earned in 2013.",
  "latent_10708": "A/N: Mṛtyu is Sanskrit for death. One of the things I like about Buddhism is that it actually considers death and suffering to be bad things which must be fought and ultimately defeated, instead of just complacently accepting them. Well, kinda. Nirvana literally means \"blown out\", which could be taken to mean the death of the soul. You have to wonder how bleak someone's worldview would have be, however, to think that the ultimate goal of life is to escape suffering by finding a way to permanently die…\n\nScar walked up the entryway to Pride Rock, as had become his evening ritual. It was still twilight, for he had finished his daily tasks sooner than expected. Nevertheless a sense of weariness overcame him, when he entered and found the great cave to be empty save for Sarabi, who was lying alone on the royal dais.\n\n\"Sarabi, where is your hunting party? And where are the children?\"\n\n\"Simba is outside spending time with Nala, and I asked the huntresses to keep an eye on Nuka.\" Sarabi gave him a playful smile. \"He reminds me a little of someone else, when he was younger.\"\n\n\"He's not my son.\" Scar crouched down at the edge of the bier and sighed heavily. \"I don't know what else I can do, Sarabi. Our subjects are at the end of their patience. If Zira does not return quickly…\"\n\n\"She will.\" Scar marvelled at the iron certainty in her voice – he had no idea how she managed that, or even if it was faked or real. \"Zira is the fiercest huntress in my unit. You did well to choose her.\"\n\n\"Did I? For all I know she might have forgotten the entire reason I sent her, and is only just now spitting the old monkey out in realization.\" This earned him a dry chuckle. \"Sarabi… do you think it's true what they say? That the Kings of the Past inflicted this drought upon us?\"\n\nSarabi slinked closer. \"Scar, I know you and Mufasa did not always get along, but if he looked down at us now he could do nothing but smile. You have done better as a king and as a parent than either one of us would ever have expected. If the Kings of the Past take issue with your leadership, then they are a pack of fools.\" She butted her head against his chest, and purred softly.\n\nScar recoiled in horror, realization finally setting in. \"Sarabi, no. We can't.\"\n\n\"And why should we not?\" Her smile was more fearsome than her iron features had ever been. \"You have done well, your majesty. I do believe you deserve a reward.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, mindless panic overtaking him. \"If Zira comes back–\"\n\nShe snorted. \"I've known Zira since she was a cub. She won't mind.\"\n\n\"Mufasa could be looking down on us right now.\"\n\n\"Then he'll know to look away.\" She placed her paws upon his shoulders and pressed downwards.\n\nHe leapt away without any conscious decision being made. He ran away from the dais, through the tunnel and out of the cave, down the entryway and under the open night sky. He did not slow down until he was in the wide open savannah, with nothing but withered yellow grass stretching out all around him, and no sound but for his own footsteps and the crickets that chirped in the distance.\n\nWhat am I doing? After all this time, what am I doing? Is all my life a lie?\n\nHe kept going, aimlessly, not knowing where to go. The dying grass crunched beneath his paws as he walked. At last he came across a dazzle of zebras, some sleeping upright while others were lying down next to an empty pit that had once been a pool of water. They did not seem to notice him as he snuck up, and the closest one only startled awake when he was close enough to touch.\n\n\"King Scar.\" The zebra stared at him blankly, the dullness of its expression apparent even in the low light of the stars above. It carried a strange, unhealthy smell. \"What're you doing here?\"\n\nScar stared at the animal with morbid curiosity. \"Why are you still here? You know there is no more water, right?\"\n\nThe zebra looked down at the empty pit. \"Prince Simba told us to stay here.\"\n\n\"Yes, but we need you here because we want to eat you,\" Scar said, unable to help himself. \"You know that, don't you? So why are you staying here?\"\n\nThe zebra reached down and pulled some of the grass from the ground, chewing it along with the clump of dirt that was still attached. \"Prince Simba told us to stay. We stay.\"\n\n\"It's no good, Sire.\" The voice that came from behind Scar was recognisable as belonging to Zazu, though there was a strange hollow quality to it. \"I did tell you, didn't I? Herbivore intelligence is simply not up to snuff compared to the rest of us. No species can attain full sentience on a diet of grass alone.\"\n\n\"Zazu.\" The bird was perched on a withered tree which Scar had failed to notice in the moonlight, so blackened was its bark. Against the backdrop of stars, Zazu was little more than a silhouette himself, and if Scar did not know better he would have guessed him to be a pied crow or a raven. \"I always thought…\" He sighed. \"All my life, I imagined what I would do differently if I were king. But now that it finally happened, all I find myself doing is to try and be more like my older brother.\"\n\nZazu turned his crooked beak sideways, and regarded Scar from his perch with a single gleaming eye. \"Sire, the duty of a king is not to change things, but rather to ensure that everything remains the same. Think of it this way: The captain of the Lion Guard is always the King's second son – you, in this instance. But why should that be the case? Would it not be more sensible to pick the most competent leader amongst those available?\"\n\n\"Good question,\" said Scar. Of course, he had never raised the issue while he was the leader.\n\n\"It's simple,\" said Zazu. \"What matters is not competence, but consistency. There really isn't much skill involved in telling your lions to group up and charge the enemy – meaning no offense, Your Majesty. Frankly, we wouldn't expect to lose any straight-up fight regardless. But what if there were infighting or the line of command were called into question? The entire group could dissolve, as is indeed what ultimately happened. That is why it is better to point to someone and say: 'The son of that man rules, and will always rule', for having a poor leader is better than having no leader at all.\"\n\nScar stared at the dark silhouette, feeling faintly like he did not know this creature and was now meeting him for the first time. \"You really don't believe in anything, do you, Zazu?\"\n\n\"I believe in the attainable, Sire. Take your scheme to offer everyone in the Pridelands immortality, for example: That was a foolish thing to say, for it contradicted everything the Kings of the Past told us to justify their rule. Yet your solution, to only offer it to your greatest and most loyal servants, now that was an excellent way to promote the idea that even the most humble figure in the Pridelands could one day earn eternal bliss. That idea brought hope, and hope is what brings us happiness.\" There was a brief pause in which Scar was sure he saw Zazu smirk. \"And dare I say it, Sire? When you told me that I could survive my own death and live with you amongst the stars – for one brief moment, it made me smile.\"\n\nScar stared at him in fascinated horror: He did not know how or why, but in that moment Zazu frightened him more than any predator ever could. He ducked low as the bird swooped down from its perch to land atop one of the zebras lying in the grass.\n\n\"Just imagine it, Sire: If I had never met your family, I might be dying right now, my bloated body lying in the middle of the savannah as some bird of prey pries at my open innards. But I begged your brother to be allowed to serve him, and now here I am. And in the end, isn't that the best any of us can hope for in life? Dying last?\" He reached down and picked at the zebra with his beak, and pulled out what looked like a worm. \"Are you sure you're not hungry, Sire? It's still fresh.\"\n\nScar stared for a moment, and then he screamed and ran.\n\n\"Now, you wouldn't be luring us into some kind of trap, would you, Scar?\" The hyena matriarch eyed him with suspicion, while the two others glanced furtively around for any sign that they had been spotted.\n\n\"I assure you, Shenzi, you are the last on anyone's list of priorities right now.\" Even so he would never have risked taking hyenas all the way to Pride Rock, but he could not afford to wait for Zira any longer. He searched briefly along the cliff face, and then brushed aside the vines that obscured the entrance.\n\n\"Oh wow, a secret passage,\" Banzai said, snickering. \"You lions really are fancy.\" Ed merely giggled.\n\n\"This is the old lair of the Lion Guard, from back when we still operated,\" Scar explained, as he led the way through the narrow opening. The passage led down into a great cave system, illuminated by a single beam of light that shone down through a hole in the ceiling. \"It should have what we need.\"\n\n\"The Lion Guard!\" Shenzi burst into a sudden fit of laughter. \"You took hyenas to the secret lair of the Lion Guard – oh, your old dead kings would blow a lit if they knew!\" A mischievous expression gleamed in her black eyes, and she elbowed him in the side. \"Hey Scar, do you think you could make us all honorary members? Just to drive the point home?\"\n\nScar gave her a look of vague annoyance. \"We're not here for your amusement, Shenzi.\"\n\n\"Sure, we didn't come here for the jokes,\" Banzai chortled, \"but I'd be lion if I said I didn't enjoy them!\"\n\nThe three hyenas collapsed into a fit of hysterical laughter, rolling on the floor and flailing their limbs as they cackled. Scar eyed them with mild distaste. Shenzi and Banzai were undoubtedly the smartest of the hyenas that lived in the elephant graveyard, which was perhaps a greater indictment of their species than even Zazu would dare utter. Once, roving bands of hyenas had terrorised the Pridelands, back in Ahadi's day. Seeing them now, he imagined Simba could have savaged them all with a single bad joke.\n\nShenzi was the first to get up again, wiping her eyes with the back of her paws. \"Hee hee. Don'tcha worry Scar, I get enough jollies from the fact that we're officially lion kings now. Hah! I can't wait to see the look on yer old man's face when I come to say hello in the afterlife. Teach him a thing or two about how inferior we really are.\"\n\nBanzai waved his paw dismissively. \"Bah, revenge in the afterlife sounds great and all, but I'm feeling hungry now. Where's that mountain of food you promised us, Scar?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" said Shenzi, \"we wouldn't be forgetting who helped you cause that little accident back at the ravine, now would we, uncle Scar?\"\n\n\"I assure you, if this works out the way I planned, you can take as much from the pantry as you can carry.\" It was not as if he was feeling hungry, anyway. He was not sure he would ever feel hungry again.\n\nAs the four of them descended ever further into the cavern's tunnels, Banzai's eyes fell upon the mural paintings that lined the walls. \"Hey, what's these then? You a painter, Scar?\"\n\n\"These images were made by the mjuzi of the past,\" Scar explained, though he did not know why he bothered. \"They detail the long history of our species. I used to come down here all the time as a cub, when I couldn't sleep, or when I was not wanted. Sometimes I would just stare at them for hours, trying to make them move with my mind as the mjuzi could, but I never managed.\"\n\n\"Hah, talk about your strange hobbies.\" Shenzi laughed, slapping him on the shoulder. \"Ahh, you're alright, Scar. You're alright.\"\n\nAs they went further down the air became cooler and cooler, until finally the tunnel opened up into a large cavern, revealing a small glistening lake in the centre.\n\n\"A pool!\" Banzai jumped up, outraged. \"The Pridelands are dying of thirst, and they have a pool down here. I can't believe these lions!\" He scuttled over to the edge, and made to dip in his legs. \"Oh well, be a shame not to make use of – ahh, this water is freezing!\"\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" said Scar. \"Peculiar phenomenon, isn't it? The currents are different down here, I think. I remembered this place while thinking of anything that could help me make sense of the spirit world, and I recalled something Rafiki once said – something about cold water, and its effects on the mind.\" It was remarkable, what an appropriate sense of urgency could do for one's power of recollection.\n\nThe only question was: Would it be cold enough?\n\n\"Alright,\" Shenzi said, \"work with me here, Scar. How is a pool of water, no matter how cold, gonna help us find out more about the spirit world? And uh, why should we care, exactly?\"\n\n\"Think, Shenzi.\" Scar sighed. He knew the hyena matriarch was not stupid, but getting other animals to actually use their brain had always proved a near-impossible task for him. \"You and I have a spot in the afterlife now – fantastic! But we still don't know if it really works that way, or even if it does we still don't know what the afterlife will look like. What if Mufasa and the others really are gods up in the stars, while you have no power there? What then? What happens to your revenge then, Shenzi?\"\n\nHe noted to his satisfaction that she gulped nervously – her sense of imagination was adequate then, at least, though he doubted she could think of anything as horrific as he could.\n\n\"Treat it like you would any other war,\" Scar continued, \"and the next step becomes obvious. If the battlefield is unknown, then you should send out a scout.\"\n\n\"A scout!\" Banzai lapsed into a fit of laughter. \"Someone to scout the afterlife! How're you gonna manage that, Scar? You'd need to kill someone, and then you'd need to, somehow…\" He looked at Scar and Shenzi, then at the lake, and paled. \"Wait, no. I don't know what you're planning, but no.\"\n\n\"Freezing water cools the brain until it doesn't work anymore,\" Scar explained. \"Then when you die of the cold, it preserves your functions, so that when you're pulled out again you're alive once more.\" Or that was how Rafiki had explained it, anyway: The actual story had involved a frozen lake a thousand miles south of here, and a mythical figure that might never even have existed.\n\n\"Why does it have to be me? Why not… why not Ed?\"\n\nThe three of them turned to regard the last member of their team, who stared blankly ahead, his tongue hanging out as he giggled softly to himself. \"Eheheheh… eheheheheh… heh.\"\n\nEd always gave Scar the creeps. He was pretty sure Shenzi only lugged the mute idiot around because he was her halfwit brother or something. He had never cared enough to ask.\n\nBanzai looked pleadingly at Shenzi, but the fear that Scar's words had imprinted was still plainly written on her face. She gestured towards the pool, and Banzai whimpered and headed there.\n\n\"Good. Now Shenzi, I will need your help holding him down.\" Before Banzai could protest, Scar grabbed his neck and forced him under with a splash. Gosh, that water really was cold on the paws.\n\nBesides him, Shenzi was doing her part in holding him under, apparently with equal distaste for the cold based on her expression. \"How long are we supposed to hold him under for?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Scar. \"It's not as if I've done this before. Come to think of it, I think we might be supposed to let him breathe during the process. It rather defeats the point of the exercise if he drowns.\"\n\nBased on unspoken consensus they raised his head above the surface, and then when they saw no more signs of struggle, pulled his body out of the water. \"Okay,\" said Shenzi. \"Now what do we do?\"\n\n\"Get him to start breathing again,\" said Scar. \"Don't you hyenas know anything of medicine?\"\n\nGrowling, Shenzi set to work pumping the water out of his lungs, and after a few tense moments, Scar was relieved to see Banzai's chest moving up and down again. His entire body was wet and shivering, and his teeth clattered with an awful sound, but he was alive.\n\nShenzi carefully pushed him to an upright position, looking more worried than ever before. \"Banzai? Did you make it to the spirit world? What did you see?\"\n\nSlowly, his eyes opened – but when they did they stared out at nothing. His tongue lulled from his mouth as he panted. Then, he started laughing, his chortles echoing against the walls and filling the entire cavern with the sound of his giggling. \"Eheheheheh… eheheheheh…. eheheheheheh…..\"\n\nThe next day, Scar received word that Zira had been found.",
  "latent_10789": "Scott Kaplan, Amber Mesker and Bill Ray Smith interview mayoral candidate Bonnie Dumanis on U-T TV's morning show \"Scott, B.R. + Amber.\" The arm in the foreground belongs to U-T TV floor director Louie Juarez. — John R. McCutchen\n\nOn the air U-T TV will offer a mix of news, entertainment and lifestyle programming, and its lineup includes: •“Scott, B.R.+ Amber” Airs on utsandiego.com this week from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. In two weeks the show moves to the 6 a.m.-11 a.m. slot Monday through Friday. •“San Diego Centric” The entertainment/lifestyle show hosted by Chris Cantore and Michelle Guerin will run from 11 a.m. to noon and 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday (Coming by end of the month)\n\nU-T San Diego is launching an in-house television station that will extend the company’s reach well beyond the newspaper with original local news, talk and lifestyle programming on cable and the Web.\n\nThe move is a new strategy in an industry that traditionally separated print and broadcast tracks. That line has already been blurred with the newspaper offering breaking news coverage, video and audio through its website. The creation of U-T TV marks the most dramatic step so far in the company’s evolution, said John Lynch, U-T San Diego’s chief executive officer.\n\n“We’re going to be, every moment of the day, talking about San Diego,” Lynch said. “We realize that we have a very valuable asset and that is unique, exclusive content that is hyperlocal and all about San Diego — from sports to business to the news.”\n\nHotel entrepreneur Doug Manchester bought the newspaper in November, returning it to local hands after more than two years of ownership by a private equity firm. Manchester was joined in the venture by Lynch, who co-founded Noble Broadcast Group and has a long history of owning radio stations.\n\nSince then, the company has invested more than $3 million to construct a state-of-the-art studio with a control room and professional lighting. It has hired about a dozen of the roughly 50 people who will run the station.\n\nBuilt in just three months, the studio occupies a large section of the newsroom on the third floor of U-T San Diego’s Mission Valley headquarters. The studio’s backdrop includes images of Balboa Park, the Del Mar races, downtown and the beach.\n\nU-T TV kicked off its morning show last week, and its goal is to develop round-the-clock programming within a year. Currently, “Scott, B.R. + Amber” can be viewed on utsandiego.com/tv each weekday morning. Other planned programming: “San Diego Centric,” with U-T entertainment/lifestyle personalities Chris Cantore and Michelle Guerin, and “Top Stories” with U-T editorial writer Chris Reed, a news/talk show.\n\nThe programming soon will be available on dedicated cable channels. U-T San Diego is in talks with Cox Communications, Time Warner Cable and AT&T, Lynch said.\n\nThe new TV station will compete for audience not only with local television news operations — KUSI, San Diego 6 and KPBS, and affiliates of ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX — but also with 24-hour news channels such as CNN, analysts said.\n\nTim Wulfemeyer, a professor in the School of Journalism & Media Studies at San Diego State University, said San Diego is a “relatively crowded market” competing for ad revenue in broadcast news. But Wulfemeyer believes there’s room for a quality news operation. Local TV stations have shrunk their news staffs, in some cases from as many as 100 to 30 people, he said.\n\n“For this size city, there’s nowhere near enough investigative reporting, thorough reporting,” he said. “… I think there’s an opening for somebody to come in and get the franchise. Any organization that wants to step into that vacuum and make a go of it, great. I think there are people clamoring for that.”\n\nU-T San Diego isn’t the first newspaper to launch a television station. In 1990, The Orange County Register launched Orange County Newschannel as a 24-hour operation, but it failed to make money and was sold six years later. And in 2000, the Tampa Tribune began working with a TV station owned by its parent company; the two operate out of the same building. Several other partnerships have been launched in various markets.\n\nMore media outlets are offering content on different digital platforms, including The Huffington Post, which will launch HuffPost Streaming Network — 12 hours of original programming for five days a week — this summer. The Wall Street Journal features reporters and newsmakers on its WSJ Live app, and TMZ, the entertainment news website, hosts TMZ.TV interviews with celebrities.\n\nLynch said the U-T television venture is different from past experiments because the timing is right. Better technology is available. The TV market has been disrupted with major staff cuts. And the U-T is demonstrating “an all-out commitment” toward offering content on multiple platforms, he said.\n\nReporters who are already posting news online to utsandiego.com and social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are being trained to shoot video and will appear on U-T TV to discuss their news stories.\n\n“U-T TV is simply one of the leading platforms of the U-T media offerings,” Lynch said.\n\nLeading the TV effort is veteran news producer J.R. Mahon, director of news and programming for U-T TV. Mahon has more than 25 years of broadcast industry experience and was executive producer of Channel 10’s morning show in San Diego. Other local television stations “have the same lead stories across the board and the same stereotypical looking people, with the same graphics going to the same press conference,” he said.\n\nHe wants reporters and editors to have their own shows. “You have a newspaper that’s already doing great things online,” Mahon said. “This really isn’t a risk; it’s a fantastic opportunity. We’re not separating TV, newspapers, online; we’re integrating content, social media and news on different platforms — and talking to each other while we do it.”\n\nU-T TV will make money through advertising, such as sponsorships and partnerships. Unlike other local stations, it will not be a network affiliate, so it won’t be obligated to carry four to six hours of syndicated programming each day, Lynch said. He believes businesses will welcome the chance to be associated with local content.\n\nMichael Parks, former Los Angeles Times editor and former director of the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, wondered whether there is enough of a local audience to justify the expense of a round-the-clock broadcast operation. He worried about the potential impact on “boring but important” journalism traditionally done by the newspaper.\n\nThat’s not a concern of Mahon’s, though. He said there’s no shortage of news, events and personalities in San Diego.\n\n“We’re not going to be boring,” he said.",
  "latent_10821": "When U.S. retailer Target Corp. this month announced its decision to exit Canada, the shocking news reverberated across the country. Just two years into its major cross-border expansion, the company was suddenly calling it quits.\n\nTo some who did business with Target Canada, however, the company's misguided strategies and financial pain were evident early on. Long before the retailer pulled the plug, Target had created rifts with pharmacists, suppliers and other stakeholders, often steamrolling along without seeking input, industry insiders say.\n\nAmong the first to feel the pinch were Target's franchised pharmacists. They had each sunk more than $50,000 into inventory to team up with the retailer for its much-touted arrival in 2013, encouraged by projections of high-volume prescription sales and heavy shopper traffic.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut about a year after Target's launch in the spring of 2013, some struggling Target pharmacists, grappling with lower-than-expected revenues, were already mobilizing to push the company for a better deal. They formed an association to fight Target, charging on a website they created that their pharmacy franchise operations were \"a failed business model for pharmacy franchisees.\"\n\nTarget was \"forcing franchisees to continue to bleed money, while giving periodic financial injections to stay alive and knowing that one of the only ways out is by declaring bankruptcy,\" the pharmacists said on the PFAC.ca site.\n\nThe pharmacists' message in 2014 was eerily prescient. Last week, Target Canada sought bankruptcy-court protection from creditors and is now moving swiftly to close its 133 stores by May, letting go 17,600 employees. Despite $7-billion of investments in its operation here, Target couldn't see a path to profit until 2021.\n\nThe grim outlook was partly formed during an executive visit to the Canadian stores. On the weekend before Christmas, typically the busiest shopping days of the year, Target Corp.'s new chief executive officer, Brian Cornell, visited several stores in Ontario and Quebec. Strolling the aisles, he found \"not as much traffic as we would have expected,\" a company source said.\n\nBut Target's pharmacists, suppliers and other stakeholders had felt cracks in the operations long before Mr. Cornell's pre-Christmas store tour.\n\nEven so, the company's abrupt decision to stage a wholesale retreat from Canada remains a mystery to some, who thought Target was slowly starting to turn a corner. Some suppliers said that in the month leading up to the chain's Jan. 15 bankruptcy-protection filing, they received merchandise orders from Target that were considerably larger than previous ones in 2014.\n\n\"They were really starting to get it together,\" said Gary Grundman, president of Garbo Group Inc. in Toronto, which supplied private-label fashion accessories, such as jewellery and scarves, to Target Canada. Garbo is owed $39,160. \"I think there is a back story here that we don't know about.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSanto Fata, vice-president of Sager Food Products Inc. in Montreal, which is owed more than $11,000 – he calculates $16,000 – said he was finally beginning to see \"wonderful\" sales numbers of its cooking oils at Target by late November, receiving its last order the day before the filing.\n\nThe inventory orders \"were steady, regular and getting larger,\" Mr. Fata said. \"We were happy.\"\n\nNow some suppliers owed hundreds of thousands of dollars are considering ways they can force Target to return their unsold goods that were shipped within 30 days of the filing – rather than have the inventory be included in the chain's liquidation sales.\n\nThe vendors would have had the right to try to reclaim unsold merchandise that had been delivered 30 days before the filing had Target filed for protection under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, said Ivan Bern, a lawyer for Elfe Juvenile Products in Montreal, which is listed as owed $38,294. (Mr. Bern says the debt is $147,758). But instead, Target filed under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, which doesn't have the 30-day goods provision.\n\nTarget spokesman Eric Hausman said this week its Canadian team \"was operating the business as normal until the day of the announcement\" of the filing. Mr. Cornell and other Target executives weren't available for interviews.\n\nFrom the start, Target was plagued with supply chain problems that often left its store shelves empty, while it grappled with customer complaints of high prices. \"We missed the mark from the beginning by taking on too much too fast,\" Mr. Cornell said last week.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe said the retailer had \"undertaken a massive effort\" to ensure that it entered the crucial holiday season with levels of stock that were at \"an all-time high.\" But Target didn't see as much of an improvement during the holiday season as it had been seeking, he said.\n\nWhile wrestling with its supply challenges, Target also faced increasingly disgruntled franchised pharmacists, many of whom were struggling with mounting losses. They initially had been assured by Target that the stores would enjoy heavy traffic, which they counted on for a healthy prescription business. But by the spring of 2014, some Target pharmacists had formed the Pharmacy Franchisee Association of Canada to take on Target.\n\nBy the end of 2013, Target had agreed to provide ailing franchised pharmacists with annual payments of up to $110,000, a source familiar with the situation said.\n\nHowever, \"only some received this while others who were in a similar or worse financial situation did not receive anything,\" said Stavros Steve Gavrilidis, a Target pharmacist in Windsor, Ont., and PFAC's acting secretary.\n\nNow many of the Target pharmacists face an uncertain future. Other drugstore retailers aren't generally rushing to pick up Target prescription lists, suggested Clint Mahlman, chief operating officer of London Drugs Ltd. of Richmond, B.C.\n\nNot many Target pharmacists have lucrative lists of prescription customers because they didn't have the two to three years usually needed to build them up, he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTarget typically shared little sales information with suppliers about how business was going, Garbo Group's Mr. Grundman said. \"They didn't really take advantage of the knowledge in the market. … They just came in here with a preconceived idea of how they were going to land and market in this country.\" Still, suppliers were starting to see improvements in recent months, Mr. Grundman said.\n\nAnd not all creditors see the Target experience as a disaster. Michael Budman, co-owner of fashion chain Roots Canada Ltd., said it successfully re-ignited the Beaver Canoe line, which generated strong sales at Target. Now Roots, which is owed $433,248 in royalties, will \"assess all our options\" for selling the brand elsewhere.\n\nSome industry observers said Mr. Cornell may have had little upside in hanging on to Target Canada because the stumble would have quickly become part of his legacy with no quick fix in sight.\n\nSager Food's Mr. Fata said he doesn't blame Target for deciding to leave Canada given the anticipated long turnaround period.\n\n\"It was a little shocking and disappointing,\" Mr. Fata said. \"But it's a tough market.\"\n\nBut Rick Chad, president of executive search firm Chad Management Group, said he helped recruit some executives for Target – plucking people from secure jobs – and found the retailer's officials he dealt with \"wouldn't take anybody's advice.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"In my estimation, they threw in the towel too early,\" Mr. Chad said. \"I think they came in in a ridiculous way – they ran before they walked.

Ironhead worked on Batman v Superman, Thor, Tron Legacy, Batman Returns, The Avengers and many others. The company knows how to create and execute on complex ideas.\n\nThe entire video is wonderful if you're interested in superhero suit design and fabrication, but the real heartbreaker takes place when Fernandez shows off his concepts for X-Men: Apocalypse.\n\nHere's a good look at his design.\n\nAnd one more.\n\nThis, for comparison, is what made it to screen:\n\nFernandez said he lost the bid to work on Apocalypse, and like many of us he was \"underwhelmed\" by the final version of the character. He also had a lifecast of Apocalypse actor Oscar Isaac, and decided to take a crack at the design.\n\n\"I thought maybe it’s not possible to make him look like this character, but that is sculpted on Oscar Isaac, so I’m like well no, it was possible,\" he said. So the version of Apocalypse from this video isn't just a dream, it could have been made to work with the actor playing the part.\n\n\"I sculpted the makeup and then I kind of bashed out the armor fairly quickly, but just an impression of what that character I think could be, could have been,\" Fernandez explained.",

  "latent_11405": "\"Offline Glass\" Fights Smartphone Addiction in Bars\n\nThe solution to your addiction could lie in a beer glass—if your narcotic of choice is your smartphone, that is. With tech dependence sweeping the planet, even the most devoted drinkers have likely experienced the siren song of the smartphone calling them away from booze and conversation. But there's now help: the Offline Glass—a beer glass that won't stand for your smartphone habit, literally. Conceived by ad agency Fischer & Friends for the Salve Jorge bar in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Offline Glass is designed with half its bottom cut away. So the only way to keep your glass upright—and prevent beer from spilling on the table—is to wedge your smartphone into the cutaway, out of reach from compulsive texting and Facebook status-checking. It's not entirely foolproof, since enterprising tech addicts could hold the glass and the phone at the same time or wedge a napkin underneath. But having a beer glass that forces you to put your phone down may act like a dunce cap that shames you into sociability. Though it could take a number of spilled drinks before patrons remember to balance the glass on their phones, it's a novel idea that provides a low-tech solution to a high-tech problem. Check out the creation and use of the glass at the Salve Jorge bar below:\n\nThe Offline Glass from Mauricio Perussi on Vimeo.",

  "latent_12025": "Ecolab Inc. has reached an agreement to sell its former corporate headquarters in downtown St. Paul to a team of local developers who plan to revamp the building into “modern office space.”\n\nThe group is led by St. Paul-based PAK Properties, which was behind several other St. Paul redevelopment projects, including the conversion of the Medical Arts Building and the Pioneer-Endicott buildings.\n\n“St. Paul is a wonderful place to do business,” said Rich Pakonen, head of PAK Properties, in an interview Wednesday. “Ecolab is a fantastic community partner. [We’ve] got a great team. … We are super excited about the project.”\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed, and Pakonen declined to give more details on plans for the 280,000-square-foot building at 370 Wabasha St.\n\nEcolab, a longtime booster of development in downtown St. Paul, has moved to the former Travelers Cos. 17-story north tower. That landmark structure with the pyramid-shaped roof sits a few blocks from the Ecolab building.\n\nAbout 2,500 Ecolab employees, who were spread among three buildings in St. Paul, have been moving to the new 882,000-square-foot tower for several months. Most of the moves will be completed by 2018. Ecolab makes cleaning, sanitizing and water treatment chemicals. It has $13 billion in annual revenue and about 47,000 employees.\n\nThe company’s commitment to downtown St. Paul has been hailed by Mayor Chris Coleman and others who are trying hard to keep the city a vibrant home for businesses, sports, the arts, festivals and residents. The decision to sell to the PAK Properties redevelopment team was in keeping with the corporation’s past promises.\n\n“In the end, we selected this team’s proposal for their focus on utilizing the building for modern office space, which we think will benefit downtown St. Paul,” said Ecolab spokeswoman Kari Bjorhus.\n\nThe company reached an agreement with Haddington Associates, which owns the Ecolab Corporate Center, to solicit development proposals with the help of real estate adviser group NTH Inc.\n\nThere had been several developers who submitted proposals for the building, including St. Paul landlord Jim Crockarell, who had intentions of converting at least some of the space into housing.\n\n“We believe that increasing the availability of attractive office space and ultimately attracting new businesses is the highest priority for downtown St. Paul,” Bjorhus said.\n\nSt. Paul’s office market has been in a state of flux. The occupancy rate for competitively leased buildings increased in 2016 to 83.4 percent, according to a report released last October by the Greater St. Paul Building Owners and Managers Association.\n\nBut the study didn’t reflect the losses of software company When I Work, Inc., which moved last fall from St. Paul to the North Loop of Minneapolis, and Cray Inc., which had operated out of Cray Plaza since 2009 and will have its grand opening at a new office tower at Mall of America in June.\n\nAlso included in the group led by PAK are Schafer Richardson, Grand Real Estate Advisors and Halverson and Blaiser Group.\n\nLocal entrepreneurs and investors Scott Burns and John Bergstrom also are part of the group.

  "latent_12465": "The Digital Commons at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington, D.C. (DC Public Library/The Freelon Group)\n\nYou make a beeline from the door to the iPad mini. The touch interface is nice, but you want something a little larger so you move on to the next device. Are you weighing a purchase at an Apple Store? No, you’re trying one of the lineup of devices at the new Digital Commons space at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe similarity to an Apple Store is no accident, according to Nicholas Kerelchuk, the manager of the Digital Commons. But at the Digital Commons you can try out e-book readers from all of the major manufacturers, including Kindles, Nooks, and Windows 8 tablets.\n\nAnd the e-book readers are just the start. When the Digital Commons opened in July, it featured a 3-D printer with a smart panel design, on-demand book binding machine, 80 desktops (some of them featuring pricey graphic design suites), rows of tables set up for patrons bringing their own devices, a Skype station, and a vast co-working space the library calls the “Dream Lab.” Could this sprawling space be a glimpse into the future of libraries?\n\nLibraries around the country are facing budget cuts as local governments struggle with the aftermath of the recession – and in many cases that means fewer branches or services. But in the recession more people than ever relied on libraries for frugal entertainment options and to search for employment opportunities.\n\nHowever, at the same time, libraries are facing an identity crisis: As the Internet has become the primary way people gather information, the traditional \"building filled with books\" model is less relevant to their lives.\n\nAs a result, \"libraries are really transforming themselves into technology hubs” says Kathryn Zickuhr, a researcher focusing on how Americans use libraries at the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project.\n\nPew's research shows that while many patrons still want to use libraries to borrow books, they’re also increasingly thinking of them as a community space that enables access to technology and a source of digital literacy for all different demographics.\n\nGeorge Williams, the Media Relations Manager for the D.C. Public Libraries system, certainly sees the Digital Commons as part of that shift: “one of the great things about the space is it is come as you are. There is no prerequisite that you must know 3-D printing or that you must know even computer basics.”\n\nSome of the computers in the Commons are set up to be one-on-one stations where library workers can assist patrons who are just learning the technology. Zickuhr says this reflects a trend Pew is seeing in libraries across the country: “They end up offering a lot of one-on-one assistance to patrons who need to use a computer or e-mail for the first time, but don’t have the experience and may not have any other place they can go to get that.”\n\nEven outside of the Commons, digital services are a big part of what the library system provides. Williams says their digital library is “the busiest location outside of Martin Luther King Jr. Library.” While there are a variety of things available, like free digital magazine subscriptions, remote e-book rentals are one of their most popular with 50 percent annual growth “at a minimum” since they started provided the service.\n\nIn some ways, the Commons is a physical space 18 months in the making that reflects the investments in digital resources the D.C. library system has made in the last several years. “The idea of the Digital Commons,” Williams says, “is not only bridging the digital divide in terms of what people say when they mean about access to the internet, for us it’s access to tech and the skills they’re going to need as tech continues to change the way that we interact, the way that we work, and the way that we learn.”\n\nThe 3-D printer is the “rock star” of the space in terms of popularity. But more importantly, Kerelchuk says, “this is the future. Look at the bio-medical field, look at the auto industry, they're using 3-D printing.”\n\nKerelchuk also has a special place in his heart for the Dream Lab which he believes is \"one of the first co-working places in a public libraries,\" saying that despite having the least amount of technology, it’s “probably the most exciting thing in the room.\" In exchange for using the space, entrepreneurs agree to provide one hour of community programming per month. The Commons received over 25 applications from groups wanting to use the space by July 30— just three days after they started accepting applications.\n\nWilliams thinks the Commons sets D.C. apart from other libraries in the country: “No space had something as large in scale and scope as we've done in DC.\" Kerelchuk agrees, arguing “everyone's done a computer lab, people have done a digital bar, people have done a maker space, in some cases they've done a style of co-working space with collaborative rooms [...] but no one's ever done it all in one room.\"\n\nMore important than comparing the Digital Commons to other library modernization efforts, however, is how they are adapting to the needs of the District in the digital age: “we’re a very reactive agency, if the public asks for it we’re going to try to give it to them” says Kerelchuk. So when he says, “we’re changing the community, we really are” it’s hard not to think “and the needs of the community are changing you.”\n\nWATCH: The Fold: 3-D printing takes shape in unlikely spots",
  "latent_12478": "Yesterday, Clemens Gleich brought you Part 1 of his authoritative guide to the Autobahn, due to overwhelming success, today Part 2. If you ask how Clemens became Minister of High-Speed Transport Propaganda – stranger things happened in Deutschland. A formerly leather-clad radical was made Secretary of State, and the province of Daimler and Porsche has a green governor. Expect to be surprised! – BS\n\n2. The Location\n\nMany foreigners think that every Autobahn is basically the same, which can lead to a very unsatisfactory motor vacation, because it is easily possible to spend the whole length of it in absurdly limited sections and road works which means you might as well have stayed at home. There are some passages that not only are unlimited, but also have curvature radii that feel like a straight at 70 mph but tear your face off your skull (or your tires off the asphalt) at 170 mph. The A95 from Munich to Garmisch is a nice example (don’t go there on the weekends, when everybody and their mother will).\n\nYou could race down BMWs very own prototype test track: Enter the A92 leaving Munich, turn on the A3 towards Regensburg, at Regensburg go down the A93 towards Ingolstadt and Munich (A9). Rinse, repeat. You will see all those disguised next-gen BMWs and perhaps a few such Audis, too.\n\nIf you are looking for competition, visit the Kassel Mountains on the A7 (“Kasseler Berge” will give you Youtube-Clips galore, complete with infos on speed cameras on the limited bits). The Bahn through these hills is so steep that caravanists go a long way to avoid it for fear their underpowered bathrooms will be reduced to 20 mph or to going backwards very fast, disintegrating. This fact alone should tell you everything: few caravans, much competition, good road. To race the Kasseler Berge, follow the A7 from Bad Brückenau towards Kassel until you come to the Autobahndreieck Drammetal (A7 and A38 meet here). Yes, Google Maps is right: There are many miles in that bit.\n\nBring an amount of horsepower you would consider “too much” at home, otherwise you might leave the A7 a very frustrated man.\n\nFor pure, undiluted straight line speed visit the north of Germany where the landscape slowly peters out into the North Sea. A famous example of this experience of American motoring in fast forward is the A27 from Bremen to Bremerhaven: Going straight towards the horizon, towards the sea. Another good stretch are the 50 open km on the A7 from Rendsburg to Flensburg, Germany’s northernmost city, (in)famous for being the home of the points-on-your-licence database. If you don’t manage to max your car on these northern Autobahns, you need a slower one. Or bigger balls.\n\nMy personal favorite are the Autobahns of Eastern Germany. The East is a dark forested no man’s land that hasn’t changed since the Dark Ages, which is why it is also known as “Dunkeldeutschland” (“Dark Germany”). During the socialist occupation after the war, people were forced to live there at gunpoint, but when the wall came down, of course everybody with half an ounce of sense and two working legs left. Now, only ancient pensioners still haunt the ghost towns there, the rest has fled to Berlin or to civilized Germany (which funds the whole Berlin island setup).\n\nAs is customary, the government didn’t notice this and built infrastructure fit for two Irelands into the empty woods, financed by a special new extra tax cynically called “Solidaritätszuschlag” (solidarity surcharge). The Autobahns they built are gorgeous, empty and give me a feeling of my money well spent. The A2 from Magdeburg to Berlin is especially popular with tourists, because at the end of it, you are somewhere (Berlin) instead of nowhere (the rest of the East).\n\nBut my secret tip for you would be the A71 connecting Schweinfurt with Erfurt. It is still quite new, so it hasn’t made its way into the travel guides yet. You can go the whole length of it, the only limits being in the tunnelly bit. The tunnel stretches are a good place for a spot of R&R (relax and refuel), because there are nearly no service stations directly on the A71. Get off at Oberhof, race up an awesome hill course, pit stop, race down the awesome hill course, continue racing the A71. You can hold the pedal to the metal until it rusts into position – if you are brave or underpowered enough to leave it there in the many turns.\n\nAnother way of finding a good piece of Autobahn is asking a German who likes driving (i. e. any German) about his favorite segment. These favorites are everywhere, so one will always be near your lodgings.\n\n3. The Rules\n\nIn Germany, we love rules. The only thing we love more than making The Rules is explaining The Rules to the ignorant, which I shall do now. Fear not, I will constrain myself to the rules concerning a happy holiday. As always, the rules are split into the official rules of the written law and the unofficial rules “you just know”. As the French expect visitors to know their history and culture and speak their language, the Germans expect you to know the unofficial rules without being told. You just know. Which is why I won’t tell you either.\n\nBut I’ll do something better, I’ll explain official rules only you will know, starting with the mysteries of the Kraftfahrstraße: The sign for an Autobahn is a white road on blue ground stretching into the distance, being crossed by a bridge (mnemonics: a big letter “A”). So when you see this but no limit signs, you are allowed to go as fast as you can afford. BUT (and not even many Germans know this) the Autobahn is not the only place in Germany where you can legally do that. Look for a blue sign with a white car front on it, it marks a “Kraftfahrstraße” (mnemonics: translate it literally into “poweerrr drive road”). If it has two lanes per direction OR a bit in the middle (bushes, concrete, doesn’t matter) and there are no limiting signs, you can go as fast as you want here as well.\n\nThese open roads residing between a Motorway and an A-Road are unofficially called Yellow Autobahns (“Gelbe Autobahnen”) because of the yellow instead of blue road signs, and you should cherish this information, because you can use it to shut up a German going on about The Rules in the pub at night. You can finish him off by adding that there is a Kraftfahrstraße sign at the entrance of the Nürburgring Nordschleife.\n\nA rule I don’t have to remind the visiting speed tourist of is nonetheless interesting, even heart-warming: In Germany, it is forbidden by law to go so slow that traffic is hampered without a good reason (see §3 Abs. 3 Nr. 3 in our holy traffic bible StVO). Traffic will immediately be hampered the nanosecond you fall below the current speed limit. The law is not often enforced, but when it is, we celebrate like Americans when they have found another terrorist. Pray that the offender doesn’t pay his fine, as this will provide you with the rare opportunity to attend a (public) trial of a Peugeot driver where he will be condemned for his sins of slowness. The memory will last you a lifetime.\n\nOn a more serious note, I have encountered tourists having a debate about their alleged whiplash on the leftmost Autobahn lane, our overtaking lane. I’m afraid this is not tolerable behavior in Germany. In fact, it is a criminal offence over here (dangerous intervention into traffic). If you get screamed at by a policeman who kicks you so hard his jackboot will stay stuck between your buttocks and then writes fines full of numbers you didn’t know existed, you will have been very lucky.\n\nIf somebody gets seriously hurt because of such stupidity, you will go to prison for “not under one year” and still be a bit lucky because you didn’t get killed by one of the many 2-tonne projectiles you were standing in the way of. You’ll see the wisdom of our legislation as soon as you come across a standing (stupid) obstacle on the overtaking lane while doing 190 mph in your 911 rental. Okay, it might be your last thought, but there are worse last thoughts.\n\nTo discuss your fender bender or the finer points of whiplash, you’ll have to leave the Autobahn, as it is completely verboten to stop anywhere on it, including the hard shoulder. The hard shoulder is for real breakdowns and emergencies, of which a spirited whiplash discussion is neither.\n\nTo cheer you up again, let me tell you another officially legal and accepted use of the hard shoulder: acceleration. If your vehicle is too feeble to get up to motorway speeds on the acceleration lane, you are not only allowed, but expected to continue your acceleration on the hard shoulder until there is an acceptable velocity to enter the Autobahn like a Gentleman (i.e. fast). But try real acceleration before you resort to this, which rally legend Walter Röhrl describes thusly: “Acceleration happens when the tears of a deeply moved heart roll along horizontally towards the ears.”\n\n4. The Time\n\nThe best time to visit our Autobahnen is in the summer, because we’ll all be gone on holiday then. Typically, a German gets 30 days of vacation a year and receives extra payment for this very vacation, so that he may leave his country for a while. It is much easier to love Germany from afar.\n\nYou can find tables on the Internet detailing the school holidays of all the German federal states you want to visit for an inkling of the remaining Autobahn traffic you can expect. Warning: At the beginning or the end of these school holidays you can forget to go anywhere fast on the respective Autobahn that provides the fastest way to the German federal state of Mallorca.\n\nThere are also many speed limits that are only effective by day. You could for example go from Stuttgart to Munich in well under an hour at night … or so I have heard. And of course you will have the motorway network to yourself during all major football matches with Germany in them.\n\nConcerning the future of our motorways: You might have heard the German Green Party’s efforts to establish a general speed limit on the Autobahns. I can assure all you tourists this is something to yawn on and then forget. These efforts exist since before the Green Party existed. They have never gone anywhere. Green means GO!!!!!\n\nYou see, in general, Germans don’t care much about freedom. They will happily trade freedom for more order every time. But the Autobahn is the one exception. The freedom to drive as fast as we want is the only one we are prepared to fight for. To the German, speeding is like owning guns to the American. A general speed limit seems un-German to us, has a socialist stench, maybe even something French about it.\n\nSo I’m delighted to say that the unlimited speed of our Autobahns will be there for you as long as we German Autobahn Raser (a majority group) can still hold a weapon to defend your motoring holiday. Don’t worry about the cost: The German government collects nearly a Euro per liter as tax from your petrol bill and as I have said before: You will need A LOT of fuel.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nThe German Ministry of High Speed Transport Propaganda\n\nACHTUNG: As our Canadian overlords have put us on a financial starvation diet, which forces me to rent-out my wife into yellow slavery, while Derek takes a night job at Chippendales Toronto, I am unable to pay the Minister of High Speed Transport Propaganda a reasonable, or even an unreasonable amount. Therefore, we did cut a deal: You click here.\n\nIn mean, NOW. You are supposed to click, verdammt und zugenaeht! The link leads you (sorry) not to a porn site, but to Amazon, where you can buy the Kindle Edition of “The Traveller’s Guide to the German Autobahn” for a lousy buck eleven. BUY THE DAMN THING!!!!!!\n\nIf you do as told (and there is no other vay in Germany), then Clemens might come back. If not, I’ll come after YOU. Bertel",
  "latent_12556": "The intersection of mental health care and gun control are suddenly tragically, and finally, the subject on every congressman’s lips and under discussion by dozens of state governors. But the two policy issues could not be further apart in terms of legislative remedies. Though both are complex and thorny matters, their respective roadblocks to resolution are diametrically opposite.\n\nThe constitutional right to bear arms is nearly as old as our country but America’s mental health policy dates only from post-World War II. The 2nd amendment was ratified in 1791. Harry Truman signed the “National Mental Health Act,” into law in 1946.\n\nThough both issues are driven by unique interests, one constituency needs enormous investments of medical and psychological diagnostic research and a commitment to providing national and local support for overmatched families and schools educating thousands of children with special needs. On the other side of the checkbook, the gun owning citizenry is led by a well-informed private industry with seemingly limitless wealth — much of it dedicated to discouraging government legislators from authorizing restrictions.\n\n1 of 10 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × What some pro-gun lawmakers are saying after Newtown View Photos In the aftermath of the shooting, a number of NRA-supported legislators have come out in support of new gun laws or signaled a willingness to budge. Here’s who said what. Caption In the aftermath of the shooting, a number of NRA-supported legislators have come out in support of new gun laws or signaled a willingness to budge. Here’s who said what. In the aftermath of the Newtown, Conn., massacre, a number of traditionally pro-gun-rights legislators have come out in support of a ban on assault rifles, or otherwise signaled they may be willing to budge on new gun laws. The NRA gives lawmakers a grade on their gun stance , which can be influential in their elections. The scale ranges from an A-plus rating (the legislator consistently votes with the NRA and makes a “vigorous effort to promote and defend the Second Amendment”) to an F, (a “true enemy of gun owners’ rights”). If any gun-control measure were to be passed, it would need significant support of NRA allies who buck the group’s wishes. Scott Olson/GETTY IMAGES Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nThose populations most deeply affected, though each well-intentioned and noble, rarely overlap. Most parents of young (mostly) men suffering from psychotic episodes struggle mightily to protect and care for their ill sons while seeking ways to integrate them into the larger community. Most gun owners are careful and safety-minded, and the gun-manufacturing sector rightly argues that firearms are not solely at fault for the 12,000 murdered with their products each year.\n\nBut their issues have recently converged disastrously in the public square, at the movie theater, and unspeakably, inside the schoolhouse door. We can no longer ignore that these two seemingly intractable subjects bring out the worst in each other. Now the Obama administration and Congress will hear from proponents of both on how to resolve and pay for one problem and how to stop influence spending to avoid reforming the other.\n\nThey say politics make strange bedfellows, but no two interest groups are more oddly paired than parents of special needs children and the National Rifle Association.\n\nFor 14 years, since the justice department and Congress revealed industry research acknowledging tobacco’s health hazards, billions of dollars in financial settlements from the largest cigarette manufacturers has been directed to state and federal budgets. Though far too little, some money even trickles into anti-smoking programs.\n\nThe NRA announced Wednesday it is “prepared to offer meaningful contributions” to address the public’s growing concerns. Since it’s open season on big ideas, here’s one for the industry organization. I suggest the gun advocate proactively re-direct a big chunk of its lobbying budget to support mental health outreach projects.\n\nWe may well have to wait to remove guns from the NRA’s cold dead hands, but at least they could allocate some profits to keep the rest of us alive and well.",

  "latent_12601": "(Image: NASA/JPL/Caltech/IAS/SSC/N Flagey/A Noriega-Crespo) (Image: NASA/JPL/Caltech/IAS/SSC/N Flagey/A Noriega-Crespo)\n\nThe famous “pillars of creation” – clouds of dust and gas imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope, are no more – a supernova blast wave has blown them apart. But their ghostly image will linger for another thousand years because of the time it takes for light to travel from them to Earth.\n\nThe pillars have been astronomical icons since Hubble imaged them in 1995 (scroll down for Hubble image). They are part of a larger star-forming region called the Eagle Nebula, which lies 7000 light years away. That means we are seeing the pillars as they were 7000 years ago, when the light first left them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, an infrared image from the Spitzer Space Telescope has revealed a previously unseen supernova blast wave that was advancing towards the pillars at that time, threatening to ultimately sweep them away.\n\nIn tatters\n\nNicolas Flagey of the Institut d’Astrophysique Spatiale in Orsay, France, led a team that obtained the image. It shows a cloud of hot dust thought to have been heated by a supernova blast that likely occurred between 1000 and 2000 years earlier.\n\nBased on the cloud’s position, the blast wave looked set to hit the pillars in 1000 years. Taking into account the 7000-year time lag for their light to reach the Earth, that means the pillars were actually destroyed 6000 years ago, Flagey says.\n\nWe will not see their obliteration from Earth for another 1000 years, however. And when we do, they will be in tatters – Flagey says only a few patches of the pillars are dense enough to survive the blast. “All the other parts will crumble when the shock wave arrives,” he says.\n\nNow, his team is searching through historical records to see if ancient astronomers spotted the supernova responsible for the pillars’ destruction. It should have become visible on Earth 1000 to 2000 years ago, but while a few candidate events have been found in the right time frame, so far none has been confirmed as the culprit.\n\nStellar wind\n\nBut Stephen Reynolds of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, US, is not convinced the hot dust cloud is the result of a supernova explosion. The expanding gas, or remnant, from the event should emit much stronger radio waves and X-rays than have been observed, he says.\n\n“I believe that a supernova remnant less than 2000 years old at a distance of less than 6000 light years would have to have quite unusual properties to have avoided detection to this point,” he told New Scientist.\n\nInstead, he suggests that hot, high-speed winds from massive stars in the region could have heated up the dust grains in the cloud. If so, the presence of this hot gas would still erode the pillars of creation over time, he says.\n\nThe results were presented on Tuesday at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle, Washington, US.",
  "latent_12656": "Photo\n\nIt is widely known that being overweight or obese is linked to an increased risk for cardiovascular and other diseases. Now a new study has found that even in young adults of normal weight, increases in body mass index also lead to increased risk.\n\nResearchers studied 12,664 young adults, testing them for 32 gene variants known to be associated with higher B.M.I., and assigning a “gene score” to each depending on how many of the genetic variants they carried. By studying such a large population, they were able to separate genetic tendencies toward weight gain from other variables that may contribute to being overweight, such as diet, physical activity levels and socioeconomic status.\n\nElevated B.M.I. and numerous blood indications of metabolic risk closely matched higher gene scores, strongly suggesting that higher B.M.I. alone causes the increase in cardiovascular risk factors independent of fatty food consumption, exercise, smoking and other variables.\n\nThe study, online in PLOS Medicine, also analyzed 1,488 people who had metabolic profiles done after six years and found that increases in B.M.I., even within the normal range, led to extensive adverse metabolic changes, while modest weight loss led to multiple favorable changes.\n\n“Our study in young adults shows that even a modest weight loss tends to improve the metabolic profile,” said the lead author, Peter Würtz, head of molecular epidemiology at the University of Oulu in Finland. “It doesn’t have to be a large change to have a beneficial role. Even with a normal B.M.I. of 24, it’s worth it to try to get it lower.”",

Nickerson recalled how the Doctors Without Borders caregiver appeared to be a typical young woman, dressed nicely and a little nervous about being photographed. \"But then, she put on her scrubs. ... She became very calm, a little bit introverted,\" the photographer said.\n\n-- Ella Watson-Stryker is a Doctors Without Borders health promoter who has been in West Africa since March. The American was uneasy during the 10 minutes it took to shoot her photo, Nickerson said. \"She was distracted, she wanted to do other things.\"\n\n-- Dr. Kent Brantly became the first American infected while running a treatment center in Monrovia.

  "latent_13031": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nDuring an alternative-fact-filled interview with Bill O’Reilly on Sunday, President Donald Trump launched into a diatribe about California pushing back against his immigration policies, suggesting that he would try to cut off the Golden State’s federal funding. “We give tremendous amounts of money to California,” he said. “California in many ways is out of control, as you know.”\n\nAssuming that Trump was speaking on behalf of the federal government, he was, in fact, correct that “we” give lots of money to California. Annually, the feds spend nearly $368 billion in California, which includes everything from paying government contracts to cutting Social Security checks. Yet implicit in Trump’s comments was the assumption that Californians are gobbling up or blowing through “tremendous amounts” of government spending without paying their fair share in return. That’s wrong.\n\nAn accumulation of data from various sources shows that California routinely pays more in federal taxes than it receives in federal spending. A 2015 study by the New York state comptroller found that in 2013 Californians paid $9,086 per capita in federal taxes and received $9,040 per capita in federal spending—or about 99 cents of spending for every tax dollar. (This is an improvement: The Tax Foundation found that California received about 78 cents in spending for every tax dollar in 2005, and Census and IRS data showed the state getting back 87 cents on the dollar in 2010.) In comparison, the average state gets about $1.29 in federal money for every dollar it sends to Washington.\n\nCalifornia pays about 13 percent of all federal taxes and receives about 11 percent of federal expenditures. It’s one of 11 states with a deficit between what it pays the feds and what it gets back. New Jersey has the biggest annual gap between spending and taxes, at more than $2,600 per person. New Mexico enjoys the biggest surplus, at more than $7,700 per person.\n\nHere’s how all the states stack up in terms of federal taxes paid and spending received.\n\nStates pay a wide range of taxes per capita. Connecticut pays nearly $14,000 per person, while Mississippians pay about $4,800 apiece.\n\nFederal spending by state also varies widely. Swamp-adjacent Virginia gets more than $16,800 per person. (Washington, DC, itself brings in a whopping $65,000 per resident.) Arid Utah, on the other hand, gets just $7,000 per person per year.\n\nMeanwhile, there remains insufficient data to calculate how much Trump has paid in taxes relative to the tremendous amounts of benefits he has received from the federal government.",

For example Litecoin was forked from the Bitcoin Core client primarily by having a decreased block generation time of 2.5 min’s, increasing the maximum number of coins and using a different hashing algorithm (scrypt instead of SHA-256).\n\nHowever there are many other complex factors that determine if a fork survives and has any value. Such as attracting mining power (if POW), getting listed on exchanges, preventing replay attacks, having a working wallet and finally having people willing to buy it. At the end of the day, just like anything in life, a Cryptocurrency is only worth what somebody is willing to pay for it.\n\nSo what the fork is happening with Bitcoingold BTG?\n\nWell this is just another software fork using Bitcoin Core as a starting reference. Therefore if successful holders of BTC will technically also hold an equal amount of the new coin up to the point of the split.\n\nHowever before you go putting the deposit down on your Lambo there are some very important things to consider.\n\nFirstly this is not some high profile fork being implemented by an experienced, transparent team of developers with community backing. The effort is being led by Jack Liao, CEO of LighteningAsic a miner manufacturer, a Chinese financial backer simply known as Wubi and anonymous lead developer called H4x3rotab.\n\nSecondly if your BTC is held in an exchange, you will only receive BTG if they decide to support it and credit it to you. Only two exchanges have so far committed to BTG, Bitexchange (Hong Kong) and relatively unknown Bitstar.\n\nUpdate 19/10/2017 – Yobit exchange have also signalled support for BitcoinGold.\n\nThirdly the project has not yet added strong replay protection to its proposed software. If this is not resolved then you could potentially lose your original Bitcoin (BTC) when moving it from your wallet if not done correctly.\n\nFinally one of the biggest criticisms aimed at the project is its decision to “pre-mine” or mine the new blockchain themselves before its released. This give the developers a potentially large amount of coins to sell or dump as they see fit. The lead developer “H4x3rotab” commented the amount of pre-mine would be “at most one percent of the total supply”.\n\nIn any case be careful when the fork arrives and do your research before making any sales or transfers.\n\n22/10/2017 Update\n\nGreat article from Bittrex confirming support for BTG but highlighting many of my concerns mentioned above https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002320451",

I've already done the obvious stuff, like replace lightbulbs -- especially the 500W halogens floodlights I have outdoors -- with low-power LEDs, and I'm being more careful as to how I use heating and cooling. But along with making big changes, I've also been looking at just how much power all the random stuff I have plugged in uses.\n\nA while back, I looked at how much power smartphone chargers consumed when there wasn't a smartphone attached to them. Now let's look at how much power it takes to charge a smartphone for a year.\n\nAlso: Best cheap phones: $300 (or much less) buys a great iPhone\n\nNow, the proper way to do this test would be to measure the power consumption over a year. Well, I want results quicker than that, so I'd have to do shorter periods of real-world testing and extrapolate out the results, which shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo, here's what I did rather than keep detailed charging note for a year, or find how much power it took just to charge the battery from 0 percent to 100 percent, and try to fudge that into some real-world figure. I replicated what most people do and put my smartphone on to charge overnight and measured the nightly power consumption.\n\nAlso: The first Android phone was an ugly thing, and I loved it CNET\n\nI chose this method for two reasons:\n\nIt's a usage pattern that matches how many people use their device\n\nIt is more real-world, since when the device is on charge overnight, not only is power being used to charge the battery, but also to run the device (remember, your device is doing stuff in the background like checking email), so this goes beyond just measuring the power used to charge the battery\n\nPower consumption was measured using a WattsUp? PRO power meter.\n\nMy test subject was the iPhone 6 Plus, which had the biggest battery that Apple offered at the time of my test. I'm also a pretty heavy user, and this meant that going all day was sometimes tricky (the things I do for you). This means that my results are going to be at the high-end, and that more restrained smartphone users are going to have a smaller power bill.\n\nSo here's what I found.\n\nAlso: 17 ways to recycle or sell your smartphone TechRepublic\n\nDuring an overnight charge, the iPhone consumed an average of 19.2 Wh.\n\nAccording to figures published by the US Energy Information Administration for July 2018 (the latest figures currently avaialble), the average cost per kWh in the US was $0.13.\n\nRemember that 1 kWh equals 1,000 Wh.\n\nSo, take our average of 19.2 Wh per day, multiplying that by 365 days, we get 7 kWh, which works out at $0.91 a year.\n\nSo if you guess under a dollar, well done.\n\nPrevious and related coverage:\n\nWant a new iPhone or Android smartphone?

  "latent_13386": "The Navy plans to perform an aerial refueling for the first time on its carrier-launched demonstrator drone aircraft, the X-47B, within the next few weeks, service officials said.\n\nThe refueling, to take place at Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Md., will have the X-47B link up with an Omega air refueling tanker, Navy officials told Military.com. Omega is a contractor that works with the Defense Department.\n\nThe X-47B made history when it flew from a carrier in May and November of 2013 and is now working on streamlining carrier deck operations and maneuvers with manned aircraft.\n\nThe Navy has launched and landed a carrier-based drone in rapid succession with an F/A-18 fighter jet as part of a series of joint manned and unmanned flight tests aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt in August of last year off the coast of Norfolk, Va., service officials said.\n\nAfter an eight minute flight, the X-47B executed an arrested landing, folded its wings and taxied out of the landing area before moving out of the way for an F/A-18 to land, Navy officials said.\n\nNavy engineers worked on some slight modifications to the X-47B aircraft in order to allow it to both land and integrate in rapid succession with fixed-wing fighter jets.\n\nThe refueling will happen as the UCLASS program faces stiff criticism from prominent members of Congress who continue to push for a stealthy, long-endurance, penetrating strike platform.\n\nAn ongoing Pentagon intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or ISR, review is currently exploring the range of desired capabilities for the Navy’s Unmanned Carrier Launched Aircraft Surveillance and Strike system, or UCLASS.\n\nThe thrust of the examination focuses on how stealthy the new first-of-its kind carrier-launched drone needs to be, how much of a weapons payload it will be configured to carry and deliver and how far it will be engineered to fly with and without aerial refueling.\n\nRelated Video\n\nThe Navy had planned to launch a competition among vendors to build the UCLASS through the release of what’s called a Request For Proposal, or RFP this past summer. However, concerns from lawmakers, analysts and some Pentagon leaders wound up resulting in a substantial delay for the competition in order to allow time for a formal review of needed requirements for the platform.\n\nDeputy Defense Secretary Bob Work said the ongoing review is making progress but the Pentagon and Navy are still not ready to move forward yet with a formal proposal.\n\n\"We decided this year we were almost ready to launch the RFP, but we decided we need to take a pause because we want to consider the UCLASS as part of the joint family of unmanned surveillance strike systems and make sure that we're going after the right capabilities,\" Work said at a recent speech at the U.S. Naval Institute.\n\nWork was likely referring to the manner in which every major platform or weapons system needs to be integrated with other services in order to operate properly in a joint combat environment, said Loren Thompson, vice president of the Lexington Institute, a Virginia-based think tank.\n\nAerial refueling technology is central to the debates about UCLASS because larger fuel tanks affect the size, shape and contours of the body of the aircraft and affect its stealth properties by changing the radar cross-section of the aircraft.\n\nSome design proposals for UCLASS would make the drone less stealthy and less able to carry a larger weapons payload – yet be able to travel very long distances as an ISR platform. Other proposals focus more on stealth and weapons payload.\n\nIf UCLASS were designed for maximum stealth and weapons-carrying potential from its inception, engineers would most likely envision an aircraft with a comparatively smaller tank in order to lower the radar cross-section of the aircraft. A differently-configured fuel tank might result in the need for more aerial refueling as a way to extend the aircraft’s range and ensure long-endurance ISR, analysts have explained.\n\nIn 2013, the Navy awarded four contracts valued at $15 million for preliminary design review for the UCLASS to Boeing, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.\n\nThe ongoing uncertainty and disagreements about UCLASS requirements could mean that the platform might wind up getting cancelled if sequestration returns in 2016, Thompson added.\n\n-- Kris Osborn can be reached at kris.osborn@military.com",

  "latent_13767": "TL;DR: Skills and exploration; story revisions; the benefits of a lengthy preproduction; Adam Heine promoted to Design Lead\n\nHi,\n\nJust a quick update to talk about where we’re currently at as we enter the holiday season.\n\nAs you may have heard, the Wasteland 2 Early Beta went out to eligible backers last week and is now available on Steam as an early access title. The Wasteland 2 Beta was not part of any of our Torment tiers, but if you selected access to the Wasteland 2 Beta as an add-on, hopefully you saw one of our early announcements about this, received your beta key through the Torment pledge management system (pretty much all digital rewards for Torment pledges will be distributed through that system), and are playing it already. (If not, please write our support team and we’ll get it taken care of.)\n\nCongratulations to the entire Wasteland 2 team for reaching this point!\n\nA Few Words on Preproduction\n\nI wanted to speak a bit about how Torment is progressing. The last round of major story revisions has been completed (more on that below) and we’ve resumed fleshing out and designing specific areas. Artist Aaron Meyers (who was also an artist on Planescape: Torment) has been making great progress on an environment prototype, proving out our art pipelines and helping us assess how the density of our design content will feel in the game. We don’t have any new art to share yet, but expect us to have something for you to see before winter’s end.\n\nFor a while now, some of you have been asking when we’d be transitioning from preproduction to production. With Wasteland 2’s recent early beta release, you may be aware that the inXile team will be spending more time on that game to get it done right—one of the fundamental benefits of Kickstarter is that we have the direction from our backers to emphasize quality over punctuality. This decision impacts Torment because most of the production team (e.g., programmers, artists, animators, etc.) will be moving onto Torment later than originally expected, which means we’ll be in preproduction for a longer period of time.\n\nBelieve it or not, this is the best situation from the perspective of Torment. When you’re in production with a large team, trying to incorporate any new idea can result in a lot of wasted work and confusion. (An “idea” in this sense could be many different things: an improvement to how conversation data is authored that enables a new type of dialogue reactivity, a new technique for handling shadow-casting lights in environments, a major change to an existing companion that improves the overall party dynamics, etc.) So when considering the new idea, you either accept this negative impact or discard the idea.\n\nWith a small preproduction team, the negative impacts have a smaller effect and the values of the ideas are more about the benefits they provide. Fewer people also means fewer miscommunications and greater flexibility both to experiment and to iterate. The closer you can get to your final design and technology before you are creating content at a rapid pace, the better the final result will be. So extra preproduction time is very beneficial, as long as you that time includes prototyping in-engine and iterating on the design instead of expanding the game’s scope.\n\nWe approached our preproduction aware that we might begin production later. On a traditionally funded project, you can ultimately be forced to make some decisions that you know are bad for the overall project to meet a specific schedule, but because we are free from external milestones, we can flexibly adapt, keeping our focus on the overall quality of the final game. It can be challenging to think that far ahead, but it’s even more challenging if you have rigid short-term goals binding you.\n\nIt’s true that if you just extend preproduction without any making any other changes to your plans, you’ll go over budget and over schedule. But the productivity improvements you gain through a longer preproduction period make up for the added cost of having a small team in preproduction for longer. (This is one reason, for example, that expansion packs are much cheaper to make than full titles – the development cycle for the original title is effectively part of the expansion’s preproduction.)\n\nWe’ll let you know if we ever determine that Torment’s release will be delayed beyond the first half of 2015. Thus far, our extended preproduction has been a very good thing and at this time I don’t anticipate it will push us out of that release date window.\n\nKevin out.\n\nSkills and Exploration\n\nAdam here. It's been a while since I've gotten to tell you about system design, so today I wanted to talk a bit about skills in Torment and how they feed into our exploration gameplay.\n\nSkills and Difficult Tasks\n\nAs you may recall from our talk about dialogue, skills work differently in Numenera than in most RPGs. In Numenera, skills don't define what you can do, but they do make success more consistent in related tasks.\n\nInstead of designing with skills in mind, we design the tasks first. Anything you want to try to do – lie to an Oorgolian soldier, activate a long-dormant intelligence, manipulate an unfamiliar beam weapon, or dodge the lethal bite of a steel spider – is considered a Difficult Task. Every Task is assigned a difficulty level, a stat the Task is based on (Might, Speed, or Intellect), and an optional skill (or skills) that can apply. (In the tabletop game, difficulties range from 1 to 10; unmodified difficulties from 4-6 are tough (> 50% chance of failure), and difficulties of 7 and up are impossible without the modifiers discussed below).\n\nSkills have four levels (Inability, Untrained, Trained, and Specialization). Training in any applicable skills lowers the difficulty by a step and specialization lowers it another step. (And as you might imagine, inability increases the difficulty, though inability is something you have to specifically choose through perhaps your descriptor or focus, and some skills don’t go lower than untrained). You'll notice that tasks at the highest difficulty are impossible even with specialization. Either multiple skills would have to apply to such tasks, or there must be another way to lower the difficulty.\n\nAnd there is. In Numenera, another way – at higher levels, the primary way – to reduce the difficulty of a task is Effort. You can apply Effort by using points from your related Stat Pool (Might, Speed, or Intellect), up to a maximum Effort level determined by your character’s Tier (or level). Each level of Effort you spend lowers the difficulty by one more step. (There’s another stat called Edge that reduces the cost of using Effort, making lower-level tasks easier or even free as your character advances, but that’s a topic for another time.)\n\nWhat this means is that anyone can have a chance of success at most tasks, if they're willing to spend their resources on Effort. Characters with applicable skills do not have a monopoly on related tasks, but they do have two advantages: they conserve their Stat Pools (saving Effort for the tasks that really matter) and they have a greater chance of success at previously impossible tasks.\n\nDisabling Traps\n\nThe concepts of Difficult Tasks and Effort feed into every aspect of gameplay. Take the common exploration-style task of disabling traps. Like any other task, disabling a given trap will have a Difficulty associated with it (and you will be notified of this Difficulty, at least in an abstract way such as \"Hard,\" \"Very Hard,\" \"Impossible,\" etc.). By spending Effort from the associated Stat Pool, you can lower that difficulty (probably Speed, though it could depend on the kind of trap).\n\nAnd it will have skills that apply. Torment won't have a Disable Traps skill, but the Quick Fingers skill applies to this kind of task (as well as others). Training or specialization in Quick Fingers will lower the difficulty even further. But more than that, certain traps may have other skills that apply. For example, the difficulty to disable a mechanical trap might be lowered if you are trained or specialized in Lore: Machinery, but a transdimensional trap might allow Lore: Mystical to apply, or Lore: Civilizations if the trap has shifting runes for you to decipher, etc.\n\nYou might find that, for certain special traps, the nano in your party is just as equipped to disable it as the jack (one being trained in Lore, the other in Quick Fingers), so if one fails, the other can take a shot at it (because each character's first attempt is free, but further attempts will cost you something—assuming your disabling attempt doesn't set off the trap, of course). For some traps, maybe the nano is even better equipped, or at least doesn't have to spend as much Effort to achieve the same chance of success.\n\nOther Exploration Tasks\n\nIf you can't (or don't want to) disable a trap, maybe you can jump over it? Not jumping like a platform game; it would be a specific action you take—like bashing a door or picking a lock—where you end up on the other side of the trap when you're done. We're talking about this and other alternatives (levitation, anyone?). Jumping would be like any task: Might-based Effort for which the Jumping skill can apply. Some traps might be extra tricky to disable but easy for your whole party to jump over. Other traps might be harder to jump over, but the means to disable it lies within easy reach on the other side, such that one party member can spend some Effort to get over the trap and turn it off.\n\nThe flexibility of Numenera's skill system gives us extra options for environmental puzzles. For us, a \"puzzle\" isn't an attempt to divine the will of the designer, but rather an obstacle with multiple solutions involving various Difficult Tasks and their applicable Effort and skills. To get at the beating heart of some ancient machine, you might smash through its cardiac gate, bypass the whisperlock, persuade the machine's custodian to give you a key, use a cypher to walk through the gate, etc. All of these are different tasks with different applicable skills, any of which you might try based on your party's skills and available Effort.\n\nAnd if we're being true to our philosophies, different solutions can each have reactivity of their own (smashing down the gate might trigger extra defenses, persuading the custodian could mean you've gained a friend or used up a favor for another quest, using the cypher means you won't have it for a later task, etc.), ultimately resulting in more interesting replayability across the board.\n\nAdam out.\n\nStory Time!\n\nColin here. You may have seen this picture of Adam, Kevin, Steve, and I standing in the inXile office together at the culmination of our intensive meetings there last month. But we weren’t just standing around smiling the whole time (we almost forgot to take the picture in fact). In actuality, much of what we were doing was hammering down the last stray nails of the upgraded story—\n\n::record scratch:: “What do you mean, upgraded story? Like, you re-wrote it?”\n\nNo. We *revised* it. It's different.\n\nLike game development, writing is an iterative process that requires occasional sledgehammers... and we wanted to make sure our foundation was as strong as possible. On this project in particular—a thematic successor to one of the most beloved CRPGs of all time—we want to make sure we get it right. It’s a rare writer who can spit out perfection the first time (and if you know one, please send him or her my way).\n\nAs the Creative Lead on this project, it’s my job to make sure we don’t settle for “good enough” on the story. To that end, we took the original story, examined its component pieces, and reassembled it in a different (and better) configuration. We kept all the elements we described in the Kickstarter—all the characters, all the items, all the *everything* except the fine details of the narrative. This was a reorganization of our elements in a way that is more focused, clearer, and more entertaining.\n\nWhich is to say, our original story was good, but now (if I may be immodest for a moment) I think it’s pretty great. With the combined talents of Adam, Kevin, Chris Avellone, Tony Evans, Nathan Long, and George Ziets, it had better be.\n\nAnyway, as I was saying, much of what we were doing was hammering down the last stray nails of the upgraded story and making sure that we are ready to bring our outside writing talent to bear on a number of different areas at once. We now have a unified set of documents that will bear the combined scrutiny of some excellent writers, effectively share our vision for the story, and help us gauge the player’s experience throughout. These are our Story Spines.\n\nThat sounds a little creepy and maybe a bit murder-y, so let me explain what I mean: a spine is a firm through-line of the story, the pieces on which the rest of the experience hangs. The first and most important is the PC’s Spine. This is the narrative of the game as experienced by the PC (and thus you, the player), from the very beginning of the game to the end, laid out from point to point. We took our design doc and stripped out all the extraneous details and the information that the player might never know—even if this was information that would inform the motivations of the other major characters in the game, if the player didn’t know it at the time, we moved it to where the player would learn it or removed it from the PC Spine altogether.\n\nDoing this exposed some potential problems in the plot of the game, and it was invaluable to us in making sure we have written a whole and cohesive through-line for you to experience. We did the same thing for other major characters in the game: what’s their history? What do they know, and when do they know it? What are they trying to achieve at any given moment in the story?\n\nWe had these spines written and ready for the meetings we had in November, with significant input from George and Tony. Then we borrowed the talents of Chris Avellone and Nathan Long to tear them apart, and we rebuilt them again—faster, stronger, better. After making sure we had all these details fully ironed out, we had several more meetings, in which I gave a summary of the improved game to a variety of teams, starting with Brian Fargo and Matt Findley. After that first meeting, Brian said (and I paraphrase): “This is awesome. This is the story for this game. Go.”\n\nWe then presented the story a few more times to several other groups—the art team, the programming team, the designers—and I upgraded my Fast Talk skill to Specialized [Adam: not a real Torment skill], tearing through a high-level summary of the game in about 10 minutes (Kevin and Adam took over the meetings after those speeches while I recovered with a tank of oxygen).\n\nBarring a few minor changes and detail fixes, these spines form the core of the Torment story. We’ve provided four writers with some design constraints for their areas and these spines, and I’m anticipating some very cool ideas back at the start of the new year.\n\nOh, and maybe I should mention down here that we’re working on quests and storylines for multiple particular areas, and as soon as I’m done with this post, I’m back to crafting the first player experience in the game. It’s looking... pretty good.\n\nColin out!\n\nA Promotion\n\nKevin again. It’s my pleasure to announce that Adam Heine has accepted a promotion to the role of Design Lead for Torment. From the beginning he has played a key role in the design of the game, and he has repeatedly demonstrated to everyone involved in the project that he has a strong command of the sensibilities that will make this game great. Adam’s ownership of various aspects of system and area design has grown over the past months, and when he visited inXile’s office last month, I formally recognized his contributions by promoting him to Design Lead. In this role, he’ll be leading the design vision of the game much as Colin is leading the creative vision. Though honestly, Adam's work hasn't changed very much – the promotion is largely an official acknowledgement of what he’d already been doing.\n\nColin brought Adam onto the fledgling project last year and wanted to provide some backstory and share his own thoughts:\n\n“Adam came on board Planescape: Torment early during the development process, when all we had was a Mortuary. We desperately needed scripters to create the rest of the Planes. He quickly distinguished himself as an agile thinker, extremely creative, and able to solve problems by approaching them from multiple different angles. He showed his excellence in catching bugs, in creating scripts, and in delivering new ideas for quests and characters.\n\nAfter PST shipped, he became a designer on Black Isle's TORN. But eventually he had to succumb to reality, realizing that as a newlywed, he shouldn’t be commuting an hour and a half (each way!) to Irvine from San Diego every day, and that 60-80 hours a week of work wasn’t a recipe for a happy marriage. So he left Interplay and took a standard programming job closer to home... and eventually he packed up and moved to Thailand to foster orphans.\n\nYears passed. In that time, he has continued to flex his creative muscle by writing novels and short stories, all while raising as many as 10 kids at once. He’s also continued to design board and computer games in his spare time, but without a production team, they’re mostly thought exercises. Fortunately, you don't need a production team to write fiction.\n\nLast year, Eurogamer had a small PST retrospective with Chris Avellone, Halo 4’s lead designer Scott Warner, Adam, and me. At the end of it, Adam said that he’d love to get back into games. I said I’d love to work with him again sometime—I had nothing but positive experiences with him on PST.\n\nIt was shortly after that that Brian Fargo asked me if I’d like to work on a new Torment. And it was mere moments after that I strongly suggested that Adam be involved. Adam has proven the wisdom of that decision over and over again on this project. He has helped me shape the story from the outset. He has delivered reams of excellent design work: from loot to inventory to crafting to area design to... well, he’s been touching almost every system in the game.\n\nAnd while we were out in California a couple of weeks ago, his hard work and insight paid off. Kevin offered him the position of Design Lead, and Adam accepted. Adam is an extraordinary designer, and I’m proud to be working alongside him.”\n\nCongratulations, Adam! (And thanks!)\n\nHope you all have a great holiday season!\n\nKevin Saunders\n\nProject Lead",
  "latent_13803": "You say it's your birthday? It's California's birthday, too. On September 9, 1850, it became the 31st state in the Union. Let's celebrate with 19 facts about the Golden State.\n\n1. The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War. The U.S. paid Mexico $15 million for war damages. In turn, Mexico ceded nearly half of its territory, including California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Colorado, Nevada, and Utah.\n\n2. California was originally known as the Bear State. As California boomed—and the bear population was wiped out—it became the Golden State.\n\n3. The grizzly bear on California's current state flag is a tribute to Monarch, the last wild California grizzly bear. In 1899, newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst paid a reporter named Allen Kelley to capture the animal. Monarch was sent to San Francisco, where he lived at Woodward's Garden and then Golden Gate Park. He was a star attraction until his death in 1911. The last reported sighting of a wild California grizzly bear was in 1924.\n\n4. But the original Bear Flag had nothing to do with Monarch. It dates back to 1846, two years before the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. A group of Americans who'd settled in California, which was then part of Mexico, feared they'd be expelled. They invaded the Mexican outpost at Sonoma and captured the retired general Mariano Vallejo. A few days later they raised the first Bear Flag and called the land the California Republic.\n\n5. The California Republic only existed for 26 days. U.S. Army Major John C. Frémont soon replaced the Bear Flag with the U.S. flag, which takes us back to the beginning of this post and the Mexican-American War.\n\n6. And who designed the original flag? William Todd, nephew of Mary Todd Lincoln. It's a small historical world.\n\n7. The one-word state motto, \"Eureka,\" hearkens back to the exciting days of the Gold Rush. But it doesn't include an exclamation point. The first \"Eureka!\" is attributed to the Greek scholar Archimedes. According to legend, he had an epiphany as he stepped into a bathtub and watched the water level rise—he realized that the volume of the displaced water was equal to the volume of the foot he'd submerged. And then he ran out of the room to tell others about his discovery ... while he was completely naked. (More on whether that ever actually happened here.)\n\n8. In 2013, the states of California and New York tied for the fourth-highest average credit score in the U.S.—653. (Minnesota was the victor, with an average score of 658.)\n\n9. California is the only state that's hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics.\n\n10. Most of the U.S. athletes competing in the 2012 London Olympics came from California. But take that with a grain of salt—one out of every eight Americans is from California.\n\n11. The first step to getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: Work in entertainment. The second: Pay a $30,000 nomination fee. Living celebrities are required to appear at their star's unveiling. (Barbra Streisand is the only person who got away with missing the event.) All of the Munchkins from The Wizard of Oz—122 adults and 12 children—share one star.\n\n12. The fortune cookie was inspired by the Japanese cookie o-mikuji and invented in California.\n\n13. I can haz state recognition? In 1973, the sabre-tooth cat, Smilodon californicus, became California's state fossil. A year earlier, Assemblyman W. Craig Biddle had nominated the cockroach-like trilobite for the honor. Nearly 2000 museum curators and fossil experts backed him, but the bill never made it to a vote. A year later, the sabre-tooth cat made it to the floor and passed. The one no-vote? Senator W. Craig Biddle.\n\n14. Except for Alaska, California contains more forestland than any other state.\n\n15. Despite living in Los Angeles for 78 years, writer Ray Bradbury never learned to drive.\n\n16. California's most famous for its Gold Rush in 1849, but it also had a Silver Rush in the Calico Mountains from 1881 to 1896. By 1904, Calico was a ghost town.\n\n17. The mineral benitoite can be found in California, Japan, and Arkansas, but only San Benito County, California has it in gemstone quality deposits. The California State Gem Mine in Coalinga allows the public to dig and take home a quart-sized bag of treasure.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\n18. Thousands of U.S. banks failed after the 1929 stock market crash—by 1933, only 11,000 were left. All of San Francisco's banks survived.\n\n19. The highest point in the contiguous U.S., 14,494-foot Mt. Whitney, is only 76 miles from the lowest point in the contiguous U.S., Death Valley. They're both in Cali- well, you know.",
  "latent_13826": "With President Barack Obama further tarnishing his Nobel Peace Prize by starting yet another Middle Eastern war, exuberant Neoconservatives claim their moment has arrived. And that was before Chuck Hagel, long the Neocon bête noire, was tossed underfoot. In fact, their moment has arrived, though not in the way they believe. The spectacle of Washington using the military in Iraq to destroy equipment provided by Washington in its last Iraq war illustrates the absurdity of the Neocons' claim that war-mongering and nation-building serve America's interests.\n\nIn 2001 President George W. Bush initiated what was supposed to be The Neocon Moment, projecting a swaggering global presence in which the U.S. would bomb, invade, occupy, and otherwise intervene whenever and for whatever reason it chose. Autocrats would flee, candies would be tossed, enemies would be defeated, flowers would bloom, allies would comply, cakewalks would be held, democrats would flourish, and the lion would lie down with the lamb.\n\nAlas, administration policy wrecked Iraq. Although President Bush never repudiated what he'd done, he appeared to lose his taste for war. Vice President Dick Cheney became a forlorn figure, pining for the old Bush. Washington still attempted to micro-manage the globe, but adopted a gentler tone and refrained from invading more countries.\n\nCandidate Obama ran against the Bush presidency, but little changed U.S. foreign policy. President Obama followed his predecessor's exit plan from Iraq, pursued the Bush program in Afghanistan with additional troops, promised even greater support to populous and prosperous Asian and European allies, launched deadly drone campaigns in Pakistan and Yemen, increased military spending throughout his first term, promoted democracy in the Arab world (with similar results), and started two new wars. Rather like the chastened Bush, President Obama used a friendlier tone and seemed reluctant even when he was starting a war. But no one could mistake the latter as a peacenik libertarian.\n\nExcept, apparently, for the Neocons. Horrified by the isolationist backwater they believed America became under Obama, they now proclaim The Neocon Moment. Explained Matthew Continetti, \"monsters [have been] brought forth by American retreat,\" and \"the threat of those monsters requires unilateral deadly force wherever necessary to kill our enemies and deter our foes.\"\n\nRetreat?\n\nAdmittedly, Obama could have done more from a Neoconservative standpoint. Bombing raids over Tehran and Damascus would have gladdened the hearts of ivory tower generalissimos everywhere. Deploying troops against the Russians in Ukraine would have been more fun than a collegiate game of Risk. Sending the 7th Fleet to safeguard Japan's claim to the Senkakus would have created an exciting confrontation with China. Threatening Beijing over Hong Kong's protests would have satisfied with sanctimonious chest-thumping.\n\nYet even Bush might not have obliged in these cases. He didn't choose war with Iran, refused to challenge Moscow in its conflict with Georgia, and adopted a cooperative attitude toward Beijing. His end-of-term caution looked a lot like Obama's approach today.\n\nAs well it should. More than a decade of foreign policy defined as \"what Washington says goes\" has been a bust. It would have been disastrous for a lesser nation. The good news for America is that when superpowers screw up, even badly, the greatest costs fall upon others. The bad news is that might change if the U.S. ever triggers a real war with a real adversary, one with nuclear weapons.\n\nIn fact, \"The Neocon Moment\" is distinguished by its failure. As evidence of the need for a return to swaggering interventionism Continetti offers a parade of horrors either created by Washington or well beyond its control. While we all know what John McCain & Co. would do in response to Continetti's examples -- bomb someone, anyone! -- doing so would solve nothing.\n\nThere's the Islamic State, which exists only because of the misguided Bush invasion of Iraq. Like modern liberals at home, neoconservatives use the ill consequences of their earlier wars to justify new wars. This one, argue Neoconservatives, justifies another round for ground troops.\n\nThere's also Ukraine, a testament to what happens when one encourages one's allies to be helpless dependents while facing an adversary with a far greater interest in the outcome of any confrontation. There are al-Qaeda affiliates in several countries, which arose in response to promiscuous U.S. meddling abroad and persisted in the midst of multiple wars even while under attack by Special Forces, drones, and more.\n\nThere's Hamas, now contained by Israel, which won an election demanded by the Bush administration. There's Iran, in which Islamists overthrew a U.S.-supported dictator who took power in a U.S.-supported coup. There's the Taliban, which survived more than a dozen years of Washington's efforts at nation-building. There's China, in which the Communist Party demonstrated its determination to preserve power during the first Bush administration.\n\nNeocons have no answer to any of these. They imagine a world of immaculate intervention, in which foreigners welcome being killed and never strike back. Washington should just bomb, invade, and occupy, never mind the enemies created or hostilities engendered. If there is blowback, the U.S. should double down and bomb, invade, and occupy some more.\n\nIn fact, terrorism is a common political tool, long used by the weak against the strong. Two Russian Czars and an Austro-Hungarian Arch-Duke were felled in terrorist assaults. India, Sri Lanka, Israel, Russia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Spain, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and other states all suffered from terrorism. America was targeted for its actions, not its freedoms. Understanding consequences is to explain, not justify. The simple fact is the more Washington attempts to micro-manage the globe, the more likely it is to be attacked.\n\nNeocons also imagine a world in which America automatically deters and only America deters. If the U.S. president raises his voice foreign autocrats will cringe. If he indicates his willingness to use military force Russia will retreat from Georgia and Ukraine. If his officials make a few appropriate threats China will abandon its claims to Taiwan and Pacific territories, and perhaps even Hong Kong. If American leaders offer the right incantations Iran and North Korea will abandon their nuke programs. No one would dare challenge Washington, at least it is exercises \"leadership.\"\n\nIn fact, countries with the most at stake will risk and spend more than their adversaries, as the U.S. demonstrated during the Cold War in Latin America. Russia and China are no different. Moreover, they are no less adept at playing the game of deterrence. Does the U.S. have anything at stake in Ukraine and the Senkakus which warrants the risk of war? Is Washington prepared to spend what is necessary to overcome Russian and Chinese deterrent capabilities? The answer is no in both cases.\n\nNeocons imagine America is strongest when it keeps its allies dependent and weak. Of course, Washington wants them all to do more militarily, but only under its direction. Allies are not to speak unless spoken to, but always should feel reassured that America will do whatever is necessary to protect them. Thus, the U.S. must dominate whenever it is involved, which is always.\n\nYet governments, no less than individuals, respond to incentives. So long as Washington promises to defend allied states, irrespective of how prosperous or populous (for instance, South Korea enjoys a 40-1 economic and 2-1 population edge over North Korea), it discourages them from doing more on their own behalf. Indeed, even during the Cold War America's Asian and European dependents routinely underinvested in defense and subsidized their adversaries while being shielded by the U.S. military. It is even worse today. Why should America be expected to risk Los Angeles to protect Seoul or Tokyo, Tallinn or Warsaw?\n\nOne doesn't have to look far to see the wreckage left by today's interventionist consensus, generally advanced by Neocons, nationalist hawks, and liberal interventionists. Washington has attempted to fix the Middle East and Central Asia for decades. The result? War, instability, autocracy, brutality, collapse. Which Neocon triumph is falling apart more spectacularly--Iraq, Libya, or Yemen? As the administration was upping its support for \"moderate\" Syrian rebels, an internal CIA study revealed that prior efforts to arm insurgents \"had a minimal impact on the long-term outcome of a conflict.\" The most successful program, in Afghanistan, resulted in bloody terrorist blowback against America on 9/11. U.S. officials consistently have demonstrated the reverse Midas touch, leaving Washington widely despised and American forces constantly at war responding to the unintended consequences of the previous military intervention.\n\nThe Balkans has turned out little better, with nationalist divisions still evident two decades after Washington imposed an artificial political settlement. Europe represents the globe's greatest aggregation of economic power, but is not inclined to defend itself, preferring instead to rely on the U.S. while carping when Washington acts without the continent's approval. European countries, including Germany, so long defended by American troops, refuse to place their own forces along Eastern Europe's border with Russia. The Europeans were unwilling to act forcefully in Ukraine, Georgia, or even the Balkans. Determined for war in Libya, the same countries lacked enough missiles to take on Moammar Qaddafy's military.\n\nEvery year the Vietnam War looks ever more foolish, as Hanoi moves toward America out of fear of China. Only now is Japan finally emerging from hiding behind the U.S.-imposed \"peace constitution\" to consider a more active military role. South Korea continues to subsidize the North even as American troops guarantee the former's security. The Philippines hopes Washington will make up for Manila's lack of a serious military in any confrontation with Beijing. With China's future at stake, Washington is pushing that nation and Russia together.\n\nThere are many reasons to be skeptical of \"The Libertarian Moment\" advanced by some. Not because libertarian policies have failed. Few have been tried domestically. None are evident in America's international relations. In fact, politicians of all partisan stripes naturally resist libertarian thinking. Almost all government officials like to use power. Especially overseas.\n\nThe world today is an unruly mess. But Neocons are more responsible than anyone else for America being stuck in the chaos. Embarrassed at the havoc they have wreaked, they blame President Obama for every problem big and small. However, he is a worthy successor to the Neocon-friendly Bush. If there's anyone who can't be blamed for the status quo, it is libertarians.\n\nWe are living in The Neocon Moment, a testament to the foolishness and arrogance of those who believe themselves to be engineers of peoples, societies, and nations. Yet Washington officials have yet to tire of America's permanent state of war. Only when the American people insist that politicians make peace, not war, will The Libertarian Moment finally arrive.\n\nThis article was first posted at Forbes online.",
  "latent_13880": "SAFETY fears have led to the sudden closure of 17 Edinburgh schools from Monday, sparking urgent demands for answers and leaving parents with a childcare nightmare.\n\nFive high schools are among those which will shut following the decision late on Friday which may also mean thousands of pupils missing lessons in the final few weeks before this year’s exams.\n\nThe safety of children and our staff is our top priority and we’re simply not willing to take any risks. As such we have no option but to close these schools Andrew Burns\n\nThe move comes after new construction issues were discovered in schools which were built or refurbished under the public private partnership (PPP) 1 agreement. Officials said they acted after Edinburgh Schools Partnership (ESP), which built and manages the schools, was unable to give safety guarantees.\n\nREAD MORE - EDINBURGH SCHOOL CLOSURES: FULL LIST\n\nThe council said “contingency arrangements” were being considered but said parents “should consider childcare\n\narrangements for next week”.\n\nCouncil leader Andrew Burns said they had been left with no choice but to take the drastic action and blamed ESP for letting the “council, children, parents and staff of this city down”.\n\n“Clearly we have every right to expect these schools to have been built to a good standard and in accordance with industry practice.

Three more schools, all part of the same PPP1 contract, closed less than a week later.\n\nIssues had been identified with the width of their wall cavities and the structures installed to maintain the stability of masonry. ESP had assured the council that all schools would reopen as normal following the Easter Holidays.\n\nBut it is understood that a contractor carrying out repairs at St Peter’s and Oxgangs warned on Friday that its staff had discovered further serious defects and said the two schools were no longer safe to occupy.\n\nFollowing this, ESP told council officials it could not confirm whether or not the faults existed at other sites, leading to the decision to close all 17 PPP1 schools and Goodtrees Neighbourhood Centre.\n\nThe Evening News has also learned that an engineer’s probe into the original collapse of a wall at Oxgangs Primary has concluded the incident was due to “poor quality workmanship”.\n\nThe council has said that families would be updated on Monday, but it was unable to say when schools would reopen or when alternative arrangements would be put in place.\n\nThe closures include campuses, such as Drummond Community High, which were refurbished under PPP1 agreements.\n\nOne father at the Royal High, one of the affected sites, said: “It beggars belief that the school was not built properly and up to the standard required – who was to blame for that?\n\n“We demand answers as to who is to blame for this. There are pupils coming up to their exams. It’s a huge concern for parents of children who have got important exams coming up in the next few weeks.\n\n“And finding out like this at the end of the holiday is very short notice – what are working parents supposed to do?”\n\nLuke McCullough, chair of the Royal High parent council, said: “If the local authority is making arrangements for those sittings exams, with Highers and Nationals less than four weeks away, they need to make those arrangements fast.\n\n“And it’s not just exams – for a number of subjects, our young people have folio deadlines and modern languages practicals due this coming week.”\n\nOxgangs councillor Jason Rust said: “This latest news is hugely frustrating for parents, pupils and staff.\n\n“I am deeply concerned that there are yet further issues and answers are needed as soon as possible given the schools were as of yesterday anticipated to reopen.”",

  "latent_13969": "This is a \"real\" Ratchet and Clank game.\n\nThe last two Ratchet and Clank titles were hardly worth calling entries in the Ratchet and Clank franchise because they lacked any sort of meaningful game-play mechanics. Fortunately, this game is true to form and it a genuine Ratchet and Clank game - there is a meaningful, although painfully short and stripped down single player campaign (no online multiplayer).\n\nThe positives - This game looks absolutely fantastic on the PS3, this is Insomniac's best work artistically on this console. The weapons are fantastic, some are recreations of past classics whereas others are brand new - to the \"ironically named Peacemaker\" to the \"Zircon Family\", the weapons are fun and easy to use. To that point, excluding the jet boots, the controls are fantastic. There is mild exploration, and there is good reward for finding everything because there are powerful, powerful weapons to be unlocked. Arena combat returns, some item collection missions return (huge open area where you look for things), and there is a challenge mode as in previous titles. There is also a difficulty setting, which is nice (easy, medium, hard).\n\nUnfortunately, however, there are some problems with this game that don't bring it to the caliber of \"Crack in Time\". First, flying between planets is not the really cool \"oh, wow, you're flying your ship in space\" that was introduced in \"Crack in Time\", rather, it is a meaningless \"move your ship icon to the planet you want to go to\". I was sorely disappointed. Level design is mostly okay, except for one particular level: in certain situations on Planet Sixon doors would be open allowing me to explore regions I shouldn't, doors would be closed when they should be open preventing me from exploring regions, and it was difficult to figure out how to re-explore past areas on that particular world. Also, diversity is limited. There are no grind boot challenge, no vehicle piloting - it is get your gun and fire (and there is little to no strategy for weapon selection either).\n\nThe price tag is what you get: a quickly made extremely short romp that is entertaining enough to have a second play through. The game comes with a download code for a previous Ratchet and Clank title - that isn't a half bad game makes up for what I feel is the high price point for this game (this should really be a $15.00 title, not a $30.00 title). The game is fun, but the fun is short lived.",

  "latent_14267": "Somewhere, a US government official is reading through a list of those who sent or received an email from Jacob Appelbaum, a 28-year-old computer science researcher at the University of Washington who volunteered for WikiLeaks. Among those listed will be my name, a journalist who interviewed Appelbaum for a book about the digital revolution.\n\nAppelbaum is a spokesman for Tor, a free internet anonymising software that helps people defend themselves against internet surveillance. He's spent five years teaching activists around the world how to install and use the service to avoid being monitored by repressive governments. It's exactly the sort of technology Secretary of State Hilary Clinton praised in her famous \"Internet Freedom\" speech in January 2010, when she promised US government support for the designers of technology that circumvented blocks or firewalls. Now, Appelbaum finds himself a target of his own government as a result of his friendship with Julian Assange and the fact WikiLeaks used the Tor software.\n\nAppelbaum has not been charged with any wrongdoing; nor has the government shown probable cause that he is guilty of any criminal offence.\n\nThat matters not a jot, because, as the law stands, government officials don't need a search warrant to access our digital data. Searching someone's home requires a warrant that can only be obtained by proving probable cause, but digital searches require no such burden of proof. Instead, officials essentially \"self-certify\" to a judge that the information they seek is, in their opinion, relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. On this basis, Google and a small ISP called Sonic were made to hand over to the government all Appelbaum's email headers from the past two years.\n\nMost people are not aware of the ease with which governments – free, open and so-called democratic – can access and peruse our private communications. This is because these court orders are commonly sealed. What is uncommon is for internet service providers to request the orders be unsealed so they can inform their customers, as Sonic and Google did in Appelbaum's case.\n\nPrivacy researcher Chris Soghoian estimates there are likely tens of thousands of these 2703(d) orders made annually by the federal government under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. He bases this on the number of pen registers granted to the federal government annually: 12,000. These allow officials to intercept telephone and internet meta-data in real time.\n\n\"There's far more data to be had after the fact, so probably these 2703(d) orders are even more common,\" Soghoian says.\n\nThe fourth amendment of the US Constitution should protect against unwarranted search and seizure. Its inclusion in the Bill of Rights was a result of colonialists' anger at abuse suffered at the hands of British officials using writs of assistance. Writs were general warrants issued by the British Parliament to allow customs officials to search for smuggled goods, but in the American colonies, they were used by agents of the British state to interrogate people and raid their homes on the pretext of searching and seizing any \"prohibited and uncustomed goods\", which often meant \"seditious\" publications that criticised government policies or the King.\n\nThe colony of Massachusetts banned these general warrants in 1756 and when the governor overturned the ban, it was one of the sparks for the American Revolution. It's ironic then to see how, under the guise of \"patriotism\", these court orders have stripped away fourth amendment protections and granted to US officials the same unlimited powers of search and seizure that so aggravated the American revolutionaries.\n\nToday, the privacy law surrounding our emails is woefully outdated, as it is based on the technology of the first email services of the 1980s. Back then, people dialled up their provider to download email onto their home computer. Mail left for over 180 days was considered in storage, so was not subject to the wiretap protections which were for information in transmission. This means email older than 180 days doesn't require a warrant whereas anything newer does. Now, with cloud services and extensive storage available through services such as Gmail, our primary archive of email is held more or less indefinitely. Ironically, this means the most important or sensitive emails receive the lowest legal protections. (The law is also weighted to protect unread mail over read mail so, strangely, spam that remains unopened because it goes straight to your junk folder has more privacy protections than read mail in your archives.)\n\nFew citizens of the world will be adequately clued up on US surveillance laws, yet information stored on Facebook, Twitter, Google or any other American companies is subject to them. Unwarranted search and seizure by the government officials was unacceptable to the American revolutionaries. Shouldn't it be unacceptable in the digital age, too?",
  "latent_14328": "An all new trailer for the upcoming anticipated game in The Legend of Zelda series The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild at this year's The Game Awards.\n\nOk I was not expecting something like this, I thought they would wait until January to show us something this big. The trailer itself is freaking epic, I felt like the trailer was on the scale of what was shown at this year's E3. We see Bill Trinen as he tells us what this trailer will focus on what and who will see throughout the game after we leave the plateau.\n\nWe then see some beautiful cross-stitch work which looks very reminiscent to what the beginning of Wind Waker was when they were talking about the legendary hero. That actually wouldn't be the first time we've seen something like that to use a different art style to introduce us to the lore, such as Skyward Sword, Wind Waker, Minish Cap, Phantom Hourglass, and A Link Between Worlds, and I wouldn't be surprised if they did the same for Breath of The Wild.\n\nWhich by the way the artwork, and the graphics are just gorgeous just the level of details on the world, the buildings, the creatures, and people. We also got to hear more of the beautiful soundtrack for Breath of The Wild, which I can not wait to hear that spectacular soundtrack for when it heads to The Symphony of The Goddesses concert.\n\nI think one of the few big things that were shown in the trailer such as- what the freak?! There was a freaking airship, which is definitely a first in the Zelda series. I mean, I knew that there was gonna be new technology introduced into the game, but a freaking airship?! That's freaking insane! Also, was that a Loftwing? Are we gonna be able to head up in the sky again? If so they need to make that interesting, because although I loved soaring the skies in Skyward Sword there were some major complaints about it just being empty space so I hope they fill that up, which is something that we were worried about earlier on as we traversed the world and being just empty, but for what we've seen back during E3 I've got no problem that they will make it feel natural and give us a great experience.\n\nThen we see this golden dust surrounding Link, which I have no idea what that stuff is supposed to be, or how it's related to the main story, hopefully we'll find out soon.\n\nNext we see something unusual. Now, I'm a bit confused at to what this scene is supposed to be, but I have a feeling that it has something to do with Calamity Ganon or maybe not. It could be something else connected to the main story.\n\nAt the end of trailer we see a glimpse of Link meeting with someone who we have no idea who that could be. It might be Zelda, but that's the only person who I think who it can be, but we'll probably find out more in January.\n\nI am a bit disappointed that there wasn't at least a release window announced, but I have a feeling that that will be shown in January. I'm very excited to see more of this game. Also The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild was given the award for being the most anticipated game..\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild will be available in 2017 for the Wii U and the Nintendo Switch\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/17foyUCR-RM",
  "latent_14373": "Republican Sen. Cory Gardner finally had enough of the disabled protesters at his office begging him not to cut their Medicaid. So he had them arrested.\n\nAfter days of a “die-in” at the Denver office of Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, disabled protesters were zip-tied, removed, and arrested.\n\nThe protesters had been in Gardner’s office for three days, and planned to stay there until Gardner had made a commitment to protect Medicaid spending and oppose the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare and gut their health care.\n\nThe men and women, some in wheelchairs or lying on the floor, were in the office to protest Gardner’s support for the bill, which would impact millions — especially the disabled — who rely on Medicaid. The Republican proposal suggests slashing at least $770 billion from Medicaid, while handing out tax cuts to the extremely wealthy.\n\nDisability rights advocates like ADAPT have been at the forefront of opposing the Republican bill.\n\nAs police came in to remove them, some chanted, “Rather go to jail than to die without Medicaid!”\n\nAnother video shows people in wheelchairs being pulled out of Gardner’s office, as police confiscate their cell phones. Protesters chanted “we are people” and “shame on you” as police removed them from the premises.\n\nBreaking: Police arrest protestors at Gardner's Office Posted by Jaclyn Allen Denver7 on Thursday, June 29, 2017\n\nThe Denver Post reports that while in wheelchairs, “The hands and ankles of all of them were zip-tied by police.”\n\nBefore the protest, Gardner’s state director told the protesters that their presence in his office was supposedly in violation of their lease in the building.\n\nBut his office gave a different story to local news.\n\n“Earlier this evening, Denver police asked the individuals to leave,” Gardner’s office said in a statement. “When they declined to leave the police were forced to remove them due to several factors, including serious concerns for their health and safety.”\n\nGardner’s office was the site of another health care protest earlier in the week, where women pushing him to oppose the bill’s cuts to vital women’s services were kept in a hot room as temperatures soared to 90 degrees.",
  "latent_14392": "\"Sacre\" redirects here. For the Canadian basketball player, see Robert Sacre\n\nQuebec French profanities,[1] known as sacres (singular: sacre; French: sacrer, \"to consecrate\"), are words and expressions related to Catholicism and its liturgy that are used as strong profanities in Quebec French, (the main variety of Canadian French and, to a lesser degree, in Acadian French spoken in Maritime Provinces east of Quebec). Sacres are considered stronger than the foul expressions common to standard French which centre on sex and excrement (such as merde, \"shit\").[2]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nThe sacres originated in the early 19th century when the social control exerted by the Catholic clergy was increasingly a source of frustration.[2] One of the oldest sacres is sacrament, which can be thought of as the French-Canadian equivalent to \"goddamn it\" in English. It is known to have been in use as far back as the 1830s.[citation needed] The word \"sacrer\" in its current meaning is believed to come from the expression Ne dites pas ça, c'est sacré (\"Don't say that, it is sacred/holy\"). Eventually, sacrer started to refer to the words French Canadians were not supposed to say. This is likely related to the commandment \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain\" (Exodus 20:7). The influence and social importance of the Catholic religion at that time allowed sacres to become powerful forms of profanity.\n\nAs a result of the Quiet Revolution in the 1960s, the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec has declined. This has had no effect, however, on the use of sacres, which are as widespread as ever.[2]\n\nList of common sacres [ edit ]\n\nThese sacres are commonly given in a phonetic spelling to indicate the differences in pronunciation from the original word, several of which, notably the deletion of final consonants and change of [ɛ] to [a] before /ʁ/ are typical of highly informal Quebec French. The nouns here can also be modified for use as verbs (see Non-Profane Uses, below). Additionally, some forms, notably \"ostie\" and \"criss\" can become semi-adjectival when followed by \"de\" as in \"Va t'en ostie de chat!\" (Scram you #%@* cat!) and \"tabarnak\" is often added at the end for extra emphasis. Not uncommonly several of these words are strung together when used adjectivally, as in \"Va t'en maudit hostie de criss de chat!\" See Intricate Forms, below. The possibilities are legion, and are one of the more fascinating aspects of Quebec swearing. Since swearwords are voluntarily blasphemous, the spelling is different from the word from which they originate. For example, câlice can be written kâliss, calice, caliss, and so on. There is no general agreement on one official way to write these words.\n\nbaptême [ˌbaˈtaɪ̯m] : \"baptism\"\n\n: \"baptism\" câlice [ˈkɑːˌlɪs] ( calice ): \"chalice\"\n\n( ): \"chalice\" calvaire [ˌkalˈvaɛ̯ʁ] : \"Calvary\"\n\n: \"Calvary\" ciboire [ˌsiˈbwɑːʁ] : \"ciborium\" or \"pyx\", receptacles in which the host is stored\n\n: \"ciborium\" or \"pyx\", receptacles in which the host is stored criss [ˈkʁɪs] ( Christ ): \"Christ\" or \"crisser\", a more emphatic version of \"sacrer\", both verbs meaning \"to curse\".\n\n( ): \"Christ\" or \"crisser\", a more emphatic version of \"sacrer\", both verbs meaning \"to curse\". esti [ˌəsˈt͡si] ( hostie ): \"host\"\n\n( ): \"host\" maudit [ˈmoːˌd͡zi] : \"damn\" or \"maudit(e)\" (adj) \"damned\" final (e) is for feminine gender nouns\n\n: \"damn\" or \"maudit(e)\" (adj) \"damned\" final (e) is for feminine gender nouns sacrament [ˌsa.kʁaˈmɑ̃] ( sacrement ): \"Sacrament\"\n\n( ): \"Sacrament\" simonaque [ˌsimɔˈnak] ( simoniaque ): from the sin of simony\n\n( ): from the sin of simony tabarnak [ˌtabaʁnak] ( tabernacle ): \"tabernacle\" (typically considered the most profane of the sacres)\n\n( ): \"tabernacle\" (typically considered the most profane of the sacres) torrieu (\"tort à Dieu\"): \"harm to God\"\n\n(\"tort à Dieu\"): \"harm to God\" viarge [vjaʁʒ] (vierge): \"the Virgin Mary\"\n\nMild forms [ edit ]\n\nMost sacres have modified, milder euphemistic forms (see minced oath). Such forms are not usually considered nearly as rude as the original.[2] They are the equivalent of English words such as \"gosh\", \"heck\", or \"darn\". Many of the euphemistic forms are only similar-sounding to religious terms, so are considered not to denigrate the Church.\n\nbaptême : batince, batêche, bateau\n\n: câlice : câline, câlif, câlique, câline de bine, câlibine, câlibouette\n\n: calvaire : calvâce, calvince, calvinouche, calvinus, calvinice, calverace\n\n: ciboire : cibolle, cibollaque, ciboulle, ciboulette, gériboire\n\n: criss : cristie, crime, crimebine, criff, cliss, christophe, Christophe Colomb, crimpuff (from the English \"cream puff\")\n\n: (from the English \"cream puff\") esti : titi, estifie, estique, estine\n\n: maudit : maudine, mautadine, mautadit, mautadite, maustie\n\n: sacrament : sac à papier, sacréfice, sacramouille, sacre bleu, Sacramento\n\n: tabarnak: tabarnouche, tabarouette, batarnak (anagram of tabarnak), tabarchum, tabarslaque, simonac, tabarclak, tabarnache, barnac, tabarnane, taberolls, tabréré, tabebouts, tabebruns, tabergaut, tabertix, taberguermon, tabermeuns, taberuph, tabermost, taberax, taberkalu, taberpuch, tabarlan, tabarlie, taberson, tabersiouf, taberboog, taberkhalil, tabeurn, tabouère (merge of tabarnak and siboire), tabarnoune, tabarnanne\n\nAlso considered milder swears:\n\nbâtard : \"bastard\"\n\n: toton : \"boob\", used to denote a complete idiot\n\n: torrieu : ( tort à Dieu ) \"harm to God\"\n\n: tort à Dieu marde: (merde) \"shit\", used in conjunction with other words, sometimes swears: esti de marde, silo de marde, tas de marde, mange donc un char de marde, pédale de marde, ciboulette de marde, or château de marde, Internet de marde\n\nSometimes older people unable to bring themselves to swear with church words or their derivatives would make up ostensibly innocuous phrases, such as cinq six boîtes de tomates vartes (literally, \"five or six boxes of green tomatoes\", varte being slang for verte, \"green\"). This phrase when pronounced quickly by a native speaker sounds like saint-siboire de tabarnak (\"holy ciborium of the tabernacle\"). Another example of a benign word that is church sounding is coltord, which was simply an anglicism for \"coal-tar\", but pronounced just so, sounds as like a merged câlice and tort (\"harm\").\n\nIntricate forms [ edit ]\n\nFrench-Canadian swear words can be combined into more powerful combinations to express extreme anger or disgust.[2] These intricate uses of French profanities can be difficult to master. The combinations are endless; some people in the French-Canadian community consider mixing and matching swear words to be a sort of skilled art.\n\nMon tabarnak j'vais te décâlisser la yeule, câlice or mon tabarnak, m'a tu t'l'a décâlisser ta grand yeule : Décâlisser means \"to fuck up something\"; yeule comes from the derived noun gueule which refers to an animal's throat or maw but is used in joual to mean the human mouth or face. The whole sentence can be summarized as \"I'm gonna beat your fucking face in, you motherfucker\".\n\nor : means \"to fuck up something\"; comes from the derived noun which refers to an animal's throat or maw but is used in to mean the human mouth or face. The whole sentence can be summarized as \"I'm gonna beat your fucking face in, you motherfucker\". Esti de câlice de tabarnak : Very strong expression of anger. Can also be used as a descriptive phrase expressing anger or derision: Esti de câlice de tabarnak, c'est pas possible comment que t'es cave (\"Jesus fucking Christ, there's no way you can be this stupid\"). Câlice and tabarnak are interchangeable in this situation.\n\n: Very strong expression of anger. Can also be used as a descriptive phrase expressing anger or derision: (\"Jesus fucking Christ, there's no way you can be this stupid\"). and are interchangeable in this situation. Crisse de câlice de tabarnak d'esti de sacrament : Expressive of extreme anger.\n\n: Expressive of extreme anger. Crisse de câlice de tabarnak d'esti de sacrament de trou viarge : Expressive of very extreme anger.\n\n: Expressive of very extreme anger. J'm'en calice : Denotes extreme apathy and suppressed anger, similar to English \"I don't give a fuck\". J'm'en calice des politiciens : \"I don't give a fuck about politicians.\"\n\n: Denotes extreme apathy and suppressed anger, similar to English \"I don't give a fuck\". : \"I don't give a fuck about politicians.\" Esti d'épais à marde!: Expression of anger aimed at someone; épais (\"thick\") is used as a derogatory term meaning \"idiot\". Esti is used to convey extreme anger and de marde, which means \"of shit\" is used to place emphasis on the idiocy of the person it is aimed at.\n\nUse [ edit ]\n\nA very strong way to express anger or frustration is to use the words tabarnak, sacrament, and câlice. Depending on the context and the tone of the phrases, it might make everybody quiet, but some people use those words to add rhythm or emphasis to sentences.\n\nUsually, more than one of these words is used in French-Canadian profanity. The words are simply connected with de (of), without any restrictions. Long strings of invective can be connected in this French-Canadian way, and the resulting expression doesn't have to have any concrete meaning. For example, Mon ostie de saint-sacrament de câlice de crisse! (literally: \"My host of (the) holy sacrament of (the) chalice of Christ\"). Non-religious terms may also be strung together in this Quebec way, as in Mon crisse de char est brisé, tabarnak de câlisse (literally: \"My Christ of (a) car is broken, tabernacle of (the) chalice\").[2] In areas where English is also commonly spoken, English expletives are often inserted. Fuck ostie (\"fuck [the] host\") is common in Quebec.\n\nThe word fucké (with meanings varying from \"crazy, disturbed\" to \"broken down\") is much milder than \"fucked\" is in English. It is routinely used in, for instance, TV sitcom dialogue.[2] The same goes for chit (\"shit\") (which in Quebec French is used only as an interjection expressing dismay, never as the noun for excrement). When used as a verb, va chier (literally: \"go shit\"), it does not mean to excrete but rather to \"fuck off\". When used as past tense chié, it is used exactly as fucké: mes souliers sont chiés (\"my shoes are fucked\").\n\nEven English-language dialogue containing these words can appear on Quebec French-language television without bleeping. For example, in 2003 when punks rioted in Montreal because a concert by the band The Exploited had been cancelled, TV news reporters solemnly read out a few lyrics and song titles from their album Fuck the System. The same is not true of Quebec's English-language television stations, which follow the same guidelines as other stations in Canada. In November 2017 the CRTC ruled that 'fuck' is not a swearword in French.[3]\n\nNon-profane uses [ edit ]\n\nA slang term with the preposition en means \"a lot of\": d'la bouffe en tabarnak (or en crisse, etc.) means \"a lot of food\", similar to English constructs such as \"fuck-ton\" or \"shitload\".\n\nSacres are often used as verbs, too. For example, câlisser une volée means \"to beat the fuck out of\" or, more literally, \"to give a beating\" where câlisser is used as a stronger form of \"to give\" (donner in French). There are constructions like détabarnaker or décrisser which means to leave or to destroy, using the dé prefix, which is about separation. Others include, s'en câlicer or s'en crisser (\"not give a damn\"), sacrer son camp (\"run away\", literally \"consecrate the camp while leaving it\"), and décâlisser. Some are even found as adverbs: crissement meaning \"very\" or \"extremely\" as in C'est crissement bon (\"This is so darned good\").\n\nIn the movie Bon Cop, Bad Cop, French-Canadian actor and stand-up comic Patrick Huard teaches Colm Feore how to swear properly.\n\nThese expressions are found less commonly in literature, but rappers and other singers often use criss and câlice as a rhyme. More traditional singers also use these words, for example, Quebec singer Plume Latraverse.\n\nOne fine example of the use of sacres as different word classes is a dialogue by 'Les Cyniques' called Le cours de sacres. The phrase Jules, étant irrité, a expulsé violemment Jacques qui était en colère (\"Jules, who was irritated, violently ejected Jacques who was angry\") becomes Le sacrament qui était en calvaire a calissé dehors l'ostie en tabarnak.[further explanation needed]\n\nComparison to other languages [ edit ]\n\nThe use of liturgical profanity is not unique to Canadian French or Quebec. In Italian, although to a lesser extent, some analogous words are in use: in particular ostia (host) and (more so in the past) sacramento are relatively common expressions in the northeast, which are lighter (and a little less common) than the typical blasphemies in use in Italy such as porco Dio (pig god) and porca Madonna (see: Italian profanity). Modifying the terms into euphemistic equivalents is used in Italy: for example ostia is commonly modified to osteria (a type of restaurant). The word sacramento has produced the verb sacramentare, which colloquially means \"to use blasphemy\".\n\nOther dialects in the world feature this kind of profanity. For instance, the expressions Sakrament and Kruzifix noch einmal in Austro-Bavarian or Krucifix in Czech. La hostia is an expletive expression in some Spanish dialects. In Catalan, hòstia is used and is frequently abbreviated to osti. Spanish also uses me cago en ... (\"I shit on ...\") followed by \"God\", \"the blessed chalice\", \"the Virgin\" and other terms, religious or not. It can be shortened to just ¡La virgen! or ¡Copón bendito! (\"Blessed chalice!\"). In Romanian, the profanity anafura mă-tii! (\"Your mother's host!\") is sometimes used with \"Easter\", \"Christ\", \"Cross\", \"Commemoration\" (parastas), \"sacred oil lamp\" ('tu-i candela 'mă-sii), \"God\", \"Church\", etc.\n\nSheila Fischman's translation of La Guerre, yes Sir! (published under that title in French and English and meaning roughly \"War, you bet!\") by Roch Carrier leaves many sacres in the original Quebec French, since they have no real equivalent in English. She gives a brief explanation and history of these terms in her introduction, including a few not listed here.\n\nIrish Catholics of old employed a similar practice, whereby \"ejaculations\" were used to express frustration without cursing or profaning (taking the Lord's name in vain). This typically involved the recitation of a rhyming couplet, where a shocked person might say \"Jesus who, for love of me / Died on the Cross at Calvary\" instead of \"Jesus!\" This is often abbreviated simply to \"Jesus-hoo-fer-luv-a-me\", an expression still heard among elderly Irish people. \"Jesus, Mary and Joseph!\" is used in Quebec French \"Jésus, Marie, Joseph!\"\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",

  "latent_14446": "British government outlines plans to dismantle welfare\n\nBy Julie Hyland\n\n29 May 2010\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has set out plans for an assault on unemployment and invalidity benefits, as the precursor to a broader assault on welfare provision.\n\nThe proposals were unveiled on Thursday as part of the Conservative Liberal Democrat coalitions pledge to slash public spending and make “radical” changes in welfare.\n\nDuncan Smith couched the government’s plans in the language of concern for those “trapped” on benefits. But talk of combating “welfare dependency” and “persistent poverty” is preparation for the impoverishment of ever-broader layers of the working class as the ruling elite utilises the global financial crisis to restructure social relations in its interests.\n\nIn his “state of the nation” report, Duncan Smith claimed that the “absurd” benefit system meant that people had no incentive to work. More than 670,000 households were “eligible” for a combination of benefits and tax credits worth more than £15,600 a year, he claimed. People who gave up such benefits and tax credits to take work, which might actually leave them out of pocket, were considered to be “morons”, he said.\n\nThe figures given by Duncan Smith—which assume that people claim everything they are entitled to— form only a small portion of the more than six million people on benefits, excluding their dependents. In reality, the vast majority of unemployed aged over 25 receive between £51.85 and £65.45 a week—an annual income of just over £3,000 (excluding help with housing benefit).\n\nDuncan Smith’s figure is, moreover, only half the average (median) annual pay of £25,000 and represents a poverty rate for what will be a fairly large family.\n\nThe “state of the nation” report made no reference to the huge growth of social inequality. Nor the fact that the super-rich massively increased their wealth over the last year—with the top 1,000 adding an additional £77 billion to their personal incomes—largely as the by-product of Labour’s near trillion pound “rescue package” for the banks and major financial institutions\n\nThe entitlement of the super-rich to such massive public subventions is never questioned. According to reports, the Conservatives are already making preparations to ditch their commitment to raising Capital Gains Tax on non-business assets after a backlash from investment houses.\n\nIt is the social entitlements of the working class, won through major class struggles, that is the target. That is what Duncan Smith meant when he told the Guardian that the government had “a once-in-a-generation opportunity”.\n\nThe coalition government’s aim, he said, was to continue where Labour had left off, and finally dismantle the post-war welfare state.\n\n“What we want to do is reform the welfare system—in the way Tony Blair talked about 13 years ago, but never achieved—a system that was created for the days after the Second World War”.\n\nTo this end, the government intends to drive down benefits and force people into work under pain of sanctions. That it is doing so under conditions in which public spending cuts will push hundreds of thousands of workers into unemployment means that the broader objective is to drive down wage rates even further.\n\nPledging to make the benefits system “simpler and more transparent so that work always pays”, Duncan Smith said that a new “work programme” will strip the unemployed off benefits if they refuse to take a job offer.\n\nThe 2.5 million people in receipt of incapacity benefit are also to be targeted. “Tougher” medical tests initially planned under the Labour government to drive the sick and disabled into work, are to be fast-tracked by the coalition government to next year.\n\nThe new test will assess if those claiming incapacity benefit are capable of taking “desk or administrative jobs or part-time work”.\n\n“So to be fair to the taxpayer, we will cut payments [to the unemployed] if they don’t do the right thing”, Duncan Smith said. “In addition, we will re-assess all current claimants of Incapacity Benefit on readiness to work”.\n\nDuncan Smith bases his plans on Department of Work and Pensions figures suggesting that the nearly all of the UK’s 2.6 million incapacity benefit claimants should be in work. Already, since October 2008, all new claimants for incapacity benefit have been given medicals to see if they able to go to work. These tests found that nine out of 10 new applicants were either fit for work or could be moved towards rejoining the workforce—meaning that they were ready to join a “work related activity group”.\n\nIn reality, a BBC Scotland investigation found that “tens of thousands of claimants who are genuinely sick or disabled may have been refused the new Employment Support Allowance”.\n\nThe ESA was heralded by government in 2008 “as the answer to the nation’s sick note mentality”, with more stringent criteria than incapacity benefit. But “fast forward just a year and a half, and there are calls for the planned roll-out of ESA to be shelved” because, “The medicals don’t appear to be thorough. They don’t appear to cover the areas that the patients want to talk about, often mental health problems”.\n\n“The medical was always anticipated to be much tougher than under the previous incapacity benefit regime, but the reality has taken even the government by surprise and has found more than two-thirds of sickness claimants fit for work”, the BBC reports.\n\nHowever, a Freedom of Information request by the BBC revealed that, “ESA appeals are running at about 8,000 hearings a month, which is double the number of the next most commonly appealed benefit, Disability Living Allowance. About 40% of those ESA claimants who do appeal have their decisions reversed”.\n\nThe Financial Times opined that the “tougher tests” will “test the mettle of the coalition: reclassifying disabled people as fit-for-work will generate political heat”, and that “given the fiscal constraints, the cost of any far-reaching reform [of welfare] will probably be paid by the poorest”.\n\nBut the 1945 welfare system, dismissed as outdated by Duncan Smith, involved not only unemployment benefits. Under the slogan of protecting people from the “cradle to the grave”, its remit included health care, education, pensions and housing.\n\nMuch of this has been stripped away over the past two decades, but the coalition government intends to remove what little protection is left.\n\nThe government has already set out plans to effectively privatise state-run schools by handing them over to the private and “voluntary” sector, through its programme for “free” schools and academies.\n\nIn his remarks, Duncan Smith made clear that housing benefit, paid to the poorest families, is to be slashed. In addition, he said it was imperative that the state retirement age must be raised in line with “growing life expectancy”.\n\nThe coalition has already proposed it should be set at 66 years of age, and Duncan Smith said he was keen to phase out a default retirement age so that people “continue to keep working and contributing”.",
  "latent_14577": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney will no longer bring up Glen Doherty, a former Navy SEAL killed in the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya, the campaign said Wednesday in response to a complaint from Doherty's mother.\n\n\"Governor Romney was inspired by the memory of meeting Glen Doherty and shared his story and that memory. We respect the wishes of Mrs. Doherty though,\" campaign aide Kevin Madden told BuzzFeed.\n\nOn Tuesday, Romney spoke to supporters in Iowa, recalling a chance encounter with a former Navy SEAL while mistakenly attending a Christmas party in San Diego a few years ago.\n\n“I met some remarkable people, one of whom was a former Navy SEAL,\" Romney said. \"I just learned a few days ago that he was one of the two former Navy SEALs killed in Benghazi. It broke my heart.”\n\nRomney didn't directly provide Doherty's name, but his campaign later confirmed his identity. He was one of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, killed during a violent assault on the consulate in Benghazi last month.\n\nBoston's WHDH later reached out to Doherty's mother, Barbara, to get her reaction to Romney's campaign trail anecdote.\n\n\"I don't trust Romney. He shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda,\" she told WHDH. \"It's wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama.”\n\nDoherty similarly decried the politicization of her son's death in an interview with the Boston Herald last month.\n\nGlen Doherty's friend, Elf Ellefsen, also spoke with Seattle's KIRO, expressing similar disagreement with Romney's mention of his friend's death.\n\nAccording to Ellefsen, Doherty found his exchange with Romney to be \"insincere and stale.\"\n\n\"Mitt Romney approached him ultimately four times, using this private gathering as a political venture to further his image,\" Ellefsen told KIRO. \"He kept introducing himself as Mitt Romney, a political figure. The same introduction, the same opening line ... [Doherty] said it was pathetic and comical to have the same person come up to you within only a half hour, have this person reintroduce himself to you, having absolutely no idea whatsoever that he just did this 20 minutes ago, and did not even recognize Glen's face.\"\n\nRomney had again made mention of his meeting with Doherty in the wake of these reports on Wednesday during a town hall event in Ohio.\n\nUPDATE: 9:58 p.m. -- Doherty's sister, Kate Quigley, told CNN Wednesday evening she doesn't share her mother's anger about Romney using her brother's story, saying Doherty \"would be the first one to reach across party lines and defuse the situation.\"",
  "latent_14609": "Despite a threat from the FCC to begin arbitration, DirecTV refuses to back down in its standoff with Time Warner Cable over rights to the Dodgers’ SportsNet LA channel.\n\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday, the satellite provider again pushed Time Warner Cable to agree to a deal in which DirecTV could offer the games ala carte to its customers.\n\n“Rather than force everyone to bail Time Warner Cable out, the simplest solution is to enable only those who want to pay to see the remaining Dodgers games to do so at the price Time Warner Cable wants to set,” DirecTV said in a statement.\n\nDirecTV isn’t alone in putting the blame on Time Warner Cable.\n\nOn Tuesday, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said he was encouraged by TWC’s willingness to end the TV blackout but “troubled by the negative impact that your apparent actions are having on consumers and the overall video marketplace.”\n\nLast year, Time Warner Cable entered into a 25-year agreement valued at more than $8 billion with the Dodgers to distribute SportsNet LA, but their inability to reach carriage agreements with other multichannel distributors has left about 70% of the region unable to access the games.\n\nRelated Cord-Cutting Sped Up in 2018: Biggest Pay-TV Ops Shed 3.2 Million Subscribers Last Year AT&T Misses on Q4 Revenue, WarnerMedia Boosts Profits While DirecTV Losses Mount\n\nWheeler went on to request that Time Warner Cable provide a written explanation of the arbitration process as proposed, how it will bring “relief to consumers expeditiously,” and other steps TWC will take to resolve the matter if arbitration is not successful.\n\nHe also chided Time Warner Cable for ignoring calls from Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and California Attorney General Kamala Harris to resolve the impasse.\n\n“We appreciate the FCC review of this dispute because all Dodger fans should be able to watch their first place team make a run for the pennant,” a spokesperson for Garcetti told Variety.\n\nTime Warner Cable and the Dodgers clearly see that the proposal to enter into binding arbitration — advanced by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) and other area lawmakers on Monday — has advantages in ending the dispute. “We prefer to reach agreements through private business negotiations, but given the current circumstance, we are willing to agree to binding arbitration and to allow DirecTV customers to watch the Dodgers games while the arbitration is concluded,” Time Warner Cable said in a statement on Monday night.\n\nYet competitors have characterized Time Warner Cable as trying to pass off the costs of the Dodgers rights to all customers, even those who don’t plan on watching the channel. An ala carte deal would likely return far less revenue to TWC and the team, or it would be priced so high as to further anger fans with memories of once watching games on free over-the-air TV.\n\nTWC has argued that the bundling of regional sports channels with other channels is standard industry practice, what may be an important point to an arbitration judge. Observers say that DirecTV would likely have a reluctance to enter into the unpredictable process of binding arbitration, where they would be bound by deal terms set by a retired judge.\n\nIn its statement, DirecTV said that they agree with Sherman that “any loyal Dodger fans deserve the opportunity to see games, yet not at the expense of the millions of other AT&T U-verse, Charter Communications, Cox Communications, DirecTV, Dish Network, Mediacom, Suddenlink Communications, Verizon FiOS and other families who have little or no interest in paying for Time Warner Cable’s excesses.”",
  "latent_14628": "Photo via Flickr user dalecruse\n\nA party of four walks into a Michelin-starred restaurant with eight trophy bottles of ultra-high end cabernet—each worth over $1,000—and they're hinting at having their corkage fees waived.\n\nSuddenly, the sommelier is enmeshed in a game of high-stakes diplomacy requiring the art of a United Nations sidebar. The goal: keep big-shot wine collectors happy without losing too much money on the table.\n\n\"They say, 'Oh, we didn't realize there was a limit,' and, 'Come on, what's the big deal? These are very special bottles,'\" one noted sommelier lamented. \"It becomes a guilt trip.\"\n\nSuccumbing to the pressure, in this case, demands 32 hand-buffed glasses, five decanters, and \"one human being's entire night\" to service an hours-long dinner. It saps the restaurant's resources and could cost more than is made on the tab, because beverage is most restaurants' profit-driver and this four-top will have none. \"We have to sell wine, and if we don't sell wine, we don't exist,\" said the sommelier.\n\nIn speaking to wine professionals—all from top Manhattan restaurants and all of whom only spoke under the condition of anonymity to avoid offending patrons—it is clear that begging out of corkage fees is a too-common practice among New York's wealthy diners. Some have even coined a term for them: corkage cowboys.\n\nCollectors will often offer a taste of their trophy wine to the sommelier. Most view it as a gracious perk; not a quid pro quo, which is how the cowboys employ it.\n\nOne sommelier said the cowboys were generally \"mid-career finance guys\"— bankers, hedge funders, and money managers who surface at restaurants about once a month. \"They swim in the same circles. They all know each other, go out together, and have the same perspective.\" Playing one restaurant off another, he said, \"They collectively boycott those that don't conform. It becomes a pack mentality.\"\n\nMost guests do happily abide by corkage policies. But cowboys work the gray areas, forcing sommeliers to do an uncomfortable table-side calculus on behalf of their restaurant's owners.\n\nOne move cowboys use to evade corkage fees is a twist on a common gesture of goodwill. Collectors will often offer a taste of their trophy wine to the sommelier. Most view it as a gracious perk; not a quid pro quo, which is how the cowboys employ it.\n\n\"I've seen it in every single restaurant,\" says one noted sommelier. \"They think we're going to geek out. Like, 'Oh, yeah, Screaming Eagle, great.'\" And it would be great, except that the nicety is manipulated. \"Once a staff member begins drinking from that bottle, the assumption is that the corkage fee will be waived.\" said another top wine professional. \"That's not a gift of generosity; it's a gift of expectation.\"\n\nSome restaurateurs try to deter cowboy-like behavior by setting their fees astronomically high ($150 per bottle at Per Se, for example) and prohibiting bottles that can be found on the restaurant's wine list.\n\nPlaces like Daniel, Del Posto, and Le Bernardin simply don't allow customers to bring their own wine. These are zero-tolerance policies: \"You could be the President and you cannot bring wine into my restaurant,\" said one no-corkage sommelier. Sorry, Obama, but you'll have to leave that 1976 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti at home.\n\nTo some, it seems strange to BYO to the planet's finest dining establishments. \"You wouldn't bring food, would you?\" said one beverage director. \"Like, walk in with a pizza and say, 'Send a slice back to the chef.'\"\n\n'We're arguing about a $40 or $50 corkage fee, but we're talking about bottles that are thousands of dollars!'\n\nBut there are times when sommeliers encourage their diners to arrive with their own wine. \"Someone went to an estate on their honeymoon,\" says one, \"or the vintage is the year of the birth of their first child ... it becomes an allegory of their relationship—that brings a tear to my eye.\"\n\nAccording to another sommelier, however, those occasions are \"super-rare\" and, most of the time, customers \"want to drink fancy wine with their meals but don't want to pay as much for it.\" Setting corkage policies that don't toss the baby with the Bordeaux bathwater is a nimble dance. Says one wine pro, \"You always hear horror stories: You give an inch, and they take a yard, bringing bottle after bottle.\"\n\nThe cowboy phenomenon appears to be special to New York. In San Francisco, in contrast, the corkage dynamic is way more chill. \"People understand you have to charge something—I mean I have five sommeliers,\" said Mark Bright, wine director at Saison, a three-Michelin-starred restaurant. Diners generally don't have a problem paying corkage there.\n\nThe perplexing question remains: Why do these wealthy diners haggle? As one frustrated sommelier put it, \"We're arguing about a $40 or $50 corkage fee, but we're talking about bottles that are thousands of dollars!\"\n\nWine professionals are sympathetic to the fact that collectors have already paid for their bottles once, usually at great cost. But, uncorking them in their restaurants was not part of that deal, they say. Between rent and storage and a broken $40 Zalto glass here and there, \"restaurants are lucky to get ten percent gross margins.\" said one sommelier. \"If you're in New York and you bitch about a corkage fee ... are you crazy?\"",

  "latent_14915": "England are painfully behind other nations in youth development; Barcelona’s team of all the talents visit Arsenal on Wednesday with up to seven home-grown products, such as Xavi, Pedro and Andrés Iniesta, in their starting line-up.\n\n“Barcelona can achieve a lot because they have four times as much money as our clubs because of individual TV selling rights and they can pool young talent nationally,” said Richard Scudamore, the Premier League ’s chief executive, on Monday.\n\nThe second point is one he seeks to copy with the Premier League’s Elite Player Performance Plan, which splits clubs into four categories of excellence from the 2012-13 season. This will give leading clubs, those who qualify for category one, access to the country’s top prospects and, most significantly, trebling the time spent working on their skills.\n\n“This is a supertanker that’s very difficult to stop now,” said Scudamore of the Premier League’s blueprint for better dream factories. “It’s a strong force going in a positive direction.”\n\nOn average, a young player in Spain will have enjoyed 4,880 hours contact time with an elite club such as Barcelona from the ages of nine to 21. Holland and France pour even more time into coaching youngsters, 5,940 hours and 5,740 hours respectively. An English tyro will have only 3,760.\n\nUnder the FA’s Charter for Quality introduced in 1997, Premier League clubs are permitted three hours’ contact time a week with nine to 11 year-olds, those progressing through what Dennis Bergkamp calls the “golden years of learning”.\n\nIn the 12-16 age group, English contenders are limited to five hours a week while those at Bergkamp’s Ajax have 10-12. Wonder why England struggle? Do the maths.\n\n“Our boys are disadvantaged compared to European boys, where they have full-time, well paid coaches,” said the Premier League’s head of youth, Jed Roddy. “We’ve made it very easy for managers to resource their clubs from abroad.”\n\nThe Premier League is taking inspiration from the world of music and dance. At the Menuhin music school, each budding virtuoso has 10,840 hours of contact time in their development years, three times the football figure. Pupils at the Royal Ballet receive 10,000 hours’ tuition.\n\nThe supply line to England needs improving and Roddy believes that “it could be 10 years before the benefits are fully felt”. Although talents such as Jack Wilshere are emerging, the crisis in youth development is not simply related to technical deficiencies.\n\nSome academy directors despair at the declining fitness levels of English youth, particularly in the under-resourced state sector. Everton have even begun sending coaches into primary schools.\n\nPremier League plans coincide with a new FA coaching strategy, focusing more on small-sided games, a philosophy that the more enlightened clubs, such as United, have long advocated. The FA will help coach the coaches at their National Football Centre at Burton, so providing the elite with more specialist, age-appropriate coaches.\n\nMost controversially, Premier League clubs have even discussed the possibility of bridging the gap between academy and first-team by fielding teams in the Football League. However, it was deemed “too radical” by Scudamore and “offensive” by Andy Williamson, the Football League’s chief operating officer.\n\nOverall, the Premier League’s pursuit of excellence should be applauded, but the elite body must ensure the Football League is not badly damaged by what could be deemed a land grab. Upstairs must look after downstairs.\n\nOf the 23 England players who travelled to Copenhagen last week, 13 spent part or all of their development years at Football League clubs. Two others, Wilshere (Luton Town) and David Stockdale (York City), also benefited briefly. “There’s a big risk for England if we get cut away,” said Greg Clarke, the chairman of the Football League.\n\nUnder the new Elite Player Performance Plan, some of those nurtured at Clarke’s clubs will migrate even earlier to the elite. So compensation levels must be properly weighted to safeguard smaller clubs’ survivals. “But if the player is too expensive, there’ll be an incentive to go abroad,” warned Scudamore.\n\nFootball League fears are real. Clarke hosts a series of chairman dinners with the leading lights at his 72 clubs. “They tell me the No 1 or No 2 issue is youth development and some say they can’t stay in business if it goes,” Clarke said. “We are concerned that 30 to 40 clubs would give up youth development.”\n\nAs usual in football, the tension comes down to money. “Looking at the Deloittes figures into Premier League club accounts, the amounts [on compensation] are not exactly going to break the bank,” Clarke said. “The £50 million Chelsea spent on Fernando Torres is equal to the cost of running all Football League youth development for a year – with £10 million spare.”\n\nClarke also pointed to the human cost. “We mustn’t screw up kids’ lives,” Clarke said. “One minute they think they are going to be the next Wayne Rooney, the next they are being released by a Premier League club and dumped back on their council estate. Let’s develop the hell out of our kids but let’s not sacrifice them on the altar of football efficiency.”\n\nFor all the sympathy with any 16 year-old released by a Premier League club, he can still rebuild his career at one of Clarke’s clubs.\n\nEnglish football must accept the law of the jungle if England are to become powerful again.",

When I write about a particular square in some inspiring place, I’m hoping you won’t take away from it that we should stamp 5-story buildings on 50-yard wide squares all across the landscape. But rather I’m reaffirming that a sense of enclosure can indeed provide a feeling of comfort and satisfaction. You’ll know, if you’re a frequent PlaceShakers reader, that this sense of enclosure is illegal across much of North America because of auto-centric land use laws that require wide, fast roads.\n\nWhile we often encourage form-based codes or other interventions to reverse these trends and increase livability, the number one way to fail at legalizing great places is failing to articulate a collective local vision. Local is the key word here. Regardless of how many global, national, or regional placemaking principles we understand, unless we take the time to extract the local knowledge about culture, custom and climate from the resident experts — the locals themselves — then we have little chance of making a meaningful and context-supportive difference locally.\n\nThat being said, those placemaking principles are somewhat similar to mixing paints or selecting brushes for an artist. It doesn’t matter whether I’m trying to paint hyperrealism or nonrepresentational abstract art, the color theory is still a guiding principle that I must know in order to be successful. In the same vein, unless we have a working knowledge of human placemaking principles, it’s hard to fully empower local placeshakers with the tools required to achieve their collective local vision or consensus plan.\n\nThis reminds me of what a fellow urbanist and friend, Jason Miller, recently said on his mayoral platform. “It’s common for me to hit the road and visit other towns to see what they’re doing to revitalize their economies. The purpose of these visits is not simply to gather ideas to try in Concrete (Miller’s town), but to gather principles that can be scaled to suit Concrete. Last year I visited Dayton, Washington, and Independence, Oregon, gaining invaluable new knowledge in community revitalization. Knowledge Concrete needs!”\n\nSo last week when I wrote about the elegant plan of Victoria Beach that was executed as dirt streets, I wasn’t suggesting that we return our new streets to dirt. Just that we learn from our ancestors what it means to be frugal and inventive. What it means to be accessible and attainable.\n\nLeveraging our legacy of human placemaking experience for any particular place — be it intensely urban, remotely rural, or somewhere in between — is the true challenge of our efforts.\n\n–Hazel Borys\n\nIf PlaceShakers is our soapbox, our Facebook page is where we step down, grab a drink and enjoy a little conversation.

  "latent_15010": "What's up Doc?\n\nPeople's names Other phrases about:\n\nWhat's the origin of the phrase 'What's up Doc?'?\n\n'Eh, What's up Doc?' joins 'That's All Folks!' as the best-known lines from Tex Avery's Looney Tunes cartoon series. It was delivered by Bugs Bunny, while nonchalantly chewing on a carrot, in most of the cartoons in which the character appeared, beginning with A Wild Hare, 1940. This was the first Bugs Bunny cartoon, although Bugs wasn't named until the second cartoon - Elmer's Pet Rabbit ('Happy Rabbit', a prototype Bugs Bunny with a somewhat different personality had appeared earlier).\n\nAvery explained how the line became established in the numerous cartoon confrontations between Bugs Bunny and the hapless hunter Elmer Fudd:\n\n\"We decided he [Bugs] was going to be a smart-aleck rabbit, but casual about it. That opening line of 'Eh, what's up, Doc?' floored them. They expected the rabbit to scream, or anything but make a casual remark. For here's a guy pointing a gun in his face! It got such a laugh that we said, 'Boy, we'll do that every chance we get.'\"\n\nChuck Jones went on to explain that the demeanour of Bugs when delivering the line was adapted from Clark Gable's performance in It Happened One Night. In that film, Gable's character leans against a fence eating carrots and gives instructions with his mouth full to Claudette Colbert's character. The scene was well-known to audiences at the time who would have been well aware that Bugs was spoofing Clark Gable.\n\nThe line has outlived Bugs Bunny and is now commonly used worldwide as a jokey alternative to the straightforward query 'what's up?', that is, 'what's going on?'.",
  "latent_15080": "Warner Bros. and DC Films have much to be proud of with their latest Justice League hit, Wonder Woman. It was the biggest grosser at the North American box office in summer, 2017, with a final tally of $411.5 million. That was 25% higher than the $330 million earned by the summer’s other solo superhero picture, Spider-Man: Homecoming. It also established an important new franchise, it boosted the fortunes of DC’s gloomy and critically derided Extended Universe series, and it set all kinds of records for female-directed and female-starring movies.\n\nBut in one vitally important respect, the picture fell far short of Spider-Man: Homecoming and every other major superhero film released in the past 10 years. It was a relatively soft box office performer overseas, earning less than 50% of its $819 million worldwide gross from foreign territories (49.7% to be precise). In a business and genre where the overseas markets typically account for around two-thirds of total theatrical receipts, Wonder Woman’s foreign numbers look like symptoms of an Achilles’ heel.\n\nOnly once after 2008, when Marvel was just launching its Marvel Cinematic Universe with Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, has a studio superhero movie failed to earn as much theatrical revenue overseas as in North America. In 2008 Iron Man earned 45.6% of its worldwide total from foreign territories, and Hulk took 48.8%. But those two films arrived back in the days when the concept of superhero movies outside of the Superman, Batman and Spider-Man franchises was still unfamiliar. The lone exception since then was Green Lantern, a 2011 Warner Bros release, which performed abysmally everywhere it went. Thanks to Forbes contributor Scott Mendelson for pointing this out to me.\n\nIn the intervening years Marvel did an exceptional job of expanding the market for unfamiliar characters (and established ones too), and by 2012-2013 its pictures were routinely earning more than 60% and sometimes 70% of their revenue from outside of North America. The high-water mark was reached in 2014 when The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (a Sony release with IP licensed from Marvel) earned 71.4% of its $709 million worldwide total from foreign territories. X-Men: Apocalypse (with Fox as its licensee) matched that 71.4% overseas share in 2016.\n\nSo what happened to Wonder Woman? The simple explanation is that many key overseas markets didn’t embrace the film with the same enthusiasm that American audiences did. Europe was particularly soft for the film, as it under-indexed—relative to other superhero pics—in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Russia, among other countries.\n\nHere’s a look at selected major territories where Wonder Woman underperformed compared to its summer rival, Spider-Man: Homecoming:\n\nUnited Kingdom: Wonder Woman (WW) earned 3.7% of its worldwide gross there; Spider-Man: Homecoming (SMH) earned 4.6%\n\nWonder Woman (WW) earned 3.7% of its worldwide gross there; Spider-Man: Homecoming (SMH) earned 4.6% Italy: WW – 0.5%; SMH – 1.2%\n\nWW – 0.5%; SMH – 1.2% France: WW – 2.0%; SMH – 2.2%\n\nWW – 2.0%; SMH – 2.2% Germany: WW – 1.1%; SMH – 1.3%\n\nWW – 1.1%; SMH – 1.3% Russia: WW – 1.0%; SMH – 1.9%\n\nWW – 1.0%; SMH – 1.9% Japan: WW – 1.3%; SMH – 2.8%\n\nWW – 1.3%; SMH – 2.8% South Korea: WW – 1.9%; SMH – 6.0%\n\nWW – 1.9%; SMH – 6.0% Mexico: WW – 2.7%; SMH – 3.1%\n\nWW – 2.7%; SMH – 3.1% China: WW – 11.0%; SMH – 12.2%\n\nThere were, however, a few territories where Wonder Woman overperformed relative to its summer rival. These included:\n\nAustralia: WW – 3.0%; SMH – 2.3%\n\nWW – 3.0%; SMH – 2.3% Taiwan: WW – 1.3%; SMH – 1.1%\n\nWW – 1.3%; SMH – 1.1% Brazil: WW – 4.1%; SMH – 3.7%\n\nThe reasons why Wonder Woman underperformed in so many countries, and why it overperformed in a few, are as diverse and varied as the countries themselves. Some analysts have blamed the picture's underperformance around the world on the fact that the Wonder Woman character is unfamiliar to audiences in many places, but that theory falls apart when you look at the overseas success of recent films based on such obscure comic book characters as Doctor Strange, which earned 65.7% of its worldwide take from overseas, Ant-Man (65.3%), and Thor (60%).\n\nOthers have suggested that Wonder Woman, the alter ego of the Amazonian Diana Prince, suffered some chauvinism because she is the only solo female lead in a superhero franchise. But that theory fails to explain why audiences went gaga for her in Brazil, Australia, the Philippines, the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe outspoken anti-Palestine rhetoric of Wonder Woman’s star Gal Gadot did hurt the grosses in some Middle Eastern countries like Lebanon, Jordan, and Tunisia, but the film did fine in the United Arab Emirates, where it earned a snazzy $4.3 million, nearly as much as Homecoming’s $5 million.\n\nThe real problem may lie not with the film, but with its distributor. Not a single one of the top 10 indexing superhero movies in overseas markets was released by Warner Bros. 11 Marvel and MCU pictures have taken 63% or more of their worldwide totals from abroad, yet the best Warners has done is 62% with last year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Not one of the studio's other superhero releases has cracked even 60%. So it would be wise for the studio to start thinking ahead to its foreign marketing for Wonder Woman 2, which is slated to release in 2019.\n\nRead More: Why The Middle East Went To War With 'Wonder Woman'",

  "latent_15256": "Since it suffered its own real estate boom, bust and financial crisis in the early 1990s, Japan has spent the better part of two decades clawing out of deflationary quicksand. (While deflation—a broad-based decline in price levels—might sound good to those struggling with high living costs, it’s a very bad thing for an advanced economy, acting as a persistent headwind against investment, consumption and growth.)\n\nRecently, a concerted push of monetary and fiscal stimulus from Japanese officials—known as Abenomics—suggests that Japan could finally be breaking the deflationary cycle. Price levels have turned up markedly in recent months. For the global economy, that’s a good thing; a strong and vibrant Japan—still the world’s third-largest national economy—would provide another leg for the global economy to stand on.\n\nUnfortunately, just as Japan approaches escape velocity from the deflationary vortex, Europe is showing signs of what could be long-term economic trouble for the world economy. (The 27-nation European Union is the world’s largest economic bloc.) The latest update on price levels in the euro zone today showed headline consumer prices rising a piddling 0.7% in October, from the same month in 2012. That was much lower than economists had expected. Core inflation—which strips out the noisy and volatile prices of products like food and energy—rose just 0.8% compared to last year. That’s a record low.\n\nThe bottom line? Europe is playing a serious game of footsie with deflation, just as Japanese prices have finally stopped falling. Year-on-year price changes actually increased 0.7% for Japan in September. This chart shows the deflation baton being handed off to Europe.\n\n​\n\nAs Japan’s experience has shown, once you slip into deflation, it can be very, very hard to get out. The traditional tools of central bankers are much more effective at quelling inflation—just raise rates until the economy cools off—than generating it. (A central bank can print money, but that doesn’t mean that it’s going to circulate around the economy, which is what creates needed growth.)\n\nFor its part, the European Central Bank isn’t even attempting to confront the problem. In fact, the ECB is actually tightening monetary policy right now, albeit in a somewhat stealth way. That’s the mistake that the US Federal Reserve made at the start of the Great Depression. And it bodes particularly poorly for a European economy that only just wobbled out of recession itself. So will this lead to another crisis? No. But deflation could damage Europe’s economy for decades, and that’s bad news for everyone.",

In fact, back before anyone knew what Skylanders was, Activision approached Nintendo and offered them exclusive rights to the franchise. But for some unknown reason, Nintendo declined.\n\nRegardless of the lack of exclusivity, Nintendo and Skylanders still share the same target audience. Therefore Activision sees tremendous sales of the Nintendo Wii Skylanders Starter Pack.\n\nActivision Shows Some Love\n\nBecause of the high sales volume in the past, Activision has decided to create one more game for the Nintendo Wii (unlike Disney Infinity who dropped support for the Wii this year).\n\nActivision is aware that the Wii is dying, but instead of just completely dropping support they are trying to help their loyal customers make the transition to the next generation.\n\nIf you look closely at the Wii packaging for Skylanders Trap Team you might notice a bright green seal near the top.

  "latent_15514": "In a series initially inspired by the popular series of essays Life of Reilly, I go in depth on the character Venom. Venom is one of Marvel’s most popular characters, yet he’s someone that very few people actually like. Sure, the 12-year-olds and the casual readers seem to enjoy his giant teeth and murderous demeanor, but most everyone else – including just about every comic writer out there – has it in for the guy. As a young fan of the character who grew up to see Venom evolve, I look into the character’s history to try to see and explain the appeal.\n\nStarting from Venom’s turn to anti-hero from the early 90’s, We Care a Lot covers the insane storylines that nobody remembers to the diamonds in the rough that few have read. Watch as a character with possible dimension (and dementia) squanders his potential through bad writing, editorial and the constant need for a company to make a quick buck. Soon Venom’s likeness is thrown around like a ragdoll to the point where he doesn’t resemble a solid persona and Marvel has no choice but to scrap him and try again.\n\nBut yet… perhaps, like Venom himself, there’s still a chance for something bad to redeem itself and become something good.\n\nPRE CARE A LOT\n\n(The Venom articles I wrote before doing this series)\n\nPlanet of the Symbiotes: History Before it Repeats Itself (10/26/07): At the time of the article, the Venom Bomb arc in Mighty Avengers was on the horizon. Here is a look at the other minor crossover story where symbiotes took over New York City. This time they had the team of Spider-Man, Venom and the Scarlet Spider to take care of it.\n\nVenom vs. Sandman: Three Stories of Living Grains and Eating Brains (11/14/07): With Spider-Man 3 recently in theaters, we take a look at the three stories throughout Marvel history where the movie’s two villains Venom and Sandman meet up and butt heads. This includes Venom’s appearances in Silver Sable and the Wild Pack, a really horrible Howard Mackie Spider-Man story, and the dark future of Spider-Man: Reign.\n\nWE CARE A LOT\n\nPrologue (10/26/08): A look at how Venom got me into comics, followed by Venom: Deathtrap: The Vault, an Avengers graphic novel rereleased with Venom’s name tacked on.\n\nPart 1: Brand New Leaf (10/29/08): Venom gets over his hatred of Spider-Man for a little bit, moves to San Francisco, grows a mullet and starts fighting crime. He has a bunch of symbiote kids and fights the Punisher.\n\nPart 2: Meet the Heavy-Hitters (11/3/08): Venom gets in a completely weird story about fighting both Juggernaut and insanity demons. Then he teams up with Morbius and later clashes with Smart Hulk.\n\nPart 3: The Last Days of San Francisco (11/27/08): Meet the Mace, a cyber ninja who appeared in a comic arc you probably never read. He does a crossover with Venom and fades into obscurity. Venom then teams up with the second-string Ghost Rider known as Vengeance and then goes back to New York to fight the new kid on the block, the Scarlet Spider.\n\nPart 4: Father of the Year (11/30/08): Separated from his symbiote, Eddie Brock must contend with his bloodthirsty symbiote children and their desperate human hosts. After that, he fights his eldest son Carnage with cyberspace as the backdrop.\n\nPart 5: Wrath of the Butterface (12/3/08): A new Sin-Eater is in town and Eddie’s ex-wife is on his “to-kill” list. It’s the story known mostly for introducing us to She-Venom. Also, Venom saves Christmas.\n\nPart 6: Special Guest Villain (12/23/08): As his own solo series goes off without a hitch, Venom appears in all sorts of other comics. Iron Man, Nova, Daredevil and more. More importantly, Venom beats the stuffing out of DC’s top hero. And I’m not talking about Batman!\n\nPart 7: The Ballad of Rad Eddie (2/2/09): In a crossover with Malibu Comics, Venom faces the evil vampire Rune. Then he takes on Ben Reilly Spider-Man, fights a symbiote-eating creature from outer space and becomes the king of skateboarding.\n\nPart 8: Brains! Brains! It’s Okay! (3/4/09): A look at The Hunger, possibly the best Venom comic of the 90’s, as Venom deals with his insatiable hunger for brains. That’s followed by a really dumb Wolverine team-up and a cool Eddie Brock solo story from years past.\n\nPart 9: The Hybrid That Crashed and Burned (4/9/09): Meet Scott Washington. Guys like Venom and Carnage have one symbiote, but Scott has FOUR! The short career of the forgotten symbiote superhero Hybrid.\n\nPart 10: The Symbiote Who Loved Me (4/15/09): After being arrested and put on trial, Venom is taken in by the government and used as a secret agent. This leads to a lot of failure to be subtle and a throwdown with Ghost Rider.\n\nPart 11: No More Mr. Nice Guy (5/11/09): Despite his best intentions, Venom government job goes bust and they make an attempt on his life. He goes on a rampage, fighting Spider-Man a couple more times. The symbiote is killed and Venom’s solo run comes to a close. Also in this update, non-comic appearances of anti-hero Venom and the completely abysmal parody comic Venumb.\n\nPart 12: A Factory of Loose Ends (5/17/09): Venom’s back to being a straight-up villain and appears in Howard Mackie’s Spider-Man comics for about a year. With stories that never go anywhere, these are the beginnings for some bad, bad times for Venom.\n\nPart 13: Way Out of His Mind (6/29/09): Having been missing from comics for about two years, Venom reappears in Venom by Daniel Way. This deals with the first nine issues, where the symbiote kills a bunch of people in Canada and fights Wolverine.\n\nPart 14: Eddie, Are You Okay? Will You Tell Us, That You’re Okay? (7/6/09): Taking a break from the Daniel Way series, this article deals with the return of Eddie Brock and the revelation that he has cancer. After warring with his symbiote, he ends up auctioning it to a new host…\n\nPart 15: Way Too Hard to Comprehend (7/20/09): Now the second half of the Way Venom series. Characters are written badly and cloning is brought into the mix in a series that goes absolutely nowhere.\n\nPart 16: Toxology Report (9/1/09): Hybrid isn’t the only symbiote superhero the world forgot about. This time the topic is Toxin, the honest cop injected with Carnage’s alien son. Can the host and baby monster within co-exist?\n\nPart 17: The Hollywood Influence (9/15/09): Spider-Man 3 featured the black costume and Venom, so around that time, Marvel did stories involving Spider-Man wearing a black costume (not THE black costume) and Eddie Brock being near death. Then there was this miniseries about Venom’s origin that was downright awful.\n\nPart 18: The Sammy Hagar of Cannibalism (10/13/09): Hey, did you know that Mac Gargan was Venom for a while? Yeah! Fancy that. Because YOU DEMANDED IT, a look at Gargan’s tenure as Venom, up to his awesome Sinister Spider-Man miniseries.\n\nPart 19: We Are the Worlds (12/3/09): There are so many alternate worlds in comic books and many of them have their own Venoms. There’s the What If series, Spider-Man Adventures, the Spider-Ham world, the Mangaverse and more.\n\nPart 20: Creatures on Infinite Earths (12/30/09): A special DOUBLE-SIZED (legally, I have to capitalize that) installment to celebrate the 20th entry in the series. More alternate Venoms including Ultimate Venom, a giant spider ghost and a symbiote wizard.\n\nPart 21: Back in Black to the Future (4/18/10): Now that the alternate presents are dealt with, how about the alternate futures? Spider-Man 2099, Spider-Man: Reign, Spider-Girl and more!\n\nPart 22: We Care Again (1/25/2011): Who needs Mac Gargan as Venom when you can have Eddie Brock as Anti-Venom? He’s spikier and his colors are different, but as he fights with and against the likes of Spider-Man and the Punisher, it feels like coming home… All is well.\n\nPart 23: Red Jelly (6/11/11): Taking another trip to the 90’s, we see Venom’s most mainstream story. Fourteen issues of Spider-Man and Venom arguing over whether or not killing an unstoppable killing machine is wise while a bunch of villains you’ve never heard of outside of this story are seeing how many digits they can get in their body count.\n\nPart 24: The Antihero’s Journey Concludes (7/9/11): To wrap everything up, I take one last look at 25 years of storyline and countless writers and artists, tape it all together and show that in the end, we get a pretty solid story about a bitter murderer transforming into a hero. All by syncing his history with the Hero’s Journey outline.",

All those things move on the waterways, so if it shuts down you've got a huge stop of commerce.\"\n\nThe Guardian's Suzanne Goldenberg reports on the river in this video:\n\nIn an effort to keep traffic moving along the river KMOV St. Louis reports that \"the Army Corps of Engineers will begin blasting the riverbed in an effort to keep the channel open for barge traffic.\"\n\nIn addition to being seen as a sign of further climate change-induced disasters to come, the drought and its effects on river traffic have real economic costs.\n\nThe Guardian reports that \"about $7bn in vital commodities typically moves on the river at this time of year – including grain, coal, heating oil, and cement.\" And Weather Underground co-founder Jeff Masters wrote in November:\n\nSandy's damages of perhaps $50 billion will likely be overshadowed by the huge costs of the great drought of 2012. While it will be several months before the costs of America's worst drought since 1954 are known, the 2012 drought is expected to cut America's GDP by 0.5 - 1 percentage points, said Deutsche Bank Securities this week. “If the U.S. were growing at 4 percent, it wouldn’t be as big an issue, but at 2 percent, it’s noticed,” said Joseph LaVorgna, the chief U.S. economist at Deutsche. Since the U.S. GDP is approximately $15 trillion, the drought of 2012 represents a $75 - $150 billion hit to the U.S. economy. This is in the same range as the estimate of $77 billion in costs for the drought, made by Purdue University economist Chris Hurt in August.\n\nThe hope of the drought and its effects ending soon is bleak. The NOAA foresees \"drought conditions lingering or intensifying over much of the central and western United States.\"",

The commission will meet in January to lay out its mission.\n\nIt was founded after “Star Wars” producer Kathleen Kennedy and others called for a meeting on issues of sexual harassment and inequality that have captured the attention of the country under the banner of the #MeToo movement, founded more than a decade ago by activist Tarana Burke.\n\n“The fact that so many industry leaders across film, television, music, digital, unions, agencies … and guilds came together, in one room, to explore solutions speaks to a new era,” Kennedy said in a statement.\n\nIn 1991, Hill testified during a televised public hearing that Supreme Court Justice nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her while they worked together at the U.S. Department of Education. She is now a professor at Brandeis University.\n\n“It is time to end the culture of silence,” Hill told the AP in a statement. “I’ve been at this work for 26 years. This moment presents us with an unprecedented opportunity to make real change.”",

  "latent_16009": "Buffalo Trace Distillery, run by the Sazerac company, is a distillery known around the world for their amazing bourbon portfolio, including Blanton’s, Eagle Rare, Pappy van Winkle, and many other fantastic labels. These brands attract scores of visitors to their distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky, where they offer five different (free!) tours, which end with a complimentary tasting. However, sometimes visitors have the chance to experience something sweeter than bourbon: a tour by Freddie Johnson, third generation distillery worker and tour guide extraordinaire. Freddie’s tours are the stuff of legend, so I contacted him for an interview to figure out just what sets him apart from other guides at Buffalo Trace.\n\nFor most people, bourbon is just a damn fine drink, but not for Freddie. He approaches it with honor and respect, since it has been the backbone of his family for many years. Both Freddie’s grandfather and father worked at the distillery; his grandfather even selected the barrels from which Albert B. Blanton chose his first single barrels. Johnson says he remembers visiting the distillery at the age of five, when his father and grandfather both worked there. Although he remembers the distillery from long ago, he looks forward to all of the changes coming in this new age—and he reminded me of Buffalo Trace’s motto, “Honor tradition, embrace change.”\n\nSpeaking of long ago, Freddie mentioned that when Sazerac acquired the distillery formerly known as O. F. C. (Old Fashioned Copper) in 1992, there were only fifteen employees left. In just 24 years, that number has grown to 425 full time employees, with plans to expand even more. Buffalo Trace also works closely with the community and local universities to give life to Frankfort and the surrounding area. They only source their grain from a 100-mile radius and announced recently their plans for an estate-grown bourbon.\n\nNeedless to say, Freddie has a lot to be proud of as a guide at Buffalo Trace. He also loves giving tours to both the young and the old, since the distillery is kid friendly as well. He relates to his younger audience by teaching them about mechanical and structural engineering, and connects that to what they are learning in school, rather than simply giving a tour to the adults in the group and letting the children stare into the distance. For adults, Johnson makes sure he doesn’t give just-another-bourbon-distillery-tour. For those who have already visited distilleries, he tries to add on to what they have already learned and teach them about what Buffalo Trace does differently. He says, “We want you to be a raving fan of Buffalo Trace.”\n\nIf you don’t have the chance to get to Buffalo Trace Distillery, you might see Freddie working an event like the Bourbon Mixer. Freddie views these events as an “appetizer” for what people might experience if they go to Buffalo Trace. He loves sharing bourbon with the people he meets at events, and especially introducing them to one of his favorite drinks: an adult root beer float a la Buffalo Trace. Here’s the recipe!",

That makes plenty of sense, after all. If you're at a concert, even slight delays between what's happening on-stage and coming through your headphones could be jarring.\n\nAs someone who's particularly picky about my sound quality, I was surprised at just how good the MIXHalo stream sounded. I could clearly hear all the lyrics during Incubus' Drive and make out individual instruments, something that's rarely possible at concerts. I also didn't lose out on the concert experience much, either, since I could still hear and feel the playback from the live instruments. I paid particular attention to the drummer during the demo, and surprisingly enough, I didn't notice any delays between beats.\n\nWhen I cranked my RBH EP-3 earbuds to max volume, I also didn't hear any distortion or compression artifacts. It's admittedly tough to judge audio quality accurately amid the noise of a live event, though. There was the occasional hiccup during the stream, but it corrected itself quickly. Incubus rounded out the event by backing Pharrell's Get Lucky, a musical collaboration I never expected to sit through.\n\nAccording to Engadget's Roberto Baldwin, a music nerd who often spends weekends rocking out on stage, MIXHalo could be particularly useful for anyone concerned with hearing loss. Concerts can get incredibly loud, after all, so many regulars end up wearing earplugs to keep things at a manageable level. It could also be great for anyone hard of hearing, he notes.\n\nMIXHalo is still developing its technology, but it hopes to head to concert venues by this fall.",

In the beginning, Trump refused to provide any details of his plan, claiming that he did not want terrorists to learn about US intentions.\n\nIn September, however, Trump outlined his approach to fighting Daesh in a national security speech.\n\n\"Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS [Daesh],\" he said. \"We should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission.\"\n\nTrump has called for cooperation with \"our Arab allies and friends in the Middle East\" in the fight against the terrorists, and said he would weigh an alliance with Russia for that purpose as well.\n\nThe United States will undertake \"aggressive joint and coalition military operations\" against Daesh, according to Trump’s plan. The country will also look to boost intelligence sharing and cyberwarfare in order to disrupt terrorists’ propaganda and recruiting campaigns.\n\nAt the same time, Trump said rebuilding the US military and empowering generals to destroy Daesh will free the United States from endless wars seeking to topple foreign governments.\n\n\"We will abandon the reckless regime change favored by my opponent [Hillary Clinton] and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States,\" Trump stated.\n\nAdditionally, Trump’s plan highlights intent to defeat radical Islam by promoting the US system of government and way of life.\n\n\"I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world — just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War,\" Trump said in September.\n\nTo keep foreign fighters out of the United States, Trump proposed to establish new screening procedures and enforce existing immigration laws. Moreover, he suggested to temporarily suspend immigration from volatile regions with history of exporting terrorism.\n\nOn December 15, US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said the United States should maintain its active involvement in the efforts of the anti-Islamic State coalition under the Trump administration.\n\nEarlier in December, US media reported that the Defense Department is preparing a number of proposals for the Trump administration aimed at intensification of US campaign against Daesh.\n\nMilitary officials are likely to propose easing restrictions on a number of US servicemen needed to take part in specific operations and reduction of White House involvement in the decision making process regarding an operation or airstrike, according to media reports.\n\nAN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF SURVEILLANCE\n\n© REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque Obama Wants Expulsions to Sabotage Trump Hopes for Good Relations With Russia\n\nLarge-scale US surveillance programs will likely continue in some form during the Trump’s administration.\n\nEarlier in December, the president-elect said he \"would be fine\" with restoration of the USA Patriot Act under which US law enforcement agencies conducted mass surveillance of individuals abroad as well as in the United States.\n\nA month after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, President George W. Bush signed the USA Patriot Act to expanded government surveillance of Americans’ online activities and authorized the bulk collection of telephone data. In 2015, US Congress approved provisions to the Patriot Act to rein in the National Security Agency’s controversial mass surveillance program.\n\nTrump has also floated the idea of increased surveillance and patrol of Muslim neighborhoods until the frequency of terror attacks within the United States drops. In addition, he suggested creating a database that would track Muslims. Trump’s team later stated, however, that the president-elect has never advocated for any specific databases.\n\nEarlier in December, more than 1,500 people, including some 200 employees of such tech companies as Google and Twitter, signed an open letter pledging not to assist the Trump administration with creation of any kind of data registry for tracking people based on their religious views.\n\nTHE GUANTANAMO CONTROVERSY AND TORTURE\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump's casual remarks about the legitimacy of extreme interrogation techniques, described by many analysts as torture, sparked a much debated controversy.\n\nLast week, Canada’s intelligence chief Michael Doucet reportedly said Ottawa may have to rethink how it provides intelligence to the United States if Trump makes good on his vow to torture captive extremists.\n\n© AFP 2018 / JONATHAN ERNST Trump to Meet With Intelligence Officials to Clarify Russian Spying Accusations\n\nCIA intelligence officer Philip Giraldi told Sputnik that Trump is likely to back down on his campaign comments favoring the restoration of waterboarding and other \"enhanced interrogation\" techniques.\n\nConcurrently with backing enhanced interrogation techniques, Trump has expressed his intention to keep open the US detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba open, even though outgoing Obama has made a significant effort to close the infamous prison.\n\n\"We're gonna load it up with some bad dudes, believe me, we're gonna load it up,\" Trump said in November.\n\nTrump indicated in August that he might push for US citizens accused of terrorism to be tried in a military tribunal in the Guantanamo prison.\n\n\"I would say they could be tried there, that would be fine,\" Trump said.\n\nNEW APPROACH TO REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS\n\nTrump has criticized NATO allies for not pulling their weight, while on the campaign trail he threatened to withdraw the United States from what he described as an obsolete organization if the allies did not deliver on their financial obligations.\n\nTrump has pledged to request all NATO nations to promptly pay their bills. He argued that only five NATO members, including the United States, are meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense.\n\n\"Additionally, I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them,\" Trump said in September.\n\nA member of the US House Committee on Armed Services, Congressman Robert Wittman told Sputnik on December 7 that the new Trump administration will also assess US strategy toward Ukraine.\n\n\"I don’t know whether the first effort would be assistance, but I do think that this administration will address the strategic elements of what we do in our relationship with Ukraine,\" Smith said.\n\nSince 2014, the United States has provided Ukraine with $600 million in military assistance, including training, equipment and reform advisory effort, according to the Defense Department.",

I was concerned for how it would be received [by the audience], because there are so many characters [to accommodate].”\n\n“There was so much pressure having been so successful in season 1,” he continued. “I’m excited for the second half of the season, because the most exciting part of what’s happening now is that the writers have been listening, we’re four or five episodes in the can, so it’s very hard to self-correct, but they’re very much fans of the show, very much committed. Someone is going to die — and they won’t come back — before the end of the season.”\n\nAnd while Jones would only tease that Irving’s reunion with Team Witness is “imminent,” he did share this delicious tease: “Irving’s soul still hangs in the balance.”\n\n“If we get this right, I think the second half of the season has some real surprises,” he said. “What that means for season 3, I don’t know. But I definitely think there’s some worthwhile stuff [ahead]…I’m mostly excited that you’re going to get to see more of Jenny and Irving…I think the second half of the season is going to be an exciting exploration for Sleepyheads, and I hope it lives up to their expectations.”\n\nHow the show plays out is also a bit of a question mark: new Fox bosses, Dana Walden and Gary Newman, raised eyebrows during their TCA session when they said that SLEEPY HOLLOW had gotten “a little too serialized,” and that the series would be getting more “episodic.” But the changes might not be as drastic as fans might have feared.\n\n“Good story is about the characters,” Jones said. “What [characters are] going for, what they’re trying to achieve: their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations. Whatever structure they want to use, as long as they remain true to telling the story of all the characters, I think it could be exciting. How it works [if they change the format] is above my pay grade. I know that I love these characters, and that [episodic] format has not traditionally been kind to characters; it’s more kind to plot.”\n\n“In the first half of the season, you certainly saw more procedural-type of episodes [on SLEEPY HOLLOW],” he continued. “Whereas I don’t believe that’s there the second half of the season, based on what I’ve seen.

The crew rushed to thescene of the fire when they saw smoke billowing out of a nearby house. When they arrived, the property was engulfed in flames and the front door was locked.\n\nBreaking down the door, they found an unconscious 20-year-old man inside. Carey - still in full costume - can be seen in the video performing CPR on the young man.\n\n\"The BA (breathing apparatus) crew radioed­ that they’ve found someone inside so I went up to the front door to help carry him out,” Carey told News Corp.\n\n“I think the beard and the hat came off when we started the resuscitation.

  "latent_16476": "Asia's rising economic success has helped China's hi-tech corridor to take a clear lead in the latest OECD international education rankings.\n\nThe results of the OECD's programme for international student assessment – a triennial exam for 15-year-olds known as Pisa – show that China's Shanghai region easily tops the rest of the world in maths, reading and science.\n\nSingapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea made up the rest of the top five for maths, followed by the Chinese island of Macao.\n\nElsewhere, Pisa results were a further disappointment for the US, which saw its maths rank fall to 36th place overall, worse than its 2009 performance, which President Obama dubbed a \"Sputnik moment\" for American education. In reading, the US fell seven places, to 24th, and in science the country came in 28th, down five.\n\nAustralia saw a precipitous fall in its maths ranking, from 15th in 2009 to 19th in 2012, as it was overtaken by Poland and the new entrant, Vietnam, which appears in the OECD tables for the first time. Australia's reading score was little changed but its performance in science slipped from 10th to 16th, tied with Macao.\n\nFinland was the highest placed European country, with a top-five performance in science, while Ireland was sixth-equal with Taiwan in reading. In maths, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and the Netherlands were the only European entrants in the top 10.\n\nThe UK's performance was virtually unchanged from its 2009 results, when its international rankings suffered with the addition of higher-placed new entrants such as Shanghai. It ranked 20th overall for science, 26th for maths and 23rd for reading – on a par with France and the US, and close to the OECD average for reading and maths.\n\nAndreas Schleicher, the OECD's deputy director for education and skills and co-ordinator of the Pisa programme, said the success of education systems such as Shanghai's was the result of an emphasis on selecting teachers, as well as prioritising investment in teacher training and development.\n\nShanghai's lead was so clear that the results were the equivalent of its students having had three additional years of schooling, the OECD estimates.\n\nOutside Asia, Brazil, Germany and Mexico have all shown consistent improvement, with Germany, Mexico and Turkey winning praise for improving the performance of their weakest performing students, many of whom were from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nDavid Spieghalter, the Winton professor of the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, said: \"Pisa explores many factors associated with country performance but occasionally seem hasty in assigning reasons for change – we can't decide causality from this study, and we should be very cautious in the lessons to be learned.\"\n\nSpieghalter added: \"If Pisa measures anything, it is the ability to do Pisa tests. Aligning policy along a single performance indicator can be damaging. We need to look at the whole picture.\"\n\nThe OECD administered the standardised tests at the end of last year in 34 countries and a total of 64 regions, to 500,000 15-year-olds.\n\nAccording to the findings, girls performed worse than boys in maths exams in 37 regions and countries, although in the majority of cases the gap was small. In most countries the gender gap favoured girls in reading, while in science there was little difference.\n\nSchleicher said that the OECD found no evidence from its international analysis that competition between private, state or charter-style schools – free schools, in the UK – had any impact on raising standards.\n\n\"You would expect that systems with greater choice would come out better because you expect competition to raise performance of the high performers and lower performers, and put out of the market schools and systems that do not succeed. But in fact, you don't see a correlation,\" Schleicher said.\n\n\"Competition alone is not a predictor for better outcomes. And the UK is a good example: a highly competitive school system but still only an average performer.\"\n\nInstead, Schleicher said parents had higher priorities in choosing schools than simply academic results, according to the OECD's surveys of parental opinion.\n\n\"The most important thing for parents is not the performance of the school but what they call a safe school environment. And that is true for privileged and disadvantaged parents,\" he said.",
  "latent_16693": "With the arrival of the next-gen era upon us, developers are looking at the raw hardware capabilities of the new consoles and wondering exactly how to use the vast increase in horsepower available to them. We'd like to think that 1080p is a given, but what's been particularly heartening has been a commitment to 60 frames per second from a number of key studios working on some of the most eagerly awaited titles.\n\nAccording to Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is one of those projects currently aiming for the gold standard in console frame-rate, and it's borne out by the video trailer presented at the beginning of Microsoft's E3 conference. Kojima himself is no stranger to shipping a 60fps title, of course. While the third and fourth Metal Gear Solid outings had varying performance levels (not to mention PSP Peace Walker operating at a locked 20fps), MGS2's interior sections ran at the full 60fps, dropping down to 30fps for the more demanding outdoor scenes. In presenting the HD Collection on Xbox 360 and PS3, which aimed to restore full frame-rate across the board, we perhaps get a much better idea of how the games were meant to be played.\n\nThe difference is revelatory - even more so for Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain. If you've only seen the trailer on a blurry stream with an ever-variable frame-rate, you're missing out on some beautifully detailed work from Kojima Productions that only looks even more beautiful when running at 60 frames per second - the way it was meant to be seen.\n\n\"Watch the E3 Metal Gear Solid 5 trailer the way it was meant to be seen - at 60 frames per second.\"\n\nAlternative 720p60 version: Capable hardware required for smooth playback\n\nThere's a pretty good reason why you don't see more 60Ffps video on the internet - and it's specifically down to the fact that existing PC playback technologies appear to have real issues maintaining frame-rate.

  "latent_17089": "Ahead of her meeting with Trump tomorrow, British Prime Minister Theresa May joked that \"opposites attract\" and called on the US President to renew the \"special relationship\" between Britain and the United States and lead in a new, changed world. In the United States for what will be Trump's first meeting with a foreign leader since he took office last week, May signaled a shift in foreign policy, bringing her position more in line with that of Trump.\n\nFollowing a disparaging statement from the French Finance Minister earlier in the day, in which Michel Sapin said that “Madame May can go see whoever she wants. I understand she goes to see the new U.S. president given the history between the U.S. and the U.K\" and added that \"she is not going there to negotiate,\" because allegedly \"neither she nor Mister Trump are in a position to negotiate\", May decided to prove him wrong, and urged the US and UK and their leaders to stand united and confront new challenges, including the rise of economies in Asia that people fear could \"eclipse the West,\" the threat of Islamic extremism and a resurgent Russia.\n\n\"So we - our two countries together - have a responsibility to lead. Because when others step up as we step back, it is bad for America, for Britain and the world,\" May told members of Republican Party at their retreat in a speech often punctuated by applause from an enthusiastic crowd.\n\n\"This cannot mean a return to the failed policies of the past. The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over. But nor can we afford to stand idly by.\"\n\nFollowing her speech, UKIP's Nigel Farage tweeted that \"I can hardly believe Mrs May's words about our place in the world and with America. I've wanted all of these things for years\" and added that the PM said \"things that I could only ever have dreamt that a British Prime Minister would say.\"\n\nI can hardly believe Mrs May's words about our place in the world and with America. I've wanted all of these things for years. — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) January 26, 2017\n\nSome of the key points touched upon by May in her speech as summarized by Axios:\n\nThe U.S. and U.K. are at the start of crafting a great trade agreement, but that the new deal must serve both national interests. (This can't happen until after Britain official leaves the EU.)\n\nU.S. and U.K. should stop intervening in other countries to try to \"remake the world in our image.\"\n\nOn working with Trump, she said, \"Haven't you ever noticed, sometimes opposites attract?\" She added she would challenge Trump on issues like torture.\n\nWhen it comes to Putin, May's advice was \"to engage, but beware.\"\n\nShe said \"there is nothing inevitable about conflict between Russia and the west,\" and that the countries should work to make \"cooperation more likely than conflict.\"\n\nShe is pushing for major reform of multinational organizations to better serve the nations that formed them. She added, \"The most important institution is and should always be the nationstate.\"\n\nNATO should be \"as equipped to fight cyber warfare\" as it is to fight conventional warfare.\n\nU.S. and U.K. should work together to fight the \"evil ideology\" of \"extremist Islamism\n\nOf note, as Reuters points out, is her break with the interventionism that launched wars in Iraq and Afghanistan underscores a change in global politics. It also fits with Trump's move to put \"America first\" and scores well with voters in Britain whose feeling of being left behind by globalization helped fuel Britain's vote to leave the EU last year that propelled May to power. Aware that Brexit will shape her legacy, May welcomed her early visit to the United States, a boost to her attempts to show that Britain can prosper outside the European Union despite criticism at home for cozying up to Trump.\n\nOn her U.S.-bound flight, May concentrated on similarities with the U.S. leader, who some reporters suggested had a style in stark contrast to her more cautious, restrained approach. \"Haven't you ever noticed ... sometimes opposites attract?\" she answered with a laugh\n\nThe biggest open issue, however, is trade, and the desire of both nations to eventually sign mutually beneficial bilateral contracts.\n\nEager to win favor - and a trade deal - with the new U.S. president to bolster her hand in the divorce talks with the European Union, May said both countries shared many values and that, contrary to his statements that NATO was \"obsolete,\" Trump had told her he was committed to the U.S.-led military alliance. May said she supported Trump's \"reform agenda\" to make NATO and the United Nations \"more relevant and purposeful than they are today,\" and \"many of the priorities your government has laid out for America's engagement with the world.\"\n\nBut there may be sticking points in Friday's talks - May said she condemned the use of torture and would stick to UK policy, suggesting Britain may not accept intelligence that could have come from such methods that Trump could reintroduce. \"We condemn torture and my view on that won't change – whether I'm talking to you or talking to the president,\" she said when asked what impact it would have if Trump brought back a CIA program for holding terrorism suspects in secret prisons.\n\nMay will have navigate the middle ground carefully, wary of being criticized as too pro-Trump or alternatively as too negative toward a future trading partner.\n\nBut the take home message is that any gain for the UK and US, is a loss for Europe, which would prefer to see the UK in a position of weakness, and May knows this well. She has threatened to walk away from the EU if she fails to get a good deal, and some critics say that could give other countries, like the United States, the upper hand in any talks.\n\nAnd the EU might not take kindly to any overly friendly overtures to a president some of the bloc's main leaders have voiced concern about. Some kind of trade agreement, though, is high on her list of priorities, despite Britain and the United States being at odds over genetically modified organisms, meat production and public procurement and May unable to sign deals until after Brexit.\n\nMay says she will launch the divorce talks by the end of March by triggering Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty, which gives up to two years to negotiate an exit deal. Only then can she agree with third countries. Both leaders should use the time to find areas where they could remove trade barriers, May said.\n\nWhat tomorrow will boil down to? \"We're both very clear that we want a trade deal.\"\n\nFor those who missed it, May's full Philly speech is below",
  "latent_17118": "As same sex marriage becomes the norm from sea to glittering sea (much to the chagrin of angry folks with their mouths stuffed full of deep fried poultry parts), gay couples are discovering all sorts of the hidden benefits of being legally allowed to get married. Like paying out the ass for a venue because proprietors of reception halls triple the price whenever anyone says the W word. Or like the relentless pestering from family and in-laws over when — or if — they're going to have children.\n\nThe New York Times, in another piece that makes the New York City intelligentsia's vision of America sound like a living realization of one of Rick Santorum's nightmares, discusses the relatively new phenomenon of newly married same-sex couples' relatives bugging them about when they're going to have some babies. Not only are relatives asking, but other gay couples have begun pressuring each other. From the Times,\n\nBut for Jeff Krehely, 35, who has been married for six years, there is no escaping the question in his social circles. His friends ask. His colleagues ask. His parents are so eager that they have taken to sending birthday cards to his two cats (they call them the \"grandkitties\"). On the Fourth of July, when Mr. Krehely and his husband sipped iced coffee with several other gay couples, he knew it was only a matter of time before the subject came up. Three of the five couples said they were seriously considering adopting. \"Everyone's asking: What's your timetable? What's your plan?\" said Mr. Krehely, a policy analyst, who is still weighing whether to take the plunge.\n\nWhile some gay couples are being pressured to adopt, in many parts of the US, there's a stigma against same-sex couples adopting. In Utah and Mississippi, it's illegal for same sex couples to adopt children. And in several other states, where gay marriage isn't legal, prospective parents need to jump through several legal hoops in order to have a child of their own.\n\nEven so, the tide is turning. Public opinion has shifted dramatically since the turn of the century, when only 38% of Americans thought that adoption should be legal for same sex couples. A survey conducted last month and released last week found that for the first time, the majority of Americans (52%) think that gay couples should be eligible to adopt kids.\n\nIt's great to see loving same sex couples who are finally free to build the families they never thought were possible — and join the Straights in being perpetually harangued over babies. Misery loves company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[NYT]",

  "latent_17261": "Corinthians lifted the World Club Cup after a typical 1-0 win.\n\nTite left out his number ten, Douglas, and instead selected Jorge Henrique to play a disciplined role on the right.\n\nRafael Benitez moved David Luiz to centre-back with Branislav Ivanovic going to right-back. Frank Lampard and Ramires started in the middle, and Victor Moses was chosen over than Oscar.\n\nChelsea had their chances – particularly late on – but overall Tite’s strategy was effective, particularly in a negative, spoiling sense.\n\nTempo\n\nOn the rare occasions European and South American club sides face each other in a competitive match, the pace of the match is always important. Corinthians may be one of the more ‘European’ sides their region has to offer, but a notable feature of this match was how they tried to slow the match down.\n\nChelsea had thrashed Monterrey in midweek because the Mexican side were simply unable to cope with a Premier League tempo – they had given Juan Mata (in particular) and the rest of Chelsea’s attackers too much time in midfield, and Benitez’s side simply battered them in a 10-minute spell of speed shortly after half-time.\n\nHere, it was clear Corinthians ‘won’ the battle of the tempo, turning it into a slow, patient match. There were two parts to their approach – with and without the ball. In possession, when there was no opportunity to counter-attack, they simply held onto the ball for long periods, and Chelsea moved back into a solid defensive shape, not pressing high up the pitch, and letting the likes of Paulinho and Ralf knock the ball around casually.\n\nHowever, Corinthians were also clever without the ball. They didn’t press Chelsea’s centre-backs constantly, but lone striker Paolo Guerrero occupied David Luiz to prevent him moving forward on the ball, and Gary Cahill was left free. His passing lacked incision and contributed to Chelsea’s slow passing, while in midfield Corinthians got into positions to press near the halfway line, preventing forward passes being played into Ramires and Frank Lampard.\n\nJuan Mata was sometimes left in too much space, and Corinthians weren’t particularly compact, but Chelsea lacked a mdifielder with space (or ball-playing ability to find him). As a result, their passing was unambitious and sideways, and they didn’t pick up the tempo until the final few minutes.\n\nFormations\n\nChelsea were in a straightforward 4-2-3-1, but Corinthians played an unusual modification of that system – although as explained here by Roberticus, it’s not unusual for them. On the right, Henrique stayed in position and offered Alessandro defensive support, which was crucial considering how dangerous Chelsea were down that flank against Monterrey. But on the other side, Corinthians were very fluid. Normally, in a 4-2-3-1 like this, you’d expect Emerson to drop back and be part of the second bank of four. But instead, he stayed high up in a position to counter-attack – often Guerrero’s closest support – and Danilo shuffled over to the left, despite nominally being a central midfielder.\n\nThat fluidity was why Benitez started Moses rather than Oscar – a natural winger to take advantage of one-versus-one situations against the left-back, and Corinthians’ fluidity down that side was another reason Chelsea needed to play quickly. If their transitions were swift, they’d be able to exploit Corinthians’ lack of defensive shape, but if they played slowly, Corinthians could get Danilo back into position. The Brazilian side committed a few tactical fouls when Chelsea looked set to launch counter-attacks, underlining how scared they were of this approach.\n\nAt other points, seemingly when Chelsea had long spells of possession, Danilo narrowed slightly and Emerson defended the left, with Corinthians becoming more 4-1-4-1, which made them look less vulnerable to Mata between the lines.\n\nAlthough Corinthians weren’t playing good attacking football – Emerson’s decision-making on the counter-attack was poor – they were successfully stifling Chelsea’s passing, and the number of long balls Chelsea played towards Fernando Torres was amazing. Lampard was generally the man to play those passes, and although a few were accurate and Torres’ first touch was often very good, it was incredible that Chelsea were so readily bypassing their attacking band of three, the playmakers Corinthians would have been most worried by.\n\nSecond half\n\nThe longer the game went on, the more it seemed Corinthians were successfully frustrating Chelsea. Their attacking play barely improved in terms of quality, but they were seeing more possession in good areas of the pitch, and eventually forced a scrappy goal.\n\nThe real question from the second half was why Benitez persisted with his starting XI for so long. The logic in starting Moses was sound, but if Chelsea were unable to get the ball to him (some odd, narrow runs from Moses hardly helped, and made his role in the side pointless), it clearly wasn’t working. It was amazing that Oscar – a player who could have lifted the tempo of the game, and prompted some fluidity and counter-attacking from Chelsea – was only introduced at 1-0.\n\nBenitez’s other two changes were also very late – Cesar Azpilicueta replaced Branislav Ivanovic to offer more thrust from right-back on 82 minutes, while Marko Marin replaced Hazard on 86 minutes. The changes were both (a) unadventurous and (b) very late, which makes Benitez’s decisions difficult to understand.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt may have been a negative, reactive performance from Tite’s side, but the approach unquestionably worked in favour of the South American champions. They had to ride their luck, and depended upon Chelsea missing a couple of decent opportunities, but the game was played at the tempo they wanted, and they prevented Chelsea’s attackers from having a significant influence on the game.\n\nDid they do enough with the ball? Probably not. This won’t go down as a great example of how to attack a stronger side, but it was a fine demonstration of defensive football through clever positioning and pressing.\n\nRelated articles on Zonal Marking:",
  "latent_17300": "As we all know, attendance has been an issue the last few years. I’d like to think that with the Sox trying to make major changes, the fans will support them by buying cheap ass tickets ($15 corners, $7 uppers for most games). But more than likely they won’t buy shit till we start winning again, much like last year when we started winning, future games started to sell. 100k tickets in a week. You know what to call that –\n\nSo here are 5 promotions that we’d like to see –\n\n1. BOGO (Buy One Get One) Tuesday. We used to have half price Monday for the tickets (they were overpriced at that time anyways) but people would lose their shit cause they thought they were getting a deal. Much like Kohls, they showed you that saved a bunch of money but you were still getting ripped off. I remember one Monday watching a girl, who was White Girl Wasted, fall down about 15 rows on the cement in 512. She got grabbed about 3 rows before the bottom, which might have hurt her more.\n\nSo anyways, let’s have a day where there is an item that is BOGO. Pizza, Pretzels, Nachos and our fave in the 108, BEER. Yes, I think there should be one day (a random Tuesday night in April) that they sell 2 beers for 1. You don’t have to announce it in advance, but rather do it when people get to the game. It should be a reward to everyone that is attending a vs. Twins game while it is 35 degrees out. Get Drunk On Us Night.\n\nSummary – On Tuesdays early in the year, one item will be BOGO. It can be any concession, but one night has to be beer.\n\n2. Free Food For Kids. If I had a dollar everytime someone used the “Food Prices” as a reason not to go to the game I would have enough money to pay off James Shields‘ contract. One, I am always shocked that people are shocked at the high prices. Two, you can bring literally ANYTHING food wise into the game. One game I saw a guy eating a carrot I am sure he stole from Mr. Ed. Three, I am REALLY REALLY shocked that people are shocked you can bring in anything. So let’s follow the masters of promotion, Denny’s, and give the kids FREE FOOD! It is a similar take on the Kohls example, if people think they are getting a deal, they will spend more. What’s a profit margin on $6 hot dog? Give away 2 to sell two. Plus, you can give away those hot dogs that they sell for $1 4th of July weekend. Those are tasty, especially the 6th one followed by your 8th Lite. You’ll sell more tickets, more people will come and you’ll sell more food. Easy peasy.\n\nSummary – Every weekday game, KIDS EAT FREE. Simple meal of a hot dog, chips and a small pop.\n\n3. Punch cards. For years and years, BeefLoaf has argued for a charge account that is connected to your seat so you can get loaded without having to have cash on you. He has also asked for pizza slices delivered to your seat. Neither is really ground breaking, or all that hard to make happen, but the Sox don’t seem to be interested. So give us a punch card! Any item over $5, you get a punch. For every $5 you spend, you get a punch. Once you hit $100, you get $25 in Comiskey Cash.\n\nSummary – Get a punch for every $5 you spend. Every $100 you spend, you get $25 in Comiskey Cash.\n\n4. Cat Day. We already have a very successful Bark At The Park! Day. Sells out (for dog space anyways) every year. Like Elvis night, I don’t try to understand it, but just get drunk at it and enjoy the extra people. So why don’t we have a Cat Day / Night? Cats are cleaner, don’t piss and shit all over the place and honestly fit the Sox fan demeanor a bit better. Cats don’t give a fuck, they use you for their purposes and only when they want to. Which to me describes a majority of Sox fans. BeefLoaf owns several cats and now a dog that looks like a cat. The guy loves pussy, that much is clear.\n\nSummary – Cat Night. Make it happen!\n\n5. Hang With An Alumni Player Night. Yes. Hell yes. Want to eat churros with Dan Pasqua? We can make that happen. Wanna have a hot dog eating contest with Ron Kittle? We can do that too. Just be careful cause Kitty can eat (and drink) like a madman. Create a contest, it can be on a weeknight too, for a guy to spend a game with an ex-player. They get a free meal, the fan get’s a once in a lifetime experience. I’d love listening to Carlos May‘s stories and thoughts on the young bloods coming up. Sounds like a win win for all involved.\n\nSummary – Alumni Date Night on the Sox!\n\n-MSS\n\nBig things are coming for the 108 in 2017. We have some t-shirts getting printed as I type this. Look for us at SoxFest and maybe you’ll get a “108 Exclusive” shirt. Follow us on FB here! We go live from time to time, mostly while drunk. We also have our Twitter that you can follow here!\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\nTumblr\n\nEmail",
  "latent_17332": "Check out a week full of exciting shark programming on Nat Geo Wild's SharkFest, starting July 23.\n\nThese sharks might be taking the expression “eating like a horse” a bit too literally.\n\nScientists have discovered that some sharks are eating a large amount of seagrass, as a significant part of their diet—but experts aren’t sure why the fish are deviating from their traditional carnivorous diet.\n\nNew research has shown that seagrass can make up more than 50 percent of a bonnethead shark’s diet. The small, shovel-headed sharks are closely related to the more familiar hammerheads.\n\nIt’s still possible that the sharks are just incidentally munching on seagrass as they feed on other prey, said Samantha Leigh, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Irvine and a National Geographic explorer.\n\n“Even if it is incidental, it is a very large amount of grass, so they have to be able to process that somehow,” said Leigh.\n\nLeigh conducted a nutrient content analysis that showed bonnetheads were digesting 56 percent of the organic matter in seagrass, similar to young sea turtles.\n\nBut in order to be considered true omnivores, an animal must obtain nutritional value or energy from the plants they eat. Without knowing why bonnetheads are eating seagrass, it’s hard to know if this habit is purposeful, said Leigh, who is studying the shark’s digestive behavior. (Read more about the behavior of the rare ghost shark.)\n\n“It’s very likely they have some sort of microbiome living in their gut that is producing some of the enzymes that they need to break down this plant material, which is something we commonly find in omnivorous and especially herbivorous species,” she said.\n\nHowever, younger bonnethead sharks have been found to have more seagrass in their stomachs than adult bonnetheads, which could point to a learning curve as the sharks mature and understand how to feed without simultaneously eating seagrass, said Dana Bethea, a research ecologist with NOAA Fisheries in Florida.\n\n“There’s a lot of prey handling learning that goes on in the younger life stages until they get to be bigger and really get their mouths around what they’re feeding,” she said.\n\nBethea’s research team hypothesized in her 2007 study that the seagrass found in the stomachs of bonnetheads is just a result of incidental prey capture. (Read about the peculiar diet of the Omura's whale.)\n\n“That’s how we think they get the plant material in their stomachs,” she said. “We don’t think they’re out there eating salad.”\n\nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists all species of the hammerhead shark as endangered, threatened or vulnerable, except for the bonnethead, which is listed as least concern. (See \"5 Winners and Losers on New \"Red List\" of World's Rarest Species.\")\n\nLeigh thinks it’s a “definite possibility” that this could be related to their unique diet, though Bethea isn’t sure.",
  "latent_17335": "Review article\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) are serious diseases that can lead to potentially fatal illness, disability and death. However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects associated with the MMR vaccine in children up to 15 years of age.\n\nSEARCH METHODS: For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Embase.com (July 2004 to May 2011).\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We used comparative prospective or retrospective trials assessing the effects of the MMR vaccine compared to placebo, do nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age.\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. One review author arbitrated in case of disagreement.\n\nMAIN RESULTS: We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case-control studies, five time-series trials, one case cross-over trial, two ecological studies, six self controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts.Effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated to be between 69% and 81% for the vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70% and 75% for the vaccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination with MMR containing the Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73% effective in preventing secondary mumps cases. Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory-confirmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one dose and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses. We did not identify any studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR in preventing rubella.The highest risk of association with aseptic meningitis was observed within the third week after immunisation with Urabe-containing MMR (risk ratio (RR) 14.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 7.93 to 25.71) and within the third (RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) or fifth (RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 to 24.2) weeks after immunisation with the vaccine prepared with the Leningrad-Zagreb strain. A significant risk of association with febrile seizures and MMR exposure during the two previous weeks (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15) was assessed in one large person-time cohort study involving 537,171 children aged between three months and five year of age. Increased risk of febrile seizure has also been observed in children aged between 12 to 23 months (relative incidence (RI) 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33) and children aged 12 to 35 months (RI 5.68; 95% CI 2.31 to 13.97) within six to 11 days after exposure to MMR vaccine. An increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR immunisation in children aged 12 to 23 months was assessed in one case-control study (RR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) and in one small self controlled case series (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 5.38; 95% CI 2.72 to 10.62). Increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR exposure was also assessed in one other case-control study involving 2311 children and adolescents between one month and 18 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was unlikely to be associated with autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections.\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with the MMR vaccine cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases.",

The SNP will still be, far and away, the biggest party. They will not reach the high-water mark of 2015 with 56 of Scotland’s 59 MPs but they will still be totally dominant.\n\n2. Labour will take an absolute battering all over the country. Even though they hope to have three MPs, it is entirely possible, if not probable, that they will fail to return a single Scottish Labour member to the Commons.\n\n3. The Tories will continue their resurgence and gain seats from the SNP.\n\n(Image: Daily Record/DWP)\n\nAnd while there are still almost six full weeks of campaigning to go and much to play for, the reason these things are likely to happen comes down to just one, mammoth, all-consuming national political obsession: the constitution.\n\nThe SNP want independence at all or any cost. The Scottish Tories want to remain in Britain at all or any cost.\n\nAnd while Scottish Labour are unwaveringly behind the Union, mixed messages from London Labour have sown the seeds of\n\ndoubt about the party’s commitment to Scotland’s place in the UK.\n\nThese doubts have spread like a virus amongst committed Labour unionists who are turning away from the bosom of a party they’ve supported all their life.\n\nNow they’re lending their support to the Tories, believing they offer the best chance of halting the SNP march to independence.\n\nWhile those former diehard Labour voters are fully entitled to protect their cherished place in Great Britain, voting to strengthen the Conservatives’ grip on power is a decision they may come to regret.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a Tory Government driven by right-wing ideology. Whatever it plans, it will not end well for the majority of working class Scots.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe Cabinet of Theresa May – the shameless Boris Johnson, Damien Green, Philip Hammond, David Davis, the Scot Liam Fox, et al – are no friends of Scotland.\n\nThis newspaper was no fan of David Cameron and George Osborne. But this current bunch demonstrate a nastiness of an entirely different magnitude. The repugnant rape clause is a stark warning about how vindictive this Government can be.\n\nIf they are emboldened by an increased majority at Westminster, be under no illusion, things will get worse. And it could get very, very much worse for Scotland.\n\nBy way of explanation, we need to wind the clock back to early 2016.\n\nIn January last year the Scottish Government were locked in bitter negotiations with the Treasury over a financial settlement required to fund the new powers coming to Holyrood because of The Vow.\n\nThese fiscal framework negotiations revolved around the Barnett Formula.\n\nThe Treasury team were desperate to cut billions from the Scottish budget. They have been itching to take money away from Holyrood for years and they saw this as a perfect opportunity.\n\nIf they got their way, the outcome would have been disastrous for Scotland.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThey did not get their way for one very good reason … David Cameron had signed The Vow on the front page of this newspaper.\n\nTo stiff Scotland out of billions of pounds would have left his questionable integrity shattered.\n\nSo he ordered the Treasury to roll over and agree to maintain Scotland’s funding for five years until a review in 2021. The Treasury was furious.\n\nWhen Scotland’s settlement comes up for renegotiation in a few short years time, there will be no David Cameron there to protect us, even if last time it was for purely personal reasons.\n\nNext time, the discussions will be led by Tory ideologues and a Treasury department hell-bent on revenge for not getting their way last time round.\n\nThe outcome could be catastrophic for the NHS, education, and everything else the Scottish Government pay for north of the Border.\n\nThat’s bad enough but here’s the real kick in the unmentionables for those Labour unionist diehards tempted to swing behind the Tories.\n\nThe Yes campaign lost in 2014 because they could not offer an economic argument that trumped Better Together’s pooling and sharing promise of staying in Britain.\n\nIf the Tories do win a bigger majority this time round and they do rip up Barnett and cut billions from our budgets, the economic arguments for staying in the Union are null and void.\n\nAnd that may be more than enough to swing a second referendum the way of Yes.\n\nThere is also little evidence that the Tories have ever been anything but disastrous for the Union.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIt was the Tories who propped up Alex Salmond at Holyrood from 2007 to 2011, giving the nationalists the springboard they needed to hold the first independence referendum.\n\nIt was the Tories who handed a major boost to Nicola Sturgeon’s 2015 general election campaign by cynically pitting England against Scotland by talking up a fantasy coalition between Labour and the SNP.\n\nAnd it was the Tories who caused the unholy Brexit mess that has put the prospect of a second indyref back on the table in such short order.\n\nElections are about choices but it’s not always as simple as a cross in the box. We know a lot of thought goes into the decision.\n\nWhen people voted for the Tories in the Scottish election last year, it was to clip the wings of the SNP Government at Holyrood.\n\nThrough the wisdom of crowds, the voters got exactly what they wanted – the SNP were denied a majority but remained the dominant force in Scottish politics.\n\nBut attempting to transfer that nuanced voting decision – and few electorates are more experienced or sophisticated than Scotland’s population – to a Westminster election scenario is wishful thinking.\n\n(Image: PA Wire)\n\nSure, more than half the voters are against independence and don’t want their votes to be interpreted as some kind of endorsement for Sturgeon’s political vision, as they were after the EU referendum.\n\nIt’s understandable that people would want to “send a message” to the SNP about having their votes hijacked for another purpose.\n\nThat is the reason Ruth Davidson’s Tories use that as their sly election message.\n\nBut if people vote Tory this time, it is for real. A Tory Government – a vicious Tory Government – is what they will get.\n\nThat will not be in their own interests or the interests of many of their friends and families.\n\nFor Labour voters thinking of lending votes to Tory candidates, there are other choices.\n\nThey may not be great choices but they are all better than voting Tory in 40 days.\n\nSo be careful what you wish for. You have been warned.",

Low intensity pulsed ultrasound for bone healing: systematic review of randomized controlled trials. BMJ 2017;356:j656 Review of all available randomised trials that assessed LIPUS versus sham device or no device that informed the recommendation made by the panel\n\nMAGICapp (www.magicapp.org) Expanded version of the results with multilayered recommendations, evidence summaries, and decision aids for use on all devices\n\nDoes low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) accelerate recovery in adults and children who have experienced bone fractures or osteotomy (cutting of a bone)? An expert panel rapidly produced these recommendations based on a linked systematic review triggered by a large multicentre randomised trial in adults with tibial fracture.\n\nFracture is common (see box 1). Bones can also be broken for medical reasons; osteotomy is a procedure whereby a bone is cut to shorten, lengthen, or to change its alignment. Following osteotomy, the bone has similar healing problems as traumatic fractures, and may require more extensive recovery.1\n\nBox 1: Background information Bone fracture More than one in three people have a fracture at some point in their life\n\nEach year around four per 100 people of all ages experience a fracture2\n\nSome 5-10% of these experience delayed healing or non-union of the fracture3 LIPUS Guidance 1994 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LIPUS for fracture healing and, in 2000, for treatment of established non-unions4 2010 UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued a statement supporting the use of LIPUS to reduce fracture healing time and to provide clinical benefit, particularly in circumstances of delayed healing and non-union5\n\nData on use A Canadian survey of 450 trauma surgeons in 2008 found that nearly half of respondents were using bone stimulators to manage tibial fractures. Of those, about half used electromagnetic field therapy and the other half used LIPUS6 Global revenues for bone stimulators were about US$400m 2004.7 In 2007, sales from LIPUS were around $250m in the US8 We found no data to describe whether use has changed over time\n\nIrrespective of age, location, and mechanism of the broken bone, whether it is managed with or without surgery, and whether it heals as expected or with delay, the idea of speeding or enhancing this healing to minimise symptoms and inconvenience for the patient is appealing. Bone stimulators such as LIPUS and electromagnetic field therapy might promote bone healing by stimulating bone growth (osteogenesis) in long or other bones.\n\nGuidance from independent organisations on use of LIPUS for bone healing is scarce, but data suggest the device is commonly used in clinical practice (box 1). Prices vary across countries, each device costing between US$1300 and $5000 (based on US and UK).\n\nThe TRUST randomised controlled trial published in The BMJ on 25 October 2016 found that the addition of LIPUS to standard care in 501 adult patients undergoing surgery for fresh tibial fracture did not improve functional recovery or accelerate radiographic healing at one year follow up compared with a sham device.9 The BMJ Rapid Recommendations team believed that the TRUST trial, if considered in a new systematic review and meta-analysis, could change practice. Previous systematic reviews had concluded that potential benefits of LIPUS on bone healing were highly uncertain, with calls for trials with safeguards against bias and a focus on outcomes important to patients.10 11 The linked publications in this package (see “Linked articles” box) synthesise the latest evidence and translate it for clinical care.\n\nHow the recommendation was created Our international guideline panel included orthopaedic and musculoskeletal trauma surgeons, physiotherapists, general internists, methodologists, and people with lived experience of bone fractures including one who used LIPUS (see appendix 1 on bmj.com for list of panel members). No person had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed according to BMJ Rapid Recommendations standards (see appendices 2 and 3 on bmj.com). We followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation.12 13 We discussed and agreed on the clinical outcomes of most importance to patients and clinicians a priori, and the systematic review authors focused their reporting on these. The outcomes chosen for LIPUS were: Functional recovery (such as time to return to work and time to full weight bearing)\n\nPain\n\nSubsequent operations\n\nComplications. The patient representatives judged radiographic healing as a less important outcome. It was included because many clinicians would consider radiographic healing to inform their management decisions. Some patients may feel reassured by observing radiographic healing, with increased confidence in resuming activities such as weight bearing and return to work. Before seeing the evidence, we agreed on what would constitute an important benefit from using LIPUS for these outcomes, and how patient values and preferences might vary between persons. Guided by patients on our panel, we agreed that most people want at least a possibly important benefit in functional recovery time or pain to make the time and expense of using LIPUS worthwhile. Reduced adherence with the device in the TRUST trial suggests that LIPUS can be burdensome to patients.9 We applied the GRADE system to critically appraise the evidence and move from evidence to recommendations (appendix 3).14 We considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of the procedure; the quality of evidence for each outcome; the typical and expected variation in patient values and preferences; resources; feasibility; and acceptability—details of our reasoning are summarised in the infographic and discussed further in the text.15 Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. We place a low value on speculative benefits of treatments. Thus, when available evidence suggests no benefit, or only very low quality evidence suggests benefit and moderate or high quality evidence shows appreciable adverse effects, burden, or cost, the panel would make a strong recommendation against an intervention.\n\nThe evidence Evidence requested from the panel to inform recommendations: A new rapid systematic review of the effects of LIPUS added to standard care for a variety of fractures and osteotomies16\n\nA systematic literature search on patients’ values and preferences, which did not identify any relevant studies (see appendix 4 on bmj.com). Systematic review of LIPUS for all fracture healing The data from the TRUST trial9 were included in a linked systematic review of randomised trials of LIPUS compared with sham device or no device on patient-important outcomes in patients with a fracture or osteotomy. Fig 1⇓ shows details about the trials and characteristics of included patients.16 Fig 1 Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of LIPUS We judged that the systematic review provides evidence of moderate to high certainty that LIPUS has little or no impact on time to return to work, time to full weight bearing, pain, the number of subsequent operations, or time to radiographic healing (see infographic). We were confident that there was little risk of adverse events from the device, based on nine trials that reported this outcome. For return to work, time to full weight bearing, and number of subsequent operations, our certainty in the evidence is moderate (rather than high) because of imprecise estimates of effect, where confidence intervals included potentially important benefit and harm (see forest plots (figs 2-7) in the linked systematic review).16 The observed heterogeneity in the effect sizes between trials for time to weight bearing, pain, and radiographic healing was explained by considering risk of bias: studies with serious methodological limitations due to lack of blinding (no use of sham device) suggested a benefit, whereas studies without such limitations did not (see subgroup analyses in the linked systematic review).16 For these outcomes, we therefore based our conclusions on the trials with low risk of bias. The estimates for typical (prognostic) outcomes for patients not treated with LIPUS were informed by the control arm of the TRUST trial, which enrolled patients with tibia fractures in the US and Canada and was at low risk of bias.\n\nUnderstanding the recommendation We unanimously agreed to issue a strong recommendation against LIPUS for patients with any bone fractures or osteotomy. We have moderate to high certainty of a lack of benefit for outcomes important to patients, and, combined with the high costs of treatment, LIPUS represents an inefficient use of limited healthcare resources. A particular challenge for the panel was to determine to what extent the most trustworthy evidence—coming from trials of patients with fresh tibial and clavicle fractures managed operatively—could be applied to adults with different types of fracture or osteotomies. Trials including patients with stress fractures, non-union, and osteotomies were either at high risk of bias or did not contribute sufficient outcome data to the systematic review. After extensive deliberations, the panel found no compelling anatomical or physiological reasons why LIPUS would probably be beneficial in these other patient populations. For example, if LIPUS on fresh fractures does not decrease the incidence of non-unions, it is unlikely to exert a beneficial effect in the conversion of non-unions into healed bones. Furthermore, osteotomies have the same biological response as for traumatic fractures. An additional challenge faced by the panel was that no trials included children. Paediatric fractures typically heal faster and have lower rates of non-union; thus, any potential benefit of LIPUS for children is likely to be even smaller than that for adults. The panel concluded that the evidence was applicable to all of these groups, and did not downgrade their certainty in the evidence.20 In response to peer review comments, the panel again considered the applicability to other fractures and populations, in particular non-union fractures. Reviewers pointed to differing healing methods in non-union, and the potential that smaller effect sizes could make a difference to patients. Non-union is the result of impaired bone health, as seen in smokers and diabetics,21 or due to mechanical reasons such as large bone defects. There was high quality evidence showing a lack of benefit in accelerating healing for fresh fractures, thus it is unlikely that LIPUS would improve outcomes in patients with non-union. Given the panel’s judgment of an implausible benefit of LIPUS for patients with non-union, the panel chose to make a strong recommendation against LIPUS also for these patients.\n\nPractical considerations Patients with fractures may experience pain and limited mobility, particularly in the first two to three months. Driving and physical activity are limited during the recovery period. Figure 2⇓ outlines the key practical issues for those considering LIPUS as an adjunct therapy in the management of bone fractures. Fig 2 Practical issues about use of LIPUS\n\nCosts and resources LIPUS does not represent an efficient use of health resources for individuals or health funders, given its lack of benefit on outcomes important to patients and its purchasing costs. Healthcare organisations that currently pay for LIPUS may reasonably choose to stop reimbursements based on best current evidence and our strong recommendation against LIPUS.\n\nFuture research It is unlikely that new trials will alter the evidence. Fracture research should focus on other interventions that have a greater probability to speed up healing, such as surgical application of adjuvant biomaterials or extracorporeal shock wave therapy.22 23 Further trials of treatments for non-union fractures would be better compared with operative stabilisation, with or without autologous bone grafts. Research should also address de-implementation strategies for the use of LIPUS for bone healing.24 How patients were involved in the creation of this article Four people with lived experience of bone fractures, one of whom had used LIPUS, were full panel members, participated in the teleconferences and email discussions, and met all authorship criteria. These panel members identified important outcomes and led the discussions about values and preferences. Return to work or regular activities and pain were weighed as of higher importance for patients than radiographic healing. The panel identified key practical issues including concerns with cost and access to LIPUS, as well as the burden of therapy. In light of the lack of efficacy, one patient panel member remarked, and the others agreed, that discussing LIPUS would unnecessarily take valuable time from the patient-clinician encounter, which is often already too short.\n\nFootnotes This BMJ Rapid Recommendations article is one of a series that provides clinicians with trustworthy recommendations for potentially practice changing evidence.

  "latent_17486": "If you spend any amount of time debating proponents of statism you’ll inevitably hear, “But who will build the roads?” Libertarians are often accused of being stupid, ignorant, and hypocritical since we want to radically shrink the size of government yet we apparently don’t realize that the government provides us with valuable services like roads. In a libertarian world, the meme goes, there would be no roads. We would all just be standing around scratching our heads trying to figure out how to get from point A to point B. How childish can libertarians be?\n\nIf you push back you’ll often find that people who hold this view have never stopped to consider whether there are better, more innovative and efficient ways to produce and maintain roads. It’s as if the fact that we’ve done it this way for so long is all the evidence we need to show there are no other ways to do it. One can imagine a world in which the government has monopolized shoe production for the last two hundred years. If you were to call for the elimination of the government shoe monopoly, rest assured someone would accuse you of wanting people to go barefoot.\n\nNow most libertarians respond to these people by pointing out that roads are no different than any other product and can and will be produced by profit seeking businessman in a free market. That’s certainly the correct answer, yet this doesn’t satisfy our opponents primarily because they suffer from an extreme lack of creativity and have a hard time wrapping their heads around the concept of private roads. They’ll usually say things like, “What are you going to do, put a toll booth at every intersection? Get real!”\n\nWhile my intuition tells me it wouldn’t be a profitable business model to put a toll booth at every intersection, there is something to be said about the need for a viable payment mechanism in the absence of taxation. Libertarians are usually not that forthcoming with proposals primarily because it’s next to impossible to predict the outcomes of the competitive process or exactly what innovations entrepreneurs will bring to market.\n\nDespite this, I’m going to put on my entrepreneur hat and offer up a proposal anyway. Before I do, however, I want to make the case against government roads which will strengthen the appeal of the solution I’m going to offer. Since this would be a really long post otherwise, I’m going to split it into two parts. In this part I’ll make the case against government roads and in Part 2 I’ll provide a proposal for how private roads could work.\n\nRoads Are Not Public Goods\n\nThe economics textbooks I used in both undergraduate and graduate school bizarrely categorized roads as public goods. But why is this? Surely they wouldn’t say that just because they’re provided by the government, right? The economic definition of a public good is one that is both non-rivalrous and non-excludable and thus subject to the free rider problem. I would hope it is obvious to everyone that roads are neither non-rivalrous nor non-excludable. There is a limit to how much traffic a road can handle, anything over that limit and you get traffic jams. Hence, roads are rivalrous. They are also excludable, just look at any toll road. If you don’t pay, they don’t let you on the road. Economically speaking, roads fit into the category of private goods — those that are most efficiently provided by the market. So what is the government doing in the road business to begin with?\n\nLocal Roads Are Not Natural Monopolies\n\nSome people like to claim that roads (primarily local roads and collectors) need to be provided by government since they are examples of a natural monopolies. It’s easy to think this way, after all there’s only one road in front of your house. Absent competition, the owner of the road would charge you a king’s ransom just to leave your property.\n\nTo the extent this would happen, it would not be due to the free market, but rather an improper allocation of rights. The relevant question is who was there first, the homeowner or the road owner? If the homeowner was there first, he should rightfully be granted an easement allowing him to leave his property and traverse the local roads and connectors to reach the paid arteries and highways that compete for his business. The owner of the local road would have to allow the homeowner go traverse the road for free (since charging would make him worse off) while retaining the right to charge outsiders and through traffic.\n\nIf the road was there first, with people building houses or businesses alongside it later, it would retain full discretion in its pricing. Even then, the road owner couldn’t charge the monopoly price since it will be in competition with other roads for business or housing development along the flanks.\n\nIt’s neglect of this type of analysis of property rights and easements that leads many to conclude that local roads are natural monopolies. In Part 2 we will take a deeper look at competition between arterials and highways.\n\nGovernment Roads Lack Innovation\n\nEvery sector of the economy touched by capitalism has seen enormous change for the better. When I was a kid, if you wanted to make a phone call, you would have to find the nearest pay phone and dial 1-800-COLLECT. Now you just pull a 1/4″ thick computer out of your pocket and video chat with someone. Went I went on road trips with my parents, we would literally purchase a map from AAA and highlight our route from New Jersey to Florida. Today you say, “Ok Google navigate to Disney World” and you are automatically directed to your location. Yet, when I think about it, roads are almost exactly the same as they were when I was a kid. I have to struggle to name a single innovation. In fact, the only real “innovations” the government has come up with have made our lives more miserable — red light cameras, seat belt laws etc.\n\nWhen services are provided privately, businessman compete to, you know, actually serve you. Those that find new and better ways of doing this are rewarded with greater profits. Most assuredly private roads companies would have found a more consumer friendly way of enforcing speed limits than by having armed police hiding in obscure locations waiting to pull you over and extort money from you. And surely private road companies would have a better incentive to find more efficient traffic patterns.\n\nTake a look at this mind blowing video from Auckland, NZ. A power outage knocked out the traffic light and look how much better traffic flows without the light! Not surprisingly, the government turned the light back on after power was restored.\n\nAgain, the government is so stuck in its ways that it would never come up with an innovation like this. My guess is there are tens of thousands of innovations just like this one that could be implemented all over the place, but never will be because of lack of incentive.\n\nThe problem is the government just does not regard us as its customers. It monopolizes the roads, does the bare minimum necessary to provide a minimally functional service, then demands we be thankful and pay our taxes — or go to prison. Next time you’re in the DMV ask yourself, who is serving whom?\n\nEdit: Based on feedback, I should probably clarify that I do not deny that government run enterprises can find improvements, such as a new type of asphalt. However, it is a core proposition in economics that competing for-profit businesses will have a greater incentive to innovate than a tax-funded monopoly. That really shouldn’t be controversial.\n\nThe Government Chronically Underinvests in Infrastructure\n\nNot only does the government provide us with terrible service, but it has practically run the infrastructure into the ground. The American Society of Civil Engineers has given the United States a D+ for the state of its infrastructure on its latest report card, noting that it is “poor” and “at risk”. It’s reported the amount of money that would be needed to address the problem is a staggering $3.6 trillion (obviously this number includes more than just roads, but the same arguments apply to all infrastructure). Now I’m not in a position to comment on the accuracy of that figure, but I’m going to assume it’s at least in the correct ballpark. The relevant question is, whose fault is this? The left loves to place the blame on conservatives for prioritizing “tax cuts for the rich” over infrastructure. But the reality of the situation is that the government has monopolized the infrastructure, prevented private businesses from competing in this sector of the economy, then has proceeded to run it into the ground. Nobody deserves any blame for this but the government and advocates of government provision of infrastructure.\n\nAfter all, what do you expect to happen when you channel funding through the political process? In the best case scenario, the funds for infrastructure spending will have to compete with funding for schools, entitlements, health care, etc. In practice it also competes with funding for war, the military industrial complex, pork barrel projects, political corruption, you name it. Does anyone really expect to get the correct amount of funding from such a defective process?\n\nOn the other hand, when have you ever heard of private industry underinvesting in whole sectors of the economy to the tune of trillions of dollars? Why don’t we see chronic underinvestment in textile manufacturing? The answer is because these funding levels are determined outside of the political process, by profit and loss, rather than political logrolling. Would the infrasture be in such terrible shape if it were provided by competing businesses? Not a chance.\n\nThe Government Suffers From Informational Problems\n\nHow does the government know the proper amount to invest in infrastructure? How does it know that resources should be allocated to widening a highway as opposed to say, building another school? How does it know that Park Avenue should be torn up and repaved as opposed to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway? The answer is — it doesn’t. What we want is for resources to be allocated to their most highly valued ends. The problem for the government is that value is subjective. It only exists in the human mind. The government doesn’t have any way of knowing if a repaved Park Avenue is more valuable than a repaved BQE. Sure it has various models it uses to determine when roads should be repaved due to wear and tear or the expected delays from construction, but none of that is rooted in value. The decisions may as well be purely arbitrary.\n\nIn the market, by contrast, people’s subjective preferences manifest themselves through profit and loss. Businesses use this data to make allocation decisions ensuring that resources are directed to people’s highest valued ends. The decision to repave Park Avenue or the BQE or to use the funds to build a new school, will be made based on which ever will create more value for society. The government, lacking the profit-loss mechanism, simply doesn’t have access to this data and will inevitably allocate resources to lower valued ends than would private businesses.\n\nThe informational problems don’t end with investment decisions either. They also extend to rules governing the roads. What is the proper way to determine what the speed limits should be? If you said: “collect data about traffic accidents and vehicle speeds and use complex statistical analysis to determine the safest maximum speed to drive”, you would be wrong. Again, what we care about is value. That is, satisfying the preferences of our customers — those who drive on the road. Maybe people would prefer to drive at 80 mph on a highway even though it means taking on extra risk of an accident. Maybe people would prefer to arrive at their destination slower if it means bearing less risk. The speed limits the government imposes are purely arbitrary. Completely divorced from consumer preferences. Given that we drive on the roads almost every day of our lives, my guess is that enormous value could be created simply by setting speed limits in accordance with people’s actual preferences. The same could be said of all the government’s other rules. All of which are equally arbitrary.\n\nTraffic Jams Are A Government Failure\n\nHow much of your day is spent sitting idly in traffic? In D.C., Los Angeles, and San Francisco commuters spend more than 60 hours a year stuck in traffic. That adds up to over a week of work time each year and we have road socialism to thank for it. While we indirectly pay taxes to finance the roads, they are essentially free for everyone to use as much as we want without any sort of rationing. Given that they can only hold so many vehicles at one time, it’s not surprising that traffic grinds to a screeching halt as everyone pours onto the roads during rush hour. There’s a term for this — Tragedy of the Commons. By failing to effectively ration roads (indeed by not rationing at all) the government is directly causing traffic jams and creating a major inconvenience in the lives of everyone. Not to mention all road rage and bird flipping.\n\nGoing back to the market economy, prices are used to ration scarce resources. When the demand for a product increases beyond what a business can supply, it raises its price. If demand fall below supply, it lowers its price. By this method we avoid the tragedy of the commons (at least in those areas not perverted by government). Scarce resources are effectively rationed ensuring that those who value them the most receive them.\n\nIf roads were provided by private businesses, I can guarantee they would employ congestion pricing. As demand rises during rush hour, the road companies would raise prices, incentivizing people to carpool, ride a bike, or take mass transit. Notice this is exactly what the left has been browbeating us to do for years. The only reason we don’t do it already is because of the government’s mismanagement of the roads, which they support.\n\nAdditionally, during the middle of the night, when demand is at its lowest, road companies would lower prices. A side effect of this would most likely be that most trucking would be done at night as businesses would pay less to ship products if truckers drive at night rather than during the day. This would mean that roads would primarily be available to passenger vehicles during the day.\n\nThe overall result of congestion pricing would be to smooth out traffic fluctuations and to permanently eliminate traffic jams and the associated pollution that goes along with them.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnlike other government blunders which we are often insulated from, we drive on the roads and experience the direct impact of this policy failure nearly every day of our lives. Most people just assume traffic jams, potholes, endless construction, speeding tickets and the DMV are just facts of life. They live their lives never considering the possibility that there is a better way and then mock and criticize those who don’t show appropriate reverence for the government road monopoly. Yet, when you sum it all up the amount that our daily lives would improve if the roads were privatized is truly staggering.\n\nThe only detail left to be worked out is the financing mechanism. In Part 2, I will give my solution to this problem and hopefully people will offer up their feedback and other possible alternatives.",

On the face of it. In Greece, what's been called the most left-wing European government since 1991 won not one but two general elections. New anticapitalist parties are owning respectable poll shares in France, Spain, Portugal, and Germany. In the UK, the Labour leadership was taken by Jeremy Corbyn, an Old Labour veteran on a mission to take the party back to its radical working-class roots. In the United States, there's been a surprising surge for the Bernie Sanders campaign, with hundreds of thousands of Americans eager to vote for a self-described democratic socialist. And while the left is losing ground in Venezuela and Argentina, there have been enough successes to show that where it puts the effort in, it really can win.\n\nExcept for left-wing politics, gaining power in elections isn't really the point; the point is to actually make things better. And things aren't getting better. Everything we hate is still very much around: the swamping inequality, the murderous wars, the general sense that we're all living in history's most complex torture device. For all its victories in local and national polls, the anti-austerity left hasn't been able to stop austerity; the internationalist left hasn't been able to stop imperialist adventures or to stop people drowning in the Mediterranean; the counter-hegemonic left hasn't been able to find any convincing narrative beyond the one bequeathed to it by the authoritarian right.\n\nIn general, the hard left tends to be a slow learner; that's why there are still thousands of people who think selling newspapers on university campuses is a productive revolutionary activity. But if we were to try to pick up a few big lessons from what happened in 2015, these might be a good start.\n\nRESPECTABILITY DOESN'T HELP ANYONE\n\nPhoto via Wiki\n\nNear the beginning of the year, the left learned an exciting new word: \"Pasokification.\" Named for Pasok, the Greek socialist party, previously part of the pro-austerity governing coalition, it referred to the process by which an old, boring, staid centre-left establishment would be suddenly hollowed out by a new and insurgent group like Syriza. But something strange happened to Syriza as it rose to take power: It began to exhibit what could be called a second stage of Pasokification, in which it started to horribly morph into its predecessor. Some of this might have had something to do with the fact that many of the young and daring Syriza politicians were in fact exactly the same people as the old guard they'd displaced, canny Pasok operatives jumping from one sinking ship directly into another.\n\nIn January of this year, Syriza stormed to victory on a radical anti-austerity platform, while Pasok was reduced from the 160 seats it held in 2012 to 13, making it the joint-smallest party in Parliament. In September, Syriza renewed its mandate by promising harsh cuts but financial stability, a steady and responsible management of the economy that would limit the country's debt at the small price of any hope for the future. When the old coalition was in power, they were kept from capitulating entirely to Greece's creditors by the strong pressure from the Left; with the radical Left in charge, there was little to stop the banks getting everything they wanted. In its bid to be seen as a respectable party of government, Syriza became, well, just as bad as all the other respectable parties of government. There are already signs of a similar process taking place elsewhere: In Spain, for instance, the new leftist Podemos party spent most of 2015 inching steadily rightwards, scrapping its demands for universal basic income and a \"citizens audit\" of public debt, and replacing them with vague liberal platitudes. Instead of filling voters with new confidence, these capitulations have instead had them abandoning the party in droves. This desperation to seem responsible is an affliction common to new parties; in the end, it makes them entirely useless.\n\nMAINSTREAM PARTIES CAN'T HELP US EITHER\n\nPhoto by saulalbert\n\nDespite the fears of a habitually jittery establishment, the pattern of Pasokification hasn't really repeated itself in the English-speaking countries: While the center-left is still in freefall, there's nothing from the outside rising to take its place. Instead, leftists have attempted to work within established parties: Jeremy Corbyn taking a landslide victory in the Labour leadership race; Bernie Sanders fighting a private insurgency within the Democrats. After all, if left parties can be comprehensively shifted rightwards, why can't the reverse happen too? But as Corbyn's experience shows, this doesn't really work. There's too much money at stake, and a core culture that can't be changed: Whoever has the leadership, we won't build socialism by voting in some Labour MP who looks like they should be working at Foxtons.\n\nCorbyn claimed to simply be embodying the Labour party's core values, but on those points where he really does differ from Labour tradition, the party's opposition has been vicious. The most damaging internal rifts have been on Trident and Syria: these are points of principle. The Labour party has always been bloodthirsty—it's a party of war; long before Iraq and Afghanistan its MPs scrapped their proletarian internationalism to cheerlead for World War One, later Labour governments were happy to brutally repress decolonial struggles on the fringes of Empire. Labour has an ingrained culture of dropping bombs on people from a great height; on this front, it won't budge an inch. Meanwhile in America, Sanders is trying to smooth over this problem by trying to out-warmonger the warmongers, making a big show of his support for the US air war in the Balkans and angrily denying any suggestion that he's a pacifist. It's an uphill struggle: Hillary Clinton has the total destruction of Libya to brag about; all he has are a few votes for military action.\n\nBEING ANTI-AUSTERITY ISN'T ENOUGH\n\nEvery so often, there's a big anti-austerity protest in the center of London. \"Not one cut,\" they chant, marching through a socially-engineered hellscape full of empty houses made of money and rough sleepers hiding behind the bins. 'Not one cut,' they chant, stumbling blindly, like someone whose blood is steadily draining out through thousands of lacerations. It's too late; the cuts have happened. Anti-austerity parties have taken control of national governments, but austerity carries on. This might have something to do with the blank negationism of the movement—opposing austerity has come to function as a substitute for actually doing anything about it. Opposing austerity has become like opposing the sunset: You do it at the end of the day, as the light grows dimmer; nothing changes but it makes you feel better about yourself.\n\nLabour were nominally anti-austerity: They opposed the Tory cuts, they were passionately against them, but they voted for them anyway. Syriza were anti-austerity: They opposed the total wreckage of Greek society even as they carried it out. With the financial bodies that govern the world utterly committed to our current path directly into the abyss, the idea that a government could end austerity and balance out the wealth a bit, while keeping everything else fundamentally the same, isn't reasonable, it's deluded. A return to nice postwar social democracy would be far harder to achieve than the total revolutionary reconstruction of the state. If we're serious about making a better world, the last year should teach us to be not against austerity, but for communism.\n\nFollow Sam on Twitter.",
  "latent_17691": "Team Vitality has made itself known in the realm of console esports, and especially Call of Duty, since 2013. At the end of 2015, they bought a spot in the EU LCS, the European League of Legends elite. Esports Observer reached out to Nicolas Maurer, the team’s owner, to talk about his daily life, struggles, and future plans.\n\nHi Nicolas! Thanks for giving us the opportunity to speak with you. To start things off, can you explain how you got into owning an esports team?\n\nBefore starting the Vitality project, I used to work as a video editor for French TV. Back then, I met Fabien “Neo” Devide. At that time, he was the manager of Corentin “Gotaga” Houssein and Kevin “BroKeN” Georges (French Call of Duty players for team aAa). So he started to talk about this job and esports in general. I listened interestedly, but nothing more.\n\nBut then, he brought me to a LAN. I then realized how big of a passion esports can be. I couldn’t believe my eyes. At work, he was just a co-worker—but at LANs, he was jumped on by fans asking for photos and autographs.\n\nAs time went by, he told me that he want to create his own team. What bothered him was that most teams would use the popularity of their players in their own interest instead of the interest of the players. He wanted a team that would change that. Wanting to be a part of esports, I joined him.\n\nWe started by building around Gotaga, who by then had established himself as one of the best and the most famous French player. We managed to secure more players, and the first sponsors joined. Then, we decided to get into League of Legends. Ever since we got involved in LoL, we entered a whole new dimension, especially concerning the media coverage and interview requests.\n\nAs for today, Fabien and myself are dealing with the day-to-day struggles of managing a team. We are still a startup with no employees, but we plan on growing bigger with time.\n\nWhy don’t you have employees?\n\nBoth Fabien and myself started to pay ourselves only recently. We just couldn’t afford it before. It is very hard to earn money as a team at the moment. Team owners are mostly driven by passion. There are indeed a few teams that manage to earn money like Fnatic, but they are the exception.\n\nThe economy revolves around the talent of the players. Except for a few greedy team owners, most of the money goes to players, just like in sports. Players are the ones bringing the money, so they are the ones benefitting from it. Which is completely normal.\n\nWhat is the difference between managing a console team and a computer team?\n\nPC esports has been around for a longer time. The community is more professional and serious. Console esports is much more messy. It is less organized. But player issues remain the same. You have to take care of players so that they can focus solely on playing. They are young and don’t want to worry about things like sponsoring and administration. So owning a team often looks like babysitting.\n\nThe main problem for consoles is that game developers are less interested in their esports scene. Most of them don’t understand esports. Now that they hear everywhere how much money there is to make, they’re starting to get involved. But they often end up doing everything wrong.\n\nThough, that isn’t true for all of them, RainbowSix has a great approach for example, but developers like EA took a lot of time to understand what needs to be done. EA could have done so many great things, but they decided to go for rentability of the FIFA Ultimate Team instead. I think they are finally coming around, but it will take time for them to catch up.\n\nHow does the daily life of a team owner look like?\n\nI don’t know if my daily life is anywhere close to the one of other teams’. In my case, especially after we entered the LCS, it’s all about troubleshooting: take calls, connect people, speak to sponsors, answer quadrillions of mails and journalist requests. We would like to recruit so we can take a step back to think about the future, but we can’t afford it yet.\n\nThe player salaries in League of Legends are very high. It takes a huge chunk of the investment.\n\nThere has been a call for transparency about salaries, would you share this kind of information?\n\nIt is complicated. Most teams don’t do it for a good reason: giving your budget numbers would mean to give away crucial informations to your competitors, which isn’t something businesses should do. Of course some teams do, but I believe this is mostly for marketing purposes.\n\nI believe we reached a turning point in professional League of Legends. It is probably the last year an independent team can enter the LCS, as the price tag for the spots is growing immensely. In the future, only big organizations with a well-funded infrastructure or with investors behind them will be able to claim a spot. We’ll be left with long-established teams that managed to stay at the top, thanks to a dedicated fanbase and sponsoring, and big teams with cash-rich investors like Rick Fox and Marc Cuban being the remaining ones.\n\nIt is known that some LCS teams are trying to sell their spot. But an organization willing to buy will need to invest heavily.\n\nWhile we are touching the topic right now: how important are investors?\n\nTo survive, you need supportive partners. Sponsors are a must. The majority of the money at Vitality comes from sponsoring. Another important source of revenue can be merchandising, but we still have to work on that. In Europe, only Fnatic really manages to earn big money from merchandising. Its importance is going to increase in the future though. Just like in any sport, merchandising, ticketing and TV rights will be a big part of the esports’ economy. For now, it is mostly sponsors, but we’ll get there.\n\nRelying so heavily on sponsors makes teams very vulnerable to economic crises. Are esports teams prepared enough?\n\nIt is even more true since contracts in esports are very short term. There is a much higher volatility than in most other markets. From one day to another, a very big team can crash down. It is particularly worrying with salaries growing exponentially. If there is a crisis tomorrow and sponsors withdraw, many teams will be in trouble. So we are all looking for ways to depend less on sponsors.\n\nChanging gears: why is the importance of media requests so much higher in League of Legends?\n\nThe difference is obvious. We were almost never solicited by media before. Now we receive requests constantly. We’ve started having more mainstream media interest as well. To give you an example, Canal+ (one of the main French TV channels) is going to follow us in Berlin next week. The LCS grew our visibility a thousand times. And that’s exactly what we came for.\n\nI really like that mainstream media is taking interest. I want esports to get out in the open. When talking about esports, most people are still unsettled or haven’t heard about it at all.\n\nWe talked about the need for a pro-gamer status in France last week. What status are you using for your players? And what do you expect from the government?\n\nAll our players were self-employed, but we are changing that. Our goal is to have all players under salaried contracts. It isn’t always possible yet, because there is no suitable legal status. The “self-employed” status isn’t ideal, but there is no better juridical solution most of the time.\n\nI’m really curious to see what the government will do. I’m very attentive on the subject because I’ve already seen how a government can destroy an ecosystem when they ruled poker. At that time, the ruling authorities didn’t care for poker at all and killed it. This time, the senators seem to really look into things with interest. They interviewed everyone and show a desire to do well. But as to what will come out, I have no idea.\n\nIs there anything you would like to add?\n\nI would like to thank our partners Red Bull and SteelSeries! It may look like a phrase, but without them we couldn’t have done it.",
  "latent_17848": "Scientists from Oxford University have made a significant step towards an ultrafast quantum computer by successfully generating 10 billion bits of quantum entanglement in silicon for the first time -- entanglement is the key ingredient that promises to make quantum computers far more powerful than conventional computing devices.\n\nThe researchers used high magnetic fields and low temperatures to produce entanglement between the electron and the nucleus of an atom of phosphorus embedded in a highly purified silicon crystal. The electron and the nucleus behave as a tiny magnet, or 'spin', each of which can represent a bit of quantum information. Suitably controlled, these spins can interact with each other to be coaxed into an entangled state -- the most basic state that cannot be mimicked by a conventional computer.\n\nAn international team from the UK, Japan, Canada and Germany, report their achievement in the journal Nature.\n\n'The key to generating entanglement was to first align all the spins by using high magnetic fields and low temperatures,' said Stephanie Simmons of Oxford University's Department of Materials, first author of the report. 'Once this has been achieved, the spins can be made to interact with each other using carefully timed microwave and radiofrequency pulses in order to create the entanglement, and then prove that it has been made.'\n\nThe work has important implications for integration with existing technology as it uses dopant atoms in silicon, the foundation of the modern computer chip. The procedure was applied in parallel to a vast number of phosphorus atoms.\n\n'Creating 10 billion entangled pairs in silicon with high fidelity is an important step forward for us,' said co-author Dr John Morton of Oxford University's Department of Materials who led the team. 'We now need to deal with the challenge of coupling these pairs together to build a scalable quantum computer in silicon.'\n\nIn recent years quantum entanglement has been recognised as a key ingredient in building new technologies that harness quantum properties. Famously described by Einstein as \"spooky action at distance\" -- when two objects are entangled it is impossible to describe one without also describing the other and the measurement of one object will reveal information about the other object even if they are separated by thousands of miles.\n\nCreating true entanglement involves crossing the barrier between the ordinary uncertainty encountered in our everyday lives and the strange uncertainties of the quantum world. For example, flipping a coin there is a 50% chance that it comes up heads and 50% tails, but we would never imagine the coin could land with both heads and tails facing upwards simultaneously: a quantum object such as the electron spin can do just that.\n\nDr Morton said: 'At high temperatures there is simply a 50/50 mixture of spins pointing in different directions but, under the right conditions, all the spins can be made to point in two opposing directions at the same time. Achieving this was critical to the generation of spin entanglement.'",
  "latent_18024": "By Jake Donovan\n\nSaturday’s middleweight championship showdown between Miguel Cotto and Daniel Geale is no longer a weighty issue. Both combatants came within the contracted 157 lb. catchweight in place for their headliner at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nCotto tipped the scales at a lean and ready 153.6 lbs. Geale brought about a collective sigh of relief after weighing in right at the catchweight limit of 157 lbs., his lightest weight in more than eight years.\n\nThere was weeklong concern over whether or not Geale (31-3, 16KOs) could come within the contracted weight agreement. Eyebrows were raised when he tipped the scales at 167.5 lbs. during the World Boxing Council (WBC)-mandated 7-day pre-fight safety check (Cotto holds the WBC belt in addition to his recognition as the World lineal middleweight king).\n\nGeale and promoter Gary Shaw have also expressed their displeasure over having to agree to the catchweight. Cynics note that they could have said no, but such a stance would have resulted in missing out on the sizeable payday that comes with fighting Cotto.\n\nWith the scale drama now behind him, the 34-year old Aussie can move towards becoming a three-time middleweight titlist.

  "latent_18132": "Inside Einstein's Mind\n\nPBS Airdate: November 25, 2015\n\nNARRATOR: It's a mysterious force that shapes our universe. It feels familiar, but it's far stranger than anyone ever imagined. And yet, one man's brilliant mind tamed it: gravity. Using simple thought experiments, Albert Einstein made an astonishing discovery: time and space are shaped by matter.\n\nCLIFFORD JOHNSON (University of Southern California): You get rid of this force of gravity, and, instead, we have curvature of space-time.\n\nJANNA LEVIN (Columbia University): Right now, the space around me is being squeezed and stretched.\n\nNARRATOR: He called it the \"General Theory of Relativity.\" How did one person, working almost entirely alone, change everything we thought we knew about the universe?\n\nDAVID KAISER (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Einstein is toiling as the world seems to fall apart.\n\nROBBERT DIJKGRAAF (Institute for Advanced Study): He was able, with pure thought, to solve the riddle of the Universe.\n\nNARRATOR: Inside Einstein's Mind, right now, on NOVA.\n\nGravity: the most familiar yet most mysterious of nature's forces. One hundred years ago, Albert Einstein made a mind-blowing discovery: what we feel as gravity is, in fact, the push and pull of space and time, itself. He called his idea \"general relativity.\" It is perhaps the most remarkable feat of thinking about nature to come from a single mind.\n\nCLIFFORD JOHNSON: General relativity is undoubtedly one of the greatest scientific theories ever conceived. It's a theory of space, time and gravity.\n\nJANNA LEVIN: One mathematical sentence, and from it, you can derive the understanding of the entire universe on the largest scale, and that is beautiful.\n\nNARRATOR: Only now, a century after it was first proposed, do we have the technology to explore the extremes of Einstein's great theory: supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies, waves of gravity that distort space and time, the evolution of our entire universe.\n\nHow did a concept that explains so much come from the mind of one man?\n\nJOHN NORTON (University of Pittsburgh): Einstein had a magical talent. He could take a hard physical problem and boil it down to a powerful visual image, a thought experiment.\n\nSEAN CARROLL (California Institute of Technology): Suddenly, he realizes this is how the world works; all this abstract nonsense is the correct theory of reality.\n\nNARRATOR: To gain an insight into Einstein's mind and the true wonder of general relativity, we need to trace the crucial thought experiments that led to his great breakthrough. The seeds for his ideas were planted when he was just a child.\n\nEinstein grew up in a small house in Munich, in Southern Germany. His unique personality was evident early on.\n\nWALTER ISAACSON (Biographer): Like many great innovators, Einstein was a rebel, a loner, but deeply curious. He was slow in learning to speak as a child, so slow that his parents consulted a doctor, but he later said that that's maybe why he thought in visual thought experiments. His sister remembers him building little card towers, using playing cards. He was a daydreamer, but he was deeply persistent.\n\nNARRATOR: Einstein's father, Hermann, manufactured electrical equipment. He nurtured his son's interest in science. On one occasion he brought him a compass.\n\nWALTER ISAACSON: Now, you and I maybe remember getting a compass when we were kids, and we're like, \"Oh, look, the needle twitches and points north.\" But, you know, then we're on to something else, like, \"Oh, look, there's a dead squirrel.\" But for Einstein, after getting that compass, he developed a lifelong devotion to understanding how things can be forced to move even though nothing's touching them.\n\nNARRATOR: The young Einstein became gripped by a desire to understand the underlying laws of nature. He developed a unique way of thinking about the physical world, inspired by his favorite book.\n\nWALTER ISAACSON: The book Einstein loved told little stories, like what'd be like to travel through space or go through an electrical wire, and it made Einstein think visually.\n\nNARRATOR: These imagined situations that we often call \"thought experiments,\" became a defining feature of Einstein's thinking.\n\nDAVID KAISER: One of the critical thought experiments that Einstein began to play with, very young, around the age of 16, was trying to imagine what would happen if he could catch up with a light wave. It's one thing to see, to imagine a light wave zooming past him, at some seemingly impossible speed, but what if he could somehow just propel himself, really quickly. What would it look like if he could catch up with that light wave? What would he see?\n\nWALTER ISAACSON: He said it caused him to walk around in such anxiety his palms would sweat. Now, you and I may remember what was causing our palms to sweat at age 16, and it was not a light beam. But that's why he's Einstein.\n\nNARRATOR: This dream-like thought about the nature of light was Einstein's first step on the path to his great theory. It stayed with him, throughout his time at school and college.\n\nDAVID KAISER: He was extremely gifted in science and math, as a young person, and very bad at other classes, mostly cause he kept cutting class and being very rude to his teachers. Many teachers from when...his high school days on, were convinced he'd never amount to anything. He was a discipline problem, and he was bad news.\n\nWALTER ISAACSON: He applies to the second best university in Zurich, the Zurich Polytech, and gets rejected,—I'd love to meet the Admissions Director who rejected Albert Einstein—but eventually he gets in. And he does moderately well, but not good enough to get a teaching fellowship. And so he ends up at the Bern Swiss Patent Office, as a third class examiner.\n\nNARRATOR: Undaunted by his university results, Einstein started work at the patent office in 1902, aged 23. Here, his job was to assess the originality of new devices.\n\nDAVID KAISER: He was immersed in the kinds of, of, sort of, technical details that he'd been fascinated by as a very young kid. And here he was, sitting in the kind of wave of, of, of the modern age. This was the era of electrification, so all the latest clever ideas for switching technology, for coordinating clocks, in particular, those were all passing through his office.\n\nNARRATOR: Time zones had recently been introduced in central Europe, and accurately synchronizing clocks was a major challenge of the day. Switzerland was a world leader in time technology. Dozens of patents to link clocks passed through Einstein's office.\n\nWALTER ISAACSON: He could whip through these patent applications, and then, out of his drawer, he'd pull his physics notes. And his boss was very indulgent and would, sort of, turn a blind eye, as Einstein was doing his theories in his spare time.\n\nSIMON SCHAFFER (University of Cambridge): It's really important to remember that theoretical physics was new when Einstein was a young man. You could do quite a lot of this work by reading a relatively small number of science journals and making the calculations yourself.\n\nEinstein's world, in 1905, was dominated by two kinds of physics. One was about 200 years old, and it was founded by Isaac Newton, a British natural philosopher. For Newton, all there is in the world is matter, moving.\n\nNARRATOR: Newton showed that the motion of falling apples and orbiting planets are governed by the same force: gravity. His equations are so effective, we still use them today to send probes to the farthest reaches of the solar system.\n\nThe other important theory of Einstein's day covered electricity and magnetism. That branch of physics had been revolutionized, in 1865, by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell. Maxwell's theory describes light as an electromagnetic wave that travels at a fixed speed. In Newton's world, the speed of light is not fixed.\n\nSIMON SCHAFFER: Einstein can see that there's a contradiction between Newton and Maxwell. They just don't fit together. And one of the things Einstein hated, hated was contradiction. If there's one kind of physics that says this and another kind of physics that says that and they're different, that's a sign that something's gone wrong, and it needs fixing.\n\nNARRATOR: For months, Einstein wrestles with the problem. Eventually, to resolve this contradiction, he focuses on a key element of speed: time.\n\nWALTER ISAACSON: He realized that any statement about time is simply a question about what is simultaneous. For example, if you say the train arrives at seven, that simply means that it gets to the platform simultaneous with the clock going to seven.\n\nNARRATOR: In a brilliant thought experiment, he questions what \"simultaneous\" actually means and sees that the flow of time is different for an observer that is moving, versus one that's standing still.\n\nHe imagines a man standing on railway platform. Two bolts of lightning strike on either side of him. The man is standing exactly halfway between them, and the light from each strike reaches his eyes at exactly the same moment. For him the two strikes are simultaneous. Then Einstein imagines a woman on a fast moving train. Travelling at close to the speed of light, what would she see?\n\nAs the light travels out from the strikes, the train is moving towards one and away from the other. Light from the front strike reaches her eyes first. For the woman on the train, time elapses between the two strikes; for the man on the platform, there is no time between the strikes.\n\nThis simple thought has mind-blowing significance. Simultaneity, and the flow of time itself, depends on how you're moving.\n\nSEAN CARROLL: If there's no such thing as simultaneity, then there's no such thing as absolute time everywhere, throughout the universe, and Isaac Newton was wrong.\n\nNARRATOR: This concept, that time, and space, as well, are relative, became known as \"special relativity.\" It led to remarkable results, such as the famous equation relating energy to mass.\n\nDAVID KAISER: So, Einstein published this article in 1905, to exactly no acclaim. Most people ignored it. This was not setting the world on fire. Two years go by before a very eminent physicist, Johannes Stark, invites Einstein to write a review article on Einstein's own work, precisely because no one was paying attention. He begins thinking about ways to generalize and to push his own results from 1905. What if he considers not only a train moving at a fixed speed past the platform, what if that train begins to speed up or slow down? What if there's acceleration?\n\nNARRATOR: Adding acceleration to the equations was his first task. Then, there was that mysterious Newtonian force of gravity to contend with.\n\nIn Newton's theory, gravity is a force that acts instantaneously, but special relativity says that's impossible; nothing can travel faster than light.\n\nELEANOR KNOX (King's College London): What Newton's theory tells you is that, suppose the sun were to disappear, the orbit of the earth should change \"at that very moment.\" But the notion of \"at that very moment\" in two different places is exactly one of these notions that special relativity has told you isn't a good physics notion. So, you've now got this challenge of trying to work out how to take the success of Newton's theory of gravity but fit into this new special relativistic picture.\n\nNARRATOR: It was only when Einstein began to understand the link between gravity and acceleration that things began to fall into place.\n\nROBBERT DIJKGRAAF: We all know that when we are accelerated—and, of course, now we have cars and airplanes to give us the physical feeling—if you're in an airplane, and it's taking off, you're pushed back in your chair, actually a kind of force pushing you back, which feels very similar to the force of gravity. But you need the brilliance of Einstein to explain why they are related.\n\nNARRATOR: Suddenly he hits upon what he describes as \"the happiest thought\" of his life. If gravity and acceleration feel the same, perhaps they are the same. Again, he examines the idea in a beautiful thought experiment.\n\nHe imagines a man in a box, floating weightlessly in a distant region of space, in zero gravity. Suddenly, the man stops floating and accelerates downward until he's standing in the box. What has happened? Either the box is now close to a planet, and the force of gravity has pulled the man to the floor, or someone has attached a rope and the box is now being pulled continuously and accelerated upwards. So which is it, gravity or acceleration?\n\nWithout being able to see outside, the man can't tell what's causing his fall to the floor.\n\nSEAN CARROLL: Einstein realized there is no way to tell the difference between sitting in a gravitational field and being accelerated. They're equivalent situations.\n\nCLIFFORD JOHNSON: The fact that these two effects are the same, give the same result, means that gravity is acceleration, not just like acceleration; it's the same thing.\n\nNARRATOR: It's a big breakthrough. Einstein's theory of special relativity worked for motion at a constant speed. By extending his ideas to acceleration he could begin to formulate a new theory of gravity.\n\nBy 1912, Einstein is living in Zurich with his wife Mileva and two young sons Hans and Eduard. The academic world had realized the importance of special relativity and his career had taken off. He's now a professor at the esteemed Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, but spends as much time as possible working on his theory.\n\nHe needs mathematics that describes how objects move in space and time and soon realizes that the best tool for the job is a strange but powerful concept called \"space-time.\"\n\nJANNA LEVIN: If I think of space, I know that I can find anything, if I know where it is North-South, East-West and up-down, three points. But that doesn't mean I can find it, because I also have to know where it is in time. And so, if we start to think, to know everything about an event in the universe, I have to know, not just its spatial coordinates, but also its time coordinate. I can begin to think about where it is in space-time.\n\nNARRATOR: Imagine a camera filming an action, capturing each moment in time as a single frame.\n\nROBBERT DIJKGRAAF: Einstein basically tells us, think of a movie reel: we have all these little pictures. Now, cut them apart, one by one, and stack them on top of each other. You get this pile. And if you go up in the pile, you go up in time. And now, kind of glue them all together into one big block, and that block has both space and time, and that's the space-time continuum.\n\nIt's almost looking at a movie, not frame by frame, but seeing the whole movie at once. There would now be kind of, two strands going up in space and time, and they would be, kind of, spaghetti strands. In fact, we all are spaghetti strands moving in this space-time.\n\nNARRATOR: Einstein feels that space-time is the natural arena in which his theory of relativity should play out, but now he needs sophisticated mathematics.\n\nSEAN CARROLL: By your standard or mine, Einstein was good at math. He was Einstein. But he was not really a mathematician, per se. He didn't prove theorems; he didn't pore over math books. He was a physicist. He did thought experiments. He thought of very tangible concrete situations and what would happen. So, when it came time for him to really bear down to the absolute cutting edge mathematics of his day, he required help.\n\nNARRATOR: At university, Einstein had skipped the geometry classes, letting his friend Marcel Grossman take notes for him. Grossman had excelled in geometry and was now chairman of the math department. He suggests Einstein uses advanced mathematics, in which the shape of space and time could be curved.\n\nSEAN CARROLL: Because space-time has a geometry, he thinks to himself, well, maybe it's the actual shape of space-time itself that is giving rise to gravity.\n\nNARRATOR: After months of work, Einstein has an extraordinary idea: what if space-time is shaped by matter, and that's what we feel as gravity?\n\nCLIFFORD JOHNSON: In struggling to figure out what causes gravity then, Einstein has this great insight. It is simply that a mass distorts the shape of space-time around it, so, you get rid of this force of gravity and, instead, we have curvature of space-time.\n\nSEAN CARROLL: In Einstein's universe then, if space were empty, it would be flat. There'd be nothing going on. But as soon as you put objects down they warp the space and time around them, and that causes a deviation of the geometry, so that now things start moving.\n\nROBBERT DIJKGRAAF: Everything wants to move as simple as possible through space and time. But Einstein tells us that mass sculpts space and time, it's the curved motion through this sculpture that's the force of gravity.\n\nELEANOR KNOX: We have this feeling that the reason I can feel pressure on the soles of my feet, that the reason things are going to drop when I throw them, are because there's a force attracting us down to the center of the earth. What general relativity tells you is that's not the right way to think about what's going on there. What's really going on is that your natural path in space-time would take you to the center of the earth. And what's actually happening is the floor is getting in the way, it's pushing you upwards.\n\nSEAN CARROLL: When we look at it, we go, \"Ah, the force of gravity.\" But Einstein says, \"No, no, no: the curvature of space-time.\"\n\nNARRATOR: It's a stunning insight. Just as ant might feel forces pulling it left and right as it walks over crumpled paper, when, in fact, it's simply the shape of a surface dictating its path, Einstein saw that what we feel as the force of gravity is, in fact, the shape of the space-time we're moving through.\n\nEinstein now has everything he needs to formulate his final theory of gravity, but he makes a critical mistake. He misinterprets one of his equations and, unaware of his error, continues working on incorrect ideas.\n\nJOHN NORTON: The point at which Einstein is going to give the most essential equations of the theory, Einstein considers something like them, and then says, \"Ah, but these don't work,\" and then writes down the wrong equations. What follows are alternations of confidence and despair, as he convinces himself that everything was fine with this theory, and then he realizes that things aren't so good with the theory.\n\nIt is a long, dark period for Einstein, as he struggles to reconcile himself with a theory that is just not working.\n\nNARRATOR: Two years later, Einstein is in Berlin. At just 36 years old, he has one of the most prestigious positions in physics. But he is still struggling with his theory.\n\nWALTER ISAACSON: By 1915, he'd reached the pinnacle of the profession. He's in the Prussian Academy and a professor at the University of Berlin. But his marriage is falling apart, his wife and his two kids have moved back to Switzerland. So he's pacing around almost all alone, in this apartment, in Berlin.\n\nNARRATOR: And now, he has a competitor. Einstein had enthusiastically shared his ideas with the brilliant mathematician David Hilbert. Hilbert was so impressed, he decided to work on the theory, himself. Einstein is now in a race to the finish, with one of the world's best mathematicians.\n\nDAVID KAISER: This is unfolding in a remarkably dramatic period in history. World War I has begun to ravage central Europe. Einstein is not just toiling in the abstract, he's toiling as the world seems to fall apart.\n\nNARRATOR: By November, 1915, Einstein is scheduled to present his work in a series of four weekly lectures at the esteemed Prussian Academy. But he's struggling to formulate his ideas.\n\nIn the midst of these challenges, letters arrived from his wife in Zurich pressing the issue of his financial obligations to his family and discussing contact with his sons.\n\nAs his lectures begin, his theory is still far from complete. The pressure on Einstein is huge.\n\nSIMON SCHAFFER: He would give a lecture, revise it, give it again, spot mistakes, correct them, get up on the podium, explain what was wrong in the previous week's lecture, correct it and then move on, and then do that again and again, for four weeks running. His work to convince them of the truth of this absolutely radical new theory of relativity that he was proposing, is one of the most intense periods of work in the history of science.\n\nNARRATOR: Somehow he's able to focus on his theory with an incredible intensity, and he makes his breakthrough.\n\nHe tests his equations on a problem that Newton's theory of gravity couldn't solve: the orbit of Mercury. Mercury's path around the sun has an anomaly that Newton's theory can't explain: it deviates slightly each time it goes around. Einstein calculates the orbit with his new equations. The answer is correct, exactly what astronomers had observed.\n\nHe'd found the final equations for his general theory of relativity.\n\nSEAN CARROLL: You have to think about the hubris of being Albert Einstein. He had already thrown out Newtonian mechanics with special relativity. And then he had gone off on his little personal quest to incorporate gravity. And at the end of the day, he boils it down to a prediction for a number that had been observed, the procession of the orbit of Mercury. And, miraculously, when the pages of algebra work out to their end, you get the right answer. And, suddenly, it's not just playing with equations anymore. He realizes this is how the world works; all this abstract nonsense is the correct theory of reality.\n\nSIMON SCHAFFER: Einstein is, at last, able to present a successful theory. That's a triumphant moment, one of the great moments in the history of physics, and for Einstein, a victory very much against the odds. And he'd won.\n\nNARRATOR: On the 25th of November, 1915, Einstein lays out his findings in his climactic fourth lecture at the Prussian Academy. He presents general relativity. The theory can be written as a single equation. It condenses sprawling complexities into a beautifully compact set of symbols…\n\nROBBERT DIJKGRAAF: So the formula is really simple: G-m-u equals…\n\nNARRATOR: …G for the shape of space-time and T for the distribution of mass and energy.\n\nROBBERT DIJKGRAAF: So this very simple formula captures all of Einstein's general relativity. It's a beautiful, simple equation, but it's a lot of work to unpack the symbols, the mathematical symbols and see how, in this very simple formula, the whole geometry of the universe is hidden. It's, kind of, an acquired taste to see the beauty.\n\nIt's also a signature formula for Einstein. The true mark of his genius is that he combines two elements that actually live in different universes. The left-hand side lives in the world of geometry, of mathematics; the right-hand side lives in the world of physics, of matter and movement. And so, perhaps, the most powerful ingredient of the equation is this very symbol—equal sign here—these two lines that are connecting the two worlds. And it's quite appropriate the two lines, because it's two-way traffic.\n\nMatter tells space and time to curve, space and time tells matter to move.\n\nNARRATOR: When Einstein presented his great theory, few people understood it. He needed a way to prove to the world that the counterintuitive features of his theory were real.\n\nSIMON SCHAFFER: The general theory of relativity made predictions of things which looked really strange, for example, the idea that light bends when it passes near a very heavy body. No one had ever looked for that. No one had ever observed it. Einstein was desperate, desperate to get astronomers to make that test.\n\nNARRATOR: Einstein's theory predicts that when light from a distant star travels close to the sun, the warped space around the sun bends the light's path.\n\nIn May, 1919, the English astronomer Arthur Eddington traveled to the African island of Principe to record images that would show this phenomenon.\n\nDAVID KAISER: What Eddington was able to do was take photographs of stars during a total eclipse of the sun, so that the moon blocked most of the brightness of the sun and little pin pricks of light could be seen around the sun. Otherwise, it would be lost in the glare. And Eddington and his colleagues were able to measure that the appearance of those stars had been shifted, compared to where they would have been had that big mass of the sun not been deflecting that light from far away.\n\nSIMON SCHAFFER: He's able to show that Einstein's general relativity theory is right, and a revolution in science has been accomplished.\n\nWALTER ISAACSON: When the eclipse experiments prove Einstein's theory right, he rockets to fame. Not just because he's explained a new way of looking at the universe, but at the end of World War I, you had the predictions of a German scientist be proven right by some British astronomers. And it becomes headlines across the world. New York Times says, \"Lights all askew at the heavens, men of science more or less agog.\"—This is back when newspapers knew how to write great headlines.—But Einstein, kind of, loves this fact that he's now an icon of science.\n\nNARRATOR: Einstein becomes a worldwide celebrity, the icon of genius we still recognize today.\n\nSIMON SCHAFFER: The only person who was more widely known was Charlie Chaplin, and they got on like a house on fire. Chaplin said, \"The reason they all love me is because they understand everything I do, and the reason they love you is that they don't understand anything you do. Can you explain that?\" And Einstein said...\n\nNARRATOR: But in 1930s Berlin, the Nazi party is gaining power. As a Jewish scientist, Einstein becomes increasingly caught up in the political turmoil.\n\nDAVID KAISER: Einstein's theories became a target. They were deemed aesthetically repugnant to a, kind of, an Aryan sensibility. So people attacked not just Einstein the Jewish scientist, they would actually have people denouncing general relativity.\n\nNEWSREEL: In January, Nobel-prized mathematician Albert Einstein visited California.\n\nNARRATOR: He begins to make trips to America, where he is welcomed with open arms. And in 1933, he settles in Princeton, with his second wife Elsa, taking up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study.\n\nToday, the Institute is headed by Professor Robbert Dijkgraaf.\n\nROBBERT DIJKGRAAF: He, basically, was still very much by himself, just, actually, as he was in Berlin, just concentrating on his deep ideas and struggling with understanding the universe. Of course, his office was here.\n\nNARRATOR: At the Institute, Einstein worked to unify his theory of gravity with the other laws of physics.\n\nROBBERT DIJKGRAAF: With Einstein, you see this phenomena you see with many great scientists, that they climb this very high mountain and instead of celebrating their success, they're privileged to see a much wider landscape, and they see all these mountains behind it. And I think he was very much aware how much still there was to be done.\n\n'Til the very last days of his life, he was trying to push these equations and find a description of nature, all of nature, in terms of the geometry of space and time.\n\nNARRATOR: But general relativity was fading from mainstream science. Physics was now focused on the quantum theory of atoms and tiny particles, a theory incompatible with Einstein's ideas, but one that could be tested in the lab. Most of general relativity was then beyond the reach of experiment.\n\nWhen Einstein died, in 1955, aged 76, his theory was seen as one with little hope of future discovery.\n\nSEAN CARROLL: The best theories in physics always take us to places where the people who invented them didn't imagine. And a truly wonderful theory, like general relativity, predicts all sorts of things that Einstein didn't conceive of. The theory has a life of its own. We understand general relativity much better, right now, than Albert Einstein ever did.\n\nNASA MISSION CONTROL/FILE FOOTAGE: Liftoff of space shuttle Discovery, with the Hubble Space Telescope, our window on the universe.\n\nNARRATOR: Today, 100 years after general relativity was first presented, new technology is allowing us to explore the most remarkable predictions of the theory: an expanding universe; black holes; ripples in space-time; and perhaps the most bizarre, the idea that not just space, but time, itself, is distorted by heavy objects.\n\nNARRATOR: To prove it, a team of physicists is carrying out a remarkable experiment. They're using two atomic clocks that are in near perfect sync, accurate to a billionth of a second. The master clock remains at sea level while they take the second clock to the top of New Hampshire's Mount Sunapee.\n\nGeneral relativity tells us that as you move away from the mass of the planet, time should speed up. After four days at the top of the mountain, the test clock is taken back to the lab for comparison. There, they compare it to the sea level master clock. Four days ago they were in ticking in unison. But what about now?\n\nDAVID SCHERER (Microsemi Corporation): You guys ready? This is it, right here. The time interval counter is going to show us the time difference between these two clock ticks.\n\nTwenty nanoseconds!\n\nYou can see the time difference between them represented here, graphically: the clock that was up at the mountain for four days and our master clock.\n\nNARRATOR: Gravity, the distortion of space and time, becomes weaker as you move away from the surface of the planet, so while the test clock was up the mountain, time sped up. It's now 20 nanoseconds, 20 billionths of a second, ahead of the sea level clock.\n\nDAVID SCHERER: This is awesome.\n\nNARRATOR: This distortion of time has surprising consequences. The Global Positioning System, something we all take for granted, wouldn't work without taking this into account. The engineers who built the G.P.S. system we use every day to pinpoint locations, had to ensure it adjusted for the time difference between clocks on satellites and receivers on the ground. If they didn't, G.P.S. would be off by six miles every day.\n\nJIM GATES (University of Maryland): Your G.P.S. units use the results of general relativity. When you navigate in your car, you perhaps should give a word of thanks to Uncle Albert.\n\nNARRATOR: Of all general relativity's predictions that new technology has allowed us to explore, there's one that's straight out of science fiction: a black hole.\n\nKIP THORNE (California Institute of Technology): Everything that we are familiar with in ordinary life is made from matter, but not black holes. Black holes are made from warped space and time and nothing else. A black hole is an object that is spherical, like a star or like the earth, with a sharp boundary, called the horizon, through which nothing can come out. So, it casts a shadow on whatever is behind it. It's just a black, black shadow, unbelievably black.\n\nNARRATOR: This simulation shows the distortion of starlight around a black hole. Even though Einstein knew his theory predicted black holes, he found it hard to believe they would really exist in nature.\n\nIn the 1960s, Professor Kip Thorne worked on the mathematical concept of black holes. The idea made sense on paper and he began to feel that these science-fiction-like objects might actually be real.\n\nKIP THORNE: Must be here somewhere. It's in one of these piles.\n\nNARRATOR: Kip Thorne made a bet with fellow physicist Stephen Hawking about whether or not a strong source of x-rays, known as Cygnus X-1, was in fact a black hole.\n\nKIP THORNE: I think it's in here, yeah, here we go: relativity, stars and black holes. Yeah, here it is. So, that is a copy of the famous bet: \"Stephen Hawking bets one-year subscription to Penthouse magazine as against Kip Thorne's wager of a four-year subscription to a political magazine called Private Eye, that Cygnus X-1 does not contain a black hole of mass above the Chandrasekhar limit. It's witnessed this 10th day of December 1974.\"\n\nStephen Hawking had a terribly deep investment in it actually being a black hole, and so he made the bet against himself as an insurance policy, so at least he would get something out of it, if Cygnus X-1 turned out not to be a black hole.\n\nThe evidence mounted, thereafter, over the period of the70s and 80s, and in June, 1990, Stephen snuck into my office and signed off on the bet, that, finally, the evidence was absolutely overwhelming that Cygnus X-1 really is a black hole.\n\nAnd eh, Penthouse magazine arrived. He sent me the British version of Penthouse, which was ever so much more raunchy than the American Penthouse, actually, enough to make my face turn red, when I received it, at first.\n\nNARRATOR: Today, we have evidence suggesting that there are millions of black holes in our own galaxy alone. But perhaps the most profound prediction of general relativity is that our universe had a hot dense beginning that we call the \"Big Bang.\"\n\nThe discovery that distant galaxies are moving away from us and that there's a background radiation permeating space, provided evidence for the Big Bang and a universe that's growing.\n\nSAUL PERLMUTTER (University of California, Berkeley): With this picture of an expanding universe, there were natural questions: Is the universe slowing down as it expands? Is it so dense that someday it will come to a halt and collapse? Will the universe come to an end? These seemed like good questions.\n\nNARRATOR: To find answers, in the 1990s, Saul Perlmutter and his team observed exploding stars, called \"supernovae,\" to track the growth of the universe.\n\nSAUL PERLMUTTER: When we made the measurement, we discovered that the universe is not slowing down enough to come to a halt; in fact, it's not slowing at all, it's speeding up! The universe is expanding faster and faster.\n\nNARRATOR: But what's pushing it?\n\nSAUL PERLMUTTER: In order to explain the acceleration of the universe within Einstein's theory of general relativity, we're considering an energy spread throughout all of space that we've never seen before. We don't know what it is. We call it dark energy. And if so, it would require something like 70 percent of all of the stuff of the universe to be in this form of previously unknown dark energy.\n\nSo, this is a lot to swallow, and you might imagine, at that point, you should go back and revisit your theory. The problem is that Einstein's theory is so elegant, and it predicts so many, many, many digits of precision, that it's very, very difficult to come up with any other theory.\n\nNARRATOR: There is one final prediction of general relativity that remains untested: gravitational waves.\n\nJANNA LEVIN: There are huge things in the universe happening, like black holes colliding or stars exploding, and they create these gravitational waves, waves in the shape of space and time that travel through the universe at the speed of light. And so, right now, the space around me is being squeezed and stretched by gravitational waves just getting here from, let's say, two black holes colliding a billion light years away. But the squeezing and stretching is so minute, I absolutely could not, personally, detect it. And so, what we're trying to do is build an instrument that can.\n\nNARRATOR: In Louisiana and Washington State, a vast experiment called LIGO is in the final phases of calibration. It's hoped that laser beams, traveling two and a half miles between precisely aligned mirrors, will measure the squeezing of space caused by gravitational waves. This could open up an entirely new window on the universe.\n\nFor 100 years, general relativity has been proven to be correct time and time again, but Einstein himself knew that his great theory had limits. It remains incompatible with the quantum world of tiny atomic particles.\n\nHere, at the Institute for Advanced study, where Einstein worked, the world's leading theoretical physicists are trying to solve the problem Einstein never could, finding a single set of rules that applies to both the cosmic and atomic scales, a unified theory, the Holy Grail of physics.\n\nROBBERT DIJKGRAAF: We are now in what, at this time, is the School of Physics. Here, people are still struggling with many of the same issues that Einstein struggled with, trying to capture the laws of the universe from the very small to the very large in a single equation. And it's still blackboards that are the weapons of choice.\n\nThe brightest minds of the world are coming here to work, 24 hours, 7 days a week, struggling to grasp the great mysteries of the universe. And I think we are still driven by the same dream, that, at some point, we can capture everything in elegant mathematics.\n\nNARRATOR: One hundred years after Einstein transformed our understanding of nature, the stage is set for the next revolution.\n\nSEAN CARROLL: When we finally move beyond Einstein, it might be another singular genius that comes along, someone struggling in a poor school in Kenya, right now, that we don't know about. Or it might be 20 different people, with 20 different points of view, gradually building, brick by brick, to finally figure out a more comprehensive view that includes general relativity.\n\nROBBERT DIJKGRAAF: I think the most important thing you learn from Einstein is the power of an idea. If it's correct, you know, it's just unstoppable. It's extremely encouraging that he was able, with pure thought, to solve the riddle of the universe.\n\nJANNA LEVIN: Once we had general relativity, the world changed completely. Our point of view on the world changed completely. I mean, the origin of the universe is a prediction straight out of general relativity. We didn't have that before.\n\nJIM GATES: I often wonder what Einstein would make of today's theoretical physics. I think he would really be saying, you know, get on with it, get the right story, get the details right.\n\nROBBERT DIJKGRAAF: You know, you have the huge universe, and it obeys certain laws of nature, but where in the universe are these laws actually discovered? Where are they studied? And then you go to this tiny planet, and there's this one individual, Einstein, who can capture this. And now there's a small group of people walking in his footsteps and trying to push it further. And I often feel, well, it's this small part of the universe that actually is reflecting upon itself, that it's trying to understand itself.",
  "latent_18210": "Throughout much of the 1980s Australian cricket was a mess, the national team cast about on the winds of rebellion, hamstrung by retirements and peppered by regular defeat. Yet in the 1990s the Baggy Green side was one of the greatest the sport has seen. A generation of England fans grew up knowing the Australian side only as an all-conquering force, one who would habitually humiliate whichever side England sacrificially put out to take them on. The pivot between the old, shambolic and (crucially) Ashes-losing Australia of the 1980s and the new, terrifying Pommie-pounding Australia of the 1990s came in the Ashes series of 1989. And perhaps the simplest way to encapsulate the spirit of that summer is with two bottles of champagne and a glass of water.\n\nFirst, the bubbly. Terry Alderman, written off before the series as over-the-hill, a 30-something whose potency had been eroded by years of injury, a has-been that never really was, confounded the critics with match figures of 10 for 151 as Australia tore England apart in the first Test at Headingley. The bowler whose swing swung the game in the tourists’ favour pipped Steve Waugh and Mark Taylor to the man-of-the-match award, accepted his magnum of champagne, then ordered it to be put on ice until the Ashes were back in Australian hands.\n\n20 great Ashes moments No2: the miracle of Cardiff, 2009 | Rob Bagchi Read more\n\nThat was the first bottle in our tale. The second makes its appearance in the hands of a waiter at lunch on the second day of the fifth Test. Taylor and Geoff Marsh had batted through the entire opening day, Australia, 3-0 up with two games to play, the Ashes already heading back down under, were 370 for one, well on their way to amassing 400 plus in their first innings for the fifth time in five matches. Marsh had at last been dismissed for 138 in the morning session and, “to celebrate”, the England captain David Gower ordered himself a glass of the good stuff. If it was meant to be a self-deprecating attempt at light humour in the face of a crisis, it came across as a gesture of utter demoralisation, a sign of England’s all-too-obvious inadequacies and impotence in the face of a Baggy Green steamroller. And, coupled with Alderman’s magnum, it showcased the contrast in attitude between the sides – one shrugging its shoulders, one ruthlessly hell-bent on victory.\n\nWhich brings us on to that glass of water. Later in that Test, during England’s doomed attempt to avoid the follow on, Robin Smith, arguably the only England player to come out of the series with any credit, asked the Australian captain if he might have a glass of water. “No you fucking can’t, what do you think this is – a fucking tea party?” came the unequivocal response from Allan Border. This was a new Australia and a new Border. No more Mr Nice Guy.\n\nThe seeds of the new era were sown in the Ashes series of 1985, one that for Australia had been preceded, in Border’s words, by “a monumental shit fight” following defections from the squad for a rebel tour of South Africa – “I was a very unhappy captain, and I clearly had a very unhappy team on my hands.” Border’s team, defending the urn won back in 1982-83 by Greg Chappell, lost 3-1 to Gower’s England, but the atmosphere was convivial – there’s an illustrative photograph in Border’s autobiography of the two captains at the end of a day’s play during that tour, Border clasping his opposite number in a handshake with one arm, the other draped chummily across Gower’s shoulders, smiles all round. It was too convivial for some. “AB, these blokes are belting the hell out of you,” Ian Chappell told the Australian captain, “but you’re out there being their best mate, for Christ’s sake.” Border would remember those words, and act accordingly, on his next visit to England.\n\nEven fresher in Australian minds was the chastening beating they suffered on home soil at the hands of the West Indies in 1988-89. “We got beaten by the West Indies in the Boxing Day Test – they smashed us up and embarrassed us – and we made a pact afterwards it would never happen again,” said Dean Jones, the Australian No5. “That was the biggest turning point we’ve had in Australia. Everything changed for us. AB and all the players were harder on ourselves.”\n\nThe tourists disembarked from 26 hours in business class (the first time an Australian side had not flown economy to England – “’Aussies mean business’ had a nice ring to it,” reckoned Border) to be greeted by the usual “worst touring side ever” headlines. There was no doubt the home side expected to win. Gower had announced himself “supremely confident” of not just retaining the Ashes but beating the Australians on his reappointment as captain in April. If the confidence of the England side and media looks ludicrous in hindsight – and in poring over the faults of the visitors they entirely overlooked the weaknesses in their own side – it’s worth remembering that since winning the second Ashes Test at Lord’s on 27 June, 1985, Australia had won only five of 34 Tests, and of the 13 Tests played away from home in that period they had won none. In the 1980s up to that point they had won just one series on foreign soil – and that a one-match affair in Sri Lanka – and they had won only three series anywhere since 1983. The future greats in the side – Taylor, Waugh, Healy – were yet to reveal their greatness. They even lost their opening three-day match of the tour in a low-scoring game against Worcestershire then drew against Somerset in the next. Yet even during those games Border had a new demeanour. He had always been a rugged character, a battler, but this was a new, harder edge – he refused to talk to the opposition, and demanded complete discipline and commitment from his team in the field. And from England’s point of view, the counties made the mistake of throwing fuel on the fire.\n\nIn 1985 Border had complained about county sides fielding below-strength lineups in tour matches, so in 1989 counties were offered cash prizes – a share of £25,000 – for wins over the tourists, in a rather ill-thought-out attempt to ensure competitive matches. It certainly did that but a side-effect was that county sides tended to prepare result pitches. Fiery, bouncy, mind-your-head pitches. In the final tour match before the first Test, against Derbyshire – who fielded Devon Malcolm and a young West Indian named Ian Bishop – the Australian batting lineup were peppered with short deliveries. Fuelled by the cold pizza served up for lunch, they were bowled out for 200 in their first innings, 180 in the second and scraped home by 11 runs . That experience was the final straw. In the first Test Australia would be determined to, in Border’s words, “show the bastards”.\n\nAnd show them they did. At Headingley, scene of Border’s lowest point in 1981, Gower won the toss (at which the Australia captain did not speak to his counterpart) and put the tourists in. Taylor smashed his first Test century, Waugh did likewise, Australia declared at 601 for seven and despite England avoiding the follow-on, Alderman bowled the tourists to victory in the fourth innings. The champagne went on ice.\n\nAfter another game of what Border described as “bounce the Aussie” against a Lancashire attack including Wasim Akram and Patrick Patterson, Waugh made an unbeaten 152 in the first innings at Lord’s, Merv Hughes was warned for intimidatory bowling and an Australian side went two up after two Tests in England for the first time since Donald Bradman’s side in 1948.\n\nTwo moments at HQ again illustrate Australia’s new-found focus. Border points to the incident when he swiped at and missed a triple-bounce ball from Neil Foster. England were tickled, the Australian captain furious: “Maybe in 1985 I’d have responded to such an incident, and their joking, with a bit of light-hearted banter of my own.” This time around there was just naked rage. After the match the Australian camp received a telegram from the makers of the Crocodile Dundee films: “The party is on us. When and where do you want it?” Again it was decided to wait until after the Ashes were secure.\n\nFor the third Test at Edgbaston England recalled Ian Botham, despite the fact that he had neither scored a first-class fifty nor taken five wickets in an innings for two years, and rain came to the rescue. But at Old Trafford in the fourth Test (ahead of which England were rocked by the announcement of a rebel squad to tour South Africa) there was no escape from the throttling, aggressive fields, disciplined bowling and belligerent dismantling of the England attack. Three-nil, the Ashes back in Australian hands, but the relentless tourists and their captain were not yet satisfied. “We had some unfinished business: we wanted to win the series 5-0, the greatest winning margin by an Australian team. We had a team meeting at which the feeling was very much: ‘Let’s go for the jugular.’\n\n20 great Ashes moments No1: Shane Warne's ball of the century, 1993 | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nAt Trent Bridge Taylor and Marsh did not just go for the jugular – they ripped it out and made balloon animals with it. The first day ended with Australia 301 without loss, the opening pair becoming the first players to bat through an entire day’s play in a Test in England and only the third openers to do so anywhere. The home side by this stage were in disarray – Australia won by an innings and 180 runs.\n\nThe ordeal was nearly over for Gower and England. On the opening morning of the sixth Test Border was asked if he would like England to up their game a little, just to try his side’s mettle, to see how his youngsters responded to pressure. “Nope,” came the reply. England, who with their team selection took the number of players used during the series to 29 (Australian, in contrast, used 12), escaped with a rain-affected draw after Border, ruthless to the end, had delayed a declaration on the final day. An earlier end to the Australian innings “would have given England a sniff of victory and I had no intention of doing that”.\n\nThe demolition work was complete, England reduced to rubble. Australia, 4-0 winners for the first time since 1948, had their party courtesy of Crocodile Dundee’s box-office takings, flew home for ticker-tape parades and prepared for a new era of hard-nosed dominance.

The multi-billion-dollar corporation revealed new updates to Windows 10, new features for their Xbox One console, an expansion of Surface Studio and new GelaSkins for Surface.\n\nWindows 10 Creators Update\n\nOn the official blog page of Windows, Microsoft announced that their latest update (dubbed the Creators Update) would be unveiled on April 11, 2017. A major aspect of this update is the ability for users to unleash their creativity in the world of 3D. Microsoft expressed their interest in this field, and they will be including a new Paint 3D app to Windows 10.\n\nLooking past fun and games, Microsoft is also adding a new security service. This service, named Windows Defender Security Center, allows all security options (anti-virus software, firewall, security options, etc.) to be accessed in one location. Among other things, they are also introducing the ability to interact with Beam in real-time and performance updates to Microsoft Edge.\n\nXbox One Update\n\nThe members of Xbox Live will notice some significant changes to the software. Today, Microsoft officially released several updates for Xbox Live. The first aspect they altered was the Home page; simplifying the user interface to optimize system performance. Secondly, they upgraded the Guide to be much more intuitive. Now, with one press of the controller, the guide can be overlaid on the left side of the screen (providing easier access to all the features).\n\nIn addition to those, the company also added new and creative ways to multitask on the platform, the Beam feature (which allows interaction with streamers in real-time), and the Copilot feature (which allows two controllers to act as one).\n\nSurface Studio Coming to Canada\n\nResidents in Canada will soon be able to enjoy the luxuries that Surface Studio provide. On April 20, 2017, this service will be unveiled starting at $3,999 CAD.\n\nSurface GelaSkins\n\nPartnering with some of Canada’s elite artists, Microsoft and GelaSkins are launching a chunk of accessories designed for Surface Studio. Using the code MSFT30, a 30 per cent discount can be used on one of them (for a limited time).",
  "latent_18231": "Viagra may have a new spokesperson.\n\nFormer Boston Red Sox outfielder Manny Ramirez gave his teammates a mixture of alcohol and Viagra, a drug used to assist with erectile dysfunction, before games.\n\nThe Red Sox began a tradition of taking a shot of alcohol prior to playoff games in 2004 in order to calm their nerves, Pedro Martinez revealed on Late Night with Seth Meyers following his book release. The process clearly worked for the club, which ended the Curse of the Bambino with a World Series title that year.\n\nBoston players would take turns introducing their favorite shots prior to games when Ramirez presented his teammates with a concoction called mamajuana - a mixture of gin, honey, wine and medicine root. There was, of course, one other special ingredient.\n\n\"(Ramirez) put three 100mg Viagras in it. So here we go, somebody needs to taste this to see if it works,\" Martinez said. \"So we decided to let Ellis Burks try to taste it and I say, 'You know, this mamajuana, if you drink it, you might get turned on.' He said, 'Oh, I'll try it. I'll try it. I'm not playing anyway.' So he took it, it seemed like it worked. So everybody was coming up to him for a little shot.\"\n\nBurks was sidelined due to knee surgery at the time, so he was the perfect guinea pig for Ramirez's experiment.\n\nThe tradition of enjoying frothy suds and other guilty pleasures in the Red Sox clubhouse is well-documented and has been embraced by the next class of players in Boston.\n\nMartinez also spoke about why he never used performance-enhancing drugs Wednesday with ESPN's Colin Cowherd, and the conversation somehow mirrored the theme of erectile dysfunction.\n\n\"To be honest? Because when I heard, you know, the result would go south and affect you some other places, physically, I just said no.\"\n\nMartinez, who will be enshrined in Cooperstown this summer, also cited a heart defect as another deterrent from using steroids.",
  "latent_18250": "Ethereum design studio ConsenSys has launched BTC Relay, an open source project enabling Ethereum-based networks to interoperate programmatically with the Bitcoin network and eventually other Ethereum and Bitcoin-based systems.\n\nBTC Relay is a fully decentralised smart contract for the community that does not grant special privileges to any party. Using BTC Relay, Ethereum developers can implement a \"Pay with Bitcoin\" button in their Ethereum-based decentralised applications, allowing Bitcoin holders to interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform, said a statement.\n\nBTC Relay has been added to EtherEx, a decentralised exchange, as a mechanism whereby Bitcoin can be exchanged with Ether, without any counterparty risk. Another potential use case is the issuance of an Ethereum-based \"BTC\" token (ETHBTC) based on locking actual BTC tokens in a multisig on the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nThis bidirectional bridge between BTC and ETHBTC is planned. From a technical perspective, BTC Relay implements Bitcoin SPV (simplified payment verification) to verify whether a Bitcoin transaction has been confirmed (sufficiently) on the Bitcoin blockchain. Community members, called Relayers, provide BTC Relay with the new Bitcoin block header that has been generated by Bitcoin miners. Ethereum decentralised app developers can make API calls to BTC Relay from their smart contracts to verify activities on the Bitcoin network.\n\nAnyone can join the Ethereum network and become a Relayer; there is no heavy hardware or electricity consumption as required for Bitcoin mining. BTC Relay was conceived and funded under the Ethereum Foundation, and later adopted and supported by ConsenSys when Joseph Chow, the developer of BTC Relay, joined ConsenSys. A grant from Wanxiang Blockchain Labs was used to fund an independent security audit and rewards for a fruitful bug bounty program.\n\n\"BTC Relay is a building block and I look forward to the infrastructure, applications, and innovations that BTC Relay helps enable on and off the Ethereum platform. The possibilities are exciting,\" said Joseph Chow, developer of BTC Relay.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the inventor of Ethereum, said \"I am excited to see BTC Relay provide the first-ever production release of cross-blockchain communication of this kind, and hope that it will set an example for interoperating cross-blockchain applications, whether between Bitcoin and Ethereum, other blockchains and Ethereum and public and private or consortium chains, for many years to come.\"\n\nJoseph Lubin, founder and CEO of ConsenSys, indicated that \"BTC Relay is a powerful tool that enables Ethereum smart contracts to serve as SPV wallets for various other Ethereum-based networks or other blockchain-based systems (Bitcoin, Doge, etc.) in private permissioned, or open permissionless implementations.\n\nWith this capability, Ethereum, due to the stateful, computational power of its EVM and smart contract capabilities, can serve as a substrate for many glue protocols that will join various blockchain networks and other decentralised services together into an internet of decentralised systems. We envision a world of many purpose-built private enterprise and consortium blockchain systems, in addition to public blockchain networks, and BTC Relay and its extensions can enable them all to easily interoperate.\"",

And now the Kremlin is stepping in.\n\nThousands of Russian-speakers took to the streets across Germany at the weekend protesting against what they say is a cover-up by police.\n\n\"Our children are in danger,\" read one banner. \"Hands off my child,\" read another.\n\nSeven-hundred protesters gathered outside Angela Merkel's chancellery on Saturday and other demonstrations have been held outside asylum-seekers' homes in Berlin and Southern Germany.\n\nMore on Germany's response to the refugee crisis\n\nAre German attitudes changing after Cologne attacks?\n\nGermany struggles to cope with influx\n\nCologne attacks put spotlight on Germany's N African migrants\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption These German Russians held up a placard saying: \"We have the right to doubt the objectivity of the police\"\n\nThe demonstrators were angry after reports on the popular Russian television station Channel One that a 13-year-old girl from a Russian-immigrant family had been abducted on her way to school and gang-raped by \"southern-looking\" asylum-seekers.\n\nBut German police say that after questioning and examination it was clear that Lisa F was not abducted and not raped. Sexual contact was not forced, say officers. Because the girl is only 13 years old prosecutors are investigating two men for child abuse.\n\nThe age of consent in Germany is 14 and while sex with an under-aged child is classed as statutory rape, it is generally seen as child abuse if violence was not used.\n\nSocial media outrage\n\nOn 11 January Lisa F was reported missing by her family. She re-appeared the next day.\n\nBut a TV interview given by a woman identified as the girl's aunt claimed that the girl was raped by numerous men over the 30-hour period while she was missing. The report that sparked the protests was spread on social media and has so far been watched more than a million times on Facebook.\n\nGerman lawyer Martin Luithle has now reported the Russian journalist behind the report, Ivan Blagoy, to the police for incitement.\n\nThe case has been taken up enthusiastically by right-wing extremists in a bid to fuel anti-migrant sentiment.\n\nGermany took in 1.1 million refugees and migrants in 2015 and migration is an explosive issue. The far-right NPD and the Berlin branch of the anti-Islam Pegida movement have helped organise the protests.\n\nImage copyright 1TV.RU Image caption First Channel correspondent Ivan Blagoy filed the original report, now seen more than a million times on Facebook\n\nLinks between Russia and far-right groups in Germany are not unusual.\n\nRussian flags and symbols are often seen at anti-Muslim Pegida protests. And the Berlin district of Marzahn, where Lisa F's family lives, is heavily populated with Russian-speakers, and is notorious for xenophobic right-wing extremist protests.\n\nBut now the case could be turning into a diplomatic row between Germany and Russia, as the Kremlin gets involved.\n\n\"It's clear that the girl did not disappear voluntarily for 30 hours,\" Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said during a news conference in Moscow on Tuesday, accusing German officials of a politically-motivated cover up.\n\n\"I hope that these problems are not swept under the carpet and that there'll be no repeat cases like that of our Lisa.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters on Tuesday it was clear the girl had disappeared - and not willingly\n\nIn fact Mr Lavrov had been asked about German-Russian relations. But by opting to talk so bluntly about what's become known as the \"Lisa case,\" Mr Lavrov is clearly calling into question Germany's authorities.\n\nThese allegations are particularly potent since the debacle in Cologne, when police failed to protect women from sexual assaults on New Year's Eve.\n\nBerlin's Interior Minister Frank Henkel has responded by saying he is baffled by Moscow's involvement in an ongoing police investigation, countering that German police and prosecutors abide by the law.\n\n\"The accusation that investigators are covering something up does not become more correct, simply by continually repeating it,\" he said.\n\nOther German politicians, from across the political spectrum, have expressed outrage, accusing Moscow of inflaming far-right conspiracy theories in Germany.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was adamant there was no justification to use the case \"for political propaganda, and to inflame and influence what is already a difficult debate about migration within Germany\".\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said the authorities should be allowed to investigate without external intrusion. \"There is no reason, in fact it is even impermissible, to make political use of this case,\" he said.\n\nThe chair of the German government's foreign affairs committee, Norbert Roettgen, complained that \"manipulation and untruths are common methods in the propaganda used by the Russian leadership. The case shows that domestic questions of power in Russia appear to be more important than relations with other countries.\"\n\nBut some German commentators have criticised the Berlin police force for poor communication.\n\nAlthough investigators are pursuing charges of child abuse, critics say it was not clear from initial police announcements that the case was being followed up.\n\nThis initial lack of clarity played into the hands of anti-migrant activists hoping to inflame tensions.\n\nKremlin-backed media have often been accused of using propaganda to stir up trouble with Russian-speakers living in the Baltics.\n\nBut now some fear the same tactic could be being used in Germany, possibly to keep Chancellor Angela Merkel on the back-foot when it comes to the fate of EU sanctions imposed on Russia because of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nGermany's New Year's Eve sex attacks\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Hundreds of women said they suffered sexual assaults and robberies around Cologne station\n\nMore than 1,000 offences, including 384 sex attacks, reported mainly on New Year's Eve in North Rhine-Westphalia\n\nMajority in Cologne but also Duesseldorf and Bielefeld\n\nIn Hamburg, 195 offences were reported, most were sexual assaults\n\nCases also reported in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Nuremberg, Munich and other cities\n\nFew suspects identified, most attackers described as of Tunisian, Moroccan and Algerian origin\n\nFrom BKA police report cited by German media (23 January)\n\nWomen describe night of assaults",
  "latent_18258": "Hear the radio version of this story.\n\nThe Cumberland Plateau is home to a rare orchid that has become so scarce it’s now up for federal protection. The Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed putting the white fringeless orchid on the Endangered Species list under a \"threatened\" status.\n\n\"Left unmanaged, the plant’s range and abundance will likely continue to diminish,\" says a release from the agency.\n\n“In proposing to list the white fringeless orchid as threatened, we are acknowledging the severity of the threats it faces, and hopefully sounding a warning that will bring the increased conservation efforts needed to recover the plant before it’s situation becomes more dire,” southeast regional director Cindy Dohner said in a statement.\n\nThe wild orchid is spindly and delicate and is only identifiable during the month of August while in bloom, even for trained botanists.\n\nWildlife officials won’t even say precisely where this flower is found except that there are 58 known occurrences across the southeast, mostly in Tennessee. There have been a few instances of poaching, though Roger McCoy, who heads Tennessee’s division over natural areas, says he’s not sure why anyone would dig them up just to watch them die.\n\n“I really don’t know,\" he says. \"I would assume it’s individuals just wanting to have a pretty plant in their yard. But orchids are very difficult to cultivate in that manner.”\n\nMore often, changes in habitat are the problem, he says. The white fringeless orchid likes boggy conditions, which can be altered by removal of beaver dams or other changes to watersheds like the construction of ponds. Deer and feral hogs have also been an issue, so fencing has been erected around one Tennessee site.\n\nThis particular orchid depends on just three kinds of butterflies for pollination and a single species of fungi. Its seeds also lack nutrient reserves for survival and are only dispersed by the wind.\n\nThe white fringeless orchid has been a candidate for federal listing since 1999.

  "latent_18292": "This story reflects the views of these authors, but not necessarily the editorial position of Fast Company. These are fast-changing times. Old certainties are collapsing around us and people are scrambling for new ways of being in the world. As we pointed out in a recent article, 51% of young people in the United States no longer support the system of capitalism. And a solid 55% of Americans of all ages believe that capitalism is fundamentally unfair.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut question capitalism in public and you’re likely to get some angry responses. People immediately assume that you want to see socialism or communism instead. They tell you to go and live in Venezuela, the current flogging-horse for socialism, or they hit you with dreary images of Soviet Russia with all its violence, dysfunction, and grey conformity. They don’t consider that you might want something beyond caricatures and old dogmas. These old ‘isms’ lurk in the shadows of any discussion on capitalism. The cyber-punk author William Gibson has a term for this effect: “semiotic ghosts”; one concept that haunts another, regardless of any useful or intended connection. There’s no good reason to remain captive to these old ghosts. All they do is stop us having a clear-headed conversation about the future. Soviet Russia was an unmitigated social and economic disaster; that’s easy to dispel. But, of course, not all experiments with socialist principles have gone so horribly wrong. Take the social democracies of Sweden and Finland, for example, or even post-war Britain and the New Deal in the U.S. There are many systems that have effectively harnessed the economy to deliver shared prosperity. But here’s the thing. While these systems clearly produce more positive social outcomes than laissez-faire systems do (think about the record high levels of health, education and well-being in Scandinavian countries, for example), even the best of them don’t offer the solutions we so urgently need right now, in an era of climate change and ecological collapse. Right now we are overshooting Earth’s carrying capacity by a crushing 64% each year, in terms of our resource use and greenhouse gas emissions. The socialism that exists in the world today, on its own, has nothing much to say about this. Just like capitalism, it relies on endless, indeed exponential GDP growth, ever-increasing levels of extraction and production and consumption. The two systems may disagree about how best to distribute the yields of a plundered earth, but they do not question the process of plunder itself. Fortunately, there is already a wealth of language and ideas out there that stretch well beyond these dusty old binaries. They are driven by a hugely diverse community of thinkers, innovators, and practitioners. There are organizations like the P2P (Peer to Peer) Foundation, Evonomics, The Next System Project, and the Institute for New Economic Thinking reimagining the global economy. The proposed models are even more varied: from complexity, to post-growth, de-growth, land-based, regenerative, circular, and even the deliciously named donut economics.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThen, there are the many communities of practice, from the Zapatistas in Mexico to the barter economies of Detroit, from the global Transition Network, to Bhutan, with its Gross National Happiness index. There are even serious economists and writers, from Jeremy Rifkin to David Fleming to Paul Mason, making a spirited case that the evolution beyond capitalism is well underway and unstoppable, thanks to already active ecological feedback loops and/or the arrival of the near zero-marginal cost products and services.This list barely scratches the surface. The thinking is rich and varied, but all of these approaches share the virtue of being informed by up-to-date science and the reality of today’s big problems. They move beyond the reductionist dogmas of orthodox economics and embrace complexity; they focus on regenerating rather than simply using-up our planet’s resources; they think more holistically about how to live well within ecological boundaries; some of them draw on indigenous knowledge and lore about how to stay in balance with nature; others confront the contradictions of endless growth head on. Not all would necessarily describe themselves as anti- or even post-capitalist, but they are all, in one way or another, breaking through the dry seals of neoclassical economic theory upon which capitalism rests.\n\nStill, resistance to innovation is strong. One reason is surely that our culture has been stewed in capitalist logic for so long that it feels impregnable. Our instinct is now to see it as natural; some even go so far as to deem it divine. The notion that we should prioritize the production of capital over all other things has become a kind of common sense; the way humans must organize. Another reason, clearly linked, is the blindness of much of the academic world. Take, for example, the University of Manchester, where a group of economics students asked for their syllabus to be upgraded to account for the realities of a post-crash world. Joe Earle, one of the organizers of what The Guardian described as a “quiet revolution against orthodox free-market teaching” told the newspaper: “[Neoclassical economics] is given such a dominant position in our modules that many students aren’t even aware that there are other distinct theories out there that question the assumptions, methodologies and conclusions of the economics we are taught.” In much the same way as House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, rebuffed college student Trevor Hill when he asked whether the Democratic Party would consider any alternatives to capitalism, Manchester University’s response was a flat no. Their economics course, they said, “focuses on mainstream approaches, reflecting the current state of the discipline”. Mainstream, current, anything but fresh. Such attitudes have spawned a global student movement, Rethinking Economics, with chapters as far afield as Ecuador, Uganda, and China. Capitalism has become a dogma, and dogmas die very slowly and very reluctantly. It is a system that has co-evolved with modernity, so it has the full force of social and institutional norms behind it. Its essential logic is even woven into most of our worldviews, which is to say, our brains. To question it can trigger a visceral reaction; it can feel like an attack not just on common sense but on our personal identities.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut even if you believe it was once the best system ever, you can still see that today it has become necrotic and dangerous. This is demonstrated most starkly by two facts: The first is that the system is doing little now to improve the lives of the majority of humans: by some estimates, 4.3 billion of us are living in poverty, and that number has risen significantly over the past few decades. The ghostly responses to this tend to be either unimaginative–“If you think it’s bad, try living in Zimbabwe”–or zealous: “Well, that’s because there’s not enough capitalism. Let it loose with more deregulation, or give it time and it will raise their incomes too.” One of the many problems with this last argument is the second fact: with just half of us living above the poverty line, capitalism’s endless need for resources is already driving us over the cliff-edge of climate change and ecological collapse. This ranges from those that are both finite and dangerous to use, like fossil fuels, to those that are being used so fast that they don’t have time to regenerate, like fish stocks and the soil in which we grow our food. Those 4.3 billion more people living ‘successful’ hyper-consumption lifestyles? The laws of physics would need to change. Even Elon Musk can’t do that. It would be a sad and defeated world that simply accepted the prebaked assumption that capitalism (or socialism, or communism) represents the last stage of human thought; our ingenuity exhausted. Capitalism’s fundamental rules–like the necessity for endless GDP growth, which requires treating our planet as an infinite pit of value and damage to it as an “externality”– can be upgraded. Of course they can. There are plenty of options on the table. When have we humans ever accepted the idea that change for the better is a thing of the past? Of course, transcending capitalism might feel impossible right now. The political mainstream has its feet firmly planted and deeply rooted in that soil. But with the pace of events today, the unimaginable can become the possible, and even the inevitable with remarkable speed. The path to a better future will be cut by regular people being curious and open enough to challenge the wisdom received from our schools, our parents, and our governments, and look at the world with fresh eyes. We can let the ghosts go. We can allow ourselves the freedom to do what humans do best: innovate.",

  "latent_18676": "Tens of thousands of people have journeyed to Iraq and Syria to join Islamic State militants in the past few years, but after experiencing the reality of life in the group’s territory many have come to regret that decision.\n\nIn a new report published this week, the International Center for the Study of Radicalization sheds light on what it calls a “growing phenomenon” of defectors, who are beginning to speak out about why they left the militant organization.\n\nICSR looked at 58 different instances when people have spoke publicly about defecting from the Islamic State, using the accounts as case studies. The defectors whose stories were analyzed are from seventeen countries, and include seven women. The report finds several consistent narratives about what caused the former fighters to quit.\n\nIn some cases, the rationale for leaving the group is disillusionment with the way that the Islamic State is run, rather than a rejection of the militants’ ideological extremism that brought the recruits to Iraq and Syria in the first place.\n\nOne of the four main reasons former members defected was that they became fed up with the level of corruption from individual commanders, and what defectors referred to as “un-Islamic” practices. This included instances of racism against fighters within the group, according to the director of ICSR and author of the report, Peter Neumann, such as one incident when an Indian foreign fighter was forced to clean toilets.\n\nAnother reason fighters say they defected is dismay that Islamic State militants kill civilians, including women and children -- notably they only cited the killings of Sunni Muslims. The Islamic State's war crimes against minority populations, like the Yazidi, which include widespread massacres, enslavement and rape, weren't mentioned in the accounts that ICSR surveyed.\n\nConflict between the Islamic State group and other militants -- instead of focusing on fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad -- was also cited as a reason defectors left. They also complained about the quality of life in areas controlled by Islamic State. The group's propaganda often makes false promises of a fully functional society based on its interpretation of Islamic law, replete with wealth, socials services and even its own currency.\n\nReuters TV / Reuters\n\nThe Islamic State's propaganda machine has been extremely effective, contributing to luring at least 25,000 foreign fighters into the group's ranks, according to a UN report published in April. There have been numerous stories detailing the circumstances that drove individuals to join the group or of how people were targeted online as potential recruits, but there have been relatively few accounts from defectors.\n\nOne possible reason for this could be because it is extremely dangerous to defect, as the ICSR report outlines. Many fear reprisals against family members. Foreign fighters may also face legal repercussions and charges when they return to their home countries, as many states have made moves to revoke passports or criminalize travel to Islamic State-controlled areas.\n\nThose who have managed to escape the group offer a unique perspective and potential antidote to its rhetoric, the ICSR report states. Their accounts present a counter-narrative to Islamic State propaganda, and show how the group can lose appeal even for those with similar extremist views.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:",

  "latent_18965": "In 2016 alone, North Korea tested two nuclear weapons, launched 20 ballistic missiles, sent a satellite into orbit, and made advances in both submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) technology.\n\nThere’s no doubt that a nuclear North Korea will be the biggest foreign policy thorn in Donald Trump’s side. But at the end of his first month in office, even after North Korea’s missile launch earlier this month, he still lacks a plan. It’s going to take more than a few aggressive tweets for Trump to bring North Korea to heel.\n\nKim Jong-un, the truculent young leader of North Korea, doesn’t mince words. In his 2017 New Year’s address, he warned, “We will continue to build up our self-defense capability, the pivot of which is the nuclear forces, and the capability for preemptive strike…”\n\nNorth Korea will likely soon be able to reach U.S. mainland targets with its nuclear-tipped ICBMs. Given his forthright approach to matters of state, skeptics are concerned about Trump’s ability to manage sensitive foreign policy matters.\n\nBut where previous U.S. administrations have tried and failed with North Korea, Trump’s eagerness to break with diplomatic convention may bring North Korea back to the negotiation table.\n\nFrom Bill Clinton to Barack Obama, a succession of U.S. administrations have sought to end North Korea’s nuclear program.\n\nThe Clinton administration was a time of “what-ifs.” A transitioning North Korean leadership was teetering on the brink of collapse and the citizenry were starving. In 1993, defying expectations of regime collapse, North Korea conducted its first successful missile test and threatened to pull out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\n\nClinton responded by negotiating the 1994 Agreed Framework, demanding (albeit politely) that North Korea pull down the shutters on its nuclear program in return for all of the heavy fuel oil it needed, and two light-water reactors (LWR). Despite opposition from Congress, delayed shipments and a failed effort to reduce economic sanctions, hopes for progress remained until the early 2000s.\n\nGeorge W. Bush came out swinging, labeling North Korea part of an “Axis of Evil” with Iran and Iraq. But Bush’s hardline triggered an escalation that led to the outbreak of a second nuclear crisis and North Korea’s subsequent withdrawal from the NPT. The very violent, very public end of Saddam Hussein’s regime in 2003—and Muammar Gaddafi’s eight years later—provided the North Korean leadership with further motivation for ramping up its nuclear program.\n\nAfter Clinton’s carrots and Bush’s sticks, Obama’s wait-and-see “strategic patience” reflected wishful U.S. thinking that North Korea would simply work itself out (or just go away). In the end, though, Obama’s patience was enough to pass the problem to his successor, but not enough to roll back North Korea’s nuclear aspirations.\n\nTrump’s uncharacteristically muted response to the recent missile launch gives pause for thought. Whether we (or he) like it or not, Trump is now the leader of the most powerful nation on earth. But his presidency is shaping up to be more Andrew Jackson than Washington-insider. The Trump administration is likely to juggle Obama’s hot potato for a while yet, charting a middle ground between Clinton’s dovish Agreed Framework and Bush’s hawkish regime change.\n\nTrump will not succeed if his end game is a denuclearized North Korea. But he has a wild card up his sleeve: He is the first American president in 30 years not pursuing the post-Cold War, end-of-history narrative. The Trump administration doesn’t believe that everything is destined to collapse into the Western-liberal order based on western-style liberal democracies, the free market economy, and globalization. In fact, he has little interest in what ideology U.S. trading or security partners follow. For Trump, ideology comes in second to the bottom line.\n\nLike Obama, Trump lacks a coherent strategy to deal with North Korea. The difference is that Obama was unable to see beyond an ineluctable unipolar narrative of world events. Belief in this inevitability haunted Obama and his predecessors in a way it doesn’t Trump.\n\nFor Trump, not all roads lead to an ideologically liberal world order. In place of America’s moral evangelism, Trump is happy to erect the twin pillars of isolationism and protectionism—the unswerving pragmatism of the businessman.\n\nTrump’s ‘splendid pragmatism’ allows him a free hand in dealing with matters of foreign policy. His apparent ease at breaking with diplomatic norms—for instance, in taking Taiwan leader, Tsai Ing-wen’s call, or backing away from longstanding U.S. support for a two-state solution in the Middle East—raised eyebrows. Yet his unorthodox approach is entirely rational for a leader free from the strictures of post-Cold War geo-politics.\n\nIf Trump accepts Pyongyang’s nuclear program and talks directly with Kim Jong-un, the deadlock that has plagued successive U.S. administrations might be broken.\n\nOf course, every rose has its thorn, and Trump’s break with traditions could also backfire. The post-Cold War world—in which the U.S. has been the sole superpower—has also been a relatively stable world. In calling off all bets, Trump might be setting the U.S. on a path of confrontation with the new superpower in town: China.\n\nTrump recently commented, “China has … total control over North Korea. And China should solve that problem. And if they don’t solve the problem, we should make trade very difficult for China.”\n\n“We are holding China up,” he added. “They’re taking so much money. They’re draining our country, and they’re toying with us with North Korea.”\n\nAny Trumpian deal with China over North Korea’s nuclear program comes with an appalling level of risk. China is likely the key to bringing North Korea in from the cold, as the excitement over Beijing’s decision to stop buying North Korean coal indicated. But how much pressure China can exert on North Korea before it over-reaches is contentious, particularly when regime survival is at stake.\n\nBefore sitting down to decide on the fate of a third country, the U.S. and China need to strike a mutually conciliatory tone. What does each side want? A denuclearized North Korea? Reunification of the divided peninsula? Decapitation of the leadership?\n\nIf Trump can’t do this, the “North Korea problem” is likely to metastasize into the “China problem” for future administrations.\n\nTrump has some difficult choices ahead, given that decades of sanctions, threats, isolation, talks, and concessions have had little impact. Another failed foreign policy initiative in Northeast Asia would send a message to its allies that the U.S. is weak. It would also pave the way for China’s expanding regional influence.\n\nMarkus Bell is an anthropologist and a lecturer in the University of Sheffield’s School of East Asian Studies.

  "latent_19445": "Both ABC and NBC were desperately backing calls from partisan Democrats, Monday night, to have a special prosecutor investigate the Donald Trump’s campaign for evidence of collusion with Russia. But, took a liking to a call from one particular Republican. “In Washington tonight, pressure is intensifying for an independent investigation on Russia, including a call from a leading Republican,” announced anchor Lester Holt during NBC Nightly News, “There's also new resistance to those calls by the White House.”\n\nThe Republican Holt referred to (and ABC praised as well) was Representative Darrell Issa of California. “But now a prominent House Republican is calling for an independent investigation saying Attorney General Jeff sessions shouldn't be involved because of the prominent role he played in the Trump campaign,” reported ABC’s Jon Karl on World News Tonight.\n\nBut their respect for Issa’s opinion is a new phenomenon for these two liberal news outlets. In the past, they wanted nothing to with his active investigations and probes when it was Barack Obama’s administration that was under the microscope.\n\nIn 2014, they ignored the findings of Issa’s House Oversight Committee when they exposed the fact that the Obama administration covered up the motivation behind the Benghazi attack that killed four Americans. NBC didn’t think much of his investigation into the IRS’s targeting of Tea Party organizations neither, while ABC completely ignored it for months. Nor did they like it when another one of Issa’s probe’s discovered an “idiotic” ATF policy that got a Border Patrol agent killed.\n\nBut that hypocrisy didn’t stop them from using him to discredit the Trump administration. “Tonight, mounting scrutiny over Russia after top Republican congressman Darrell Issa breaking ranks with the President, calling for a special prosecutor to look into potential ties between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials,” Kristen Welker declared. She also leaned on an interview her colleague Matt Lauer conducted with former President George W. Bush where he tried to get the former president to trash Trump.\n\n“The White House insisted today there's nothing left to investigate even though key questions remain unanswered,” Karl warned in the middle of his report. But he never expressed what those questions were. He only insinuated that there were dark secrets as he played highlights of his sparring with Press Secretary Spicer from the press briefing earlier in the day.\n\nHe brushed off Spicer’s argument of “how many people have to say that there's nothing there before you realize there's nothing there?” He’s comeback was that the FBI and Congressional investigations were still going on. He never mentioned that leaks from the FBI investigation (which is how they know anything about it) have said that there has been no evidence found of Russia collusion with the campaign, and that media reports were overstating the facts.\n\nThis lusting for a special prosecutor to look into Trump campaign/administration demonstrates their obscene levels of bias and contempt that they have for the beater of Hillary Clinton. They never accepted Republican calls for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary’s or Obama’s misconduct but they’re now throwing their full weight behind one for Trump.\n\nTranscripts below:\n\n<<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>>\n\nNBC Nightly News\n\nFebruary 27, 2017\n\n7:06:08 PM Eastern LESTER HOLT: In Washington tonight, pressure is intensifying for an independent investigation on Russia, including a call from a leading Republican.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Do you support a special prosecutor on Russia? WELKER: But as the press was hustled out, whispering he hasn't spoken to Russia in years. DONALD TRUMP: I haven't called Russia in 10 years. WELKER: That contradicts Mr. Trump's own public statements. This 2014 speech one of many in which he's touted his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. TRUMP: As an example I own the miss universe, I was in Moscow recently. And I spoke indirectly and directly with President Putin, who could not have been nicer. WELKER: But even former President George W. Bush insisted more information is needed in an exclusive interview with Matt Lauer on Today. GEORGE W. BUSH: I think we all need answers. Whether or not a special prosecutor's the right way to go, you're talking to the wrong guy. I am sure, though, that that question needs to be answered. WELKER: Today the White House tried to knock down the controversy. SEAN SPICER: I guess my question would be, a prosecutor for what? We have for six months heard story after story come out about unnamed sources, say the same thing over and over again. And nothing's come of it. WELKER: Tonight the fight is heating up on Capitol Hill. DEVIN NUNES: We still have not seen any evidence of anyone from the Trump campaign or any other campaign, for that matter, that's communicated with the Russian government.

An excerpt of the report states that VCU is synergistically linked with the community and “integral part of the very soul of the community.”\n\nThe report also references the student body size, employees, and percentage of alumni who stay within the region.\n\n“Thus, at any given moment, well over 10 percent of the population of the entire Richmond metropolitan area is comprised of former or current VCU students, faculty and staff. In the city of Richmond, this percentage is undoubtedly much higher. While they certainly do not all share the same political attitudes or tastes, their youthful, creative energy contributes in countless ways to shaping the identity of Richmond.”\n\nMichael Rao, Ph.D., president of VCU and VCU Health, said the report’s findings will help VCU address some of the complex issues faced by the community.\n\n“We learned a lot from this report about what VCU has been, and what we should become,” Rao said. “Our focus will be the people behind these numbers — the people of Richmond — and how we can continue to use our expertise, talents and resources to help solve some of the most challenging issues our city faces, including K-12 education, health disparities, housing and others.”\n\n“We have already begun work on these complex issues, and this report is a call to action to forge ahead in helping achieve what’s difficult,” Rao concluded.\n\nRichmond Mayor Levar M. Stoney said the strong relationship between the city and the university is beneficial to both partners.\n\n“The impact of VCU upon the city of Richmond cannot be overstated,” Stoney said. “Its artistic, cultural, academic and economic contributions through its university and health system have helped make us the destination city we are today, and will play a huge role in our future success going forward.”\n\nBarry Matherly, president and CEO of the Greater Richmond Partnership, cited VCU’s role in engaging with the community as critical to the region’s success.\n\n“I think the big connection here is that VCU actually wants to be a part of the community and engages in a very thoughtful way to make sure that the community is growing with the university,” Matherly said. “And I think the ability to focus, not only just on inside of the walls of the university, but to focus externally around it, makes it that powerful engine that’s helping drive this economy.”\n\nThe full report and a video about the report’s findings are available at president.vcu.edu/impact/.",

  "latent_19723": "Barrett Brown Re-Arrested For Giving Media Interviews Without Permission\n\nfrom the hey,-wait-a-second... dept\n\nThe weird, sickening persecution of Barrett Brown continues. Whether or not you like the guy (and every time we post about him, we hear from people who provide reasons why they dislike him), the way he's been treated by our justice system is despicable. If you don't recall, Brown is an award winning journalist, who certainly went deep with Anonymous and other online groups. Eventually that resulted in him being arrested and harassed by prosecutors for sharing a link. When the infamous Stratfor hacks were released, he shared a link to the files to get people to sift through them. Because some of the files included swiped credit card numbers, he was charged with \"trafficking\" in stolen credit cards. Oddly, right before trial -- realizing how insane it was to charge him over this -- the feds dropped the charges around linking, but pushed forward on other charges because he hid a laptop in a cabinet and (stupidly...) got angry at the FBI when they came to investigate. The odd part is that following a plea deal, the judge sentenced him to an astounding 63 months in jail -- and cited the sharing of the link (again, those charges were dropped, but it sometimes appeared the judge didn't realize that) to explain why.\n\nBut the odder part throughout all of this was just how vindictive and petty everyone in the system were towards Brown -- and specifically towards his interactions with the press. The feds sought to stop the media from reporting on Brown's case and got a judge to block Brown or his lawyers from talking to the media. And once he was in prison, the feds cut off his email.\n\nAll this weird petty shit, just to stop him from talking to the media.\n\nLate last year, he was released from prison (earlier than expected) and has been complying with all the terms of his release... except, apparently, officials disagreed with that... because he was conducting interview with the media, according to D Magazine, where Brown has been working since his release. The Intercept, which employed Brown as a columnist while he was in prison, has more details, claiming that his check-in officer suddenly claimed that he needed permission before he could conduct media interviews -- something he had not been told at all.\n\nAccording to his mother, who spoke with Brown by phone after his arrest, Brown believes the reason for his re-arrest was a failure to obtain “permission” to give interviews to media organizations. Several weeks ago, Brown was told by his check-in officer that he needed to fill out permission forms before giving interviews. Since his release, Brown has given numerous interviews, on camera and by phone. But according to his mother, Brown said that the Bureau of Prisons never informed him about a paperwork requirement. When he followed up with his check-in officer, he was given a different form: a liability form for media entering prisons. Just last week, Brown was interviewed for two days by VICE, and his PBS interview was set for Friday. Leiderman said he had not been presented with a formal justification for the arrest but was told that it had “to do with failing to abide by BOP restrictions on interviews.”\n\nThat's both astounding and frightening at the same time, and seems like a fairly blatant kick in the face to the First Amendment. There appears to be no other reason for his arrest other than his speech in the form of conducting media interviews (often critical of criminal justice system). Nothing about this makes sense, other than out of pure vindictiveness. And, of course, if the idea was to shut him up about this, it seems quite likely to backfire massively. Not only will Brown continue to be able to talk about on this, but it's drawing much more attention to the issue from many others in the press, wondering what kind of world we live in when you can be arrested for agreeing to do media interviews.\n\nFiled Under: arrested, barrett brown, first amendment, free speech, giving interviews, media, press",

He knew he qualified. He had many more than one million dollars from his last few years as a top tier Presso VR gamer. His last three seasons had netted him over 21 million. It would merely be a matter of figuring out how to convert it to gold, and hide the fact from Morgan Gabrielle, his 'bride from hell', also acquired three seasons ago, during his 'mindfuck' period that followed his first big win during the Presso Pan-Planetary Games. So he had both the money and the motivation. Not grasping the effects of money, alcohol, and drugs at sustained levels, Brett had taken no precautions, waking up one morning wedded to his own personal torturer.\n\nThree years later, Brett found himself spending most of his time locked away exploring the dark web. In spite of the horror tales from his friends and entourage, it was something to do. He was wealthy beyond his capacity to grasp, or spend unless he took the batshit celebrity route, buying houses and islands, or supporting nations. So he spent most of his day tucked away in various cafes, lost in the anonymity of the general nerddom citizenry.\n\nMorgan Gabrielle seemed to neither care, nor notice his absence, as long as he was around in the evenings for their vid chats with 'her audience'. It had not occurred to Brett that he was a 'catch' of such a level to attract a vid personality intent on sucking her way into global vid celebrity status. She worked her enhanced lips, and re-textured tongue on Brett just as he was entering the mindfuck stage from his huge, underdog, win at the Pan-Planetary Games. The next time Brett sobered up, he discovered he was part of a global celebrity power couple in which he had no power.\n\nAnd, after three years of Morgan's husband engineering, Brett had no life.\n\nHe longed for the days of his youth, just those short three years ago. Simplicity, solitude, and freedom, long swept away by Morgan's 'broom of change', 'her audience', and her ever present entourage. She had cleaned him up, and set him on a path straight, and so narrow that Brett felt more regimented in his day than any of the robots tending the automated needs of his mansion, and grounds.\n\nIt had truly been hell for Brett until he invented the excuse of needing to train with the new games for the next Pan-Planetary Games. Morgan was supportive of that as she saw it increasing both her global cache, and 'her audience'.\n\nMany different cafes later, Brett was thinking that maybe, just maybe, he had found the way out. But how to contact the EscapeThisLife company? Searching for most of a month had revealed exactly squat for results. Yes, there were a few teasing hints of corporation banking accounts on a few of the blockchains, but nothing leading to any points of contact.\n\nBrett leaned back, looked around, shaking his head, and wiping at his eyes. He had been tunneled into his search for weeks. He felt the grit in his bones signaling, as in his playing days, too rigid a pose held longer than common sense should allow. The familiar sand-feeling in the muscles of his back told him he had been too deep in the quest too long. Quivering on the precipice of abandoning his quest, and returning home to Her, and the never ending Her Demands, Brett closed the laptop with a bang that startled even him.\n\n“NO!” he thought. “I won't quit!” The grit turned to cement and his thin biceps swelled slightly, his face flushing.\n\n“I want to escape my life!” Brett said to no one in particular, and for himself.\n\n“Don't we all sweetie” replied the coffee dispenser in his booth, “do you want another grande latte? A muffin with that perhaps?” it said in its best 'sales voice' that was installed in the overnight firmware update.\n\nThat's when he understood the meaning of gobsmacked! Pulling the laptop closer, he fidgeted while the browser loaded. Typing as fast as his fingers would fly, he was back to 'escapethislife.onion'. As soon as the page loaded, Brett knew he had it!\n\nPlease contact the EscapeThisLife corporation for further details should you qualify and wish to escape Your life.\n\nBrett flung the URL into the browser, 'escapeYourlife.onion'. Less than a millisecond later, his faced crashed into a blank page. Serious blankness showed on the screen. Examining the raw input for the page, he found nothing in the body, and only belatedly glanced at the header text where he found non displaying text; the words “whose life”.\n\n“I was right!” Brett thought as he replaced “Your” with “My” in the URL, 'escapeMYlife.onion'.\n\nThe sudden emergence of a live vid window on the laptop was as sharp as a slap across the face. But the face of the man on the screen saying “Ah, Mr. Brett Young”, and smiling before continuing with “We had been expecting you! So nice to finally see you!”\n\nThen a fleeting look of contrition swept across the face, “Oh! My apologies. Welcome to EscapeMyLife! How may we serve you?” he asked.\n\nAn hour, and several false starts later, Brett knew that this was the real deal. He was speaking with Trey Pinerou via, he was told, an 'inter-temporal quasi-link'. Trey as he had instructed Brett to call him, was speaking in 'real time' from 121.44 years in Brett's future.\n\n“...as though 'real time' means string when we are separated by over a century.” Trey had said. “The intricacies and technologies of the link are of far less importance than what they allow.” Trey continued, explaining to Brett that he, Trey, was living in what was clearly, from the perspective of all humans NOT there, a flat out, no damn denying it, Utopia.\n\nTrey explained that the Utopia of his time was pan-sysem wide, that there were dozens of planets from which to chose his residency, or simply go traveling as did a sizable portion of the population. The AI wars of the previous century, apparently just about to happen barely 20 years ahead of Brett, were over, with humanity the winner, with life-on-earth proceeding to get manifestingly gorgeous for all humans ever since. No pains, no body problems, universal access to replicators, med-beds, feelies, and drugs designed specifically for your DNA and mind state made the earth of Trey's time a very real paradise.\n\nHumans of Trey's time worked as they chose, and felt the need. Robots and AI doing all the menial tasks, humanity had blossomed. Most of the mental aberrations of previous ages were vanquished with personally tailored diets of adequate micro-nutrients. It was a glorious time in which to live.\n\nTrey was offering that to Brett. Trey's work consisted of being the face man for EscapeMyLife, Inc. He had said there were quite a few like him, scouring the past for talented humans to bring forward.\n\n“So how does this work?” Brett had asked.\n\n“Well, what we do is to ask a million dollar fee. Most of this is put into an account for your use here after your arrival. One hundred thousand is given to my clone, in your time, to pay for the costs of our operation there. The remainder will grow over the intervening years until your arrival, and will produce an income of spectacular size ensuring you, and any future children will have access to all the luxuries that life here can provide.” Trey said.\n\nBrett asked quizzically, “your clone?”\n\n“Yes... my clone. He will be exactly like me, in all respects, except that he will have three multicolored circle tattoos on the right side of the inside of his lower lip here where I do not. All clones are like that. It is a part of the process of making the clone. The markers are grown in place. ” Trey leaned forward, pulling his lip down, and putting more of it in view of the camera. “I, like you, was a recruit. It's the only way this can work. My clone was left behind to take care of business. That's why the money. Your clone will need instruction and monitoring. Don't forget that your clone will fill your shoes precisely, will have access to your property, but also will be taking on your responsibilities, and will need the occasional guidance from my clone. And it costs a lot to send someone through time...all that electricity is expensive your day.”\n\nIt all made sense to Brett.\n\nHe had decided, it occurred, the instant he had first seen the advert. He wanted to escape his life. The future sounded fantastic as did the supporting vids, which curiously were not able to be copied to his machine, but Trey explained that by the 'quasi-link' allowing communications through time. It seemed it would not do to have evidence of the future able to be passed around in his time. Temporally not allowed.\n\nThat did not matter to Brett. In just a few days, he and Trey had constructed a plan. Setting it in motion, Brett had obtained his payment by shifting coins around in a few wallets to provide the specific coin mix required for maximum increased valuation over time, and he was ready.\n\nPrimed to meet Trey's clone, Brett made his way to the 'secret location' specified. As promised, there was a hidden door in the deep back wall of a lower level parking structure. The door opened to a smiling Trey, offering a hand to help Brett across the threshold.\n\nAs expected, Brett found himself in a very well lighted room with lots of strange electronic gear, and in the middle of the non-occupied space, a medical theater as might be found in a teaching hospital. There were three nurses, and two men who looked authoritarian, presumably the doctor and 'temporal location specialist', as had been described to him. Excited, and trembling slightly, Brett allowed himself to be led over to the table, the hard-wallet taken from his willingly limp hand as he seated himself in the strange chair-bed that was the focus of the electronics and the room.\n\n“You can call my clone, Trey”, the Trey in the future had explained. “He is me, quite happily adjusted to his life of responsibilities in your time. As a matter of fact, he is frequently seen at the meetings, well, more like parties, that the clones have periodically. They call us FutureMe's. Not sure I like that much. But nothing I can do about it now, from here, 120 plus years away.”\n\n“Parties?” Brett had inquired.\n\n“Yes”,Trey responded, “you are not alone. We have brought many people from your period forward to become happy customers of EscapeMyLife, Inc. As part of the service we provide enrichment activities for the clones that are very well attended.” Leaning forward with his large smile, “my clone is happier in my life than I ever was! He says the parties are legend, going for days!”.\n\nBrett had asked Trey's clone, who obligingly pulled back his lower lip, revealing the three multicolored circle tattoos. As had the 'temporal medical staff' in the room. Brett relaxed back into the chair, excited for his new life, and feeling very content with his decision.\n\nAfter the necessary transfers of the coins to the accounts specified by Trey's clone, Brett was elevated in the chair as a variety of medical looking equipment was brought over his reclining body. Lights were increased, bustling of bodies, humming of electricity as devices were powered up. Shaking his hand, Trey's clone stepped back allowing the doctor to come forward with two small cups. One held a small blue tablet, the other some water.\n\nQuickly swallowing both, Brett sat with some intense concentration waiting for an effect that did not manifest. Then the doctor put a small mask over his nose and mouth, asked Brett to take a deep breath which was the last words that Brett heard before sliding easily into unconsciousness.\n\nTrey's clone moved swiftly bustling the others out of the room. He shut the heavy plated door, and turned on several large devices near the door. Arming a remote control, Trey's clone himself stepped through the door, drew it closed behind him, twisting the large locking mechanism. He put on goggles, as had the others, then they all turned away from the door, as Trey's clone pressed the activate button.\n\n“WHOOOSH” noise filled the room, moving the clothing on the clones, and dropping the temperature noticeably. There was the impression of giant amounts of blindingly white light even through the dark goggles, and it was over.\n\nTrey's clone and the others very rapidly took off the goggles, opened the door, and rushed back into the room.\n\n“We have less than an hour before he wakes,” Trey's clone said, “let's get this clone done.”.\n\nWithin minutes, Brett's lower lip was held in clamps attended to by the nurses, and the 'temporal location specialist' was in place with appropriate gear, tattooing three, multicolored circles on Brett's lower lip.\n\nWhen he woke, Brett was in the chair-bed, but the room was quiet, the attending staff was gone, and he was with Trey's clone alone.\n\nTrey handed Brett a mirror, and indicated he should look at his lower lip. Brett did so, and smiled, in spite of the slight pain that both actions produced.\n\n“So, I am the clone?” Brett asked Trey.\n\n“Yes, welcome to clone-dom”, Trey said, and then assisting the still woozy Brett up, he said, “hope to see you at our next party. I'll be sure to send you the invitation.” Trey walked Brett to the door.\n\n“But wait!” Brett said, “what'll I do now?”\n\n“What ever you wish!” Trey said, smiling, “It's your life now! You can manage it any way you desire. Change anything, change everything, and have fun doing it! As we clones say, they may be your responsibilities, but you are not responsible for them! It was him, that other bastard in the future who created all the problems of the life you now have!” Laughing, Trey guided Brett out the door and into the lower level parking area, and to his vehicle. “But you can deal with them any way YOU choose!”\n\nLowering him into the driver's seat, and activating the engine, Trey said once again, “It's your life now! Do with it as you will!”\n\n“Wait! How will I contact you?” Brett said as the door swung shut.\n\n“Don't worry...we'll be in touch!” Trey said, smiling, “another party in just a month! Come and tell us all about it!”\n\nThe door to the car shut, it slowly backed out, the bemused Brett at the controls, but allowing auto-drive to take him out of the garage. He was rubbing the sore area of his lip as he watched Trey's clone go back behind the hidden door while the car turned around and headed up.\n\n“Hmmm...” Brett thought, considering how to present himself at “his” house, and what to do with “his bitchy wife”. She did have those lips though, and that re-textured tongue....but still, he was the clone of someone famous, so Brett decided to punch in the codes to THAT club he had heard of. JUST the place to pick up some re-textured fans to take home. Morgan will shit cement, Brett thought with some satisfaction. “Too bad Brett had to miss this”, Brett thought, fingering his clone tatoo through his lip. But he could vid the whole scene, and send it to Brett-in-the-future when he next saw Trey's clone. Yes, that would be fine. Brett smiled. It was a whole new life, and, as a clone, it was his to reform! What was it that 'we clones' say, oh, yes, “responsibilities, but not responsible!” Brett was laughing for the first time in years as his car took the left from the garage toward the mid-town club district.\n\nTrey had watched Brett drive off from the view port next to the hidden door. “Another satisfied customer” he said to himself, wincing slightly as the glue for the thin plastic came loose from his inner lip, bringing with it the three multicolored circles. He carefully placed his prop back into its case, and putting that in his pocket next to the wallet, Trey beamed in satisfaction. The moving crew was due in minutes. Soon the room would be completely barren, an unused old storage space surprisingly clean, the equipment having been moved into various storage facilities miles away.\n\nTrey patted his pocket, reassuringly fingering the hard-wallet, and the nearly nine hundred thousand dollars it still contained after he had paid off the medical staff. A small few coins for the moving and storage bots, and he would be quite flush for a few weeks work.\n\n“Where to this time?”, thought the man pretending to be the clone of Trey, a man he was also pretending to be. “Australia? Good beaches, uncomplicated women.” The thought also brought up images of his grandfather with his terribly fake Australian accent. The man pretending to be Trey smiled at the memory. G'Dad would have loved these days. The marks are plentiful, and the Big Barn con had never been as profitable, nor as easy.\n\ntime talks share link use this link to share the time talks...\n\ntimetalks from days past...\n\nTweet\n\nFollow @clif_high for real time updates to data forecasts!",
  "latent_20202": "The Internet has brought an enormous mass of knowledge to the fingertips of everyone with a computer, smartphone or tablet. Never before have so many individuals been so close to true scientific facts about the world, from fun facts about animals to the latest crime statistics. Large communities with blogs, forums and social media groups have grown up around a wide variety of special interests and it has become a powerful tool for communication, cooperation and the advancement of human knowledge.\n\nHowever, this has also led to the creation of ideologically isolated Internet communities, where faulty claims and misunderstandings of statistics and empirical evidence gets repeated in an endless echo chamber and all refutations are either ignored, misrepresented or subjected to ideologically driven rejection, often with stale references to supposed “political correctness”, as if that was a statistically mature rebuttal.\n\nThis article will show that according to crime victim surveys, the actual rate of sex crimes has been more or less unchanged in Sweden between 2005 and 2014, despite the fact that immigration has increased during the same time period. Instead, the increasing rates of reported rapes are influenced by expansion of the legal rape definition, an increase in the tendency to report rapes, police efforts to classify each individual rape as a separate crime and their tendency to classify any sex crime that could potentially be rape as rape. It will also demonstrate that reported rates between countries such as Sweden and Denmark cannot be naively compared to do the large difference in legal rape definition and police registration methods.\n\nPrimer: how does crime statistics work?\n\nBefore we look at the data, here is a short primer on what crime statistics is and different ways to measure crime. This is crucial, since a lot of arguments that commonly occur in mainstream, alternative and social media are based on confusing these different measurements.\n\nWhen looking at crime statistics, there are two main sources of information:\n\n(1) Data from reported crimes : these kinds of datasets provide information about how many crimes of a certain type was reported to the police during a certain time period (such as a calendar year).\n\n(2) Data from crime victim surveys : these datasets come from surveys sent out to many thousands of people who ask them if they have been the victim of particular crimes during e. g. the past 12 months.\n\nThese may look similar, but they are in fact completely different and answer very different questions.\n\nReported crime rates are influenced by the real crime rates, propensity for reporting, trust in the criminal justice system, victim stigma, crime definitions and registration methods. This is a measurement of how many reports of a certain crime that comes in to the police, and thus a measure of the police investigation load.\n\nCrime victim surveys, on the other hand, attempt to measure how many individuals are the victim of a certain crime during each time period i.e. the actual crime rates . Since these are anonymous, is not done by the police and uses the same crime definitions over the years, it is not influenced by the confounders that reported crime rates are.\n\nTo make it crystal clear: reported crime rates is not the same as actual crime rates and changes in one does not need to be reflected in the other. In fact, they do not even have to correlate. This is because not all crime reports are true and not all crimes get reported to the police.\n\nIf you want information about actual rates, you have to look at crime victim surveys.\n\nThe Swedish Crime Survey show that sex crime incidence is unchanged since 2005\n\nThe Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (BRÅ) does a crime victim survey every year called The Swedish Crime Survey (“Nationella Trygghetsundersökningen”, abbreviated NTU). They send out surveys to a random and nationally representative sample of 20 000 people in Sweden and about 12 000 people respond (60% response rate). They survey asks people if they have been the victim of certain crimes and other questions related to crime and the criminal justice system. They started at 2005 and summary statistics was recently released for 2014.\n\nHere is BRÅ data from 2005-2014 for crimes against individuals, expressed in proportion of total population:\n\nRed is any kind of sex crime, blue is robberies, purple is any kind of physical assault, yellow is fraud, dark-cyan is any form of harassment and green is any kind of illegal threats.\n\nThe major result from this graph is that not a lot happens over time. Since 2005, most categories are roughly the same or slightly decreasing, although there is some random fluctuation from year to year.\n\nThe Swedish Crime Survey attempts to ask additional details about the seriousness of the sex crime in question by asking if the sex crime was accompanied by violence or threats of violence, if the victim was incapacitated by sleeping, alcohol or drugs and if the victim would label it as rape. However, because it cannot be generally expected that victims of sexual crimes fully understand legal definitions of rape, those estimates are more uncertain. The year-to-year variability in rapes is comparable to that of sex crimes generally.\n\nThis also means that the doomsday claims made in alternative media and Internet forums about an avalanche of rapes and sex crimes in the wake of immigration is empirically false. So how could so many political ideologues be so profoundly mistaken on this issue? It turns out that it is because they look solely on incidence of reported rapes and not actual incidence of rape.\n\nIf actual incidence of rape is unchanged, why are rape reports increasing?\n\nAnti-immigration activists often point out that the observed number of rape reports per year is increasing. This is true, but does not demonstrate that the actual incidence of rape is increasing. As we saw above, it is more or less constant over time (with some year-to-year fluctuations).\n\nSo what is going on? Well, the increase is caused by a couple of different factors:\n\n—> Changing definitions of rape : over the past 20 years, Sweden has broadened the definition of rape several times: actions that are comparable to rape (e. g. forced vaginal fisting) was classified as rape in 1998, sex with someone in a helpless state (e. g. sleeping or passed out due to alcohol or drugs) was classified as rape in 2005 and sex with someone in a particularly vulnerable situation (e. g. victim paralyzed with fear) was classified as rape in 2013. Since a higher proportion of sex crimes is classified as rape, the incidence of rape reports increases over time.\n\n—> Increased tendency to report sex crimes: a doubling of the proportion of sex crimes reported to the police occurred between 2005 (10%) to 2011 (20%) according to BRÅ, but this figure fluctuates a bit from year to year. This statistic may be influenced by increase in societal equality, more attention given to sex crimes, and increased trust in the criminal justice system by victims.\n\n—> Extensive registration efforts: Swedish police has made a stronger conscious effort at registering all potential rapes over time: “a lot of effort is made to register all cases that can be suspected to be rape. As this is done at a very early stage of the process, cases are included that later turn out to be some other sex crime, or even no crime at all.” (according to BRÅ).\n\netc.\n\nTogether, these factors increases the incidence of reported rapes. No one is claiming that any individual factor causes all of it and they are not post hoc rationalizations since crime victim survey data shows that the incidence of sex crimes is more or less constant since 2005.\n\nWhy naive comparison of incidence of rape reports between Sweden and Denmark is invalid\n\nWhen anti-immigration activists are faced with data from crime victim surveys that show that actual rates of sex crimes is more or less constant in Sweden from 2005, they rarely change their minds. Instead they either appeal to conspiracy theories about the government hiding statistics (even though it is freely available online), and if they are more sophisticated, they will try to make faulty comparisons with rape statistics from other countries, such as Denmark. However, this is not a valid comparison.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBRÅ emphasize the distinction between actual crimes and reported crimes:\n\nWithin established research about levels of crime and crime development, people are agreed that it is not possible to evaluate and compare the actual levels of violent crimes (such as rape) between countries by comparing the number of crimes reported to the police. This is because there are significant differences between the judicial systems of countries and systems for creating statistics showing crimes reported to the police.\n\nBRÅ goes on to cite a couple of reasons why a naive comparison between Sweden and other countries does not work:\n\nBroader definition and extensive registration\n\nFirstly, in Sweden there is a noticeably broad definition of what constitutes rape. This means that more acts in Sweden are regarded and registered as rape than in the majority of other countries. Secondly, in Sweden a lot of effort is made to register all cases that can be suspected to be rape. As this is done at a very early stage of the process, cases are included that later turn out to be some other sex crime, or even no crime at all. In addition to this, all individual acts are registered — not just the latest occasion or the main crime. In many other countries cases like these are filtered out and do not show up in the statistics.\n\nIn other words, Sweden has a much broader definition than other countries, police makes an effort to label sex crimes that they suspect are rapes and registers each rape as a separate event even when the perpetrator has raped a victim several times over a longer period of time (such as months or years).\n\nThis can be independently verified by comparing the number of rapes with the number of unique rape victims. For instance, the NTU 2013 report states that (my translation):\n\nOf the polled, 0.8% states that they were the victims of sexual crimes during 2012, which corresponds to about 62 000 persons in the population (aged 16-79). The proportion of sex crime victims has been relatively stable during the eight measurement dates (see table 3A). Just like when it comes to threats and assault, most people who were the victim of a sex crime during 2012 were exposed to a single event, but there is a smaller group that are repeatedly victimized. The number of events amount to an estimated 223 000.\n\nSo although there were 62 000 people exposed to sex crimes (not just rape, see above), there were 223 000 events, which highlights that the police reports single events separately.\n\nAnother way to independently confirm the statements made by BRÅ is to compare the legal rape definition between Sweden and Denmark.\n\nThe Swedish legal rape definition can be found in the 1§ of the 6th chapter of the Penal Code called Brottsbalk (1962:700) (my translation):\n\n6th chapter. About sex crimes 1 § The one who through assault or otherwise with violence or threat of criminal act forces a person to intercourse or to undertake another sexual act that with respect to the seriousness of the violation is comparable to intercourse is convicted for rape to prison for at least two years and at most six years. The same applies to the one who with a person completes an intercourse or a sexual act that is according to the first section comparable to intercourse by unduly taking advantage of the fact that the person due to being unconscious, being asleep, serious fear, intoxication or other drug influence, disease, bodily injury or psychiatric disorder or otherwise with regards to the context are in a particularly vulnerable situation. […]\n\nThe first paragraph continues for two more sections to discuss sentencing where the crime is considered less severe and more severe than normal, respectively.\n\nThe legal rape definition in Denmark can be found in the Criminal Code (“Straffeloven”) Chapter 26 Section 216 (Danish original):\n\n§ 216. For voldtægt straffes med fængsel indtil 8 år den, der 1) tiltvinger sig samleje ved vold eller trussel om vold eller 2) skaffer sig samleje ved anden ulovlig tvang, jf. § 260, eller med en person, der befinder sig i en tilstand eller situation, i hvilken den pågældende er ude af stand til at modsætte sig handlingen.\n\nThe first part of the definition is about violence or threat of violence (cf. Swedish definition above) and the second part relates to victims that are incapable of refusing the act due to e. g. sleeping or heavily intoxicated or under the strong influence of drugs.\n\nThus, the Swedish rape definition is much broader, encompassing sexual activities that are comparable to rape, individuals that cannot resist due to psychiatric disorder or are in a particularly vulnerable situation. In other words, many sex crimes that are classified as rape in Sweden are classified as a lesser sex crime in Denmark.\n\nSo when anti-immigration activists write stuff like:\n\nDanish legislation is not very different from Sweden’s, and there is no obvious reason why Danish women should be less inclined to report rape than their Swedish counterparts.\n\nWe can now easily understand why they are mistaken: Danish legal definition of rape is very different from the Swedish legal definition and the tendency to report rapes is an explanation for why rape reports are increasing in Sweden whereas crime victim surveys place sex crimes at more or less a constant rate since 2005 (not an explanation for between-country differences in the number of reported rapes).\n\nAdditional claims made by that source have been refuted here and here and several other articles on this website.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe moral of the story is that you should not get your information about crime statistics from shady blogs who make trivial statistical errors (like confusing reported and actual crimes) or Youtube videos. Instead, go to the original scientific papers or crime victim surveys, read them and understand the methodology, results, limitations and conclusions. There are no shortcuts to substantial knowledge.\n\nThe increasing rates of reported rape in Sweden is primarily caused by a repeated expansion of the rape definition, the fact that police is consciously reported all rapes as individual reports and an observed increase in the tendency to report rape. The differences between rates of reported rape between e. g. Sweden and Denmark is caused by differences in rape definition, differences in registration methods and efforts to rape all sex crimes that might be rape as rape.\n\nIn the end, it is doubly ironic that anti-immigration activists say that they refuse to read mainstream media because of its bias, yet (1) are strongly influenced by the increase in sensationalist coverage of violent crime by mainstream media and (2) are so willing to believe claims made by “alternative” media that are unsupported and often contradicted by actual crime victim survey results.\n\nFollow Debunking Denialism on Facebook or Twitter for new updates.",
  "latent_20269": "The Texas “bathroom bill” is anti-transgender legislation on steroids.\n\nIt’s not that Senate Bill 6, which cleared the state senate by a 21-10 vote this week at the urging of Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, is that much different from North Carolina’s notorious House Bill 2 or the other proposed “bathroom bills” that we’ve seen in other states.\n\nBut by virtue of its Lone Star state setting, SB6 is poised to have an outsized impact on a large slice of the American transgender population—one that is already coping with an archaic birth certificate policy that will only magnify the bill’s effects.\n\nAccording to the Williams Institute, an LGBT think tank based out of the UCLA School of Law, there are over 125,000 transgender adults in Texas, most of them black or Latino. North Carolina, for comparison, is home to about 45,000 transgender adults. The Texas total falls just shy of 9 percent of the 1.4 million transgender adults in the entire country. No other state besides California has a larger trans population.\n\nAnd if SB6 clears the state house—an uncertain possibility, given that Republican House Speaker Joe Straus has said he’s “not a fan of the bill”—those 125,000 transgender adults and thousands of transgender minors would be barred from using public restrooms unless they have successfully updated the gender markers on their birth certificates.\n\nThat’s where things get especially tricky for transgender Texans.\n\n“Getting your documents updated in the state of Texas is rather difficult,” Lou Weaver, Transgender Programs Coordinator for the LGBT advocacy group Equality Texas, told The Daily Beast.\n\n“Rather difficult,” in this case, is an understatement. The majority of U.S. states have written policies allowing transgender people to change the gender markers on their birth certificates with either a doctor’s letter specifying that they have had “appropriate clinical treatment” or proof of sex reassignment surgery, which not all transgender people want or can afford. About twice as many states require surgery as those that do not.\n\nBut the state of Texas goes a step further, requiring transgender people to obtain a court order—generally after surgery—to change the sex on their birth certificates.\n\nNot all judges are willing to provide such an order.\n\nAs the National Center for Transgender Equality notes, “current case law and evidence indicates that some Texas officials and judges are averse to issuing the necessary court orders.”\n\nTransgender people may have to travel to a different county to locate a court that will accommodate their request. And even when they people do find a willing judge, the process takes time.\n\n“It’s not like going to the local McDonald’s and ordering your Big Mac—it doesn’t just happen,” Weaver joked. “It’s an onerous project, it takes months, it’s not easy, and it costs money.”\n\nBy contrast, even a state like North Carolina will accept a notarized physician’s letter after surgery to update the sex field on a transgender person’s birth certificate. In California, the physician’s letter only requires “clinically appropriate treatment,” which may include hormones and therapy.\n\nIf SB6 passes, then, even transgender Texans who have undergone sex reassignment surgery—but who haven’t been able to go through the state’s circuitous process for updating their birth certificates—will be required to use public restrooms corresponding to the gender they were assigned at birth. And as SB6 moves one step closer to the governor’s desk, transgender people are already trying to get their documents in order.\n\n“We’re already having trans people scrambling here in Harris County,” said Weaver.\n\nThis problem will only be exacerbated for transgender minors who attend public schools. Here’s the catch: SB6 defines “biological sex” based on a birth certificate and also requires public school districts to restrict multiple-occupancy bathroom use by “biological sex.”\n\nBut medical guidelines for transgender minors stipulate that they should not receive the genital surgery that may be required for a birth certificate change in many states until the “legal age of majority.” The bill allows for—but does not require—school districts to make an alternative accommodation for trans students.\n\n(Most recently, we saw the results of a similar catch-22 when a transgender boy named Mack Beggs won a girls’ category in a Texas state wrestling championship because the athletics association restricted his participation based on his birth certificate, which still said “female.”)\n\nIn effect, many Texan transgender minors would be effectively banned from using bathrooms matching their gender under SB6 simply because they are not old enough to undergo the necessary medical care required to update their documents.\n\nEven more bizarrely—as the Texas Tribune detailed in its analysis of SB6—the bill would allow the attorney general’s office to collect penalties of up to $10,500 per violation from school districts that do not regulate bathroom use by birth certificate.\n\nThese penalties would be instituted even as state lawmakers in Texas are looking to increase the state’s school funding. As the Dallas Morning News reported, Texas ranked in the bottom third of states in terms of spending per student in 2016.\n\nSB6 would empower the attorney general’s office to investigate school districts that violate the law and to sue them to collect money for “a crime victims fund,” as the Texas Tribune reported, effectively taking money away from schools.\n\n“If this is really about protecting women from men who would go into the bathroom claiming to be trans, then why are we punishing the school?” Weaver asked. “We’re really punishing the school for allowing trans youth to go to school. It doesn’t make sense.”\n\nOf course, the Texas state legislature could decide that it’s not necessary to check birth certificates at the bathroom door. Any such requirement will require transgender people, depending on where they were born, to undergo costly and perhaps unwanted medical procedures to preserve their right to use the restroom.\n\nRecognizing the potential effects of SB6, the Texas Association of Business and major companies including Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, IBM, Microsoft, and PayPal have all urged the state to spike the bill.\n\nBut it’s up to the house to decide whether they want Texas to pass legislation that would easily overshadow North Carolina’s “bathroom bill” in its magnitude. Not everything has to be bigger in Texas.",
  "latent_20428": "This SPAM musubi recipe is an easy Hawaiian style snack that’s as simple as it is delicious. Perfect for snacking on the go!\n\nIf you’re looking for easy Hawaiian food, SPAM musubi can’t be beat. At its most basic you have just three ingredients: SPAM, rice and nori (or seaweed).\n\nBut the variations on SPAM musubi are endless; you can marinate the SPAM, add a scrambled egg, make them bite sized, or even substitute chicken or beef for the meat.\n\nAnd they’re AMAZING dipped in my Traditional Chinese Plum Sauce!\n\nBut my favorite thing about SPAM musubi is that you can make a big batch, individually wrap them and pop them in the freezer. Then they make a great afternoon snack, grab and go lunch or even breakfast!\n\nDISCOVERING HAWAIIAN STYLE SPAM MUSUBI\n\nI had my first SPAM musubi at a convenience store on my way to dawn patrol, which is a sunrise surf session. I was a seventh grader who’d been living in Hawaii for a year, and this was my first time surfing. I had a mixture of fear, excitement, and determination not to let the cute high school guys in our group think I was anything but gutsy.\n\nNone of us had eaten breakfast, due to the early hour, so we stopped by a 7-11 to grab some quick protein. The checkout counter had a tall heated glass case, filled with rows and rows of perfect plastic wrapped rectangles of rice and meat in a seaweed blanket.\n\nAn adventurous eater, I followed the example of the group without question and grabbed two SPAM musubi, for a total cost of $1.\n\nIn the van we dug hungrily into the steaming rice “sandwiches”, and I knew instantly that I had a new favorite snack.\n\nLEARNING TO MAKE SPAM MUSUBI\n\nIn Hawaii I never made my own musubi at home, because they were everywhere. You could get them cheaply at any convenience store alongside the manapua, bentos and somen salads. We also made them at school (in the science classrooms) and sold them as fundraisers. They were even available in the school snack bar!\n\nBut the year of high school I spent in Pennsylvannia, my sophomore year, there was not a single musubi in sight, so I decided to start making my own. I got a cheap musubi press (there are lots of musubi presses on Amazon) and began making several SPAM musubi at a time, keeping the musubi in the freezer for a quick microwave lunch or snack.\n\nThe first day I brought a SPAM musubi to school, my friends reacted rather strongly. “WHAT is THAT?!!!”\n\nI explained and offered them a taste. “Meat from CAN? No way!” So I happily ate them myself, secretly glad that I didn’t have to share.\n\nAfter a few weeks of bringing musubis to school regularly, I could see the feigned disgust change to intrigue, and sure enough, they began asking to try my “foreign food”. My musubi quickly became quite the lunchroom commodity, and soon I could trade them for pretty much anything I wanted.\n\nHOW TO MAKE SPAM MUSUBI\n\nMy go to method for SPAM musubi is an easy basic one, with a simple marinade to give that extra pop of flavor. Some people say you need to use sushi rice, but in Hawaii we also used regular rice, just cooking it to be sticky. Just use 1.5 parts water to 1 part rice. For example: 2 cups of uncooked rice with 3 cups of water.\n\nYou can cook your rice in a rice cooker or on the stove. I find it easiest to use a rice cooker, or the rice setting on the Instant Pot.\n\nOnce your rice and SPAM are cooked (yes, you’re actually suppose to COOK the SPAM!), it’s time to mold or press your musubi.\n\nI like to lay out the strip of nori (seaweed) and put the musubi mold on top of it. Then fill the mold 3/4 full with rice, that’s about two inches high with rice. Place your sliced SPAM on top and use the press to firmly press it down and compact the rice.\n\nThen you can remove the press and wrap your nori strips around the musubi. My press is a long one that makes two musubi, so I then cut it in half with a knife. You can also get single musubi presses, and divided musubi presses.\n\nSPAM MUSUBI SUPPLIES\n\nHere are some options for purchasing musubi supplies on Amazon. If you buy anything on Amazon using one of these links, we get a small commission without it costing you anything extra. Thanks for supporting our family business!\n\nHOW TO MAKE SPAM MUSUBI WITHOUT A MOLD\n\nIf you’d like to try your hand at making SPAM musubis, but don’t want to get a musubi mold yet, you can use the SPAM can to press your musubi.\n\nJust open both ends of the can and use it as your mold, pressing the rice down with the piece of SPAM you’re using. Be careful not to cut yourself on the edge of the can! You can use a spoon to press on top of the slice of SPAM to avoid getting your fingers near those edges.\n\nHave you ever had SPAM musubi? Have you ever had SPAM? Let us know in the comments!\n\nPIN TO SAVE THIS SPAM MUSUBI RECIPE FOR LATER:\n\n5 from 3 votes Print SPAM Musubi Recipe Prep Time 10 mins Cook Time 10 mins Total Time 20 mins This SPAM musubi recipe is an easy Hawaiian style snack that's as simple as it is delicious. Perfect for snacking on the go! If you don't have a musubi press, open both ends of the can and carefully use it to shape and press your rice. Cook time does not include cooking the rice.\n\nCourse: Snack Servings : 12 Calories : 280 kcal Author : Diana Johnson Ingredients 1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari\n\n1/4 cup rice vinegar\n\n2 tablespoons honey sugar, or sweetener of your choice\n\n12 slices SPAM\n\n3-5 sheets nori or seaweed 10-12 inch squares\n\n2-3 cups sticky rice hot or room temperature Instructions Whisk together soy sauce, rice vinegar and sugar or honey to make your marinade. Place SPAM slices in a single layer in a shallow dish and pour marinade over the top. Let sit at least 15 minutes (this is a great time to cook your rice!). Remove SPAM from marinade and fry in a single layer in a pan on high heat. Lightly brown the SPAM, 2-3 minutes on each side. Cut your nori sheets into 2 1/2 - 3 inch wide strips. Place a strip (or two depending on the size of your mold) under your musubi mold. Fill mold with about three inches of rice. Use the press to compact it in the mold. Place one to two slices of SPAM on top of the compacted rice (again depending on your mold). Place the press firmly on top of the SPAM and carefully slide your mold up and off of the musubis. Fold the strips of nori up and over the rice and spam, moistening the ends with a little water to seal. If making two musubi in one mold, use a sharp, wet knife to slice the rice in the middle to form two separate musubi. You can eat the musubi immediately, or wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze to eat later. To heat from frozen, keep wrapped and microwave for 30-45 seconds. Recipe Notes Approximate cost/serving: I try to buy SPAM on sale because it just costs more on the mainland than it did in Hawaii. Costco is usually the best deal. I get all my Asian ingredients at an Asian grocery store. This ends up costing me about $3 for 10 so around 30 cents each. Gluten free: Make sure that your nori only contains salt, oil and seaweed. Any flavored ones can contain gluten. Also use gluten free soy sauce or tamari Nutrition Facts SPAM Musubi Recipe Amount Per Serving Calories 280 Calories from Fat 72 % Daily Value* Total Fat 8g 12% Saturated Fat 3g 15% Cholesterol 21mg 7% Sodium 697mg 29% Potassium 168mg 5% Total Carbohydrates 42g 14% Dietary Fiber 1g 4% Sugars 2g Protein 7g 14% Vitamin A 0.7% Vitamin C 0.3% Calcium 0.6% Iron 5.8% * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet.\n\nLOVE THE SPAM MUSUBI AND WANT MORE SPAM RECIPES?\n\nWe'd love to keep in touch.

  "latent_20552": "Share This Video Facebook Twitter EMAIL\n\nMartin Freeman, who most recently popped up in a low-key government bureaucrat role in Captain America: Civil War, is now probably wishing the Avengers were in every movie he does. The Hobbit and Fargo actor is set to star in Cargo, a thriller adapted from an Australian short film that has been receiving critical raves and worldwide studio interest from Cannes to Canada. Based on the plot synopsis provided by Empire,\n\n[It stars] Freeman as a father who is stranded in Australia in the aftermath of a violent pandemic and is desperately seeking a home for his most previous cargo – his infant daughter.\n\nAs if the situation couldn’t get any worse for Freeman’s character, he will also be preoccupied trying to resist turning into a zombie himself after being bitten by his wife. Or, ex-wife at this point. We can only assume that if the previous love of your life turns into a zombie and then bites you a breakup is pretty much a foregone conclusion. Between the popularity of The Walking Dead and movies such as World War Z, pop culture is just about fully saturated with zombie stories right now.\n\nHowever, this sounds like a more focused and introspective story on what zombie outbreaks can do to one person instead of an entire society. Who knows, maybe this will inspire Series 4 of Sherlock to incorporate some creepy undead beings as well. Besides Moriarty, of course.\n\n(via Empire)",
  "latent_20557": "Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) speaks during a news conference on Oct. 18, 2011 in Washington, D.C.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images.\n\nIn a time of legislative gridlock, the Stop Online Piracy Act looked like a rare bipartisan breakthrough. The bill, known as SOPA, promised a brave new Internet—one cleansed of “rogue websites” that hawk pirated songs and movies as well as counterfeit goods. For Congress, the legislation’s goals amounted to a can’t-lose trifecta: uphold justice, protect legitimate businesses (and jobs!), and make the Web safer for law-abiding consumers. Who could be against that?\n\nA lonely few, at first. When the legislation was introduced in the House last month by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), a smattering of civil libertarians and techno-wonks quickly raised objections. They were drowned out, though, by a cadre of influential backers: movie studios, record labels, pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and even the national police and firefighters unions. After the bill hit the House on Oct. 26, members of both parties broke out their co-sponsorship pens. By the time it reached committee, two dozen representatives had signed on, from dyed-in-blue Democrats like Florida’s Debbie Wasserman Schultz to security-hawk Republicans like Peter King of New York. A similar (though less sweeping) bill, the PROTECT IP Act, racked up some 40 co-sponsors in the Senate, prompting the record industry to boast that it was among the most popular bipartisan bills of the year.\n\nBut something happened on the way to easy passage and the flourish of the president’s signature: The Internet fought back. The groundswell started with open-Internet stalwarts like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology. As they have before, the non-profits picked apart the bill’s perceived oversights and omissions. This time, though, their message—that the law would fundamentally damage the Internet’s culture of openness—resonated loudly outside the world of tech wonkdom.\n\nIn theory, SOPA enlists Internet service providers and advertising networks to filter out the “worst of the worst” sites, most of them based offshore. EFF and its cohorts argue, however, that there is little protection for legitimate sites that might get swept up along with the rogues. Worse, the law appears to disregard some of the “safe harbor” provisions established in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which has protected sites such as YouTube as long as they take down copyrighted content upon request. SOPA targets any sites that “enable or facilitate” copyright infringement, a sweeping category that could be interpreted to include YouTube, Flickr, WikiLeaks, or even Google. Opponents have said the bill would result in a government-curated “Internet blacklist” or “great firewall of America.” Various provisions have also provoked concern over domain name security and privacy. Critics are predicting lawsuits galore.\n\nAs these critiques began to mount, the open-Internet groups were joined by a growing coalition of SOPA haters. Popular websites with an open-source orientation, like Mozilla and Wikimedia, helped launch an “American Censorship Day” campaign to encourage Internet folk to get involved, and liberty-loving media outlets like BoingBoing symbolically censored their own homepages to draw attention to the bill. Most significantly, the big Silicon Valley tech firms waded in. Google, Facebook, AOL, eBay and others took out a full-page New York Times ad arguing that the bill would stifle innovation. At the same time, anti-SOPA fury took hold on social media, spread in part by the Twitter hashtag #DontBreakTheInternet. Social media platforms such as Tumblr prompted users to call their representatives in Washington. In one day, 87,000 people did.\n\nSuddenly the bill had opponents in Congress. As of October, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, both Democrats, were among the only ones on record opposing it. But by Thanksgiving, representatives from libertarian-leaning Ron Paul to Tea Party Republican (and Obama scourge) Darrell Issa to House minority leader Nancy Pelosi had adopted anti-SOPA stands. “Need to find a better solution than SOPA,” Pelosi tweeted, adding the #DontBreakTheInternet hashtag.\n\nCampaigns to save the Internet from nefarious legislation aren’t anything new. In the 1990s, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Communications Decency Act, an anti-Internet porn bill, both sparked opposition. But the tools of dissent were more limited back then—websites could post blue ribbons advocating “free speech online,” but their users couldn’t mobilize and spread the word on Twitter or Facebook. More recently, a push for the FCC to adopt net neutrality laws inspired some online activism but didn’t arouse nearly as much passion. Perhaps that’s because it didn’t run afoul of the “cute cat” maxim—the idea that people will rebel against any regulation that might prevent them from sharing cat pictures. SOPA, some fear, could do just that.\n\nWhat should we call this ad hoc association of Silicon Valley businesses, venture capitalists, law professors, civil libertarians, and avid Internet users? Julian Sanchez of the Cato Institute told me he’d brand it a “populist technocratic coalition,” which is somehow both oxymoronic and apt. Leslie Harris, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, says it calls to mind the old buzzword Netizens. My preferred term: the geek lobby.\n\nJust because the geek lobby has awoken doesn’t mean it will win. Rep. Smith, undeterred by the backlash, has scheduled his bill for markup by the House Judiciary Committee on Dec. 15, and he still has plenty of support. The anti-SOPA coalition may have found its voice on the web, but at the last hearing, on Nov. 16, Smith called five witnesses in favor of the bill while allowing just one opponent to speak. The opponent was a representative of Google, which has significantly boosted its spending on lobbying of late.\n\nWhile Silicon Valley is just learning to play the lobbying game, its foes in Hollywood are old pros. Southern California’s favorite industry outspends Northern California’s by a ratio of 10 to 1. That’s because the entertainment industry has always depended on Washington’s enforcement of copyright laws. The Internet companies are just beginning to realize the extent to which they, too, are at lawmakers’ mercy.\n\nRep. Lofgren, who represents part of Silicon Valley, told me that her constituents have already made a couple of minor rookie mistakes in their anti-SOPA campaigning. The flood of calls to Congress came as many members were looking ahead to the Thanksgiving recess, and many went to district offices rather than offices in the Capitol. For all the fury on Facebook and Twitter, Lofgren says, the backlash against SOPA has registered as “a blip” in Congress so far. “Eighty-seven thousand (phone calls), that’s a start,” she says. “But remember when President Bush was pushing for immigration reform in the Senate? The anti-immigration people melted the system with the number of calls. That killed immigration reform” for years afterward, she explained. That could still happen with SOPA, she says, but it hasn’t yet.\n\nHow the fight in Congress plays out will reveal how far the geek lobby has come—and perhaps, how far it still has to go to establish itself as a defender of the values the Internet was built on. “This is a seminal moment,” says Leslie Harris. “I think when we look back in a couple of years we’ll see that this really cemented a way of defending the net on the policy side that’s transformative.” Meanwhile, some tech wonks, such as Jonathan Zittrain of Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society, say the bill as written is so extreme that it looks more like an opening bid in a negotiation than anything that could plausibly gain passage. But if the anti-SOPA campaign doesn’t keep up the pressure, it just might become the law of the land.",
  "latent_20572": "FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-17:01.openssh\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA512 ============================================================================= FreeBSD-SA-17:01.openssh Security Advisory The FreeBSD Project Topic: OpenSSH multiple vulnerabilities Category: contrib Module: OpenSSH Announced: 2017-01-11 Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD. Corrected: 2017-01-11 05:56:40 UTC (stable/11, 11.0-STABLE) 2017-01-11 06:01:23 UTC (releng/11.0, 11.0-RELEASE-p7) 2017-01-11 05:56:40 UTC (stable/10, 10.3-STABLE) 2017-01-11 06:01:23 UTC (releng/10.3, 10.3-RELEASE-p16) CVE Name: CVE-2016-10009, CVE-2016-10010 For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>. I. Background OpenSSH is an implementation of the SSH protocol suite, providing an encrypted and authenticated transport for a variety of services, including remote shell access. OpenSSH supports accessing keys provided by a PKCS#11 token. II. Problem Description The ssh-agent(1) agent supports loading a PKCS#11 module from outside a trusted whitelist. An attacker can request loading of a PKCS#11 module across forwarded agent-socket. [CVE-2016-10009] When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix domain sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root' instead of the authenticated user. [CVE-2016-10010] III. Impact A remote attacker who have control of a forwarded agent-socket on a remote system and have the ability to write files on the system running ssh-agent(1) agent can run arbitrary code under the same user credential. Because the attacker must already have some control on both systems, it is relatively hard to exploit this vulnerability in a practical attack. [CVE-2016-10009] When privilege separation is disabled (on FreeBSD, privilege separation is enabled by default and has to be explicitly disabled), an authenticated attacker can potentially gain root privileges on systems running OpenSSH server. [CVE-2016-10010] IV. Workaround Systems not running ssh-agent(1) and sshd(8) services are not affected. System administrators may remove ssh-agent(1) to mitigate CVE-2016-10009. System administrators should enable privilege separation when running OpenSSH server, which is the FreeBSD default, to mitigate CVE-2016-10010. V. Solution Perform one of the following: 1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date. Kill all running ssh-agent(1) process and restart sshd(8) service. A reboot is recommended but not required. 2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch: Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility: # freebsd-update fetch # freebsd-update install Kill all running ssh-agent(1) process and restart sshd(8) service. A reboot is recommended but not required. 3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch: The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable FreeBSD release branches. a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility. # fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:01/openssh.patch # fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:01/openssh.patch.asc # gpg --verify openssh.patch.asc b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root: # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>. Kill all running ssh-agent(1) process and restart sshd(8) service. A reboot is recommended but not required. VI. Correction details The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each affected branch. Branch/path Revision - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- stable/10/ r311915 releng/10.3/ r311916 stable/11/ r311915 releng/11.0/ r311916 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a machine with Subversion installed: # svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number: <URL:https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=NNNNNN> VII.

  "latent_20622": "PHILADELPHIA, PA--(Marketwired - July 22, 2016) - Clinton Cash, the documentary based on the Peter Schweizer book that the New York Times hailed as, \"… the most anticipated and feared book of a presidential cycle,\" will air on Breitbart.com at 8PM ET on Saturday and at 2PM and 8PM ET on Sunday (July 23-24). The film is scheduled to set the tone for the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, PA (July 25-28).\n\nBreitbart.com is offering complimentary online access to the film with an email sign-up.\n\nThe film, which MSNBC says is \"devastating\" and \"powerfully connects the dots,\" reveals how Bill and Hillary Clinton went from being \"dead broke\" after leaving the White House, to amassing a net worth of over $150 million, with $2 billion in donations to their foundation. This wealth was accumulated during Mrs. Clinton's tenure as Sec. of State, through lucrative speaking fees and contracts paid for by foreign companies and Clinton Foundation donors.\n\nThe film's screening on Breitbart, which is the #41 media website in the world, could spell trouble for Democrats heading into their party's convention. The Guardian says it's \"…a powerful message, one that is clearly designed to stir up trouble at the convention at just the moment when Clinton should be reveling in her victory in the Democratic race.\" Time Magazine calls it \"a scathing broadside aimed at persuading liberals [and] is likely to leave on-the-fence Clinton supporters who see it feeling more unsure about casting a vote for her.\" The Fiscal Times warns that the documentary is a \"weapon that could knock Clinton out.\" And CNN's Michael Smerconish says Clinton Cash is shaping up to become the political \"playbook for the fall campaign.\" The Daily Mail heralds the film as a \"blistering indictment\" of how the Clintons got rich from corruption.\n\nThe book, Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich (published May 2015 by HarperCollins), dominated headlines for months as the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and others confirmed the book's investigative assertions regarding foreign donors and companies funneling tens of millions of dollars to Hillary and Bill Clinton.

Jeffrey D.

  "latent_20673": "Harry Truman became president after Franklin D. Roosevelt died just a few months into his fourth term. The 33rd man to come into the presidency soon learned about a stunningly powerful new weapon, proclaimed V-E Day on his birthday, and inherited a load of real estate problems — the White House was literally falling apart in 1945. For the New York Times, Michael Beschloss writes:\n\nOne day, while President Harry S. Truman took a bath upstairs, a great Blue Room chandelier threatened to crash down on his wife, Bess, and her guests from the Daughters of the American Revolution. The president later joked that he might have unexpectedly dropped through the ceiling naked on the ladies below, and he confessed that the incident made him nervous. The upstairs floor, he noted, “sagged and moved like a ship at sea.”\n\nThe next year, his daughter Margaret’s piano fell through the floor in the room today known as the Private Dining Room. The White House Museum’ website explains:\n\nEngineers did a thorough examination and found plaster in a corner of the East Room sagging as much as 18 inches. Wooden beams had been weakened by cutting and drilling for plumbing and wiring over 150 years, and the addition of the steel roof and full third floor in 1927 added weight the building could no longer handle. They declared the whole house to be in imminent danger of collapse.\n\nIt would have been cheaper to destroy the White House and build something sounder, perhaps even in a larger tract of land, writes Beschloss for The Times. But Truman felt strongly about what should be done:\n\nAs one of the most voracious readers of history ever to serve as president, Truman recoiled from that prospect. He also felt that witnessing the old White House being torn to the ground would wound Americans’ psyches. He instead approved a plan to shore up the outer walls, tear out everything inside and install a new internal steel superstructure (“of skyscraper strength,” The Washington Evening Star said) above a large new, poured-concrete basement. (The basement included a shelter from nuclear attack, where President George W. Bush was taken on the evening of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.)\n\nAnd so the entire interior was gutted, leaving the oldest section a mere shell with two modern wings attached. Concrete and steel beams replaced wooden joists.\n\nHowever, given the costs and chaos of the project some historical artifacts were sold or lost. After Truman’s renovation, the White House was stable, but rather empty of historical decoration. When Jacqueline Kennedy moved in, she saw the need for a detailed restoration of the interior.\n\nToday, presidential families usually add their own touches to the mansion, though nods to history are maintained. Yet despite Jackie’s careful effort, some out of the way spaces still show the touch of Truman’s work. Beschloss writes:\n\nFor example, adjoining the second-floor Treaty Room — which presidents from George H. W. Bush through Barack Obama have used as a home office — is a small, brightly lighted bathroom with exposed plumbing and a green-and-white checkerboard tile floor that looks as if it belonged to a 1952 hotel.\n\n​The Truman Library has hundreds of photos of the restoration. Here are a few:",

  "latent_21243": "BACKSTAGE\n\nQuote:\n\nBACKSTAGE\n\nArchitect\n\nJeweler\n\nChiffonier\n\nBarman\n\nMilliner\n\nMerchant\n\nDirector\n\nKit Marlowe\n\nAfter the presentation of the new cast , it's finally time to reveal backstage. This new system is the heart of this expansion with 32 cards comprised of 12 new characters who gravitate around the world of theater and offer their services promptly (or more sustainably). To create these characters, we did not want to invalidate the rules we created for Shakespeare, so we identified characters that seemed to complete the game and left the name off the character for you to imagine his power. Before presenting these characters, I'll explain the new system.Note : graphics and iconography are in progress , so anything you see here is not final.When the game starts, the 32 backstage cards are shuffled and then placed just like the Character cards are (that is to say 6 cards for 4 players, 5 cards for three players and 4 cards for 1 or 2 players). These characters can be used on days 1-6 and will be replaced during the maintenance phase..Phase 1 (Wager): Players bet normally. However, instead of putting aside non wagered cylinders, they place them on the deck of backstage cards. So a player who bets three, places their two remaining cylinders on backstage and a five cylinder bettor can't place anything on backstage..Phase 2 (recruitment & activation): in addition to the two normal actions (recruit or activate), a player can also use the backstage action. For that it takes one or more cylinders placed on the deck of backstage cards. The player then places them on an available (unused) character of his choice. It applies the effect of the character and his action is over..Recruiting card: in the expansion, Recruitment has two uses. The first is the same as in the basic game; recruit a character card. The second is related to backstage; the player can use its recruitment card as a \"virtual\" cylinder backstage. This virtual cylinder can be used alone (to gain the effect of a character requiring one cylinder) or together with the cylinders that the player has placed on the deck of Backstage cards. If he uses his card Recruitment this way, the player will obviously perform no recruitment during this day.In essences, that's all! But obviously, this simple system will complicate the decisions of many players in the first two phases.The Backstage cards have quite different effects. To tie in with the actors presented previously, we'll first talk about the characters that interact with the actors.This high ranking noble is a lover of the arts and artists. He will help you financially just as long as you hire one of his \"actors\" for the troupe. In the expansion, using only 13 of the 22 actor cards. The remaining 9 cards are placed next to the central board, the first card being visible . For a cylinder, Lord Chamberlain offers 2 pounds and allows you to recruit the first actor of the deck. For 2 cylinders it offers you again two pounds and allows you to search the deck and take the actor of your choice. Of course, this card can not be transformed into an extra.Lord Chamberlain therefore offers more economical recruitment opportunities that may be coupled with the standard recruitment for faster development.The understudy, as its name suggests, allows you to use a double to temporarily replace an actor. Besides, there are some similarities with Iago, right? The player who uses the understudy can therefore activate one of his players instantly without using a cylinder. This can even be done on an actor at rest or already activated earlier in the day. The number of cylinders necessary to enable the understudy depends on the price of the actor being doubled: 1 cylinder for a one coin actor , two cylinders for a 3 coin actor and 3 cylinders for a 5 coin actor.I think it is unnecessary to emphasize the potential of the understudy, but it combines well with all types of actors and allows players to rush a strategy. It should be noted nonetheless that it only works with actors not crafts people (which makes sense).Our third character this week is special, since it shows the iconography of the \"non-actors\". Indeed, unlike most cards Backstage (which it is part of), the prompter can be recruited. The player who places a cylinder on the card then immediately has it added to their crew. The prompter at end of the game does not cost anything and it of course goes toward the \"non-actor\" objective. The prompter is not activated, but it has a special power that is used during dress rehearsals: If a player is still in the \"-1\" zone (the first 3 boxes) on one or more acts, he can pay 1 pound per each of those acts to not lose a point.The prompter will therefore enable the development of strategies that include very little repetition or allow you to completely ignore an act. Under his modest air, it will therefore push Shakespeare in new directions, which is the goal that we set initially.You may remember that I spoke of personal Theatre cards for each player? The function of the architect is to beautify players' theaters. When a player uses the architect, the player takes one of the decorative elements available (the color depends on the number of cylinders the player uses) and places it on the lowest available space on the theater card. He applies the power (depending on color) and possibly scores a point if it overlaps a candle. So far it works much like normal set building. But the small difference is that if the player then uses another architect, he applies the power of this new element in addition to all the powers of the previously installed elements.This obviously opens many strategic possibilities, either to earn money, to undermine the atmosphere of the other players, to improve their own atmosphere, earn a \"+3\" token, or a mixture of all them! Obviously you will fight to get architects because even though there are many in the expansion (6) they will likely be a source of envy.The jeweler, you know, so there is no need to make an introduction. However, the presence of a jeweler backstage is not insignificant, since it will help players who do not have jewelers compete for gold or it will allow a jeweler in your crew to rest a round by using the backstage jeweler instead.With this card, gold is no longer only available to a select few, which could give them a cold sweat!The Chiffonier (ragman) is a bit special, since he shows the iconography of the \"non-actors\" (much like the Prompter). Indeed, unlike most cards Backstage, the Chiffonier can be recruited. The player who places a cylinder on the card then immediately adds the Chiffonier to his crew. The Chiffonier costs 1 coin at the end of the game and counts toward the \"non-actor\" objective. The Chiffonier is not activated but he allows handymen to use discarded elements from previous rounds and more of the available elements. Also note that there are two other scavenger models (which work with decorators and costume designers).The Chiffonier is going to give a lot of freedom to its owner, allowing him to take elements that are impossible to reach for other players. It is a source of potential problems as with his power he can reintroduce purple set pieces discarded in past rounds and therefore make the fight for ambience even more complicated!The barman is a small break of \"sweetness.\" He lightens the mood of the troupe. This is a power that no doubt would seem normal in the environment of Shakespeare but makes even more sense now that you know the powers of the Chiffonier and the architect. His power, even at the lowest level will give breathing room to players who cannot rely on Falstaff or on blue decorations that turn. And the times where ambience is not a problem, it helps you to get a point from ambience (an often neglected strategy).The milliner's a little like the architect but for costumes. However, the milliner operates on a completely different mechanic. It allows you to spend a cylinder to take a costume element of your choice (everything except gold) and you can spend three cylinders to buy two costume elements. These elements, as indicated by the profession of the girl, are not intended for normal use. They are indeed placed above the first costume slot on the left. This \"hat\" will not count toward the costume value of the character but in the final round, we will count all the hats: if the total of the hat and the costume element it overlooks is 6 exactly then the player scores a victory point for that hat.The milliner is both a source of alternative and lucrative points. Moreover, it \"plunders\" the costume pieces freely and thus poses a lot of problems for costume designers!The merchant power is quite simple: it allows the player to take elements (costumes here but there is another card for scenery) out from under the nose and beard of costume designers. It is a relatively rare card in the backstage deck but for those who need to retrieve an element that goes well at a selected time, and don't have a craftsmen to spare, the merchant is not to be neglected.The director, as might be expected, is there to make sure that the play advances! His power will therefore allow for an unbet cylinder to ask a rest token to sit out during the next rest phase. You really struggle between who to rest, the author or your favorite designer? When the director is there it becomes possible to have them both! The only problem is that everyone wants the director! Remember that if you bet five cylinders it is still possible to use the recruitment card as a \"virtual\" cylinder. If you activate the director (and five cylinders), you would only have to place 3 rest tokens at the end of the round instead of four. What a fresh start!In films devoted to Shakespeare, Marlowe is often the friend and adviser of young William. Even if there is no evidence that the two authors were friends. Marlowe was a famous author and recognized in London while Shakespeare was writing (again, the two men were the same age). We decided to use this friendship so now Marlowe can slip some ideas to Shakespeare when he is backstage. This is a good way to earn some feathers to get you out of the penalty area on the act tracks or give you the little boost needed before rehearsals.",

  "latent_21654": "The Atascosa Ranch is walking distance from the US/Mexico border, just outside of Nogales, Arizona. It’s owned by Dave Lowell, an affable 84-year-old man who’s spent the past 75+ years hunting for buried treasure. Today, he’s known as the most successful mining explorationist of the past century, having discovered an unprecedented seventeen ore bodies, including the world’s largest copper mine. Last week, Lowell and his wife, Edith, invited us to Atascosa for lunch. We brought our cameras and sound equipment, and recorded a conversation with one of mining’s greatest outliers of all time.\n\nJ. David Lowell was born February 28, 1928, to a modest family, not too far from Atascosa (the ranch belonged to his uncle at the time). Lowell was first exposed to mining at age 7, when his father, a mining engineer, put him to work. When Lowell pursued his college education at Arizona and then Stanford, he concurrently worked at mines and on exploration programs. Not too long after he had completed his degrees, Lowell had become one of the foremost experts on copper deposits.\n\nLowell is probably best known today for co-authoring the Lowell-Guilbert Model, a guide to large, low-grade porphyry copper deposits published in 1970. Throughout most of his career, Lowell used the model to locate some of the most profitable mineral finds in the history of mining, such as the 1981 discovery of the Escondida deposit in Chile. Containing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of ore, Lowell and his colleagues found it at the cost of a mere $2.5 million.\n\nOver lunch of elk tacos and Meixcan fried beans, Lowell was modest about his success. But he offered a theory as to why major mining companies don’t make discoveries as efficiently as prospectors like Lowell. Major mining companies have a “don’t make mistakes” approach, which “doesn’t fit at all with the profile of the mad scientist who discovers mines,” he said. “When something like one in five hundred good-looking targets will become a mine, a successful explorationist needs permission to be wrong four hundred and ninety-nine times.” Here he paused. “If there’s anything my career says about me, it’s that I’m very good at being wrong.”\n\nDespite being a pro about being wrong, Lowell does admit to limitations. Having “no taste for shareholder relations,” he recalled giving a presentation to investors in 1995 that resulted in the share price of one of his companies falling from $35 to $15 during the time it took him to finish his talk. The shares recovered shortly thereafter.\n\nOn the changing impact of technology on mineral exploration over the span of his lifetime, Lowell holds that it’s been “very little.” He believes that “geophysics has been very oversold,” instead favoring “drill holes and geochemistry… The best guide to ore is ore.” Lowell also voiced doubts that technology would be able to revolutionize mineral exploration the way 2D and 3D Seismic has for the oil and gas business, at least in the near future.\n\nThe commodities super-cycle is in tact, Lowell believes. There’s elasticity in mining companies’ profit margins, he told us, but not in the demand for the underlying commodities they produce. For that reason, large, undeveloped, low grade copper deposits will need to be put into production, sooner than later.\n\nWhen asked about his favourite jurisdictions for exploration currently, he told us he favors Chile, Peru, New Guinea, Mongolia, Nevada, and some parts of Africa. But he qualified his dispositions by recalling that attractive jurisdictions are constantly changing. “Places like Arizona were very attractive as a place to explore for copper deposits, and now Arizona is about as bad as Venezuela,” he chuckled.\n\nWhen we moved on to the role luck has played in his career, Lowell avoided answering directly. Instead he responded that “minefinders who make one discovery are much more likely to find another.” His basic philosophy is that of persistence, and it shows — his career is equally productive after retirement age as it was before.\n\nAt age eighty-four, Lowell is not slowing down. With financiers Dave De Witt and Marcel De Groot of Pathway Capital (“as efficient, honest and reliable as partners get”), Lowell is developing several projects, including a titanium-iron deposit in Paraguay, which he believes is the largest of its kind in the world. Other active projects are under wraps for now, as to avoid competition. Investors who rode his Arequipa Resources shares from .20 to $30.00 in 1995 will surely be watching Lowell’s upcoming public ventures. An autobiography is also in the works.\n\nIt was an honor to spend time with Dave at his ranch, and we’re pleased to share some video, pictures, and sounds of the day. We hope you enjoy the following short film about the greatest outlier and maverick the mining industry has known in recent memory, J. David Lowell.",
  "latent_21702": "Putting all that aside, if you like politics— if you like America, dammit—it'll be tremendously fun to watch for several reasons.\n\nFor starters, it's going to be awkward. Christie and Booker are friends, as close as two politicians with identical aspirations can be. They don’t attack each other, they text all the time, and they shot an amusing parody video together. Over the summer they cut away from a party at the gubernatorial Jersey Shore house and took a stroll on the beach, just the two of them. They're even Facebook friends, having sat on Oprah Winfrey's couch last year and collected a $100 million investment from Mark Zuckerberg for Newark's schools. From education reform to a property tax cap, they have supported each other in a bipartisan way that is unfathomable in the nation’s capital.\n\nSecond, this will be Campaign 2.0. They may love a good TV interview, but Booker and Christie have drawn much of their popularity by circumventing traditional news and developing their own social-media channels for disseminating information. Booker has the second-most Twitter followers of any politician who hasn’t run for president and he recently cofounded a video-based social media company called Waywire. Christie, meanwhile, has amassed an online following from countless video clips, posted by his staff, of his dressing down journalists, constituents, Democrats, academic researchers and the New Jersey Supreme Court. YouTube against Twitter: Which is more effective?\n\nAnd finally, perhaps most importantly, the race represents a stark contrast in style. The mayor who meditates and quotes poetry versus the governor who…what's the opposite of meditation and poetry?\n\nBooker is a chameleon, able to give any audience what it needs. To the Florida delegation at the Democratic convention, for example, he dropped “Jesus Loves You” and the Hebrew equivalent, “Baruch Hashem,” in the same sentence, bringing black women and Jewish grandmothers to their feet. Christie, on the other hand, keeps his finger on the trigger—choosing respect, as he always says, before love. While Christie is a married father of four and the fattest national politician since the dawn of television, Booker is a fit, single man often dubbed “America’s sexiest mayor.” His sex life is of more than a little interest in political circles, and his name was appropriated for an erotic novel, “Cory’s Salvation.” He is crushed on by 20-something female progressives across the country, as evidenced by the question recently asked about him on Jezebel: “Is it hot in here or is that just the rising temperature of a million vaginas?”\n\nBooker, a vegetarian, often points to the contrast: “The governor is a Republican, I’m a Democrat. The governor likes steak, I like tofu. The governor is bold, I am bald. But we both recognize that we have common ground between us.”\n\nWhen the Klieg lights are turned on at the must-see debates next fall, though, don't expect the candidates to tread on such common ground. Christie will look to smash what one Republican operative described as Booker's “glass jaw” by attacking him for being the same kind of tax-and-spend Democrat that brought New Jersey the highest property taxes in the nation. He will say that Booker followed the playbook of his tarnished ally, former governor and bank boss Jon Corzine, by failing to address Newark’s structural deficit and continued reliance on suburban taxes. Like Democrats in Congress who ignore the cost of entitlements, Christie will argue, Booker failed to do the “big things.”\n\nChristie’s been to war before as a federal prosecutor, challenger to Corzine, and chief surrogate for Romney. Booker won his mayorship in a nasty race against a longtime state senator, but he's the relative newbie on the national scene. So he will first try to deflect Christie's shots with some of the platitudes he peddles on Twitter. Failing that, he will follow the advice of the focus groups and attempt to exploit Christie's gender gap by repeatedly bringing up the governor's opposition to abortion and gay marriage. He will frame these as civil rights matters, then go for the gut by questioning Christie's blue-collar-hero status—that the governor reduced a tax credit for the working poor, while vetoing taxes for millionaires.\n\nMost of all, Booker will wait for the inevitable insult, some word that Christie lets slip that a few thousand independent voters think goes too far. This isn't a state where we want our leaders calling lawmakers “numbnuts” and Navy SEALs “idiots,” as Christie has done. Booker will wait for that gaffe, and then let it simmer. The message: Christie's tough talk, his Insult the Comic Dog routine, is growing too old, New Jersey. You've done bold; now is the time to go bald.\n\nMatt Katz covers Christie for The Philadelphia Inquirer.",

  "latent_21859": "About 1.2 million people in the U.S. brew their own ales and lagers at home, according to the American Homebrewers Association, Boulder, Colo., a division of the Brewers Association, a craft beer trade group.\n\nMost of these novice brewers purchase the necessary equipment and ingredients at home-brewing supply stores.\n\nBut in certain markets, they can head to their favorite food store for all their home-brewing needs. For instance, Whole Food Market’s Coddingtown store in Santa Rosa, Calif., is a fully stocked brewing supply store. Not only does it sell brewing equipment, but also bulk grains, yeast and other ingredients. It also hosts homebrewer how-to classes. Other Whole Foods stores have similar offerings.\n\nThe Whole Foods website even includes a video of the founders of the Brooklyn Brew Shop, which markets home-brewing kits:\n\nCONNECT WITH SN ON FACEBOOK Like the Supermarket News page for updates throughout the day.\n\nMeanwhile, the Austin, Texas-based chain operates its own microbrewers on site at two stores: one in Houston and another in San Jose, Calif.\n\nIn Houston, the Whole Foods Market Brewing Company has a five-barrel, two-vessel brewing system with the ability to produce about 400-500 barrels annually. Its on-site bar includes windows overlooking the tanks:\n\nHere, the Whole Foods Market Brewing Company's Facebook page announces new flavors:\n\nWFM's efforts come at a time when the home brewing market is on the upswing.

He told me that home brewers like experimenting with recipes to create the flavor and style of their choice.\n\n“There’s a trend of do-it-yourself,” he said.\n\nA demographic shift is aiding the home-brewing market, according to Parr. Once dominated by the over-30 set, there’s now significant growth among Millennials. Millennials have jumped on the home-brewing bandwagon because they like to save money, and create unique food and beverage offerings for their friends.\n\n“Home brewing is an art form,” Parr said.",
  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nUltra-high-net-worth individuals by country, 2011\n\nThe tax plan passed by Senate Democrats on Wednesday isn’t really about taxing the rich; it’s about taxing the megarich. As Timothy Noah has explained in The New Republic, the plan would actually reduce taxes on a lot of fairly rich people by renewing the (supposedly temporary) Bush-era tax cuts for everyone except those who make more than $250,000 a year. Even then, Democrats are only proposing a higher marginal tax rate, which means that even people raking in far more than $250,000 will still pay lower taxes on their first quarter million in annual earnings. Crunch the numbers, and it turns out that the biggest losers under the Senate plan are couples who earn more than $1 million a year—mostly multimillionaires and billionaires.\n\nWhile the Senate tax plan could certainly go further in taxing the rich, focusing on the megawealthy makes sense considering how much of our economy is now controlled by them. According to the Internal Revenue Service, there are 66,000 taxpayers who individually control $20 million or more in assets, and all these people put together are worth $4 trillion—more than the net worth of the majority of the US population.\n\nThe investment bank Credit Suisse, for its part, classifies “ultra high net worth individuals” as people with at least $50 million in assets—and according to the bank’s 2011 Global Wealth Databook, more of these UNHWIs live in the United States than anywhere else in the world (see chart above).\n\nSo perhaps America has lots of multimillionaires because it’s a prosperous country? That’s certainly a factor—but not the only one. Compared to the superrich in the six other countries with the most multimillionaires, American tycoons grab a disproportionately large share of the economic pie:\n\nPercent of Income Earned by Top 0.1% of Taxpayers\n\nYet despite raking in such a large share of the national income, our nation’s über-wealthy pay very little in taxes by global standards:\n\nTop Income Tax Rates in the 6 Countries With the Most Ultra-High-Net-Worth Citizens\n\nBut don’t higher tax rates at the top slow economic growth? Apparently not, considering the growth rates of our tax-happy competitors.\n\nChange in Gross Domestic Product, 2011\n\nSo why hasn’t Congress already raised taxes on the rich? Perhaps because the superwealthy have raised a lot more political money than the rest of us.\n\nPercent of donations to super-PACs this year that come from just 196 Americans: 80\n\n80 Amount the Koch brothers and their foundations plan to spend to defeat Obama: $395 million\n\n$395 million Total money raised by John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign: $384 million\n\n$384 million Number of billionaires who’ve made donations to Mitt Romney’s super-PAC, Restore Our Future: 32\n\n32 Percentage of Americans who give more than $10,000 in any election cycle: 0.01\n\nREAD MORE: 4 Ways That Democrats Want to Cut Taxes on The Rich",
  "latent_22156": "NEM NIS\n\nNIS (NEM Infrastructure Server) is the backbone of the NEM network. NIS nodes are nodes that maintain the blockchain of NEM. It also has a web server built in and uses that to serve queries via JSON RESTful APIs on the blockchain. A NIS node is trustless in the NEM network, meaning one does not need to trust it for any transaction. Anyone can use any NIS to broadcast transactions to the network. Transactions in blockchain technology platforms require that they are signed by the person controlling an account before they can be broadcast out. Signing of a transaction should always be done locally on the computer of the person signing it and the signing key should never ever need to leave the person’s computer.\n\nNEM NCC\n\nNEM’s first wallet is the NCC (NEM Community Client). It was written in a mix of Java and JS code. It is a completely separate wallet program than NIS that does the signing locally and then sends the transaction to a NIS node to broadcast it. That NIS node can be on the same machine locally or an external address operated by a third party, like blockexplore.in.\n\nSo if one is sending some XEM and signs the transaction in the NCC, no one else can get sensitive information about that account. This is because NEM was designed from day one to have a unique 2-tier architecture that allows anyone to make any transaction on any node safely, and without that node charging any third party service fees.\n\nNEM Lightwallet\n\nNEM has recently introduced a new type of wallet: the lightwallet. It allows users to make transactions just like what one can do with the NCC, but it uses a browser webpage written in javascript. So, now one can have just one html file to send XEM in a public network using any NIS without risking the safety of the account.\n\nThrough the NIS web server, the NIS is essentially acting as a lightwallet service provider. While a trusted NIS can be accessed via a web browser without any additional add-ins or programs running, the most secure way to use the lightwallet is to run it locally on any device that supports js/html. To do this the all new lightwallet has been released as a stand alone version without the need to boot up a NIS.\n\nThe lightwallet enables any novice or beginner to access the NEM platform without much knowledge of the technical intricacies of the blockchain technology, securely and easily to transact.\n\nWhy is the lightwallet important ?\n\nOne the more obvious functions that has come out of this new lightwallet is the ability for any merchant to incorporate the lightwallet js code into their webpage on their websites to facilitate payments easily. This can be done in minutes and the implications can be profound as the NEM blockchain data become easily available and accessible by the merchant.\n\nHow to use the NEM light wallet.\n\nOption 1: Go to http://nem.io/install.html\n\nDownload and unzip the nginx light wallet.\n\nTo start the server simply start nginx.exe.\n\nNext, go to http://127.0.0.1:7778/ in your web browser.\n\nTo stop double click stop-nginx.bat.\n\nYou can now safely run your own light wallet locally!\n\nOption 2: Download and synch and NIS and then go to http://127.0.0.1:7778/ in your web browser.\n\nTip: If you decide to make a pass phrase wallet, we strongly suggest you make a long and secure password.\n\nNote: The light wallet is very light. When you double click nginx.exe, it might look like nothing happened; it did! If you can visit the page http://127.0.0.1:7777/ in your browser and the light wallet loads, then you started it properly. Once you double click stop-ngix.bat, you should find that the page no longer loads.\n\nTroubleshooting: If you are running an NIS on the same machine you are running a lightwallet they ports, they will both try to access port 7777 so there will be a conflict, so a person should run either one or the other, or adjust ports in the config files.",
  "latent_22236": "The following post is by Arley McBlain . Arley has written a few other great articles for CSS-Tricks in the past so I'm pleased to have him back for another!\n\nThis post's title isn't just a weak attempt at SEO stuffing, it's also a blind-folded scissor kick into a beehive convention! Few topics in web production can bring a nerd's blood to a rolling boil as quickly as \"The Fold\" and \"Responsive Web Design\", so it's high time we combine the two and bring this server to its knees under the sheer weight of trolls sharing how they really feel about me as a person.\n\nBefore the Webbys have to invent the \"Best Use of Naivety\" award I'd like to point out that for years I've been in the \"The Fold is Dead\" camp. Nothing used to please me more than comparing a website to the source of the scrolling metaphor; papyrus scrolls (bonus points when I could work a font joke in). \"Sure, and when scribes wanted to avoid scrolling they probably wrote letters on fortune cookie paper, amiright?!\" (clients probably love sarcasm). However, recently I've been forced to admit that maybe I should be a bit more accommodating of the Fold's proponents, rather than simply beating them over the head with my sack of used mouse scroll wheels.\n\nRecently Google (incidentally a company whose clean \"above the fold\" website is merely a gateway to lots of scrolling search results) added a new feature to their Google Analytics suite that allows you to see what size of browsers users are visiting your site with. This allowed me to stop pretending that the data from the user's monitor resolution actually meant something relevant, and to begin to learn more about the way users are surfing my site.\n\nView Browser Size analtyics in Standard Reporting > Content > In-Page Analytics, and click the \"Browser Size\" button. (view full size)\n\nGoogle Analytics is a useful tool, and can do more than just shatter your faith in humanity's ability to upgrade their web browser. This tool can literally tell you how your site is being used. You can easily see who is scrolling and clicking those big shiny buttons you painstakingly designed, even after they've been pushed well out of sight by multiple instances of the \"Ask Jeeves\" toolbar. It will literally show you a percentage of who is scrolling and clicking individual links!\n\nThis new analytics tool made me start thinking about the fold afresh. I used to think of the fold as a weakness or handicap of Luddite users, but for the first time I saw that the fold has a huge bearing on the way that I (a savvy webmaster) surf the web as well. I had to admit to myself that I bounce a lot (Google Analytics probably has me pegged with the attention span of a goldfish). I'll often making the decision to leave a website within a second of arriving if I don't immediately see what I came for, or if I think the site looks like it was built by rodents. Judging books and websites by the cover doesn't usually hurt until a lack of results has me return to that same page to look harder, only to find the content in question sitting smug just below the fold.\n\nGetting Started\n\nThe new browser size analytics feature has been around just long enough now that you can see some real data on how your current site design fares with impatient people like me! You'll see that many users aren't using their browsers full screen. While this has always been true of Mac users (most bitterly say they prefer their windows smaller after not being able to figure out what that UI \"+\" button does), it turns out that many PC users probably don't either (probably trying to look cool to the aforementioned Mac people).\n\nI'm guessing the results of the reports will motivate you to do one of two things: personally confront each user on their questionable computer habits in dimly lit remote areas, or make you want to fine tune your design. The latter is where some handy vertical responsive web design comes in (for the former I recommend a sack full of used mouse scroll wheels).\n\nVertical Responsive Web Design\n\nFor the last couple years we've all been resizing our monitor widths like giddy accordion players to better understand RWD. The magic behind those is the now-common Media Query:\n\n@media screen and (min-width: 768px) { marquee { font-size: 43em; } }\n\nTo get started with vertical RWD is a simple matter of addressing heights. Cinchy.\n\n@media screen and (min-height: 768px) { blink { color: pink; } }\n\nI wanted to make a couple practical vertically responsive demos to tantalize and delight!\n\nExample #1: A Cuddlier, Squishier Fold\n\nThe most obvious use of vertical RWD would be to keep your all-important calls to action above the fold. To make this example extra fun I've chosen to do this on an existing horizontally responsive layout courtesy of Twitter Bootstrap. Being responsive on two axes is good fun, and is a great opportunity to make some messy code, if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nWhen you vertically resize this demo site on desktop I've decided that I want to keep all four of the buttons in view as much as possible (hopefully the average site will just have one key CTA). For mobile sizes I only will require the blue CTA button to stay visible. For this demo I've decided not to worry about screens shorter than 320px. Realistically that should cover the extremely small desktop users and mobile users alike. We should be comfortable to talk about the users with smaller viewports in the tone that we usually reserve for IE6 users.\n\nWith this Twitter Bootstrap layout there are four horizontal break points - all but the last one (when the lower 3 columns get stacked) I am able to keep my buttons in view. This is all done by a few media queries which you can find in a <style> block at the bottom of the document's source code.\n\nAll in all, it was pretty cinchy to retro fit this layout to work in this way (he said with confidence despite deliberately picking a layout lacking media above the fold), especially by piggy-backing on existing horizontal break points.\n\nOf course we also need to address the ugly elephant that basically lives in this room like an ever-unwelcome squatter: what shall we do about the old versions of Internet Explorer? There's a lovely little JavaScript library called CSS3MediaQueries.js that does the trick fairly well. I've included it in this demo in conditional IE tags. While it doesn't resize as fluidly as a modern browser, on the page load the user will see the responded version of the layout. Beauty.\n\nTwitter Bootstrap demo:\n\nView Demo\n\nExample #2: WordPress Dashboard Navigation Tweak\n\nThis example is much simpler: one tiny media query with a simple bit of CSS that completely changes the ordinarily relative positioned left navigation that all WordPress admins are familiar with:\n\n@media screen and (min-height: 500px) { #adminmenuwrap { position: fixed; } }\n\nNow, regardless of the navigation being in the collapsed or n00b mode (I jest), it will stay visible when you're scrolling through taller pages - provided your vertical resolution is taller than 500px. If your browser is shorter than that it goes back to being a relative positioned element that will scroll with the rest of the site. I've chosen 500px which is enough for the standard menu, as well as a few extra menu items from plugins or themes.\n\nThis vertical oriented RWD positioning treatment can work very well for navigation, widgets, pictures of cats, page tools, and even the lovely ads, like the ones from the charming sponsors of this website!\n\nFor this proof of concept I've made a localized HTML version of the WordPress dashboard (all of the links are broken it's a demonstration of the scrolling effect only):\n\nWordPress Dashboard Demo (media query only):\n\nView Demo\n\nThe 500px used in my example only works when you know the maximum height needed for the element. However, if the height of that object is unknowable or changes (an accordion navigation with multiple levels for example) you may want to consider a bit of jQuery that will compare the height of the object to the height of your window.\n\nI have done this in the following variation of our demo by calling jQuery and using this script:\n\nvar setResponsive = function () { // Is the window taller than the #adminmenuwrap by 50px or more? if ($(window).height() > $(\"#adminmenuwrap\").height() + 50) { // ...if so, make the #adminmenuwrap fixed $('#adminmenuwrap').css('position', 'fixed'); } else { //...otherwise, leave it relative $('#adminmenuwrap').css('position', 'relative'); } } $(window).resize(setResponsive); setResponsive();\n\nWordPress Dashboard Demo (with jQuery):\n\nView Demo\n\nA Tall Order\n\nSo there you go.\n\nA slight disclaimer: throughout this post I've been using the phrase \"vertical responsive web design\" - please understand that I'm just specifying the orientation of the responsivity, not coining a phrase. Whether the response is vertical or horizontal the term \"responsive web design\" captures it all.\n\nI think there's a lot more we can be doing with vertical responsive web design in relation to our best practices, our content, and our users. The advent of this snappy new Google Analytics tool makes this a great time to start. In the past these wily short-browsered users may have been unpredictable and frustrating enough to drive Berners-Lee to kick a kitten, but now we can learn from their behavior, and predict the common ways they'll view important content.\n\nGood news my friends, the fold is now undead.",
  "latent_22293": "Just in time for the holidays—here's a transcription of \"Skating\" by the Vince Guaraldi Trio. I've always been a fan of this song since I first heard it on the Charlie Brown Specials. It wasn't until I heard George Winston's take piano solo I really fell in love with the song. I was super excited to learn this song, but I did not have the technical skills at the time to learn this song by ear, so I bought the Charlie Brown Christmas books only to find that it did not include the piano solo section! I was heartbroken. For a while I felt incomplete searching high-and-low with the hopes of coming across sheet music with the missing solo. Unfortunately, I came up empty handed despite there being a ton of videos on YouTube with players performing the whole song, solo included.\n\nI decided to transcribe the song myself using Transcribe! and Musescore. The process was painstakingly long, but it was a great learning experience for me as this was the first song I attempted to transcribe, ever.\n\nMy arrangement is heavily influenced by George Winston's piano solo, but I chose to go with a simpler lefthand configuration—much like Vince Guaraldi did—in some sections like the solo. I felt Winston's version was a little too loud and overbearing for my taste. In other places I decided to add a more fuller sound to lefthand during passages like measures 6–8. Although the solo I arranged is not perfect note for note I feel like I captured the essence of it.\n\nI really wanted to put my little twist on this song, so I decided to add an additional section which includes a transposed version of \"You're in Love Charlie Brown\" in the key of C.\n\nI hope you guys enjoy this one.

I also claimed that Muslims are not a race by anybody’s construal of the term, and this proposal was just a way to uniquely insulate Islam from criticism.\n\nI also claimed (with a bit of hyperbole), that no religion deserves respect, but qualified that by saying that we shouldn’t respect those faiths (nearly all of them) whose truth claims are untestable or wrong and their god-derived moral codes questionable. I do have more respect for, say, Quakers, than I do for the more theistic faiths. Quakerism, however, is almost the same as secular humanism.\n\nBut I did make this comment:\n\nCatholicism and Islam are no more deserving of respect than are Scientology or Christian Science. Why is the claim that someone was nailed to the cross, killed, revived, and now is the sole vehicle for eternal salvation in Heaven any more deserving of respect than the claim that the overlord Xenu stashed people in volcanoes and then blew them up, releasing body thetans that now afflict us? Or that disease is merely an instantiation of misguided thinking, and can be cured by prayer. None of the bases of these faiths—their fact claims—survive the merest scrutiny, and none of their behavior claims, including assertions about the afterlife or the efficacy of prayer, are credible to someone not brought up in the asylum. In fact, severe ridicule of doctrine (not “adherents”) is the appropriate response to most religions; or, if you’re not into mockery, calm analysis and rejection of their claims.\n\nWell, Fletch didn’t like that, and tried to post the following. I decided to put it above the fold and get readers’ comments, so I could email the whole lot to him. (I suspect his email address is bogus, but I’ll try). To wit:\n\nI agree and disagree with this column. I agree that Islam is not, and should not be considered, a race; however, I disagree with your assertion that “None of the bases of these faiths—their fact claims—survive the merest scrutiny”. Christianity actually does survive this scrutiny. You just throw off this flip statement because you haven’t really studied it. Look at people like Lee Strobel – the former award-winning legal editor of the Chicago Tribune. He looked into Jesus and Christianity from the point of a reporter after his wife’s conversion. What he found so convinced him, that he became a Christian. Or look at J. Warner Wallace, a former homicide detective who worked on cold-cases for 15 years. He approached the death of Jesus like a cold case and the gospels as eyewitness accounts, and he also came to the conclusion that, yes, what the Gospel accounts say are reliable. He also became a Christian as a result. As C.S Lewis and J.R.R Tolkien said, the Bible is a myth, but that it is also true. That is the difference between Christianity and your overlord Xenu. As Lewis puts it – “Myth in general is … at its best, a real though unfocused gleam of divine truth falling on human imagination. The heart of Christianity is a myth which is also a fact. The old myth of the Dying God, without ceasing to be myth, comes down from the heaven of legend and imagination to the earth of history. It happens — at a particular date, in a particular place, followed by definable historical consequences. We pass from a Balder or an Osiris, dying nobody knows when or where, to a historical Person crucified (it is all in order) under Pontius Pilate. By becoming fact it does not cease to be myth: that is the miracle”.\n\nAs most of us know, there’s no extra-Biblical evidence for the existence of someone who either was a divine Jesus (apparently Fletch’s belief) or even a secular preacher on whom the Biblical Jesus was modeled. The rest is commentary.\n\nI didn’t know about Lee Strobel, who apparently wrote five books on apologetics, including The Case for Christ and The Case for The Real Jesus, but I simply can’t be bothered to read every such book that the goddies throw in my face. However, I found a pretty fair review of The Case for Christ by Jeffery J. Lowder on the Secular Web. Lowder, after a non-“strident” but critical review, concludes this:\n\nCase for Christ is a creative, well-written contribution to Christian apologetics. Moreover, Strobel is to be commended for summarizing the work of so many leading apologists for Evangelical Christianity in such a compact and easy-to-read format. Yet Strobel did not interview any critics of Evangelical apologetics. He sometimes refutes at great length objections not made by the critics (e.g., the claim that Jesus was mentally insane); more often, he doesn’t address objections the critics do make (e.g., the complete inauthenticity of the Testimonium Flavianium, the failure of Jews to produce the body is inconclusive evidence for the empty tomb, etc.) Perhaps this will be a welcome feature to people who already believe Christianity but have no idea why they believe it. For those of us who are primarily interested in thetruth, however, we want to hear both sides of the story.\n\nI’m sure there’s at least one reader who has read Strobel’s books, and if you have weigh in below. If Strobel was a true journalist, and was convinced by the evidence, it’s odd that—as Lowder notes—he doesn’t even deal with the objections to the “real Jesus” story. If you’re weaving an evidence-based tale, it’s always best, as we scientists know, to take up possible objections to your case before others do!\n\nAs for J. Warner Wallace, author of Cold-Case Christianity and now adjunct professor of apologetics at Biola University, his book appears to be based purely on whether Scripture seems reliable to a detective (see here for his case). Apparently it does. But if the case for Christianity (or rather the divinity of Jesus) is best made by Wallace and Strobel, yet refuted by many others, including the Biblical scholars Bart Ehrman and Richard Carrier, then one should hardly commit one’s life to the doctrine.\n\nI wonder what Fletch would think of The Case for Muhammad, which seems much stronger than The Case for Christ?\n\nAnyway, if you want Fletch to read your comments, put them below, and in a day or so I’ll direct him to all of this.",
  "latent_22654": "Jun 22, 2015. Sphinx is now on GitHub\n\nShare it: Tweet\n\nTL;DR = Sphinx sources are now on Github, at sphinxsearch/sphinx. Please get the updates from there, SVN mirror at Google Code is not updated anymore. For a bit more details, read on.\n\nGoogle Code is closing doors this coming August, and internally we have been using Git and GitHub for quite a while now, so it’s long due to bid SVN farewell. r5125, aka e7f124d, is officially the last SVN revision. We already closed down our internal SVN repo, and its mirror on Google Code is not updated anymore, too.\n\nsphinxsearch/sphinx is now the official public repo. We only kept rel21, rel22, and master (aka rel23) branches in there. While the entire revision history is of course available in the new repo, we dropped the older, now inactive branches.\n\nIssue tracking is staying on Sphinx Mantis, at least for now. Migrating to GitHub Issues was also considered, but seems clumsy, not without its problems, and without really clear killer benefits. We do however plan to add auth via GitHub there. (And, perhaps, simplify the basic bug reporting form, while we’re at it.)\n\nAs for the public SVN, we stopped updating it a couple weeks ago, and more, Google will eventually kill it. So, well, switch to GitHub. All the new updates go there. There already are a few fixes and even a small new feature.\n\nThat’s pretty much it, and if I missed something, just ask in the comments. Also, all hail Git! :)",
  "latent_22872": "London Philharmonic record every national anthem (more or less)\n\nBy CMU Editorial | Published on Thursday 29 September 2011\n\nThe London Philharmonic Orchestra has recorded no less than 200 national anthems ready for next year’s London Olympics. The recordings, recorded in just 52 hours at the Abbey Road Studios, will be used during medal presentation ceremonies at next year’s games. Though every anthem will also be played at the opening events of both the Olympics and Paralympics, so if any countries fail to win any medals, at least the Phil’s efforts won’t be wasted.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Olympic rules dictate that each anthem is between 60 and 90 seconds. As the shortest, Uganda, is eighteen seconds long normally, and the longest, Uruguay, runs for nearly seven minutes, that involved some reworking. Though original arrangements were being used anyway, partly to give the performances a fresh spin, and partly to avoid any copyright issues around existing arrangements.\n\nConductor Philip Sheppard had 45 meetings with reps from all over the world to discuss his adaptations of each anthem. Meanwhile, the orchestra had a map on the floor of the studio so they could mark off each anthem as it was recorded. Sheppard told the Beeb: “My geography has definitely been sharpened!”",
  "latent_22915": "Part of the sequence: The Science of Winning at Life\n\nOne day a coworker said to me, \"Luke! You're, like, the happiest person I know! How come you're so happy all the time?\"\n\nIt was probably a rhetorical question, but I had a very long answer to give. See, I was unhappy for most of my life,1 and even considered suicide a few times. Then I spent two years studying the science of happiness. Now, happiness is my natural state. I can't remember the last time I felt unhappy for longer than 20 minutes.\n\nThat kind of change won't happen for everyone, or even most people (beware of other-optimizing), but it's worth a shot!\n\nWe all want to be happy, and happiness is useful for other things, too.2 For example, happiness improves physical health,3 improves creativity,4 and even enables you to make better decisions.5 (It's harder to be rational when you're unhappy.6) So, as part of a series on how to win at life with science and rationality, let's review the science of happiness.\n\nThe correlates of happiness\n\nEarlier, I noted that there is an abundance of research on factors that correlate with subjective well-being (individuals' own assessments of their happiness and life satisfaction).\n\nFactors that don't correlate much with happiness include: age,7 gender,8 parenthood,9 intelligence,10 physical attractiveness,11 and money12 (as long as you're above the poverty line). Factors that correlate moderately with happiness include: health,13 social activity,14 and religiosity.15 Factors that correlate strongly with happiness include: genetics,16 love and relationship satisfaction,17 and work satisfaction.18\n\nBut correlation is not enough. We want to know what causes happiness. And that is a trickier thing to measure. But we do know a few things.\n\nHappiness, personality, and skills\n\nGenes account for about 50% of the variance in happiness.19 Even lottery winners and newly-made quadriplegics do not see as much of a change in happiness as you would expect.20 Presumably, genes shape your happiness by shaping your personality, which is known to be quite heritable.21\n\nSo which personality traits tend to correlate most with happiness? Extroversion is among the best predictors of happiness,22 as are conscientiousness, agreeableness, self-esteem, and optimism.23\n\nWhat if you don't have those traits? The first thing to say is that you might be capable of them without knowing it. Introversion, for example, can be exacerbated by a lack of social skills. If you decide to learn and practice social skills, you might find that you are more extroverted than you thought! (That's what happened to me.) The same goes for conscientiousness, agreeableness, self-esteem, and optimism - these are only partly linked to personality. They are to some extent learnable skills, and learning these skills (or even \"acting as if\") can increase happiness.24\n\nThe second thing to say is that lacking some of these traits does not, of course, doom you to unhappiness.\n\nHappiness is subjective and relative\n\nHappiness is not determined by objective factors, but by how you feel about them.25\n\nHappiness is also relative26: you'll probably be happier making $25,000/yr in Costa Rica (where your neighbors are making $13,000/yr) than you will be making $80,000/yr in Beverly Hills (where your neighbors are making $130,000/yr).\n\nHappiness is relative in another sense, too: it is relative to your expectations.27 We are quite poor at predicting the strength of our emotional reactions to future events. We overestimate the misery we will experience after a romantic breakup, failure to get a promotion, or even contracting an illness. We also overestimate the pleasure we will get from buying a nice car, getting a promotion, or moving to a lovely coastal city. So: lower your expectations about the pleasure you'll get from such expenditures.\n\nFlow and mindfulness\n\nYou may have heard of the famous studies28 showing that people are happiest when they are in a state of \"flow.\" Flow is the state you're in when you are fully engaged in a task that is interesting, challenging, and intrinsically rewarding to you. This is the experience of \"losing yourself in the moment\" or, as sports players say, \"being in the zone.\"\n\nFinding flow has largely to do with performing tasks that match your skill level. When a task is far beyond your skill level, you will feel defeated. When a task is too easy, you'll be bored. Only when a task is challenging but achievable will you feel good about doing it. I'm reminded of the state troopers in Super Troopers, who devised strange games and challenges to make their boring jobs passable. Myrtle Young made her boring job at a potato chip factory more interesting and challenging by looking for potato chips that resembled celebrities, and pulling them off the conveyor belts for her collection.\n\nIf you're struggling with negative thoughts, achieving flow is probably the best medicine. Contrary to popular wisdom, forced positive thinking often makes things worse.29 Trying to not think about Upsetting Thought X has the same effect as trying to not think about pink elephants: you can't help but think about pink elephants.\n\nWhile being \"lost in the moment\" may provide some of your happiest moments, research has also shown that when you're not in flow, taking a step outside the moment and practicing \"mindfulness\" - that is, paying attention to your situation, your actions, and your feelings - can reduce chronic pain and depression30, reduce stress and anxiety31, and produce a wide range of other positive effects.32\n\nHow to be happier\n\nHappiness, then, is an enormously complex thing. Worse, we must remember the difference between experienced happiness and remembered happiness. I can only scratch the surface of happiness research in this tiny post. In short, there is no simple fix for unhappiness; no straight path to bliss.\n\nMoreover, happiness will be achieved differently for different people. A person suffering from depression due to chemical imbalance may get more help from a pill than from learning better social skills. A healthy, extroverted, agreeable, conscientious woman can still be unhappy if she is trapped in a bad marriage. Some people were raised by parents whose parenting style did not encourage the development of healthy self-esteem,33 and they will need to devote significant energy to overcome this deficit. For some, the road to happiness is long. For others, it is short.\n\nBelow, I review a variety of methods for becoming happier. Some of them I discussed above; many, I did not.\n\nThese methods are ranked roughly in descending order of importance and effect, based on my own reading of the literature. You will need to think about who you are, what makes you happy, what makes you unhappy, and what you can achieve in order to determine which of the below methods should be attempted first. Also, engaging any of these methods may require that you first gain some mastery over procrastination.\n\nHere, then, are some methods for becoming happier34:\n\nIf you suffer from serious illness, depression, anxiety, paranoia, schizophrenia, or other serious problems, seek professional help first. Here's how. Even if you don't need professional help, you may benefit from some self-exploration and initial guidance from a reductionistic, naturalistic counselor like Tom Clark. Develop the skills and habits associated with extroversion. First, get some decent clothes and learn how to wear them properly. If you're a guy, read these books. If you're a girl, ask your girlfriends or try these books. Next, learn basic social skills, including body language. If you're really introverted, practice on Chatroulette or Omegle first. Next, spend more time with other people, making small talk. Go to meetups and CouchSurfing group activities. Practice your skills until they become more natural, and you find yourself enjoying being in the company of others. Learn how to be funny and practice that, too. Improve your self-esteem and optimism. This is tricky. First, too much self-esteem can lead to harmful narcissism.35 Second, it's not clear that a rationalist can endorse several standard methods for improving one's self esteem (self-serving bias, basking in reflected glory, self-handicapping)36 because they toy with self-deception and anti-epistemology. But there are a few safe ways to increase your self-esteem and optimism. Make use of success spirals, vicarious victory, and mental contrasting, as described here. Improve your agreeableness. In simpler terms, this basically means: increase your empathy. Unfortunately, little is currently known (scientifically) about how to increase one's empathy.37 The usual advice about trying to see things from another's perspective, and thinking more about people less fortunate than oneself, will have to do for now. The organization Roots of Empathy may have some good advice, too. Improve your conscientiousness. Conscientiousness involves a variety of tendencies: useful organization, strong work ethic, reliability, planning ahead, etc. Each of these individual skills can be learned. The techniques for overcoming procrastination are useful, here. Some people report that books like Getting Things Done have helped them become more organized and reliable. Develop the habit of gratitude. Savor the good moments throughout each day.38 Spend time thinking about happy memories.39 And at the end of each day, write down 5 things you are grateful for: the roof over your head, your good fortune at being born in a wealthy country, the existence of Less Wrong, the taste of chocolate, the feel of orgasm... whatever. It sounds childish, but it works.40 Find your purpose and live it. One benefit of religion may be that it gives people a sense of meaning and purpose. Without a magical deity to give you purpose, though, you'll have to find out for yourself what drives you. It may take a while to find it though, and you may have to dip your hands and mind into many fields. But once you find a path that strongly motivates you and fulfills you, take it. (Of course, you might not find one purpose but many.) Having a strong sense of meaning and purpose has a wide range of positive effects.41 The 'find a purpose' recommendation also offers an illustration of how methods may differ in importance for people. 'Find a purpose' is not always emphasized in happiness literature, but for my own brain chemistry I suspect that finding motivating purposes has made more difference in my life than anything else on this list. Find a more fulfilling job. Few people do what they love for a living. Getting to that point can be difficult and complicated. You may find that doing 10 other things on this list first is needed for you to have a good chance at getting a more fulfilling job. To figure out which career might be full of tasks that you love to do, a RIASEC personality test might help. In the USA, O*NET can help you find jobs that are in-demand and fit your personality. Improve your relationship with your romantic partner, or find a different one. As with finding a more fulfilling job, this one is complicated, but can have major impact. If you know your relationship isn't going anywhere, you may want to drop it so you can spend more time developing yourself, which will improve future relationships. If you're pretty serious about your partner, there are many things you can do to improve the relationship. Despite being touted widely, \"active listening\" doesn't predict relationship success.42 Tested advice for improving the chances of relationship success and satisfaction include: (1) do novel and exciting things with your partner often43, (2) say positive things to and about your partner at least 5 times more often than you say negative things44, (3) spend each week writing about why your relationship is better than some others you know about45, (4) qualify every criticism of your partner with a review of one or two of their positive qualities46, and (5) stare into each other's eyes more often.47 Go outside and move your body. This will improve your attention and well-being.48 Spend more time in flow. Drop impossible tasks in favor of tasks that are at the outer limits of your skillset. Make easy and boring tasks more engaging by turning them into games or adding challenges for yourself. Practice mindfulness regularly. When not in flow, step outside yourself and pay attention to how you are behaving, how your emotions are functioning, and how your current actions work toward your goals. Meditation may help. Avoid consumerism. The things you own do come to own you, in a sense. Consumerism leads to unhappiness.49 Unfortunately, you've probably been programmed from birth to see through the lens of consumerism. One way to start deprogramming is by watching this documentary about the deliberate invention of consumerism by Edward Bernays. After that, you may want to sell or give away many of your possessions and, more importantly, drastically change your purchasing patterns.\n\nNote that seeking happiness as an end might be counterproductive. Many people report that constantly checking to see if they are happy actually decreases their happiness - a report that fits with the research on \"flow.\" It may be better to seek some of the above goals as ends, and happiness will be a side-effect.\n\nRemember: Happiness will not come from reading articles on the internet. Happiness will come when you do the things research recommends.\n\nGood luck!\n\nNext post: The Good News of Situationist Psychology\n\nPrevious post: How to Beat Procrastination\n\nNotes\n\n1 From a young age through my teenage years, I was known as the pessimist in my family. Of course, I would retort I was merely a realist. Making happiness work within me made me an optimist. These days I'm pessimistic about many things: For example I think there's about a 50/50 chance the human species will survive this century. But it's a kind of rationalistic, emotionally detached pessimism. It doesn't affect my mood.\n\n2 Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener (2005).\n\n3 Steptoe et al. (2005).\n\n4 Isen et al. (1987); Isen (2004); Fredrickson (1998).\n\n5 Isen (2002); Morris (1999).\n\n6 Beck (2008); Ellis (2001).\n\n7 Age and happiness are unrelated (Lykken 1999), age accounting for less than 1% of the variation in people's happiness (Inglehart 1990; Myers & Diener 1997).\n\n8 Despite being treated for depressive disorders twice as often as men (Nolen-Hoeksema 2002), women report just as high levels of well-being as men do (Myers 1992).\n\n9 Apparently, the joys and stresses of parenthood balance each other out, as people with and without children are equally happy (Argyle 2001).\n\n10 Both IQ and educational attainment appear to be unrelated to happiness (Diener et al. 2009; Ross & Van Willigen 1997).\n\n11 Good-looking people enjoy huge advantages, but do not report greater happiness than others (Diener et al. 1995).\n\n12 The correlation between income and happiness is surprisingly weak (Diener & Seligman 2004; Diener et al. 1993; Johnson & Krueger 2006). One problem may be that higher income contributes to greater materialism, which impedes happiness (Frey & Stutzer 2002; Kasser et al. 2004; Solberg et al. 2002; Kasser 2002; Van Boven 2005; Nickerson et al. 2003; Kahneman et al. 2006).\n\n13 Those with disabling health conditions are happier than you might think (Myers 1992; Riis et al. 2005; Argyle 1999).\n\n14 Those who are satisfied with their social life are moderately more happy than others (Diener & Seligman 2004; Myers 1999; Diener & Seligman 2002).\n\n15 Religiosity correlates with happiness (Abdel-Kahlek 2005; Myers 2008), though it may be religious attendance and not religious belief that matters (Chida et al. 2009).\n\n16 Past happiness is the best predictor of future happiness (Lucas & Diener 2008). Happiness is surprisingly unmoved by external factors (Lykken & Tellegen 1996), because genes accounts for about 50% of the variance in happiness (Lyubomirsky et al. 2005; Stubbe et al. 2005).\n\n17 Married people are happier than those who are single or divorced (Myers & Diener 1995; Diener et al. 2000), and marital satisfaction predicts happiness (Proulx et al. 2007).\n\n18 Unemployment makes people very unhappy (Argyle 2001), and job satisfaction is strongly correlated with happiness (Judge & Klinger 2008; Warr 1999).\n\n19 Lyubomirsky et al. (2005); Stubbe et al. (2005).\n\n20 Brickman et al. (1978).\n\n21 Weiss et al. (2008).\n\n22 Lucas & Diener (2008); Fleeson et al. (2002).\n\n23 Lucas (2008) and Lyubomirsky et al.

On the learnability of conscientiousness, see Roberts et al. (2009). On the learnability of self-esteem, see Barrett et al. (1999); Borras et al. (2009).

(2006).\n\n34 There are several disputed and uncertain methods I did not mention. One example is \"expressive writing.\" Compare Lepore & Smyth (2002) and Spera et al. (1994) to Seery et al. (2008). Moreover, talking with a others about bad experiences may help, but maybe not: see Zech & Rimé (2005). Another disputed method is that of improving mood by thinking quicker and more varied thoughts: see Pronin & Jacobs (2008). I'm waiting for more research to come in on that one. The results of \"affectionate writing\" are mixed: see Floyd et al. (2009). The effects of household plants are also mixed: see Bringslimark et al. (2009). There remains debate on whether forced smiles and laughter improve happiness. Finally, see the review of literature in Helliwell (2011).\n\n35 Crocker & Park (2004); Bushman & Baumeister (1998); Bushman & Baumeister (2002).\n\n36 Self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute success to internal causes (oneself), but attribute failure to external causes. Basking in reflected glory is an attempt to enhance one's image by announcing and displaying association with a well-perceived group or individual. Self-handicapping is a way of saving face by sabotaging one's performance in order to provide an excuse for the failure.\n\n37 See, for example: Stepien & Baernstein (2006); de Vignemont & Singer (2006); Heln & Singer (2008).\n\n38 Bryant & Veroff (2007).\n\n39 Burton & King (2004).\n\n40 Emmons & McCullough (2003); Lyubomirsky et al.

  "latent_23012": "First and foremost, the Green Bay Packers got themselves a heck of an athlete with the 109th pick in the 2013 NFL Draft. David Bakhtiari, a 3-year starter along the offensive line for the University of Colorado Buffaloes, spent the last few months working out with a group of linebackers in California. He was invited to the group by his older brother, Erik Bakhtiari, who has bounced around the league since 2007. Among the other players in the group? Clay Matthews. You have to wonder if that factored into the Packers decision to draft him.\n\nHe was recruited to CU by Dan Hawkins and redshirted his first year here. He was only about 245 lbs when he first arrived on campus having also been a lacrosse player in high school. After putting on more than 45 lbs, he locked up the RT job before the second game of his redshirt freshman season. He showed definite improvement as the season wore on. After the graduation of Nate Solder, Bakhtiari was moved from right to left tackle, and would spend the next two seasons starting there for the Buffs.\n\nStrengths:\n\nDavid is a high-character guy that is going to work hard to continue to get better, stronger and quicker. He definitely still has a way to go, but he knows that. He has quick feet, can kick-slide well and can get to guys at the 2nd level quickly. He has good flexibility which should help his versatility and a quick punch.\n\nWhere he needs to improve:\n\nHe needs to work on strengthening his base to be able to hold up to the size he'll be facing consistently in the NFL, especially if he's going to be looked at as a guard. He can also continue to get stronger so he can have a more violent punch. His recognition of certain twists and stunts needs work as well. Basically, he needs to adjust to the NFL and get into an NFL strength program.\n\nWhere does he fit in?\n\nGreen Bay uses a zone-blocking scheme, which is good for a nice athlete like Bakhtiari. There is a chance he could find himself competing for the starting left tackle spot there, but ideally he'll have a year or two to adjust to the NFL level of play while proving solid depth at both tackle spots, and eventually at the guard spots as well. His height, isn't great for a tackle, but his athleticism and good feet can make up for that, especially in a zone-blocking scheme. I instantly thought of TJ Lang when I heard GB picked Bakhtiari, because he reminds me of a lighter version of Lang when he was picked in 2009. And if you remember (I did not, but I noticed when I looked him up), Lang was also taken by the Packers with the 109th pick...weird.\n\nIn 2013, I wouldn't be too surprised to see Bakhtiari fighting for a starting tackle spot well into the preseason. He's solid and it sounds like the Packers are a bit unsettled at left tackle, with Bryan Bulaga being looked at if none of their guys can take over the spot. And that would then open up competition on the Right side. Bakhtiari could see time at either side. And if he doesn't win a spot, he's definitely a candidate to be the first guy off the bench on gameday as a swing-tackle. I wouldn't expect him to get that many reps at guard quite yet, but he could easily work there and provide depth if he doesn't snag one of the starting spots at tackle early. He has the potential to be in the NFL for a long time, though he probably won't ever be a candidate for Pro Bowls or All-Pro nods. He's not a spectacular talent, but he is a good athlete and possesses the intangibles and pedigree to make a nice career for himself.\n\nGreen Bay made a nice pick and David Bakhtiari lucked into a nice organization and situation. We have another Buffalo in a good situation that can represent the University of Colorado well and be used as an example for recruits.",

Several audience members held signs calling to action and listing issues facing residents. Photo by Genesee Martin\n\nMayor Ed Murray listens to audience questions and concerns during the Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda Night Out at the Museum of History & Industry. Several audience members held signs calling to action and listing issues facing residents. Photo by Genesee Martin\n\nMayor Ed Murray hosted Livability Night Out last week at the Museum of History & Industry, starting a conversation with residents, businesses, developers and city department heads concerning the Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda (HALA) for the city.\n\nMore than 200 people attended the event, with city staff and department directors answering questions about the massive initiative that is expected to start making changes this year.\n\nHALA addresses housing affordability, as well as the city’s livability, including education, civil rights, arts and culture and public space. Ten department directors spoke during the event, outlining with how their departments see the issue of livability and what they would contribute to the program.\n\nMurray said April 19 that his office has sent legislation to the Seattle City Council for approval as part of the initiative that would expand fair housing protections to renters with certain types of income, such as subsidies or alternative sources, including veterans’ benefits, disability and child support. It also prohibits landlords from evicting or refusing applicants because of alternative income sources.\n\nIn addition, the City Council adopted legislation last year creating a Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) Program that would require developers to pay fees or include affordable housing for commercial projects. A second portion concerning residential projects is expected to be adopted this spring with MHA implementation slated for final approval by October.\n\nThe mayor said when he was a teenager living in the city, jobs and people had moved away, prompting school closures.\n\n“Now, jobs are moving back into the city, and we don’t have enough schools,” he said. “For the first time in a century, we are growing faster than our suburbs. So we have a big challenge.”\n\n‘Not where, but how we live’\n\nMurray also talked about the massive effort to engage stakeholders, residents, neighborhoods and developers, starting in 2014 with citywide community outreach. He said city officials held town halls, attended public community and neighborhood council meetings and hosted teleconference town halls.\n\nOf the people who attended the telephone town halls, 70 percent had never attended a public meeting.\n\n“So we researched different methods to involve everybody in the city in a conversation,” Murray said. “Tonight, we get a chance to spend time with the department heads and people who work in departments.”\n\nEach department head gave a brief description of what their department considers livability and spoke about the need for major changes due to the massive number of people moving to the area monthly. Seattle is projected to grow by more than 100,000 by 2020.\n\nRandy Engstrom, director of the Office of Arts & Culture, reported the old King Street Station, which is slated for renovation, will become the new, long-term home for the department. He also said his department would be able to apply history, lifestyles, creativity and culture to public spaces and communities.\n\n“Livability is not just about where we live but about how we live,” he said.\n\n“Maybe you’re one of the 45,000-plus households in Seattle that spend more than half their income on housing,” said Seattle Office of Housing director Steve Walker. “Even with our historic minimum-wage increase, two people working full-time cannot afford the average for a one-bedroom apartment in Seattle.”\n\nHALA includes 65 recommendations for affordable and sustainable housing, as well as increasing the livability of the city. MHA is only one measure being put in place to try to stop people from being priced out of Seattle.\n\nThe initiative started with Murray convening a committee of 28 members to negotiate among residents, stakeholders and developers on issues facing city administration and residents from skyrocketing demand for housing.\n\nThe agenda’s recommendations include renewing and increasing the housing levy, maximizing surplus and underutilized property for affordable housing and creating a new housing-preservation property-tax exemption. It also includes strengthening tenant-protection laws and modifying building and construction codes.\n\nThe city’s design-review program, including the Early Design Guidance Review Board, is also slated for changes after developers and neighborhoods complained of time constraints and delays in construction, which critics say add costs and decrease affordability. There is no word yet on what those changes will look like.\n\nPublic criticism\n\nSeveral attendees at the meeting held signs calling for an end to homelessness and more action from city officials. One woman held a sign that read, “Don’t turn my neighborhood into a scene from ‘Up,’” referring to the scene in which an old man’s modest home is surrounded by skyscrapers.\n\nOne man said he expected more courage from officials in addressing the housing crisis in the city. Murray responded that he feels HALA is an unprecedented undertaking and takes a lot of courage to implement.\n\n“We have 5,000 homeless people on the streets; we have 50,000 people who are significantly housing-burdened in this city. And I see…10,000 affordable units,” the man said in addressing the HALA recommendations. “I mean it’s a half-measure.”\n\nHe added when a half-measure is introduced, it means the mayor lacked the moral authority to define the problem and introduce broad decisions to fix the issue.\n\n“So I would encourage you not to bow to the whims of the people who don’t want to make room for the rest of us,” he said.\n\nAnother woman demanded to know about a zoning proposal to allow primary and secondary structures on private property that are often rented out as income. Murray said he has withdrawn the proposal, then clarified his statement when she challenged it.\n\n“We are in the process of both putting in place a taxing mechanism for [rental properties], as well as limiting the number of days people can have them and the number that can be in any part of any neighborhood,” Murray said. “We will lose the affordability crisis if we have blocks and blocks of Airbnbs.”\n\nThat same woman responded that people are buying homes in her neighborhood to make money by renting them out and that her neighbors would soon move away. Murray said the city currently does not have regulations in place for this but is in the process of creating them.\n\nFor more information, visit seattleforeveryone.org.\n\nTo comment on this story, write to QAMagNews@nwlink.com.",
  "latent_23219": "PROVO — BYU quarterback Tanner Mangum and linebacker Fred Warner were added to 2017 watch lists by the Maxwell Football Club on Monday.\n\nMangum was named to the 81st annual Maxwell Award watch list, while Warner was named to the 23rd annual Chuck Bednarik Award watch list.\n\nThe Maxwell Award has been given to America’s College Player of the Year since 1937. BYU’s offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, Ty Detmer, sets precedence for Mangum, winning the award as a player at BYU in 1990.\n\nMangum, heading into his junior season, only started in the Poinsettia Bowl last year while leading the Cougars to a victory over Wyoming. As a freshman, he had 3,377 passing yards and 23 touchdowns, setting BYU freshman records.\n\nEntering his senior season, Warner has played in 36 career games as a Cougar at outside linebacker. In 2016, he led BYU in total tackles with 86, while recording a career-high in tackles with 14 against West Virginia.\n\nThe Chuck Bednarik Award has been awarded to the College Defensive Player of the Year since 1995.\n\nAlabama leads the way on the Maxwell Award watch list with four players being named while Texas has three Maxwell Award candidates. For the Chuck Bednarik Award, Ohio State and Florida State are represented well with four players apiece on the watch list.\n\nBoth the Maxwell Award watch list and Chuck Bednarik Award watch list pull from FBS programs and various conferences across the country. In 2016 Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson won the Maxwell Award, while Jonathan Allen, an Alabama defensive end, won the Chuck Bednarik Award.\n\nOn October 30, 2017, Mangum and Warner will find out if they were chosen as semifinalists for their respective awards. The final three finalists will be revealed on Nov. 20, 2017, with the winners of each award being announced on Dec. 7, 2017, at the Home Depot College Football Awards Show.\n\n×",
  "latent_23283": "BI Australia Earlier this week China's government released its latest quarterly GDP growth rate, reporting that the economy grew by 1.8% in the three months to September, leaving the annual rate of growth based on the quarterly figure at 7.2%.\n\nOn cue, the howls of doubt over the accuracy of the figure presented was heard across the markets. Given all of the data leading up to the release of the GDP report, how possibly could the economy be growing at such a quick clip?\n\nLike Capital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard, Diana Choyleva of Lombard Street Economics believes that the numbers were inflated, suggesting that the real growth rate for the economy during the quarter was less than half the rate reported by the government.\n\nHere's Choyleva on what rate the economy really grew in the September quarter, based on her own calculations.\n\n\"China's real GDP data came in worse than we expected, raising the risk of a sharper downturn next year. Our preliminary estimates show growth at an annualised rate of just 2.9% in Q3, way lower than the official 7.2%. Year-on-year growth was 3.1% (official 6.9%). The Q3 number changed the seasonally adjusted profile of our quarterly annualised estimate, lowering it to an average of just 3.5% so far this year.\"\n\nThe chart below from Choyleva reveals the vast disparity between the official seasonally adjusted annual growth rate released by the government compared to that calculated by Lombard Street.\n\nBusiness Insider Australia\n\nDuring the quarter Choyleva suggests that net trade, along with services, helped boost economic growth, partially offsetting declines from heavy industry and construction which suffered from \"massive overinvestment.\" She also notes that the overvalued yuan \"weighed on manufacturing.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Choyleva believes that external factors, rather than domestic, will determine whether growth can stablise in the quarters ahead.\n\n\"Whether Beijing will be able to stabilise growth in the next couple of quarters depends on American and European consumers starting to spend more of their real income gains\", she said.",
  "latent_23449": "Over the past couple of months, literary critics in the UK and the US have been unstinting in their praise for Ghachar Ghochar, Vivek Shanbhag’s Kannada novella, translated into English by Srinath Perur. “A Great Indian Novel Reaches American Shores\" is how The New York Times publicized its review. In the UK, translator and publisher Deborah Smith, reviewing the book for The Guardian, wrote that “reading beyond our tiny borders shows us what we’ve been missing\". The question is, will Ghachar Ghochar’s international success pave the way for more literature translated from Indian languages—indeed Asian languages—to gain a sizeable readership outside the country?\n\nThe interest certainly exists. In the UK at least, the year 2016 was pertinent in terms of translated fiction. The Independent Foreign Fiction Prize joined forces with the Man Booker International (MBI) Prize, which changed in character and criteria into a prize exclusively for fiction in English translation—awarding £50,000 (around Rs40 lakh) for the winning title, to be shared equally between the author and the translator. South Korean writer Han Kang and her translator, Smith, bagged the inaugural MBI Prize for The Vegetarian (Portobello Books), a disturbing three-part novella delving into the subjects of madness, desire and the rejection of social conventions.\n\nA year earlier, Smith had set up Tilted Axis Press (TAP), a not-for-profit focused on publishing Asian language literature, which started functioning in full swing in 2016. Research—commissioned by the MBI Prize, and conducted by Nielsen Book—revealed a near doubling in translated fiction sales figures in the UK between 2001 and 2016, from 1.3 million to 2.5 million copies.\n\nOne may credit this overall curiosity for, and consumption of, translated tales to the success of Scandinavian noir, or even the Italian literary sensation Elena Ferrante, but there’s something to be said for the UK pointing its compass towards languages and literature from the Asian continent—from Korean, Thai and Japanese to Bengali and Kannada.\n\nTranslator Deborah Smith at JLF 2017. Photo: Priyanka Parashar/Mint\n\nAsian exports\n\nTo say that The Vegetarian was seminal in carving a space for contemporary Korean literature would be an understatement. Smith has since translated Han Kang’s Human Acts (2016), and the forthcoming The White Book—both published by Portobello Books, an imprint of Granta Books. TAP has supported other Seoul-born writers such as Han Yujoo, whose genre-and mind-bending The Impossible Fairytale (2017) was translated by Janet Hong, and is considered a literary force.\n\nTAP has also travelled to Thai terrain, publishing the first-ever modern Thai fiction in English in the UK; author-translator-publisher-graphic designer Prabda Yoon’s collection of Bangkok-based playful and postmodern short stories, The Sad Part Was (2017), won an English PEN Translates grant, and was translated by Mui Poopoksakul. Yoon’s readers can expect plenty of pop-culture references and unexpected punctuation styles. Another English PEN Translates Award winner is The Accusation: Forbidden Stories From Inside North Korea (2017, Serpent’s Tail), written by a pseudonymous dissident writer, and also translated by Smith. Written in secret between 1989 and 1995, and smuggled out of the country in 2013, this collection of short works is a brave critique of the state.\n\nEarlier this year, Strangers Press at the University of East Anglia (UEA), Writers’ Centre Norwich, and Norwich University of Art and Design collaborated on a collection of Japanese chapbooks, Keshiki: New Voices From Japan. The series was edited by Elmer Luke (New York) and David Karashima (Tokyo), and “we wanted the whole publication process to be a kind of ‘cultural exchange’,\" says Nathan Hamilton, publisher at Strangers Press. Indeed, the cover illustrations were designed with the same impulse—“drawing on a number of influences from both sides of the world, a ‘fusion-design’ if you will,\" he adds.\n\nThe Keshiki bundle was initially printed in a limited run of 500 per chapbook, says Hamilton, but may be reprinted “given the wonderful response\". Smith is currently editing a Korean follow-up series to this successful project.\n\nFrom the subcontinent, Sangeeta Bandyopadhyay’s Panty (2016) was showered with praise. Translated from the Bengali by Arunava Sinha, this is an erotic and enigmatic tale of a woman who arrives in Kolkata, finds a pair of leopard-print panties, and fantasizes about their former owner.\n\nTAP will also publish Bandyopadhyay’s next novel, Abandon, this autumn; Smith says “TAP will be publishing Sangeeta (and Arunava) continuously\", and they’re currently considering other translations from Hindi, Urdu and Tamil.\n\nAnd, of course, there’s Shanbhag’s Bengaluru-based domestic drama, Ghachar Ghochar. When translating the Indian edition, Perur was mindful of “how we use English as an Indian language\"; this, he thought, “would give the translation some sort of warmth and immediacy\". He then made minor edits for the international editions to spell things out further for a wider audience.\n\nKorean writer Han Kang with her book. Photo: Reuters\n\nFluorescent dreams\n\nAlthough the remarkable recent Asian arrivals on the literary landscape in the UK are cause for celebration, publishers and translators continue to caution against the pitfalls of the publishing industry and overemphasis on literary prizes, and champion the need for better representation. Only one Asian language book, Yan Lianke’s The Explosion Chronicles, featured on this year’s MBI longlist.\n\nSmith was disappointed that Ghachar Ghochar, as well as Indonesian author Eka Kurniawan, missed out on the MBI, adding that “this year, less than 15% of the books submitted for the MBI were from Asia\"—the only two from the subcontinent being Ghachar Ghochar and Panty. Perur, however, cautions that “not all good literature exports well\", and that “it would be folly for us to begin valuing our writing in terms of its receptions in the US or Europe, or in terms of international prizes\".\n\nBoth agree, however, that it finally comes down to funding. Perur points out the asymmetry and selectivity. “What literature gets read in translation is also determined by resources—for example, state-funded organizations from Europe routinely subsidize translators and publishers so that their literature is more visible globally,\" he says.\n\nSmith also points out that the majority of UK presses that focus (exclusively) on translation are not-for-profit, and while there are strong programmes in place for a handful of Asian countries (South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, non-mainland China), there are none for the rest, “meaning we have to rely on English PEN—but the maximum you can get from them is two books per year. So for the long term, there will only ever be a tiny number of Asian translations published in this country.\"\n\nPerur is hesitant to consider “Asian literature\" or “Asian languages\" as a coherent category, and rightly so. But maybe the construct is less an effort to homogenize—obviously, Kannada and Korean are linguistic and cultural worlds apart—and more to collectively highlight these fresh and not-so familiar voices in global contexts.\n\nFaber senior designer Luke Bird’s explanation for his cover design for Ghachar Ghochar best describes this: “The pink/purple tone is printed in a screamingly bright fluorescent Pantone ink,\" he says. These books are bold, beautiful, and border-expanding—from cover to content—and they are screaming out loud for a space in worlds beyond their own.",
  "latent_23526": "Editor’s note: Tadhg Kelly is a veteran game designer, creator of leading game design blog What Games Are and creative director of Jawfish Games. You can follow him on Twitter here.\n\nHere are some numbers to chew on:\n\n2012 also marked the Xbox’s biggest year for entertainment and games usage. Users enjoyed more than 18 billion hours of entertainment in 2012, with entertainment app usage growing 57 percent year over year globally. Last year in the United States, Xbox LIVE Gold members averaged 87 hours per month on Xbox, an increase of 10 percent year over year.\n\nThat entertainment number sounds very impressive, and, yet, only Microsoft seems to think so. That’s because it’s not. There are 76 million Xboxes out there, 24 million Kinects and 46 million Xbox Live users. 18 billion hours of “entertainment” (which I’m going to assume is mostly video services like Netflix and ESPN) breaks down to 236 hours per machine per year. Put another way, that means about two movies per week per machine. Or, if you want to just think in terms of the Xbox LIVE crowd, three movies per week.\n\nMoreover, I think the 18 billion number is soft, much as the idea that the PS2 would own DVD proved soft. All it will really take for Microsoft to lose that ground is for cable providers to make better boxes, or Apple to actually advertise the Apple TV (5.3 million sold with no push whatsoever). This despite having hundreds of partnerships, simulcast content, HD output, Sky TV in the UK et-cet-era. Those 76 million Xboxes took an awfully long time to put together (the Xbox 360 is more than seven years old). To put that in context, Sony’s PlayStation 2 sold 130 million machines. In a smaller time period, Apple has sold more than half a billion iOS devices, including more than 100 million iPads. And, not to be unfair to Microsoft, the picture is very similar for Sony’s PlayStation 3. Remember when it was the machine that was supposed to drive Blu-ray adoption?\n\nI bring all of this up to talk about a particular delusion that both companies (and to a lesser extent, Nintendo with the Wii U) have fallen into. In the MicroSony paradigm, the world is filled to bursting with feature-loving media customers. These “medians” want nothing more than to own a single device that serves you games, movies, music, social networking, status updating, showing off, books, podcasts, avatars, phone calls, video calls, holographic calls, interwebs, emails and so on. They’re out there, just waiting to be tantalised with exactly the right suite of features, and they will come in their droves.\n\nAnd yet, while both can talk as long and as loudly about living-room strategies, wedge strategies, battles for the living room and moving beyond just games, customers continue to buy Xboxes and PlayStations to play games. While both can get very excitable about video cameras, connectivity, streamed media and so on, nobody gives a good goddamn about the vast majority of those features. If anything, they are voicing their displeasure through supporting leaner microconsoles like OUYA. Yet the powers that be in Redmond and Japan are simply not listening.\n\nIt’s worse than just a lack of focus. The issue for both is that they have largely run out of compelling platform stories. They either don’t believe that there is anything more to the gamer market than they have already captured, or that they have no meaningful way to attract them any more. So, like the Tom Waits song “Step Right Up,” wherein he recites a laundry list of features for a product (“it fillets, it chops, it dices, slices, never stops, lasts a lifetime, mows your lawn…”), for both big-M and big-S, life is about seeing just how many boondoggles and doohickeys they can staple to their platforms. Those days of courting the lifestyle gamer, the passionate gamer and the indie gamer? Long gone.\n\nAll in the hope of attracting a median dollar that is more mirage than reality. Perhaps the most poignant article on this subject is Nat Brown’s “Stupid, Stupid xBox!!“. Brown – one of the original engineers behind the console, who even dreamed up its name – lambasts Microsoft thoroughly for making deep dives on features that nobody cares about (and, in my opinion, are mostly poorly executed) and navigation systems that are unusable (again, agree – the Xbox dashboard gets worse with every major iteration) while failing to solve the obvious problems in front of them.\n\nThe main problem, as Brown sees it, is the ham-fisted way in which Microsoft handles independent development and relies on big partnerships. While you can easily build an app for mobile, tablet or PC these days, building for Xbox is impossible unless you have a lot of money and partner-level relationships with the platform. Your game will, at best, end up in a graveyard hidden under 100 tonnes of nonsense. Even the portrayal of the Xbox 360 as seen in Indie Game: The Movie (which is not kind) is like some shining reverie of the past compared to the modern version.\n\nOf course we do tend to sometimes converge on devices, such as the PC, the tablet and the smartphone. This is largely to do with either necessity (we need a family computer) or convenience (why carry a walkman and phone when my smartphone can save pocket space) or both (tablets). Manufacturers mistake this for a desire for features, inferring that there must be other markets out there that want all of their stuff under one lid. But they don’t really. Regular users dislike cruft, and they actively hate the sensation of being jerked around.\n\nThe PC has always lived with this tension, and smartphones are showing signs of it, too. These devices attract several groups of people whose use cases are very different, and so each has gripes. For some, one interface goes too far, while for others not far enough. The word-processor-and-email user just wants a simple computer to do that and finds the techie side frustrating. The gamer wants power, and for the operating system and other software to get out of the way. The programmer wants something different again. So too the graphics artist. Arguably the big reason why iPads are so popular is that they are much simpler than PCs, drawing the word/mail crowd away. Meanwhile the gamers are still sticking with their power PCs but couldn’t care less about Windows 8.\n\nWhile game consoles certainly seem as though they could be the ur-box that sits under your TV and converges everything, that vision is one which has been in front of users for a long time, yet they just don’t care. When Sony lifts the lid on the PS4 next week, and Microsoft presumably does something similar at GDC for Xbox, we will know more about their concrete plans for the future. We expect that both will be long on waffle about entertainment applications, especially Microsoft, and the awesome power of using Internet Explorer on your telly.\n\nMy prediction has long been that the console that convinces gamers that it’s really just about games and focuses on executing for that is the one that will win. We already know that Nintendo has laid a big egg with Wii U (sadly), and that means the market is wide open. So the question is whether the other two will fail to capitalise or not. Thus far neither of the other two major platform holders is doing that, which is why smart eyes are starting to look to microconsoles instead.",
  "latent_23700": "Photograph by Andrew Hetherington for Fortune\n\nThe Trader Seeking Revenge Against U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara David Ganek lost his hedge fund after getting caught up in an insider trading investigation. Now he’s suing. The anger is always lurking just below the surface for David Ganek. And as the pugnacious money manager begins to recount the events that led him to lose his hedge fund business, his influence as a patron of contemporary art, his status in Manhattan society, and some of his longtime friends, it threatens to boil over. We’re sitting in a large conference room in Ganek’s office on the 45th floor of a Midtown Manhattan office building, just a few blocks away from where he used to preside over the $4 billion Level Global Investors fund. Ganek took the space a few years ago as a home base for managing his own portfolio and overseeing his charitable work. But it still has a temporary feel, as if he’s just camping out. There isn’t the chic modern art on the walls that one might expect from a noted collector, as Ganek has been for years. And the quiet is almost eerie. Other than the receptionist, there doesn’t appear to be anyone else around. It feels strangely still for a natural-born trader who used to live his work 24/7, monitoring a “constant ticker tape of communication.” These days Ganek, 53, spends much of his energy plotting his revenge on the federal authorities he accuses of wronging him. And the more we delve into his favorite subject—his legal case—the more agitated he becomes. “If the government’s misconduct didn’t make me furious, I wouldn’t have filed the lawsuit,” he says, his body tensing and his voice rising. “But that’s good news and bad news for me. I filed the lawsuit because it makes me so furious.” He pauses and adds, “As much hell as I went through, if the system works as I have every reason to believe it does, it will be even more hell for them, given the severity of their misconduct.” Photo: Jesse Dittmar—Redux The primary target of Ganek’s ire is Preet Bharara, the powerful U.S. Attorney for the extremely powerful Southern District of New York (SDNY). In early 2015, Ganek filed a lawsuit against Bharara, as well as 14 other current and former FBI agents and prosecutors. Ganek’s chief allegation is that the defendants, including Bharara, used false evidence about him when, in the midst of their crackdown on insider trading, they got a search warrant to raid his fund, Level Global. The raid, which happened in 2010, made headlines around the world. “The Day of Hedge Fund Reckoning,” the New York Observer called it. Ganek’s suit has set up a potentially explosive confrontation—one that reads like an episode of the Showtime drama Billions—between an unlikely set of characters. And the implications for the chief protagonists on each side could be profound on both personal and professional fronts. Ganek’s motivations appear elemental: redemption and payback. Until Bharara came along, Ganek was a prototypical master of the universe. Although he was never charged with a crime, the raid, with its connotation of guilt, says Ganek, spooked his investors and left people whispering about his reputation. Now his mission, maybe even his obsession, is taking down the man he thinks wrecked his life. For Bharara, the lawsuit is a blow to the reputation of a once unimpeachable office—one that has already seen its prestige take some hits. The formidable federal prosecutor led the SDNY to a string of unprecedented victories on insider-trading cases after his appointment in 2009. But in 2014 an appeals court not only reversed two of Bharara’s most prominent convictions—including that of Ganek’s junior partner—but also delivered a broadside to Bharara himself, citing the “doctrinal novelty” of the SDNY’s approach. (The ruling was seen as a damaging precedent that would impair future enforcement of laws against insider trading, but a recent Supreme Court decision in another case has cheered prosecutors. For more, see the box below.) Insider-Trading Law: A Supreme Court Ruling Gives Prosecutors a Boost In December, the Supreme Court handed down its first ruling about insider trading in more than two decades. It affirmed the conviction of a grocery wholesaler named Bassam Salman, who traded on tips from his banker brother-in-law, making hundreds of thousands of dollars in the process. Lawyers for Salman pointed to the precedent set in the overturned convictions of traders Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson in 2014. They argued that because Salman’s brother-in-law didn’t receive any financial benefit from passing information, it wasn’t insider trading. For more on Todd Newman, see “The Hedge Fund Trader Who Beat the Feds.” That argument failed to fly with the justices. In a unanimous ruling the court found that giving a gift of tradable information to a friend or relative creates a benefit even if no cash or goodies change hands. “[T]he tipper benefits personally because giving a gift of trading information is the same thing as trading by the tipper followed by a gift of the proceeds,” wrote Justice Samuel Alito. The decision was hailed by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York, who called it a matter of common sense. Observers predict the ruling could renew the appetite of prosecutors, cowed by the Newman ruling, to pursue insider-trading cases. But while the Supreme Court decision called into question a significant part of the Newman ruling, it does not necessarily suggest the outcome of that case should have been different. Unlike the grocer and his brother-in-law, the hedge fund bosses at the center of it were several steps removed from those who used the confidential information. Bottom line: Insider trading is still a gray area, but prosecutors are back in business. —Jeff John Roberts If Ganek’s case moves into discovery, it threatens to shed a very public and ugly light on the process prosecutors use to put people in jail. After meeting with President-elect Donald Trump in late November, Bharara announced that he had “agreed to stay on” as the head of the SDNY. That means he will still be in office as the lawsuit plays out. Adding to the high-profile nature of the case is Ganek’s surprising partner in his crusade—his celebrity attorney, Barry Scheck. Scheck, who played himself in the CBS drama series The Good Wife, is the rumpled lawyer still best known to many Americans as a member of the team that defended O.J. Simpson against murder charges in the early 1990s. He’s also the cofounder of the Innocence Project, which uses DNA evidence to exonerate people of crimes for which they were wrongfully convicted. Scheck is not, as Ganek says, someone who is typically “into protecting the rights of hedge fund managers.” When asked if he ever thought he would represent a hedgie, Scheck offers a blunt “No.” But he argues that what happened to Ganek speaks to a deeper problem with all-powerful prosecutors who can serve as jury, judge, and executioner. “This is an issue of principle and professionalism,” he says. Photo: Monica Schipper—Getty Images Neither the defendants, including Bharara, nor the SDNY will comment. But in legal filings, Bharara’s office has called Ganek’s allegations “grandiose,” “farfetched,” and “wholly implausible.” Lawsuits against federal prosecutors are rare, and the bar is high for cases alleging this kind of government misconduct. However, last spring, Judge William Pauley allowed the suit to move forward. “Discovery is now appropriate to ascertain whether this case is about a simple misunderstanding or whether something more troubling was afoot,” he wrote in his opinion. Bharara then took the unusual step—available only to the government—of appealing Pauley’s decision, which has put discovery on hold. In late November the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), a professional bar association for public defenders and private criminal defense lawyers, filed a brief supporting Ganek’s case, noting that while it isn’t in a position to comment on the underlying merits of Ganek’s charges, the “allegations as detailed … describe a serious case of misconduct,” and a lawsuit is the only means by which they will even get heard. “In many respects, this case is extraordinary,” wrote the NACDL. “It’s not every day that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York is alleged to be so directly involved in the allegations underlying a civil rights lawsuit.” Ganek worries about some form of retribution. But he relishes the chance for the whole world to hear the details of his story—the ones he replays over and over in his head. “As much as people think it’s crazy to poke the bear,” he says, “it’s much more productive poking than being poked.”\n\nWHEN BHARARA took office in August 2009, his predecessor at the SDNY had already gotten wiretaps on Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Galleon Group. That October, FBI agents arrested Rajaratnam at his multimillion-dollar Manhattan apartment. (Rajaratnam would be convicted in 2011.) Bharara said the arrest should serve as a “wake-up call” for hedge fund managers, adding, “We are targeting white-collar insider-trading rings with the same powerful investigative tools that have worked so successfully against the mob and drug cartels.” Some cynics saw Bharara’s aggressive insider-trading prosecutions as a ploy to distract from the government’s failure to prosecute anyone in the wake of the financial crisis. But Bharara nonetheless gained enormous plaudits in the media. Time put him on a 2012 cover under the headline “This Man Is Busting Wall Street.” It soon became common knowledge on Wall Street that Bharara and his team had their sights on an even bigger target than Rajaratnam: Steve Cohen, the multibillionaire founder of hedge fund SAC Capital and David Ganek’s former boss. That put Ganek right in the firing line. (In 2013, Cohen’s fund, SAC Capital, pleaded guilty to criminal charges of insider trading, paid a $1.8 billion fine, and stopped managing money for outside investors. Cohen will be free to take on outside investors again in 2018.) For more on Steve Cohen, see “Inside Billionaire Steve Cohen’s Comeback.” The son of a prominent Manhattan money manager, Ganek had worked in finance since graduating from Franklin & Marshall College in 1985. It was all he had ever wanted to do. In 1996, he went to work for Cohen, just as SAC was beginning a run of spectacular returns that made Cohen a legend in the industry. Ganek became one of the firm’s biggest moneymakers, thanks in part to shorting the technology bubble before it burst in 2000. In 2003 he left SAC with a junior partner named Anthony Chiasson to start his own fund. He named it Level Global, with the idea that it would produce stable returns through times both good and bad. Ganek didn’t shy away from the spotlight that came with his immense financial success. In 2006 he joined the board of the Guggenheim Museum. He and his wife, Danielle, a former fashion-editor-turned-novelist, reportedly paid $19 million to purchase a duplex that had once belonged to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis at 740 Park Avenue, Manhattan’s most gilded address and the same building where Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and Treasury Secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin live. Ganek and his wife were regulars on the party circuit, and they also bought the requisite estate in the Hamptons, where they threw charity bashes for hundreds of people. Photograph by Andrew Hetherington for Fortune He says it wasn’t deliberate, but Ganek also did his part to help create the cliché of the hedge fund manager who dabbles in art. He had begun collecting back in 1981, he says, long before doing so became de rigueur for hedgies. He and Cohen shared the same adviser, and at various times, Ganek owned works by artists beloved by the hedge fund set: Damien Hirst, Richard Prince, Cindy Sherman, and Jeff Koons. At Level Global, Ganek did not earn a reputation as a likable boss. When I ask a former senior employee if Ganek was a bad guy, this person responds, “No. He is the worst guy ever.” But it was an issue of personality, not ethics. There were complaints that Ganek was cheap when it came to bonus time, and he could have a vicious temper. The former employee nevertheless says that Ganek was conservative when it came to compliance, with a strict set of internal rules. “There was never pressure to get close to the line,” this person says. Another employee says that Ganek was a tough boss but adds that the hedge fund business is itself a tough one, filled with prickly personalities, and that Ganek was always fair. This person seconds the notion that Level Global did deep research and was not a fund that was driven by a quest for edge. Ganek shrugs off criticism of his style: “It wasn’t my objective to be liked by everyone.” But he says that everyone was paid a bonus. And he stresses that even after the raid only one employee left the fund before Level Global shut down. Likable or not, Ganek built a solid business. Level Global didn’t blow the lights out, but it fulfilled its promise of balanced performance. Over seven years it produced an average annual return net of fees of 12%, and it even weathered the financial crisis of 2008 with only small losses. By 2010, Ganek, who had started with around $500 million, was managing some $4 billion. He had 60 employees, and earlier that year he had sold a piece of his business to Goldman Sachs gs in a deal that valued his company at $400 million. Then came the Nov. 22, 2010, raid on Level Global, along with two other hedge funds, including the $5 billion Diamondback Capital Management, co-managed by Steve Cohen’s brother-in-law Richard Schimel. (Schimel was never charged with a crime.) “There wasn’t a day of my life up until the minute this happened that I ever thought something like this could happen,” says Ganek. “It was unimaginable.” Indeed, in a typical insider-trading investigation, prosecutors subpoena records and conduct a methodical probe. The government’s decision to raid the three funds was a dramatic deviation from its usual procedure. “There wasn’t a day of my life that I ever thought something like this could happen,” says Ganek. “It was unimaginable.” The Fourth Amendment provides protection from “unreasonable searches and seizures,” so to get a judge to sign a search warrant for, say, an individual’s office, the government has to present a sworn affidavit, demonstrating that there is probable cause to believe incriminating evidence will be found there. A raid doesn’t mean the individual is guilty. But practically speaking, it often gets interpreted that way, particularly in a white-collar case. Ganek, along with Chiasson and one other employee, was personally named on the warrant. Along with all the documents in Ganek’s office and his personal cell phone, the agents carted off Ganek’s list of artwork and a folder labeled “S/A/C/ Correspondence.” The media seized on the story. “Targeted Hedge Funds Are Toast,” blared the New York Post, which noted that investors would run at the first sign of trouble. The day after the raid was Danielle’s birthday, and Ganek remembers trying desperately to remain stoic through dinner at Manhattan’s Palm restaurant with his wife and three children. He knew his reputation had just taken a major hit. “I also knew that there wasn’t anything I could do about it,” he says. “It would be like blowing into a tornado.” For Ganek, it kicked off a dark period, marked by an uncertainty that was particularly maddening for the trader. “The worst thing for market participants is fear of the unknown,” he says. “Once you know what it is, you can take action. But that’s not the way the government plays ball.” Being named on a search warrant doesn’t give you the right to see the underlying affidavit or to learn anything about what the government’s case against you might be. For that, you have to wait until you’re charged. But investors weren’t willing to be patient. Their capital was at risk and they wanted to know if Ganek had been named on the warrant. When he couldn’t say no, they began to pull out their money. Ganek tried desperately to save his business. On Dec. 20, a month after the raid, his lawyers met with representatives of the SDNY, including Rich Zabel, then the chief of the criminal division, and David Leibowitz, a prosecutor on the case. Ganek’s legal team pressed the prosecutors on whether or not they were sure of their facts and emphasized that the uncertainty was dooming Ganek’s fund. According to Ganek’s lawsuit, Zabel and Leibowitz informed Level Global’s lawyers that the commercial consequences of the raid “had been carefully considered at the highest levels.” There was some history between Ganek and Zabel. Rich Zabel’s father is William Zabel, a name partner in the law firm Shulte Roth & Zabel, which specializes in doing work for hedge funds. But more to the point in Ganek’s mind: He and Rich Zabel were rivals on the squash court. Photo: Eric Thayer—Reuters Squash has been a key part of Ganek’s life. He played at Franklin & Marshall, where he was the captain of the team, and he remains devoted to the sport. (In early 2014, he donated $2 million to the U.S. Squash program to fund the hiring of a national coach for the first time.) Zabel, meanwhile, captained the squash team at Princeton and won two national championships by the time he graduated in 1983. Through their families, both were members of Manhattan’s private Harmonie Club. Ganek says the two faced off against each other in the finals of the Harmonie Club squash championship multiple times between 1985 and 2000, and the rivalry was fierce. Zabel won’t comment, but Ganek says the antagonism between the two was long-standing and mutual—and a conflict of interest for Zabel. “Shouldn’t he have recused himself?” Ganek asks. Several lawyers I spoke with, however, didn’t consider past squash showdowns to be a problem. In a last-ditch effort, Ganek hired another lawyer who had a personal relationship with Bharara. Ganek says this lawyer told him that if an internal investigation found that Ganek was clean, he would personally appeal to Bharara. On Feb. 4, 2011, this lawyer met with Bharara, and asked him to provide assurances that Ganek wasn’t at risk of being charged. Bharara responded that he was “unable to do anything … that would help Level Global,” according to Ganek. With his investors continuing to bail, on Feb. 11, 2011, Ganek announced that he was shutting down Level Global. He set up a new family office to trade his own money and named it Apocalypse 22 after a word painting by Christopher Wool he had once owned called Apocalypse Now.\n\nIT WASN’T UNTIL early 2012, well over a year after the raid, that the government indicted Ganek’s junior partner, Anthony Chiasson, and others, including Todd Newman, a trader at Diamondback. That’s when it came out that a former junior employee at Level Global named Sam Adondakis, who had been forced to leave in the spring of 2010 for compliance reasons, was cooperating with the government. The government alleged that Adondakis and others were part of a long chain—even Adondakis was several steps removed from the sources—who were getting information passed to them from company insiders at Dell and Nvidia nvda . Ganek wasn’t charged. But Chiasson’s lawyers were thinking about asking Ganek to testify, and the judge allowed the affidavit to be disclosed to the defendants and prospective witnesses. That’s when Ganek learned that, according to the affidavit, Adondakis had told the government that he had provided inside information to Ganek, that Ganek had traded on it, and, critically, that Adondakis had “informed Ganek of the sources of the inside information.” (You can’t be guilty of insider trading unless you knew, or should have known, that an insider breached his or her fiduciary duty.) There were no specifics, and although the affidavit was 32 pages long, Ganek wasn’t mentioned anywhere else. Photo: Brandon McDermid—Reuters Sources close to Chiasson say that he likened being indicted to “being buried alive,” and also say that he was repeatedly told that he could get leniency if he cooperated with the investigation—and if he gave the government Ganek. But despite immense pressure, he did neither. As Chiasson’s case headed to trial in the fall of 2012, what Ganek calls his “well-built life” began to crumble. “It wasn’t, ‘Your kids can’t play with mine,’ but you quickly found out who your friends were,” he says. “A lot of friends and business contacts wouldn’t take calls from me. I was told they were afraid I was wearing a wire. They cut me out of their lives.” He began to adjust to his new reality. Ganek is still very well off, and he continues to work and invest privately. But without hedge fund compensation, art has become more of a business than a pleasure for him. He has delayed plans to give his collection to a museum, and no longer feels like he can give the millions in cash and art that are expected with prominent board positions. In 2013, he stepped down from the board of the Guggenheim. “New York is a very transactional town,” Soros told Ganek. “If your transaction has gone bad, it’s a very tough place to be.” One of the more interesting meetings Ganek had after his fund shuttered was with the multi-billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros, with whom he plays backgammon. “He was kind enough to reach out and invite me to dinner,” says Ganek. “He asked me how I was doing in New York. I said it was tough. It’s a hard place to have public problems. He said, ‘New York is a very transactional town. If your transaction has gone bad, it’s a very tough place to be.’ ” “Think about it,” says Danielle Ganek. “Is there anything more devastating to a person’s soul than a false accusation? My husband was never actually [charged with] anything, but in a very public and loud fashion the question was deliberately raised. It was very painful.”\n\nWHEN CHIASSON’S TRIAL finally began, Ganek’s pain turned to shock. He was stunned to learn that a critical allegation supporting the government’s warrant appeared to be false. When Adondakis was put on the stand, he said he had never told Ganek that the information was coming directly from contacts at Dell. And an FBI agent corroborated that statement. “Mr. Adondakis did not say that he told Mr. Ganek that the Dell information was coming from a source inside Dell,” the agent testified. Although both Chiasson and Newman were convicted, that trial turned out to be what Ganek calls “the peak of the bubble for prosecutorial victories.” The two traders immediately appealed; their convictions were overturned two years later, in December 2014. At this point, it all could have been over. “Most people would slink off into the corner and lick their wounds,” says John Carroll, a Skadden Arps lawyer and former SDNY prosecutor who represented Ganek. Ganek didn’t think he had much left to lose. In his view, he had lost his business because of false information in an affidavit. As he thought about it, his outrage grew. Even if it had initially been just a mistake, wouldn’t the prosecutors, up to Bharara, have discovered and fixed the error when pressed by his lawyers to be sure of their facts? Photo: Peter Foley—Bloomberg via Getty Images But the outright false information in the affidavit wasn’t the only issue. The way it was written was also misleading, argues Ganek’s lawsuit. The affidavit justified the raid in part by stating that a hedge fund was destroying evidence of insider trading. If you read it quickly, you would think the fund in question must be one of those that was to be raided. But in fact, it was a tiny two-man shop with no connections to any of the firms that were raided on Nov. 22, 2010. Furthermore, says Ganek, none of the information the government got during the raid of Level Global was used in the indictment. (The government ultimately got the information used to indict Chiasson the traditional way—via subpoenas.) In Ganek’s mind, the unjustness of the raid, combined with what he sees as the illegality of putting his name on the search warrant, turned into a bitter stew. “All of these things combined, for better or for worse, to make me unable to let go,” he says. So Ganek began to talk to lawyers. They all advised him to leave it alone. “You are taking on the biggest machine you can take on,” the attorneys told him, “and this machine plays dirty.” And in a business where relationships with prosecutors are part of your currency, few lawyers were willing to take on the SDNY. Then he had a phone call with Barry Scheck. Ganek was thinking about giving money to the Innocence Project. He mentioned his own case, and Scheck invited him in to talk to his team. Everyone in the meeting was skeptical at first, but as he talked Ganek could feel the mood in the room changing. Soon after, Ganek hired Scheck and sued. What Ganek really wants to know is this: If Adondakis never implicated Ganek, then how did an affidavit stating the opposite get written, and why didn’t it get fixed? “There are a lot of times where clients feel wronged by the government,” says Nancy Gertner, a former federal judge and professor at Harvard who is working with Scheck on Ganek’s case. “But it’s rare where there is proof. This is a terribly important case with a unique set of facts.” Scheck says the SDNY had a “duty to correct” the affidavit just as it would to correct testimony in a case if advances in DNA science changed conclusions about the evidence in a case. Ganek’s lawyers are sure that discovery will show that there was a deliberate fabrication. Ganek is convinced that he was targeted not because of anything he did, but because of his connection to Cohen and because of what he represented. “The destruction of our business went into their pocket as a different kind of capital—as political capital, as magazine covers, as lucrative jobs in the private sector,” he says. (In an irony of sorts, Zabel is now the general counsel for hedge fund powerhouse Elliott Management.) But, Ganek adds, “by putting me out of business they’ve also put me in a position where I can say things that other people think but can’t say.” He is hardly Bharara’s only critic. Most recently, Judge Valerie Caproni chastised Bharara’s office, accusing him of orchestrating a “media blitz” around the prosecution of former New York state assembly speaker Sheldon Silver. “There is definitely a sense that Preet is a press hound,” says a former SDNY prosecutor. “And there is something to it. There’s declining patience on the bench and in the community.” More pointedly, Ganek and his advocates accuse Bharara of hypocrisy for not practicing what he preaches by conducting an investigation into how false information might have gotten into the affidavit. “Preet Bharara talks about how corporate leaders should react to employee wrongdoing by cleaning their houses,” says Carroll, the former SDNY prosecutor who represented Ganek. “Shouldn’t he take his own medicine and respond to this false affidavit by cleaning up his own house?” Bharara declined requests to comment for this story.",
  "latent_23723": "Picture this: A thin little girl—freckled, pigtails askew, barefoot—wearing a nightgown, holding a pistol in one hand and brandishing a sword with the other. No, it’s not Hit Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz‘s character in Kick Ass), nor an infant Lisbeth Salander. It’s how you first meet Pippi Longstocking, on the title page of Astrid Lindgren’s first Pippi Longstocking novel, illustrated by Louis S. Glanzman. Pippi is where Grrrl Power got its start, and if you’re interested in the ancestral line of “grrls” like Lisbeth Salander, Hit Girl, The Hunger Games‘ Katniss Everdeen, or the slew of other gritty girls from the past year in film and fiction, Pippi Longstocking is grandmother of them all.\n\nIn Lindgren’s children’s novels, first published in her native Sweden from 1945-48 and the US from 1950-57, and their Swedish film adaptations, starring the superb Inger Nilsson (1969-70), Pippi is a nine-year-old girl with superhuman strength, ingenuity, and self confidence, an endless supply of gold (from her pirate Papa), and a beautiful, shambly house named Villa Villekulla, where she lives by herself with her horse and Mr. Nilsson, a spider monkey (her mother is dead and her pirate father’s at sea). Like her most notable descendent, Lisbeth Salander, of Steig Larsson‘s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo franchise, Pippi is most easily recognized by her distinctive personal style: Pippi’s hair is the color of a carrot, and usually done in two braids that stick out on either side of her head; she wears patch-worked dresses of her own devising, mismatched stockings, a giant hat, and men’s boots twice the length of her feet. And her motto, which promises and delivers a happy ending in all of her adventures, is “I’ll always come out on top.” In both attitude and fashion sense, Pippi’s nearest American relation is the spunky 1980’s television character Punky Brewster (same wild pigtails, freckles, animal friends, outlandish clothes; a plucky can-do motto: “Punky Power!”).\n\nLindgren’s Pippi lives a child’s wonderland life: no school, no rules, no bedtime, animals in the house, as many sweets as she can eat, victorious encounters with bullies, burglars, police, and pirates, homemade aeroplanes and air-balloon beds that actually fly. Pippi is invincible, irrepressible, fearless: What she sets out to do, she achieves. She’s generous even in triumphing over the numerous bad men who think they can best her (her preferred method of dealing with the inevitably farcical villains who take her on is hanging them on walls or in trees). And she always wins: even when she—a puny-looking girl—is faced with a man-sized job, rescuing her father from a slew of pirates or wrestling the world’s strongest man.\n\nIf any of this triggers a twinge of familiarity, it may be because Stieg Larsson modeled Lisbeth Salander on Pippi Longstocking. According to Larsson’s Swedish publisher, Eva Gedin, Larsson imagined Lisbeth as a grown-up, darker version of Pippi. Of course, there are tonal differences: Though Lindgren’s Pippi never quite breaks the laws of physics, she’s an impossible creature, a fantasy of empowerment: rich, self-confident, unnaturally strong, perpetually delighted, never compromising, never defeated. Larsson’s plots may have their fantastic and implausible qualities–Salander is a fantasy of empowerment too, if a grittier one than Pippi–but Larsson’s books do aspire to a certain realism and are particularly interested in the reality that the best and the strongest, the most strong-willed, don’t win every battle (even if they win in the end). While Salander is locked in mental hospitals and children’s homes against her will, turned over to a monstrous guardian whose abuses she cannot thwart, Pippi informs the police officers who’ve come to take her as a ward, “You’ll have to get kids for your children’s home somewhere else. I certainly don’t intend to move there,” and uses a lively game of tag to strand them on her roof. She then carries the officers out of the yard by their belts, giving them cookies as a no-hard-feelings parting gift.\n\nPippi’s endlessly obliging world certainly isn’t Salander’s; Pippi is a children’s book heroine, after all. But Pippi and Salander do share a fundamental character trait: a deep sense of justice and courage in the pursuit of justice—very real, if increasingly rare, human qualities. In one of Pippi’s first adventures, she stands up to five boys bullying a younger boy. She interrupts the bullies’ taunting of the little boy and brings their taunts on herself. The bullies tease Pippi about her red hair and her clown shoes, but Pippi just smiles her friendliest smile and seems not to hear their taunts. This enrages the ringleader and he shoves her. So, Pippi calmly lifts the bully up and hangs him on a high tree branch, telling him, “I don’t think you have a very nice way with the ladies.”\n\nPippi is, here and elsewhere, Lisbeth Light (or perhaps the other way round: Lisbeth is Pippi R or X). Both heroines are good at putting dangerous men in their places and both feel a deep sympathy for underdogs and innocents. Pippi’s bully-hanging is the child’s version of Lisbeth’s often much more gruesome acts of justice: Lighting her father on fire in an attempt to protect her mother from him; Taking on the Harriet Vanger case, not for personal gain, but out of a deep hatred of violence against women, a desire to see justice served—and, like Pippi, Lisbeth serves her justice by herself. But with Lindgren’s books—if you’ve got children to read to or if you can still muster a child’s delighted sense of limitless possibility—there’s a purer, simpler pleasure to be had in Pippi than in Lisbeth. This goes without saying, maybe: There are no atrocities in Pippi Longstocking, no dead and mutilated women, no chance of feeling like a sadistic voyeur or that the book’s nominal feminism is actually a slick form of misogyny. But it’s more than that: Pippi is a breathtaking vision of boundless, uninhibited possibility, and pretty funny while she’s at it (so is the dubbing in the movies: Pippi’s friend Annika has a NY/NJ accent that’s to die for). Pippi’s impossible, yes, a fantasy, but she might help you remember what it was like to believe in possibility, in unlikely powers and triumphs. She might also help you imagine a world yet to come of little girls who aren’t Ophelias in need of reviving.\n\n“I can,” says Pippi, when a circus ringleader asks for a volunteer who thinks he can beat a towering, hulking strongman in a wrestling contest. “Oh, no, you couldn’t,” Pippi’s practical, goody-two-shoes friend Annika tells her, “he’s the strongest man in the world.” And Pippi cooly replies: “Man, yes, but I am the strongest girl in the world, remember that,” and climbs into the ring.\n\nGuess who wins.",
  "latent_23788": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Light arms supplied by the United States are flowing to “moderate” Syrian rebel factions in the south of the country and U.S. funding for months of further deliveries has been approved by Congress, according U.S. and European security officials.\n\nPeople stand on a street lined with damaged buildings in the besieged area of Homs January 27, 2014. REUTERS/Yazan Homsy\n\nThe weapons, most of which are moving to non-Islamist Syrian rebels via Jordan, include a variety of small arms, as well as some more powerful weapons, such as anti-tank rockets.\n\nThe deliveries do not include weapons such as shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles, known as MANPADs, which could shoot down military or civilian aircraft, the officials said.\n\nThe weapons deliveries have been funded by the U.S. Congress, in votes behind closed doors, through the end of government fiscal year 2014, which ends on September 30, two officials said.\n\nThe apparently steady weapons flow contrasts with the situation last summer, when lethal U.S. aid to the Syrian rebels dried up for a time due to congressional reservations.\n\nCongressional committees held up weapons deliveries for months over fears that U.S. arms would not prove decisive in the rebels’ efforts to oust President Bashar Assad and his government and could well end up in the hands of Islamist militants.\n\nA U.S. official familiar with recent developments said national security officials and members of Congress are more confident that weapons delivered to southern Syria are going to, and remaining in, the hands of moderate rebels rather than militant jihadist factions.\n\nCongress approved funding for weapons deliveries to the Syrian rebels in classified sections of defense appropriations legislation, two sources familiar with the matter said. It was not clear when the funding was approved, but unclassified defense funding passed Congress in late December.\n\nSome additional budget tweaks may be necessary to ensure that all the approved funding is fully available for disbursement during the current fiscal year.\n\nYet, officials who support providing U.S. arms to the rebels acknowledge that this has not greatly increased U.S. expectations of victory by anti-Assad forces, whether moderate or militant.\n\n“The Syrian war is a stalemate. The rebels lack the organization and weapons to defeat Assad; the regime lacks the loyal manpower to suppress the rebellion. Both sides’ external allies... are ready to supply enough money and arms to fuel the stalemate for the foreseeable future,” said Bruce Riedel, a former senior CIA analyst and sometime foreign policy adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nBoth U.S. and European officials said that “moderate” rebels had recently consolidated their positions in the Syrian south, where they are pushing out elements linked to al-Qaeda. More militant factions remain dominant in the north and east.\n\nAnother recent development favorable to more moderate factions is that Kurdish groups that had been providing weapons and other aid financed by donors in the Gulf state of Qatar indiscriminately to both moderate and religious extremist rebel factions had greatly reduced their involvement in the arms traffic, one of the officials said.\n\nA White House spokeswoman had no comment. Other U.S. agencies did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs for “non-lethal” aid like communications and transportation equipment, the United States hopes to resume deliveries to moderate groups in Syria soon, a U.S. official said on Monday.\n\nThe United States and Britain suspended non-lethal aid to northern Syria in December after reports that Islamist fighters seized Western-backed rebel weapons warehouses, highlighting fears that supplies could end up in hostile hands.\n\n“We hope to be able to resume assistance to the SMC shortly, pending security and logistics considerations,” said the official, referring to the Supreme Military Council moderate rebel group. “But we have no announcements at this time,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nNon-lethal aid was resumed to civilian groups in that region in late December.",

The observances culminate on Saturday, but the violence could continue as pilgrims return home.\n\nSecurity personnel also suffered massive casualties and, in the north, Kurdish targets were attacked.

  "latent_23897": "In a test that started on Monday and runs through Thursday, Disney World is requiring Hollywood Studios visitors to make advance reservations via the FastPass+ system if they want to hop aboard the popular Toy Story ride, an interactive “4D” attraction in which guests twist through a series of virtual carnival games while wearing 3D glasses. Normally, the wait time to ride Toy Story Mania can easily stretch over an hour, but the new reservation-only system means that Disney World guests won’t have the option of waiting it out in the standby queue.\n\nA Disney spokesperson explained to the Orlando Sentinel that extra FastPass+ reservations for Toy Story Mania would be available during the course of the experiment. On the one hand, the move means that no one will have to endure agonizingly long lines for the ride. The FastPass+ system gives riders a time window when they are to arrive and hop on in a jiffy. On the other hand, some worry that all of the available pass times could be snatched up as soon as they’re available, and those who don’t snag a reservation early in the day will be shut out from riding.\n\nWhat makes this four-day test potentially big news is that it could be a vision of how theme parks will operate on a broader scale in the future. Over the years, Walt Disney World and other theme parks have tweaked numerous policies that essentially kill spontaneity because they all but force guests to plot out plans for meals, rides, and more in advance. Disney guests have been instructed that if they want to bring their kids to a Character Breakfast or have dinner at one of the nicer park establishments, they should reserve weeks if not months before arrival. Likewise, the MyMagic+ wristband system introduced in early 2013 was created to help guests reserve meals, ride times, and more.\n\nWhen theme park guests aren’t waiting in lines for hours, they’re happier, which works out for Disney and park visitors alike. What works out especially brilliantly for Disney is that when guests aren’t waiting in lines, they’re free to roam about in the areas where they’re apt to spend more money, such as gift shops and restaurants. After all, you can’t buy overpriced souvenirs while you’re stuck waiting on line.\n\nIn a post at Theme Park Insider, most Disney fans seem opposed to reservation-only rides. “I want a vacation, for Christ’s sake, and if I have to plan everything in advance, then it’s simply not fun anymore,” one commenter stated, bashing the entire swath of policies pushing guests to plot minute-by-minute plans ahead of time. Still, another commenter noted that Toy Story Mania reservations are “definitely needed for the ride. The queues are longer than any other attraction in the Disney parks.”\n\nLove it or hate it, the shift to more reservations and less waiting in line seems like the way things are heading. “Everybody’s striving to improve the flow of the guest. That’s the wave of the future in our industry,” Dennis Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services, explained to the Orlando Sentinel. “It would not surprise me within the next 10 years that we see rides that are totally reserved.”",
  "latent_23909": "CLOSE Target said customers should use the restroom of the gender they identify with, and everyone seems to have an opinion about the decision. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nProtesters head into the Legislative building for a sit-in against House Bill 2 in Raleigh, North Carolina, Monday. While demonstrations circled North Carolina's statehouse, for and against a Republican-backed law curtailing protections for LGBT people and limiting public bathroom access for transgender people, House Democrats filed a repeal bill that stands little chance of passing. (Photo: Chuck Liddy, AP)\n\nTerrorism, education and jobs are the No. 1 concerns for many Americans.\n\nSo, what are we talking about today?\n\nBathrooms. And whether transgender people who want to relieve themselves in public restrooms where they're comfortable will do so primarily to attack you and/or your children there.\n\nFirst, in February, the Palm Bay City Council turned down a human rights ordinance to protect gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people from all sorts of business discrimination that is legal in Florida.\n\nThat same month, the Brevard Public Schools board tabled a non-discrimination and equal employment policy for LGBT people in Brevard Public Schools. Tuesday, the topic surfaced again at BPS, at a workshop revisiting the policy discussion. A 3-2 majority of school board members agreed a revised non-discrimination policy should come up for hearings and a vote.\n\nSomehow, it's an even bigger issue nationally.\n\nIn North Carolina, a new law requires transgender individuals to use public restrooms associated with the sex designated on their birth certificates. How that will be policed and enforced is anyone's guess.\n\nWhen Target announced recently that transgender employees and customers may use bathrooms and dressing rooms aligning with their gender identity, you'd have thought they'd allowed al-Qaida to set up shop by the diaper-changing station.\n\nSocial media blew up with memes and petitions. A reported 700,000-plus people have signed an American Family Association petition, threatening to boycott Target. Anita Staver, president of Liberty Counsel, announced on Twitter that her Glock will be her bodyguard in Target's bathroom.\n\nBoycott? OK. I still don't eat at Chick-fil-A because of their politics I find distasteful.\n\nBut boycotts based on bogeyman tales of bathroom predators are devious and dangerous. I'm much more concerned about being in a stall next to a Glock-toter who might find me masculine-looking. Or running out of TP with no one around to toss me a roll.\n\nNationwide, and in Florida, reports from cities and counties that passed nondiscrimination policies\n\nEven Donald Trump has addressed the transgender bathroom policy stink.\n\n\"People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate,\" the GOP presidential candidate told the \"Today\" show.\n\nBrevard native Gina Duncan, a transgender woman and transgender inclusion director for Equality Florida, was encouraged by this week's school board workshop. She was moved by Superintendent Desmond Blackburn's tear-inducing, \"amazing\" speech, which she thinks solidified support.\n\nAmong her observations:\n\nOverall, Florida is the most progressive state in the South — \"the best of the worst,\" says Duncan. \"The South is farthest behind, but Florida is doing better than the rest of the South. We have 36 human rights ordinances that protect almost 60 percent of our population against discoloration and we're working with school boards all over the state to adopt inclusive policies.\"\n\nStudies on a national and state level show no increases in public safety issues where such ordinances and policies have been put in place. There is not one instance, Duncan said, of a transgender person committing a crime in a bathroom that aligns with their gender ID.\n\nIf anyone's concerned about harassment or bullying, it's certainly transgender people, who simply want to use the restroom and go about their business.\n\nWhy the persistent toilet talk?\n\nDuncan's take is, the transgender community \"for the longest time, was always in the shadows,\" she said. \"We were the 'silent T.' Then, finally, the community felt with the progress of LGBT rights in general, and the passage of same-sex marriage, it was time to step out of the shadows and be part of the LGBT movement.\"\n\nThat, in turn, brought certain fears and issues into the spotlight, and some bad policy-making, she said.\n\n\"There's a judgment call ... how female-looking do you have to be to use a women's restroom?\" she asked. \"We all have friends, who through genetics, perhaps present as masculine in presentation and mannerisms. Lesbians who present as masculine will be challenged ... what it's doing is putting all women at risk.\"\n\nIt's far past time for inclusive non-discrimination policies that protect all people — and to end unwarranted harassment of transgender individuals regarding their bathroom usage.\n\nLet's flush this non-issue, and wave goodbye as it swirls down the drain.\n\nContact Britt Kennerly at 321-242-3692 or bkennerly@floridatoday.com. Follow her on Twitter @bybrittkennerly.\n\nWe asked readers: Have you ever been bothered by anyone in a public restroom?\n\nDenise Cisar: No. I have not even given it any thought until all this baloney about \"things that could possibly happen\" was brought up.\n\nMary Greene: No, I never have. Plus, if you are concerned for your children 1) go with them and 2) use the family restrooms available at so many stores, especially Target. I am much more concerned with the grown men who hang out near elementary schools, playgrounds, and school bus stops. Most parents don't think twice about that, do they?\n\nKen Previti: I was once bothered by a lack of toilet paper. That is a real issue and a real problem. Can Republican fundamentalist right-wing Christians and their elected officials do something about that very real tissue? I mean, issue. ISSUE.\n\nGina Wilson Beckles: Like it or not, some of you have been sharing restrooms with transgender people for years and you don't even know it!\n\nAmy Tidd: No.\n\nLaura Sakal Fausone: I used to work with kids who had been sexually assaulted. Most by their own fathers, step-fathers, or Mom's boyfriend. Not a homosexual or transsexual in the bunch molested these kids. Heterosexual men and idiotic women packing Glocks scare me more. I go to the grocery store and look around to see who's possibly carrying a gun. I abhor anything said by anyone from Liberty Counsel.\n\nTerry Sanders: No, not once. Never felt threatened or uncomfortable. But I can imagine feeling uncomfortable if someone who looked exactly like a man was forced to use the ladies room, like in North Carolina.\n\nVicki Ulrich Impoco: Anti-transgender initiatives like the \"bathroom issue\" perpetuate the myth that protecting transgender people’s access to restrooms endangers public safety and are manufactured purely for political purposes\n\nJennifer Ann Mueller: My favorite argument: \"the children.\" My counterpoint, get off your lazy butt and go with your child. I'm not nervous about it, either. I also don't see myself trying to figure out who's got what next stall over. Chill out, folks.\n\nMargaret Bihr: I am more concerned about perverts who plant spy cams in bathrooms than any transgender person using the stall next to me.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nMay 7, 2017, 3:16 PM GMT / Updated May 7, 2017, 10:36 PM GMT By Andrew Rafferty\n\nFormer Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina says lawmakers need to let the American people know what's in the Republican health care legislation.\n\nFiorina agreed with NBC News' Kate Snow, who noted in an interview with the former candidate that some Republicans had not read the GOP health care bill before it was passed last week.\n\n“Yeah, and they made the same mistake that Democrats did — remember [Rep. Nancy] Pelosi saying you have to pass the bill so we know what's in it?” Fiorina told Snow.\n\n“The American people need to know what's in this bill, just as they should have known what was in the Obamacare bill,” she added.\n\nFiorina was referring to Pelosi's 2010 comments about the Affordable Care Act when she said, “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy.” Pelosi came under fire from conservatives, but she has defended her remarks at the time, saying she meant that when people found out what was in the ACA, they would like it.\n\nThe former Hewlett-Packard CEO told NBC News that it would have been “preferable” for House Republicans to wait for the Congressional Budget Office to analyze the cost and provisions of the legislation before it was voted on. But, she added, \"On the other hand, momentum matters in something like this.”\n\nFiorina expressed confidence any flaws in the House bill will be fixed in the Senate.\n\n“[Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell has made it pretty clear that this is only the first step,\" Fiorina told Snow in the interview. \"But what I would advise is that Republicans in the House and in the Senate take the time to talk with the American people about what's in this bill and what it will mean for them.”\n\nRELATED: HHS chief Tom Price defends pre-existing coverage in the House bill\n\nFiorina ended her 2016 presidential run after garnering just four percent of the vote in the New Hampshire GOP primary. She later re-emerged as Ted Cruz’s runningmate in a last-ditch effort to derail then-candidate Donald Trump’s surging campaign.\n\nFiorina, who has moved to Virginia, told NBC New she is considering making a return to politics by running for Senate against Virginia Democrat and 2016 vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine.\n\n“One of the things that I'm weighing is whether or not his seat is winnable given given all the various opportunities in 2018,” she said. “Running as the runningmate for Hillary Clinton put him at odds with commitments that he made to the people of Virginia when he was running as their senator. And so it won't be a slam dunk for him either.”\n\nFiorina also discussed the recent work she has been doing on \"microfinance\" to help women entrepreneurs around the world.\n\n\"It began really with the initiative I launched in conjunction with the State Department and Condoleezza Rice called the 'One Woman Initiative,'\" she told NBC News. \"We were focused on helping grassroots women's organizations around the world lift women up. Provide them training in entrepreneurship, access to leadership training, access to justice, which women lack in so many parts of the world.\n\n\"Economies grow faster if women are engaged and yet it's also true that women don't always have the opportunity and the support and the tools,\" Fiorina added. \"Microfinance is one such tool to lift women out of poverty. Microfinance, of course, is giving very small amounts of money to very poor people ... And in my work with Opportunity International, one of the largest private microfinance organizations in the world, we lent $8 billion — $100 dollars at a time lifted millions of people out of poverty.\"",

  "latent_24472": "A former United Nations police officer is suing a British security firm over claims that it covered up the involvement of her fellow officers in sex crimes and prostitution rackets in the Balkans.\n\nKathryn Bolkovac, an American policewoman, was hired by DynCorp Aerospace in Aldershot for a UN post aimed at cracking down on sexual abuse and forced prostitution in Bosnia.\n\nShe claims she was 'appalled' to find that many of her fellow officers were involved. She was fired by the British company after amassing evidence that UN police were taking part in the trafficking of young women from eastern Europe as sex slaves.\n\nShe said: 'When I started collecting evidence from the victims of sex trafficking it was clear that a number of UN officers were involved from several countries, including quite a few from Britain. I was shocked, appalled and disgusted. They were supposed to be over there to help, but they were committing crimes themselves. When I told the supervisors they didn't want to know.'\n\nDynCorp sacked her, claiming she had falsified time sheets, a charge she denies. Last month she filed her case at Southampton employment tribunal alleging wrongful dismissal and sexual discrimination against DynCorp, the British subsidiary of the US company DynCorp Inc.\n\nDynCorp has the contract to provide police officers for the 2,100-member UN international police task force in Bosnia which was created to help restore law and order after the civil war.\n\nBolkovac has also filed a case against DynCorp under Britain's new Public Interest Disclosure Act designed to protect whistleblowers.\n\nAs well as reporting that her fellow officers regularly went to brothels, she also investigated allegations that an American police officer hired by DynCorp had bought a woman for $1,000.\n\nBolkovac's British lawyers say her evidence will highlight how the underground sex trade in Bosnia is thriving among the 21,000 Nato peacekeepers and thousands of international bureaucrats and aid workers.\n\nMany of the hundreds of women working in Bosnia's sex industry are lured from countries such as Romania and Ukraine with promises of jobs as waitresses but then delivered to brothel owners who confiscate their passports. Bolkovac claims that Dyncorp officers forged documents for trafficked women, aided their illegal transport through border checkpoints into Bosnia and tipped off sex club owners about raids.\n\nIn an email to more than 50 people - including Jacques Klein, the UN Secretary-General's special representative in Bosnia - Bolkovac described the plight of trafficked women and noted that UN police, Nato troops and international humanitarian employees were regular customers. It was shortly after this email went out that Bolkovac was reassigned.\n\nRichard Monk, a former senior British policeman who ran the UN police operation in Bosnia until 1999, has sympathy with her plight. He said: 'There were truly dreadful things going on by UN police officers from a number of countries. I found it incredible that I had to set up an internal affairs department to investigate complaints that officers were having sex with minors and prostitutes. The British officers were on the whole extremely good and very professional, setting a great example. But there were policeman from other countries who should not have been in uniform.'\n\nA DynCorp spokeswoman would not comment on the Bolkovac case because it was coming to court later this year. But in a earlier statement the company said: 'The notion that a company such as DynCorp would turn a blind eye to illegal behaviour by our employees is incomprehensible...We encourage our employees to be proactive in reporting inappropriate behaviour and commend those who follow our procedures by reporting it.'\n\nBolkovac's case is the second against DynCorp alleging misbehaviour in Bosnia. Air mechanic Ben Johnston is suing the company, alleging he was sacked because he had uncovered evidence that Dyncorp employees were involved in 'sexual slavery' and selling arms.\n\nSince 1998 eight Dyncorp employees have been sent back from Bosnia, but none have been prosecuted.",
  "latent_24504": "Pitchers and catchers officially reported to Maryvale Baseball Park on Friday for the Milwaukee Brewers. The first official workouts of 2016 took place yesterday, marking the end of the 2015-16 offseason. It was definitely a winter to remember as it was Brewers' General Manager David Stearns' first at the helm. Tasked with rebuilding the franchise into a consistent contender, Stearns hit the ground running and was perhaps the most active GM in baseball. He was dubbed \"Slingin' Stearns\" after completing three trades in three days early on in his tenure and he certainly lived up to that nickname throughout the offseason.\n\nOutgoing Free Agents\n\nC Nevin Ashley - signed MiLB deal with Mets\n\nOF Logan Schafer - signed MiLB deal with Nationals\n\nC Juan Centeno - signed MiLB deal with Twins\n\nRHP Johnny Hellweg - signed MiLB deal with Padres\n\n1B Matt Clark - currently free agent\n\nRHP Kyle Lohse - currently free agent\n\nINF Elian Herrera - signed MiLB deal with Dodgers\n\nWaiver Wire Activity\n\n10/4/15 - Brewers claim RHP Junior Guerra off waivers from White Sox\n\n12/7/15 - Dodgers claim OF Daniel Fields off waivers from Brewers\n\n12/7/15 - Marlins claim LHP Mike Strong off waivers from Brewers\n\n12/23/15 - Brewers claim C Josmil Pinto off waivers from Padres\n\n12/23/15 - Brewers claim 1B Andy Wilkins off waivers from Rangers\n\n12/23/15 - Brewers claim OF Kirk Nieuwenhuis off waivers from Mets\n\n1/13/16 - Brewers outright C Josmil Pinto to AAA\n\n2/4/16 - Brewers outright OF Shane Peterson to AAA\n\nSigned to Minor League Deal\n\n11/10/15 - Signed SS Edwin Sano\n\n11/11/15 - Signed RHP Harold Chirino\n\n11/16/15 - Signed INF Hernan Perez with invite to Spring Training\n\n11/16/15 - Signed RHP Henry Medina\n\n11/18/15 - Signed RHP Jim Miller\n\n11/19/15 - Signed C Rene Garcia with invite to Spring Training\n\n12/04/15 - Signed RHP Daniel Tillman with invite to Spring Training\n\n12/11/15 - Signed OF Alex Presley with invite to Spring Training\n\n12/11/15 - Signed INF Jake Elmore with invite to Spring Training\n\n12/15/15 - Signed INF Will Middlebrooks with invite to Spring Training\n\n12/15/15 - Signed RHP Hiram Burgos with invite to Spring Training\n\n12/17/15 - Signed RHP Tim Dillard\n\n1/5/16 - Signed OF Eric Young Jr. with invite to Spring Training\n\n1/12/16 - Signed OF Yorki Franco\n\n1/22/16 - Signed LHP Cesar Jimenez with invite to Spring Training\n\n1/25/16 - Signed LHP Chris Capuano with invite to Spring Training\n\n1/26/16 - Signed 3B Fidel Pena\n\n1/26/16 - Signed C Luis Avalo\n\n1/26/16 - Signed RHP Miguel Sanchez\n\n2/8/16 - Signed RHP Johan Dominguez\n\n2/8/16 - Signed RHP Daniel Acosta\n\n2/12/16 - Signed RHP Blaine Boyer with invite to Spring Training\n\nRule 5 Draft\n\n12/10/15 - Brewers draft INF Colin Walsh from Oakland\n\n12/10/15 - Brewers draft RHP Zack Jones from Minnesota\n\nSigned to Major League Deal\n\n1/6/16 - Signed 1B Chris Carter\n\nTrades\n\n11/18/15 - Traded RHP Francisco Rodriguez to Detroit for 2B Javier Betancourt and a PTBNL, 12/10 Tigers send C Manny Pina to complete deal\n\n11/19/15 - Traded RHP Cy Sneed to Houston for SS Jonathan Villar\n\n11/20/15 - Traded SS Luis Sardinas to Seattle for OF Ramon Flores\n\n12/9/15 - Traded 1B Adam Lind to Seattle for RHP Carlos Herrera, RHP Daniel Missaki, and RHP Freddy Peralta\n\n12/10/15 - Traded cash considerations to Boston for INF Garin Cecchini\n\n12/17/15 - Traded 1B Jason Rogers to Pittsburgh for OF Keon Broxton and RHP Trey Supak\n\n1/28/16 - Traded LHP Trevor Seidenberger to San Diego for OF Rymer Liriano\n\n1/30/16 - Traded SS Jean Segura and RHP Tyler Wagner to Arizona for RHP Chase Anderson, INF Aaron Hill, SS Isan Diaz, and cash.\n\n2/12/16 - Traded LF Khris Davis to Oakland for C Jacob Nottingham and RHP Bubba Derby\n\n____________________________________________\n\nOverall, the Brewers completed 38 transactions over the last five months or so that brought 45 players into the organization. If you weren't careful you might've gotten whiplash trying to keep up with all the moves, and we the BCB staff have already filed insurance claims to have the carpel tunnel treated that we all developed on the job this winter.\n\nBroken down the Brewers added 20 pitchers and 25 position players this winter. Slingin' Stearns was especially active on the trade market, completing nine deals to add 16 new players. At least seven of those guys should have some impact at the major league level this season, for those who think that the Brewers don't care about their big league club at this point.\n\nDecember was the Brewers' most active month overall, which should come as no surprise because the annual Winter Meetings were held during that time. The Brewers made 14 transactions that month: three trades, two Rule 5 picks, six minor league signings, and three waiver claims. October was the quietest month with only the claim of Junior Guerra, but that's no shock either as the playoffs and World Series were still wrapping up.\n\nStearns' first offseason has been almost universally praised by those in the know around baseball, and it's hard not to like what he's done so far. He's specifically targeted players who take plenty of walks at the plate and pitchers who have shown they can limit walks on the mound. There has been 'young, controllable talent' added at every level of the organization: stuffing the lower levels with pitching, adding some advanced position player prospects like Betancourt and Nottingham, and rolling the dice on some post-hype guys like Garin Cecchini and Rymer Liriano who could very well play themselves into important roles this season at the major league level.\n\nSlingin' Stearns didn't rush to make any deals this winter and so far he has gotten good, if not great, returns for all the players that he's dealt. The farm system is now ranked among at least the top 10 of the game depending on which outlet you consult, and it should only further improve with valuable trade chips like Jonathan Lucroy and Will Smith still in the fold. The Brewers have a clear plan moving forward and the rebuild is off to a great start. It's difficult not to get excited about what the future could hold for this team.",
  "latent_24807": "The admission is hugely embarrassing for Germany, which had previously blamed Spanish cucumbers for the bug.\n\nBeansprouts are a common ingredient in salads and stir frys, but have previously been blamed for major health scares. They were held responsible for a serious outbreak of Salmonella in Britain last year and 17 E.coli-related deaths in Japan in 1996.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Gert Lindemann, agriculture minister in the northern state of Lower-Saxony, said a company that grew bean sprouts had been shut down and further test results were expected on Monday.\n\n\"There was a very clear trail (to this company) as the source of the infection,\" Mr Lindemann said in a news conference. He urged consumers in northern Germany to refrain from eating all types of sprouts.\n\n\"It is the most convincing...source for the E.coli illnesses,\" he said.\n\nIn the face of mounting criticism that it was not acting fast enough of the crisis, which took hold on May 2, German officials have been have been racing to track down the source of the pathogen, which has infected people in 12 countries – all of whom had been travelling in northern Germany.\n\nMany of those infected have developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), a potentially deadly complication attacking the kidneys.\n\nThe rare strain of E.coli has the ability to stick to intestinal walls where it pumps out toxins, sometimes causing severe bloody diarrhoea and kidney problems. Some patients have needed intensive care, including dialysis.\n\nAt least 1,700 people in Germany have been infected, including 520 suffering from a life-threatening complication that can cause kidney failure. Ten other European nations and the US have reported 90 other cases, all but two related to visits in northern Germany. In Britain, the number affected remains at 11, with three of those suffering from HUS, all of whom have travelled to Germany.\n\nIn Germany, some patients have complained that the hospitals in Hamburg, the centre of the outbreak, are not coping. Daniel Bahr, the German health minister, said: \"The situation in the hospitals is intense,\" adding that clinics outside of Hamburg should start taking in ill persons from the north.\n\nOne E.coli survivor, 41-year-old Nicoletta Pabst, told The Associated Press that sanitary conditions at the Hamburg-Eppendorf hospital were horrendous when she arrived with cramps and bloody diarrhoea. She said at least 20 others had a similar condition in the emergency room.\n\n\"All of us had diarrhoea and there was only one bathroom each for men and women — it was a complete mess,\" she said. \"If I hadn't been sick with E. coli by then, I probably would have picked it up over there.\"\n\nBoth Canadian and American health officials have frequently given warnings about the dangers of bean sprouts, which have been responsible for well over 40 food borne illnesses around the world caused by either E.coli or Salmonella bacteria in the last 35 years or so.\n\nThe largest outbreak linked to sprouts took place in Japan in 1996, when 6,000 people got sick and 17 died after eating radish sprouts contaminated with E.coli O157: H7.\n\nIn Britain, the head of the Health Protection Agency reiterated advice that British travellers to Germany should avoid eating all salad.\n\nMore than two million British people travel to Germany each year, according to the Office for National Statistics, making it the fifth most popular destination for Britons.\n\nJustin McCracken, the chief executive of the HPA, said: \"We are advising people who travel to Germany to avoid eating raw tomatoes, raw cucumbers and leafy salads, including lettuce,\" he said, speaking on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One.",
  "latent_24836": "If you follow the heavyweight division closely at all, you likely know the name Shawn Jordan. While he hasn't ventured into the upper echelon of the UFC's biggest division, he has consistently put on exciting fights during his time there and has won some performance bonus money in the process.\n\nBut now he's a free agent, and he wants the type of money he thinks he deserves, or he could just give up on the sport of MMA. He spoke to MMA Fighting about what he wants and what other options he has:\n\n\"I prefer to fight and make money, but I graduated from college. I have degrees. I can go to work tomorrow and get a job.\"\n\nHe does know that the outcome of his last fight, a dull loss to Ruslan Magomedov in October, hurt his negotiating power with the UFC though:\n\n\"Had I come out with a win there, the negotiating power would be in my court. Since I lost, then they can bully me around. But that's fine. I'll sit around and wait.\"\n\nThe sitting around and waiting part refers to the UFC's matching clause in his contract, which lasts for a year according to him. That means what it sounds like - that if he is offered a contract by a different promotion, the UFC has the right to match it to keep his services.\n\nIn terms of money, he seems like a little frustrated with the fact that uber-prospect Sage Northcutt is making so much money already:\n\n\"Nothing against him, but he comes with his second fight in the UFC and they give him 40 and 40,\" Jordan said. \"They don't pay half the veterans that.\"\n\nLike heavyweights Alistair Overeem and Matt Mitrione, along with guys like Ben Henderson, he decided that going to free agency was the only real leverage he had left. The lack of a union doesn't help:\n\n\"It's one of those things you have to kind of suck it up and let them use you up,\" Jordan said. \"It gets a little frustrating. Guys are fighting their contracts out in order to get competitive [offers]. At some point, there's gotta be a fighter union.\"\n\nJordan (18-7) went 6-4 in 10 UFC fights, with only two going to decision. His six TKO wins and three performance bonuses place him in the higher end of UFC heavyweights in those categories. Will the promotion end up paying him what he wants, or will he move onto greener pastures? It may take him a while to find out.",

  "latent_24867": "SEOUL, April 30 (Yonhap) — Controversy flared again here over the screen monopoly by major film distributors with the ongoing success of Hollywood blockbuster “The Avengers: Age of Ultron.”\n\nMoviegoers complained that they can hardly find any other films in theaters these days because conglomerate-run cinema chains such as CJ CGV, Lotte Cinema and Megabox have allocated too many screens nationwide for the box-office hit, to earn as much as they can.\n\nAccording to official data from the Korean Film Council, the superhero flick has been shown on 1,623 big screens across the country as of Wednesday, which accounts for 71.2 percent of the 2,281 screens available in the country.\n\nReleased here on April 23, the movie distributed by the Walt Disney Co. Korea has topped the local box office for seven straight days backed by its monopolization of cinemas.\n\nIt has attracted more than 4 million viewers in a very short period of time. Industry watchers expect the film will surpass 10 million in attendance, the standard for huge success in the South Korean film market.\n\nIn comparison, only 292 screens, about 7.4 percent of total screens, were allocated to “Salut d’Amour” by veteran Korean director Kang Je-kyu, known for “Swiri” (1999) and “TaeGukGi: BrotherHood Of War” (2004), on the same day. The romantic comedy opened only a few weeks before the Avengers film hit local theaters.\n\nBut the problem of the American film’s monopoly becomes even more serious when taking into consideration how often “Avengers 2″ is screened a day.\n\nThe film was shown 8,133 times on Wednesday, accounting for nearly 60 percent of the total screening times. This is nearly four times higher than 15.2 percent for “Coin Locker Girl,” the Korean film that sits at No. 2 on the daily box-office chart. The rate for the superhero sequel jumped to 68.3 percent on the first Sunday after it opened.\n\n“Avengers 2″ also takes up major showing times after 8 p.m. every night, while diverse films such as “The Finishers,” for instance, was shown only twice a day, at 8:35 a.m. and midnight, at a Seoul theater.\n\nThe issue of big-budget films’ screen monopoly is not new in the Korean film industry.\n\nAs conglomerates operate the investment, distribution and screening of large films all at the same time, those that they back take up the most screens in Korean theaters, taking away chances for smaller movies to be seen.\n\nDomestic filmmakers and producers have long raised concerns that the monopoly would hurt the diversity of films, with some raising the need to enact laws to limit the number of screens that can be allocated to a film.\n\n“The history of the Korean film industry has always been that of a battle against monopoly,” said Eom Yong-hoon, head of Samgeori Pictures Co., the film company that produced “How To Steal A Dog”(2014).\n\nHe said the industry fought against the market dominance of Hollywood films in the past and is now combating the screen monopoly of films backed by Korean conglomerates.\n\nDespite favorable reviews from movie critics, Eom’s film managed to attract only 305,389 viewers nationwide. Eom attributed the failure to the screen monopoly of “Ode to My Father,” which opened in the same month.\n\nCo-produced and distributed by CJ E&M, an affiliate of food and entertainment conglomerate CJ, “Ode to My Father” was shown on up to 960 screens its opening week. It drew more than 14 million viewers.\n\n“We can overcome a lack of quality by exerting more effort, but cannot secure capital and screens with effort because this is a structural problem,” Eom said.\n\nA bill was previously proposed to ban films produced and invested in by the same company from monopolizing cinemas screens run by that company’s affiliates, but it died due to opposition from conglomerate-run companies, arguing that it would hurt the market economy.\n\nOh Dong-jin, a movie critic, warned that the monopoly situation, if continued, would result in a lack of diversity and creativity in the Korean film industry and far less attendance in theaters.\n\n“The industry might be destroyed in five years without measures to ensure co-existence,” he said. “We need to settle the issue by setting up a double regulation that would ban a film from taking up more than 40 percent of screens nationwide and half of the number of screens at a theater.”\n\nEdit: An earlier version of this article contained a percentage miscalculation regarding screens the “Avengers: Age of Ultron” is being shown on in South Korea. It has since been changed to the correct figure.",

  "latent_24911": "A resolution introduced in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday aims to roll back privacy rules for broadband service providers that were approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October.\n\nThe rules include the requirement that internet service providers like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon should obtain “opt-in” consent from consumers to use and share sensitive personal information such as geolocation and web browsing history, and also give customers the option to opt out from the sharing of non-sensitive information such as email addresses or service tier information.\n\nThe rules have been opposed by internet service providers who argue that they are being treated differently from other Internet entities like search engines and social networking companies.\n\nThe providers secured a win last week when the now Republican-dominated FCC decided that the operation of the data security provisions would be temporarily halted in view of a stay petition by providers. The data protection rules were to come into force last Thursday.\n\nThe new resolution introduced by Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, is backed by over 20 Republican co-sponsors.\n\nIt aims to provide for congressional disapproval of the FCC rule relating to ‘‘Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services’’ under the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law that empowers Congress to repeal federal regulations, according to a statement issued by Flake, who is also chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law. The resolution under the CRA would also prevent the FCC from issuing “similarly harmful regulations” in the future, it added.\n\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who on Tuesday was nominated for a second term five-year term at the agency by President Donald Trump, favors uniform rules on privacy for Internet companies, with the Federal Trade Commission rather than the FCC setting those rules. His renomination requires Senate confirmation.\n\n“The federal government shouldn’t favor one set of companies over another—and certainly not when it comes to a marketplace as dynamic as the internet,” Pai said in a joint statement last week with FTC Acting Chairman Maureen K. Ohlhausen.\n\nIn an op-ed this month, Flake wrote that by reclassifying in 2015 internet service providers as common carriers, subject to Title II of the Communications Act, the FCC had stripped the FTC of its jurisdiction over the privacy practices of ISPs. The reclassification of broadband as a public regulated utility was part of a move by the previous administration of President Barack Obama to preserve net neutrality in the country.\n\nThe FTC has no real regulatory power to protect the privacy of Americans once they turn 13 and are no longer covered by a 1998 children’s privacy law, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy in Washington, in an emailed statement.\n\nThe Flake resolution has been opposed by civil rights groups as well as Democrats in Congress. Electronic Frontier Foundation has called on people to call up their senators and their representatives to tell them to oppose the use of the CRA to roll back the FCC’s new rules about ISP privacy practices.\n\nThe use of the CRA would allow Congress to overturn the privacy rules with just a majority vote in both chambers, without the opportunity for members to filibuster, said the American Civil Liberties Union. It would also ban the FCC from issuing rules that are “substantially the same,” raising “serious questions about the FCC’s ability to protect consumer’s online privacy in the future,” wrote Nathaniel Turner, lobbyist assistant at ACLU’s Washington Legislative Office.\n\n“The Republican leadership—working on behalf of the nation’s largest cable and phone companies—wants to strip Americans of important protections on how their most sensitive information can be used,” Chester said. He warned that the leading broadband ISPs have developed “Big Data collection practices” that gather and analyze personal information when people are on PC’s, mobile devices and increasingly even while viewing TV.",
  "latent_25009": "Today’s post is so colorful and fun, not just because of the art project, this time Nady is sharing it with his friend Fouad!\n\nTwo days ago Nady came from the nursery with a painting made of dots. I knew then they are exploring circles and dots. As i mentioned once, my son is my inspiration for the activities, so lets paint a tree practicing dots!\n\nTo prepare this easy recipe you need:\n\n1 cup flour\n\n1 tbsp salt\n\n2 1/2 cup water\n\nfood coloring\n\nMix water and salt in a pot. Set the heat on medium, slowly add the flour and mix with a whisk to not get lumps. Once it starts thickening, put down the heat and keep stirring until you get the right consistency, custard like.\n\nLeave it to cool, then divide it in containers as many colors you want to have. Add your colors and mix well. And here is your homemade fingerpaint!\n\nWith a brown paper i made the cut out of the trunk shape to set the starting point.\n\nNady, already familiar with this type of painting couldn’t wait to start, Fouad (should mention he is 7 months younger) was exploring this messy art for the first time, but all what mommy needed to do is dump those tiny fingers in the paint and let the fun begin!\n\nThere are plenty of activities you can do to encourage creative play at your home. Painting is so tempting, one of the creative plays that offers many skills to learn especially when freedom is left to explore.\n\nChildren love being creative if they are given the chance, such activities develop a love for the creative process, enlarge their brain and set them up as creative thinkers in all walks of life.\n\nDon’t hesitate to do such messy activities at home, children love the paint! Try not to stress about the mess and let them enjoy being creative. Of course shouldn’t be a war zone as well, set the rules and boundaries and let them enjoy! Homemade recipes are always the safest and easiest to be cleaned with less risk of stains.\n\nThe physical, emotional and social benefits and skills gained from such activities are worth the mess!\n\nPainting develop fine motor skills in early age which in turn helps them to be writing ready as they are near school age.\n\nEven at young age, creative activities help to develop maths skills such as geometry (size and shape).\n\nLook at the art pieces we got at the end:\n\nThis is the chef d’oeuvre of Fouad, he didn’t just use his hands but his feet as well! i loved how he was exploring the paint!\n\nAnd this is the chef d’oeuvre of Nady, we framed it and add it to his wall of art!\n\nAren’t they beautiful?\n\nWe spent a really fun creative afternoon! A refaire sans dire!",
  "latent_25070": "image provided by Sony\n\nThe Houston Astros are 13-7 and have a four-game lead in the American League West. What has stoked the team to such an impressive start? Sony San Diego Studios might tell you it's all in the scouting.\n\nThe developers behind the MLB: The Show video game series, which is exclusive to the Sony PlayStation family of consoles, has been offering the Astros the images generated from the data they compile when rating players for the game. I'm kidding when I directly tied in Houston's success to the images from Sony, but the blurred lines between reality and game are legit.\n\nimage provided by Sony\n\nHow realistic is it?\n\nHere's what Astros Coordinator of Advance Information Tom Koch-Weser had to say per a statement provided to Bleacher Report from Sony Entertainment, \"the Sony images offer realistic representations of players. We're excited to incorporate these images in our scouting reports.\"\n\nThe statistical tracking within MLB 15: The Show is as expansive as you'll find in any sports video game. This seems to be a product of the games to achieve a realistic simulation experience as opposed to a more arcade feel.\n\nMLB 15 uses data from advanced statistics firms when generating player ratings and tendencies. Spray charts, pitch velocity and cold and hot zones are factored in and displayed in the game via graphs and other visual presentations.\n\nThere's a great deal of technical expertise required to achieve these results, but it's not all game development.\n\nThe Sony San Diego team benefits greatly from the presence of someone on their team who has actually played professional baseball. Senior Managing Producer Chris Gill played in the Cincinnati Reds organization from 1989-93. He was also an area scout for the team from 1996-98.\n\nI had an opportunity to speak with Gill about the mindset of the development team when creating the player profiles in the game.\n\n\"Just like everything else, we try and make the game as realistic as possible,\" he said. \"It’s a true simulation so we need to make sure the game behaves as close to real life as we can make it. We use real-life stats to determine the hitters’ strengths and weaknesses for hot and cold zones, and batters fly ball/ground ball, pull/oppo tendencies to come up with our spray charts in game.\"\n\nObviously, the charts that we see in the game are similar to what we see when watching an ESPN or Fox Sports broadcast. What about the charts that major league teams use and create for themselves?\n\n\"It’s pretty much the same,\" Gill said. \"In fact, some MLB teams use the same stats company we do for their scouting reports. At the end of the day, all the MLB teams are getting pretty much the same info. It’s just a matter of how they choose to get it. Some teams use the stat companies, while others rely on their own staff; some may use both.\"\n\nIf the Astros use MLB 15's data and deem it as an asset to their scouting process, we may see more teams asking for Sony's images in the future.\n\nFollow Brian Mazique aka FranchisePlay, the Sports Video Game Journalist",

He or she will have to, even if they haven’t been in touch. He or she has been taking your money.\n\nThe first letter (due on the birthday of you accepting their advice) will do more than simply tell you how much the planner has been taking from your accounts. It’ll also ask if you want the withdrawals to continue. If you don’t you merely need to do nothing. The withdrawals will stop. If you do want your accounts continually drained you’ll have to send back a form. It’s called “opting-in”.\n\nThat’s what financial planners and the organisations that employ them have been engaged in a last-ditch battle to stop. Living off ignorance and amnesia, they’ve been desperate to ensure their long-forgotten clients don’t remember what’s being taken from their accounts and can’t easily stop it.\n\nThe Coalition has been backing them rather than us under the guise of stopping red tape. So keen has it been to do their bidding rather than ours that it waited until the parliament wasn’t sitting to introduce a regulation that would smother the requirement.

  "latent_25244": "You will be amazed by the things that a dying military veteran wrote in a letter to the two U.S. Senators that are representing his state. Like so many other Americans, this elderly vet is absolutely disgusted by the corruption and the incompetence that he sees coming out of Washington. In the past, I have also written about how $1.4 billion is spent on the Obamas each year and about how Congress is living the high life at our expense, but in this letter this dying military veteran puts things much more eloquently than I did. The name of the vet that wrote this letter is Bill Schoonover, and it was written on April 3rd, 2013. Even though his representatives in Congress will probably never take the time to read this letter, I think that you will agree that the emotions that Mr. Schoonover has expressed in this letter are shared by millions upon millions of other Americans all across the country…\n\nDear Senator:\n\nI have tried to live by the rules my entire life. My father was a Command Sergeant Major, U.S. Army, who died of combat related stresses shortly after his retirement. It was he who instilled in me those virtues he felt important – honesty, duty, patriotism and obeying the laws of God and of our various governments. I have served my country, paid my taxes, worked hard, volunteered and donated my fair share of money, time and artifacts.\n\nToday, as I approach my 79th birthday, I am heart-broken when I look at my country and my government. I shall only point out a very few things abysmally wrong which you can multiply by a thousand fold. I have calculated that all the money I have paid in income taxes my entire life cannot even keep the Senate barbershop open for one year! Only Heaven and a few tight-lipped actuarial types know what the Senate dining room costs the taxpayers. So please, enjoy your haircuts and meals on us.\n\nLast year, the president spent an estimated 1.4 $billion on himself and his family. The vice president spends $millions on hotels. They have had 8 vacations so far this year! And our House of Representatives and Senate have become America ‘s answer to the Saudi royal family. You have become the “perfumed princes and princesses” of our country.\n\nIn the middle of the night, you voted in the Affordable Health Care Act, a.k.a. “Obama Care,” a bill which no more than a handful of senators or representatives read more than several paragraphs, crammed it down our throats, and then promptly exempted yourselves from it substituting your own taxpayer-subsidized golden health care insurance.\n\nYou live exceedingly well, eat and drink as well as the “one percenters,” consistently vote yourselves perks and pay raises while making 3.5 times the average U.S. individual income, and give up nothing while you (as well as the president and veep) ask us to sacrifice due to sequestration (for which, of course, you plan to blame the Republicans, anyway).\n\nYou understand very well the only two rules you need to know – (1) How to get elected, and (2) How to get re-elected. And you do this with the aid of an eagerly willing and partisan press, speeches permeated with a certain economy of truth, and by buying the votes of the greedy, the ill-informed and under-educated citizens (and non-citizens, too, many of whom do vote ) who are looking for a handout rather than a job. Your so-called “safety net” has become a hammock for the lazy. And, what is it now, about 49 or 50 million on food stamps – pretty much all Democrat voters – and the program is absolutely rife with fraud with absolutely no congressional oversight?\n\nI would offer that you are not entirely to blame. What changed you is the seductive environment of power in which you have immersed yourselves. It is the nature of both houses of Congress which requires you to subordinate your virtue in order to get anything done until you have achieved a leadership role. To paraphrase President Reagan, it appears that the second oldest profession (politics), bears a remarkably strong resemblance to the oldest.\n\nAs the hirsute first Baron John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton (1834 – 1902), English historian and moralist, so aptly and accurately stated, “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.” I’m only guessing that this applies to the female sex as well. Tell me, is there a more corrupt entity in this country than Congress?\n\nWhile we middle class people continue to struggle, our government becomes less and less transparent, more and more bureaucratic, and ever so much more dictatorial, using Czars and Secretaries to tell us (just to mention a very few) what kind of light bulbs we must purchase, how much soda or hamburgers we can eat, what cars we can drive, gasoline to use, and what health care we must buy. Countless thousands of pages of regulations strangle our businesses costing the consumer more and more every day.\n\nAs I face my final year, or so, with cancer, my president and my government tell me “You’ll just have to take a pill,” while you, Senator, your colleagues, the president, and other exulted government officials and their families will get the best possible health care on our tax dollars until you are called home by your Creator while also enjoying a retirement beyond my wildest dreams, which of course, you voted for yourselves and we pay for.\n\nThe chances of you reading this letter are practically zero as your staff will not pass it on, but with a little luck, a form letter response might be generated by them with an auto signature applied, hoping we will believe that you, our senator or representative, has heard us and actually cares. This letter will, however, go on line where many others will have the chance to read one person’s opinion, rightly or wrongly, about this government, its administration and its senators and representatives.\n\nI only hope that occasionally you might quietly thank the taxpayer for all the generous entitlements which you have voted yourselves, for which, by law, we must pay, unless, of course, it just goes on the $17 trillion national debt for which your children and ours, and your grandchildren and ours, ad infinitum, must eventually try to pick up the tab.\n\nMy final thoughts are that it must take a person who has either lost his or her soul, or conscience, or both, to seek re-election and continue to destroy this country I deeply love and put it so far in debt that we will never pay it off while your lot improves by the minute, because of your power. For you, Senator, will never stand up to the rascals in your House who constantly deceive the American people. And that, my dear Senator, is how power has corrupted you and the entire Congress. The only answer to clean up this cesspool is term limits. This, of course, will kill the goose that lays your golden eggs. And woe be to him (or her) who would dare to bring it up.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBill Schoonover",

These three have come a long way, and have expanded their ranks while doing so, so I couldn't leave out Babs or Gabby.\n\nI may need to go over this one for some clean-up, but I had a limited window to get it done and didn't want to miss their theme day on Equestria Daily.\n\nWhen the show started, I was like many of the older fans and not as enamored when the season inevitably took a break from the Mane Six to concentrate on the younger characters. I never disliked them... They were always pretty cute (determined Apple Bloom was especially adorable in the first season especially, and Sweetie Belle never stopped being so, while Scootaloo's evolution brought the feels), and their interactions with their older sisters and the rest of Ponyville led to some great world-building, but at first I wasn't overly invested in their antics or their quest to find themselves. And yet... \"Crusaders of the Lost Mark\" was a highlight of the entire show for me. Just a hugely triumphant moment that was done with such love and care that the overall story of the CMC will forever be a favorite part of the series for me. I'm not sure when exactly these girls grew on me to the extent that they did, but the show would have been so much less than it is without them.\n\nI only wish that we didn't lose interactions with Diamond Tiara in the process...

Allison Kaplan Sommer, writing on the Haaretz website, says that it is too soon after the attack on the kosher grocery store to be making such statements.\n\nBut there's a right and a wrong way to go about it, and Israel's unsubtle ham-handedness is clearly the latter. Statements like Netanyahu's sends a message that Israeli government, in a perverse \"I told you so\" manner is glad that Jews abroad are threatened because it strengthens their raison dﾒetre.\n\n20.20 Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, is speaking at the Grand Synagogue in Paris. He has thanked Lassana Bathily, the Muslim employee of a Jewish supermarket who saved several hostages on Friday, and said he appreciated the \"very firm position\" taken by French leaders against \"the new anti-Semitism and terrorism\" in France.\n\nOur common enemy is radical, extremist Islam - not normal Islam.\n\n20.10 And here is the line-up of world leaders, arms linked in a show of solidarity.

The rally, organised by Jerusalem City Council, was addressed by Nir Barkat, the city's mayor, and Rabbi Shlomo Moshe Amar, its chief rabbi.\n\nIt came as Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister - attending a mass rally in Paris along with Avigdor Lieberman, the foreign minister, and Naftali Bennett, the industry minister - announced that French Jews wishing to emigrate to Israel would be \"welcomed with open arms\".\n\nLater his office announced that he had accepted the requests of the families of four French Jews killed by a jihadist during last Friday's siege of a Kosher supermarket to be buried in Israel. The funerals are expected to take place in Jerusalem on Tuesday.\n\nMahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority leader, also came to Paris.\n\n14.42 The US attorney general has said there is no \"credible information\" al-Qaeda was behind the Paris attacks.\n\n\"At this point, we don't have any credible information that would allow us to make a determination as to which organisation was responsible,\" Eric Holder said in an interview from Paris with ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\n14.38 In an interview ahead of the march (which you can watch in the video above), Mr Cameron disclosed that he will meet security and intelligence chiefs on Monday to discuss how to respond to the terrorist attacks in France, writes Steven Swinford.\n\nHe said: \"We are here to demonstrate that we all stand for the values of democracy, freedom, freedom of expression and tolerance.\n\n\"We in Britain face a very similar threat - a threat of fanatical extremism - and we have to confront that in every way we can.\n\n\"That means maintaining strong security, investing in our security services, it means being very vigilant.\n\n\"But it also means confronting the poisonous narrative of Islamist extremism wherever we find it. Whether in universities or schools or our prisons or throughout our society, we'll only defeat this threat if we use all of the means at our disposal to confront and defeat it.\"\n\nHe added: \"If we make sure we have strong security, confront the poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism, we make sure we all play our part then I believe we can defeat it, because in the end the values that we stand for - of democracy, freedom of speech, of tolerance - these are not values that make us weak, they are values that make our societies, our economies, our countries, they're values that make us strong.\"\n\n14.34 Masses of people are out in force and not just in France. More than 10,000 people marched through the Belgian capital Brussels on Sunday in solidarity with the huge rally in Paris, a police source said.\n\nPolice had counted \"between 10,000 and 15,000\" about half an hour after the start of the march, the source told AFP. A huge \"Brussels is Charlie\" banner in French, Flemish and English was hanging in the city centre.\n\n14.31 Many of the leaders are arm in arm, showing solidarity on this important day. The families of the 17 victims are also marching in memory of their lost loved ones, killed during a three-day siege.\n\n14.29 And the leaders are moving.\n\n14.28 The leaders are together and should soon be on the move.\n\n14.23 Francois Hollande, Italian PM Matteo Renzi, Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy, German chancellor Angela Merkel, British PM David Cameron, Turkey's PM Ahmet Davutoglu among other world leaders are preparing to march\n\nCrowds gather in Paris' Palace de la Republique for the Unity rally in remembrance and defiance of the recent terrorist attacks in and around Paris\n\nDavid Cameron in France ahead of huge Unity march.

Since time immemorial, the arts have been an inspiration for reflection giving rise to new ideas and fighting against intolerance and ignorance.\"\n\n14.08 At the Republique Square, spontaneous applause appears to have broken out, according to the BBC. The march will go down the Boulevard Voltaire to the Place de la Nation and will be led by the families who lost their loved ones during the tragic events in Paris earlier this week.\n\nRory Mulholland says they will then be followed by the leaders with the unified French public behind them - a mix of athiests, Muslims, Jews and more, Mishal Hussain on BBC reports.\n\n14.05 There are leaders from more than 40 countries including Israel, Italy and Spain. But they're definitely not alone as this image shows the sheer numbers. The march is called the March of Unity and for those on Twitter, the hashtag appears to be #unitymarch\n\n14.00 There are solidarity marches across the world including in Trafalgar Square, BBC News reports\n\n14.00 The four killed by jihadist Amedy Coulibaly in a hostage drama at a kosher supermarket in Paris will be buried in Israel on Tuesday, a community spokesman told AFP on Sunday.\n\n\"The four families decided to bury their dead in Israel. The funerals will be held on Tuesday at 10.00 am in the Mount of Olives cemetery\" in Jerusalem, the source said.\n\n13.58 David Cameron said the extremist threat will \"be with us for many more years to come\" as he met with other world leaders and the French president to join the march.\n\n13.56 The leaders are on the move, they left the Elysée Palace and are on their way to join the march.\n\nHollande & Valls are leading their group out of the Elysee, to go to the march, which starts at Place de la Republique in an hr #UnityMarch — Harriet Alexander (@h_alexander) January 11, 2015\n\n13.54 The entire crowd is clapping and chanting, \"Charlie Charlie\", says Rory Mulholland\n\n13.53 We've got pictures of the French president welcoming world leaders. Mr Hollande (R) welcomes United Arab Emirates foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan (L) at the Elysée Palace in the image below.\n\n13.51 \"I've lived in Paris for 14 years and have never seen any demo on this scale before. The avenues leading to the Republique, a square bigger than Trafalgar Square, are jammed with people as far as the eye can see with people trying to get on to the square. So many that no one is moving any more,\" adds Rory Mulholland.\n\n13.48 Philippe Odiau, caretaker of a building on the 20th arrondissement of Paris, told Rory Mulholland he was here \"because simply to show we are here to fight against barbarity.\n\n\"The French republic is still on its feet. But above all I came here above all for the memory of Franck Brinsolaro, a bodyguard at Charlie Hebdo, killed during Wednesday's attack.\n\n\"He was a friend of mine and he lived in my building - it was 48 hours before we realised it was him.\"\n\n13.45 Rory Mulholland has this short dispatch from the scene at Republique Square:\n\nThe march will be taking two different routes as it is thick with people and difficult to move. The avenues leading to the square from all directions are absolutely throng with people and some people will not be able to reach the square.\n\nThe tricolour flag and Je Suis Charlie posters can be seen everywhere - and it's just started to rain. There are occasional bursts of the national anthem but there is a quiet and subdued atmosphere.\n\nThere are people climbing the statue of Mariane, the symbol of the republic - some are even hanging off the edge.\n\nOne man, dressed a green statue of liberty costume, is using a pencil instead of the torch. Vincent Renau, a banker from Paris, told me why he came here because \"there's been a terrible attack on the freedom of expression and on the French republic\".\n\nOn the issue of whether he was afraid, he said he was a little. \"But I'm here to say yes to life. We must carry on.\"\n\n13.19 The British, German and Israeli leaders were also joined by Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, all of whom will march through the French capital in the same demonstration - a world first, AFP points out.\n\n13.09 David Cameron, Angela Merkel and Benjamin Netanyahu have arrived at the French presidency\n\n12.59 News is breaking that the US will host a summit next month on the extremism challenge and how to fight \"violent extremism around the world\".\n\nThe meeting is likely to take place in Washington DC, the US attorney-general, Eric Holder, said.\n\n12.54 Crowds continue to gather and Valerie Trierweiler appears to also be in the crowds.\n\nBBC News was reporting that there could be more than a million people today at the march which will take place in just over an hour, but some estimates suggest it will be 700,000.\n\nCrowds streaming towards République for the Charlie Hebdo march. pic.twitter.com/sux4SvhyGH — Rory Mulholland (@dogphone) January 11, 2015\n\n(Pic: Warren Allott)\n\nThere is a heavy armed presence as you can see from this image of French soldiers on patrol around the Place de Nation in Paris, another big site in the march.

The prosecutor said the jogger was seriously wounded.\n\n12.43 From that meeting between interior ministers, they said there was an \"urgent and crucial need\" to share European air passenger information and strengthen the EU's external borders\n\n12.32 BREAKING The French prosecutor has confirmed Amedy Coulibaly is linked to the shooting of a jogger, causing the individual to sustain critical injuries.\n\n12.28 Louisa Loveluck points out that officials have been sent to Paris from both Egypt and Turkey, both among the biggest jailers of journalists in the world.\n\n12.26 Tim Chester, Deputy Editor of Mashable UK, has shared this Vine via Twitter showing the crowds gathered at Place de la République two hours before the march.\n\nPeople start gathering in Republique Square before the start of the march in Paris\n\n12.21 Spain's interior minister, Jorge Fernandez Diaz, earlier said he intended to call for changes to the Schengen treaty allowing border controls.

If that is so, then we have to question the priorities of our country.

CCTV images from Istanbul airport appear to confirm her presence, Turkish officials say.\n\nA signal from her phone was then traced on January 8 to the Turkish border town of Akcakale, which is next to Isil territory in Syria. The town is known to harbour Isil sympathisers and the porous border is easy to cross. Her phone signal has not been traced since.\n\nThe French authorities only passed on Boumeddiene’s name to Istanbul on January 9. Turkish officials say there is no evidence any of the other attackers passed through Turkey.\n\n11.25 Le Monde says there are rumours the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu may go to Jewish supermarket but it must stressed, there is no confirmation from Israeli embassy in Paris.\n\n11.18 More from Rory Mulholland about the Charles de Gaulle news mentioned earlier.\n\nAn airport spokesman told the Telegraph that there was no terror threat at Charles de Gaulle and that the heavy police presence was due to the arrival in Paris of foreign heads of state to attend the march to commemorate the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre.\n\n11.14 The Telegraph's picture desk has created this gallery entitled: Crowds join 'Unity' march for Charlie Hebdo attacks, in pictures\n\nPeople lay flowers and candles close to the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris as people gather for the start of a huge march which will end at the Place de la Nation\n\nA man dressed as the Statue of Liberty holds up the French national flag at the Place de la Republique in Paris\n\n11.10 Last night, five people detained in connection with the terror attacks were released from custody, the Paris prosecutors' spokesman said.

  "latent_25938": "Share\n\nGetting self-driving cars on the road will require more than just regulatory approval. For autonomous vehicles to be truly safe and efficient, they will need the most accurate mapping data possible. A number of big automakers are working toward this goal, but technology companies hold the keys to success.\n\nQualcomm Technologies, Inc., an offshoot Qualcomm Inc. announced a partnership with TomTom, the navigation company, to provide autonomous cars with the best map data around. The collaboration will pair Qualcomm’s Drive Data Platform (DDP) with TomTom’s HD Map tool.\n\nDDP collects and analyzes data from vehicle sensors to learn driving patterns, monitor surroundings, and share data with smart cars and infrastructure. TomTom’s HD Map allows autonomous vehicles to precisely locate themselves on the road at any speed.\n\nThis partnership will, to some degree, bypass the traditional way of categorizing map data. Instead of using massive vehicle fleets to collect location, imagery, and Lidar data, Qualcomm and TomTom will use machine learning (powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820Am processor) and crowdsourcing to build its knowledge base. The new method will allow connected cars to see and understand their environment, traffic and road conditions, and support real-time input for map and road condition updates.\n\n“Feature-rich, highly accurate and frequently updated HD maps are critical to support some of the most advanced applications envisioned in the automotive industry, especially for autonomous driving,” said Willem Strijbosch, head of autonomous driving at TomTom. “We are building the cloud-based platform to make and maintain HD maps using a range of input sources, including crowdsourced data from swarms of intelligent connected vehicles. We’re excited to explore the connectivity and compute capabilities of the Qualcomm Drive Data Platform to help map the world for the future of driving.”\n\nWe will have a chance to learn more about this crowd-sourced mapping system at Mobile World Congress this week.",
  "latent_26113": "I've openly admitted in many places I have been quite down hearted by the way monthly beauty boxes were going, and while I've not been buying them myself I have been paying attention to the goings on, the one box that has kept me more intrigued is Birchbox as a long standing American beauty box – that took over Jolie Box (formerly Boudoir Prive) officially at the beginning of this year, the reason I've watched this one more closely is I would love it if they included American brands that we couldn't get over here, and I wondered if perhaps this takeover would lead to a switch like that happening (us getting American goodies / Americans getting British goodies).\n\nMarch 2013 brought the Role Models box to us a box it is said to include products that have iconic or inspiring stories – some of which have been founded by females.\n\nBirchbox March Contents\n\nLaura Geller – Inkwell Waterproof Gel Liner – Full size price: £24.50\n\nBefore I say anything else about this I just want to say the price above is what is stated on the Birchbox insert card – I have had a google and all I could find for a UK price was a duo for £24.25 and a single US price is set at $16.50 so I can only assume the Full Size Price is in relation to a duo set rather than a single one. That being said that makes this product alone worth £12.50 which is 70p under the cost of the box in total.\n\nThe colour I received was purple, as you can hopefully tell in the photo it has quite a shimmer to it – I like the fact this liner has been well thought out in terms of usage, the brush fits inside the cap and to make it a usable size you just flip it over and attach it into the lid the other way round, the pot is open and easily accessible once the lip is removed.\n\nMolton Brown – Valbonne Fragrance Full size: £65 (50ml)\n\nThis is one of Molton Browns unisex fragrances and I have to say it is a little to masculine for me and wouldn't be something I would wear though the fragrance isn't unpleasant in itself it just isn't for me. (Sample size is 2ml worth about £2.60)\n\nRMK – Cleansing Balm Full Size: £29 for 100g\n\nI was quite a fan of the RMK Makeup base which has come in previous boxes so I am looking forward to giving this a try – apparently it helps remove even stubborn makeup – so no more red scrubbed face perhaps? (Sample size 25ml worth around £7.25)\n\nLa Sultane De Sabba – Body Lotion with Argan Oil Full Size: 26.50\n\nI really like trying body lotions so this is right up my street, it has a subtle delicate scent behind it. Sadly although I found the site that seemed to be linked to this cream I couldn't completely work out which one it was, so I can't give a price.\n\nYu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream Full Size: £19.50 2.75oz (around 78g)\n\nI've tried this cream before – the small size of the 3g sample does make it hard to come to a full conclusion of it, but I do think it's either a love it or hate it item, it is highly moisturising and also medicated but it does smell of camphor which I think would really put some people off, I can though see why this has been a best seller in Japan since 1957. (3g sample worth around 75p)\n\nBeauty Extra\n\nSanctuary – 30 Day Thermal Transformation Mask Full Size: £27.50\n\nThis is a two-step process mask including a serum and a clay mask – it's come up a few times in boxes as well as being given away as a free sample – I have to say I'm glad this has been included as an extra rather than a main item.\n\nLifestyle Extra\n\nLindt – Heart tin filled with Chocolate Truffles Full Size: £2.99\n\nOm nom nom – sorry was there chocolate in here drool.\n\nOverall I have to say this box is growing on me – when it first arrived I wasn't so sure, but the more I think about it (and think about it I have as I sit writing this) I realise most of it I will use, I'm not 100% sold on the gel liner yet – I think it's a good product for people who would use it, but sadly purple isn't really my colour, now if it had been black I would probably have been over the moon, but that's a risk you take with these boxes and at least I know now should I want a waterproof gel liner that it's worth looking into Laura Geller so it's got it's plus side.\n\nThe one thing I don't like is the perfume sample – In my opinion if they are included in these boxes I think it should be as extra due to how freely samples are given away when it comes to scents.\n\nOther than that I will use everything, so I have to say I wouldn't have been disappointed though maybe not completely WOW'd by this box had I brought it myself.\n\nIf you fancy signing up to Birchbox you can do so here where it costs £10 + P&P (£2.95) per month.\n\nWhat do you think of this months offering from Birchbox, is it one for you?\n\n*PR Sample",

Formed in November 2006, the PFI includes the Karnataka Forum for Dignity (KFD), the National Development Front (NDF), and Manitha Neethi Pasarai (MNP), which are active in Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu , respectively.,Although PFI claims to be an organization working for only the socio-economic, cultural and political empowerment of the deprived and the downtrodden, state intelligence sources say it is under their scanner for possible militant activities including terrorism.Sources in the police department said PFI is making every effort to win over the Muslim community in Andhra Pradesh by taking up issues which are emotive and sensitive to their feelings. Specifically, it is concentrating on rural areas where the Muslim population is dominant, they said.“The activities of PFI are widespread in Rayalaseema, especially in Kurnool district, where it is incidentally headquartered. Though its presence in Hyderabad is presently restricted to some pockets like Chandrayangutta and Shivarampalli, its activities are slowly spreading.

  "latent_26282": "In June, Jeremiah Heaton planted a flag in small region between Egypt and Sudan in a bid to make his daughter a princess. Now he hopes it will improve global food security\n\nWhen Jeremiah Heaton’s seven-year-old daughter Emily turned to him one night last winter and asked him if she would ever be a real princess, he was faced with a dilemma.\n\n“I didn’t want to break her spirits, so I said ‘yes, absolutely,’ he told the Guardian by phone from his home in Abingdon, Virginia, this week. “At that point I had no idea how to make it happen, but I couldn’t let her down. She had such a serious tone. I knew it meant a lot to her.”\n\nThe 38-year-old American took to Google to begin researching disputed regions across the world. He figured that to make his daughter a princess, he would have to make himself a king.\n\n“I looked at Antarctica, and there is unclaimed land there, but there is a treaty that means people can’t claim it. So I kept researching, and I found Bir Tawil”.\n\nSandwiched between Egypt and Sudan, Bir Tawil is an area of around 800 square miles not far from the Red Sea, and is a geographical anomaly known as a ‘terra nullius’ - a land that belongs to no-one. Following a decades-old land dispute, neither Egypt or Sudan have laid claim to it.\n\nHeaton had found what he was looking for. In June, he flew to Egypt and made a 14-hour journey through the desert to plant a flag (designed and made by his three children over the course of “a few dinners”) in the earth at Bir Tawil, laying claim to it on behalf of him and his family.\n\n“It has been unclaimed for around 100 years,” Heaton explained. “I just followed the same process as many others have done over hundreds of years, planted our flag, and claimed it.”\n\nHeaton, who works in the mining industry and ran for Congress in 2012, said he, his wife Kelly, and his three children have decided to rename the territory the Kingdom of North Sudan, and plan to launch a website to spell out their vision for the new country.\n\nThis vision includes using the land as a “testbed” for scientific advancement to help improve global food security.\n\nHe says the country’s initial development would be based on “four pillars”; innovative agricultural production, renewable energy, digital freedom and digital currency. The first two are particularly important to his children, Emily, 12 year-old Justin and 10 year-old Caleb, who know there are “a lot of hungry people in the world” and “would like to help”.\n\nHeaton says the country’s initial development would be based on “four pillars”; innovative agricultural production, renewable energy, digital freedom and digital currency.\n\nThe second two are areas that Heaton is particularly interested in. He says he would like to establish a server farm in the kingdom that would allow “freedom to exchange information without any government interference”, and would like to establish a digital currency like Bitcoin, though he feels Bitcoin itself is too elitist.\n\nHeaton says he has opened the project up to bids from the scientific community, and is looking forward to seeing the ideas he is presented with. But for now, he'll have his hands full working towards having his claim to Bir Tawil recognised by Egypt, Sudan, and the international community, for it to be validated.\n\n“I know these are lofty goals, and it seems like a grand feat to accomplish them, but I believe we can,” he says.\n\nWhat about the African people he encountered on his trip, and the Bedouin who roam Bir Tawal - what do they make of Heaton’s scheme?\n\n“I didn’t encounter any hostility at all,” Heaton insists. He says his guide thought “it was a neat idea, like a lot of other people do”. He argues that the Bedouin don’t travel into Bir Tawil because it is too dry, and that the area therefore has no population. He said the Egyptian authorities, who approved his travel to Bir Tawil, appeared positive about his scheme, and that the Bedouins he spoke to “welcomed” his ideas, though admits he only spoke to a handful of people.\n\n“One of our key principles would be to share the food and resources that we develop with other people in the region, so I think they understand that this project would be beneficial for everyone,” Heaton says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremiah Heaton and his seven year-old daughter Emily, with the flag their family designed. Photograph: David Crigger/AP\n\nHe says critics have accused him of being a racist who is trying to colonise Bir Tawil. He insists that is not the case.\n\n“What I am doing is the exact opposite of colonialism,” he says. “The dictionary defines colonialism as one country taking control of another to exploit its resources or people. Bir Tawil is not a country, it does not have a population, and I don’t represent the United States or a corporation. I’m an individual, and I'm not going to dig for diamonds or drill for oil or build a pipeline. What we’re doing is designed to improve people’s lives.”\n\n\"I don't see race, colour or creed, and neither do my children,\" he added.\n\nThough the project began as a means to make his daughter a princess, he also rejects the suggestion that it was a materialistic pursuit, and insists it was only ever intended to be altruistic.\n\n\"That [lesson against materialism] is the real gift I will be giving my kids,” he says. “I’m not trying to entitle them. I’m trying to teach them about how to help others, and work in the service of others. If anything, I believe it will help them to be more humble.”",
  "latent_26290": "While many people know of the close relationship between Israel and Intel, the depth of that relationship may come as a surprise to many: Intel Israel has been responsible for many, if not most, of the processor breakthroughs for Intel, and the Intel Sandy Bridge processor, developed in Israel, was responsible for 40 percent of Intel’s sales worldwide in 2011.\n\nThat fact was revealed Sunday at a press conference in Tel Aviv, where top Intel Israel executives discussed the company’s activities last year and plans for this year. 2012 is set to be an important year for Intel Israel, as the company refits its Kiryat Gat facility to manufacture the new 22-nanometer Ivy Bridge processor. Currently, the Kiryat Gat facility makes Intel’s 45-nanometer Sandy Bridge processor, and the company has invested $3 billion in preparing the facility for Ivy Bridge.\n\nOne highlight of the press conference was the introduction of top Intel exec Mooly Eden as Intel Israel president. Eden will share top executive status with general manager Maxine Fassberg. There had been speculation that Intel has been dissatisfied with Fassberg’s leadership of the company, with Eden being appointed to gradually take over operations. At the press conference, however, both Eden and Fassberg praised the appointment, with Eden pointing out that the appointment of a president and general manager was Intel’s way of honoring the Israel facility for its accomplishments.\n\nGet The Start-Up Israel's Daily Start-Up by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nFassberg said that Intel Israel had hired some 700 people in 2011 and planned to hire at least 600 more in 2012. Fassberg added that Intel Israel employs nearly 8,000 workers directly, and is indirectly responsible, through suppliers and subsidiaries, for the employment of 23,000 heads of households — and altogether employs 10% of all workers in the electronics and software industry in Israel. Intel employs about 100,000 people worldwide. A special point of pride, she said, was that Intel Israel did not lay off any workers during the 2008-2009 economic downturn. “We had plans ready for all scenarios, but we were able to work things out to ensure that we did not have to lay off even one worker because of the recession,” she said.\n\nIntel Israel is a strong contributor to Israel’s bottom line, said Fassberg, with $2.2 billion in exports in 2011. That was about 20% lower than in 2010, but Fassberg attributed the shortfall to the limited capacity of the Kiryat Gat plant during its refitting for 22-nanometer processors. The company expects to more than make up for it this year as it gears up to sell the Ivy Bridge processors.\n\nBesides Kiryat Gat, Intel has facilities in Jerusalem, Haifa, Petah Tikvah, and Yakum.\n\nEden presented the company’s plans for 2012, discussing a slew of new products Intel intends to release. Among those products are the Ultrabook, Intel’s answer to small, light laptops like the Macbook Air. The company will be marketing some 75 different Ultrabook designs, so “there will be something for everyone,” Eden said. Besides Ultrabooks, Intel will be pushing forward with completion and development of its smartphone, and later in the year, an Intel tablet will be available. Eden also described a number of software innovations, including an “end-to-end” service that will allow access to data and content along a series of devices via the cloud — similar to current offerings by Apple, which stores data in the cloud and allows users to access it on its line of Macbooks, iPads, and iPhones.\n\nEden also rejected notions popular in the media, that the PC was outmoded and would die a quick death, and that tablets were going to replace laptops. “There may be some cannibalization at the fringes,” Eden said, referring to a “blurring” of distinctions among some devices. However, all four “device streams” — PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones — were growing and would continue to grow in tandem. PCs were becoming household necessities and not luxuries, and as such have become a recession-proof product. Regarding tablets, Eden challenged audience members who believe that the tablet is set to replace the laptop to “give me your laptop for two months, and then we’ll see whether or not you don’t need it.”\n\nEden, who is also an Intel worldwide senior vice president, has been working for Intel in the US since 2003, and was responsible for the sharp growth in notebooks and netbooks for Intel, the company said.\n\nIntel is strongly committed to Israel, Eden said. Israel is the third largest investment target for Intel outside the US — after China and India — and over the past 15 years, the company has invested in 64 different Israeli companies. A big believer in working with start-ups, Eden said that he intended to not only look for companies Intel can work with directly, but for partnerships with other Intel partners around the world for promising Israeli startups. “The most important contribution we can make to Israeli startups is through our rolodex, the connections we have in the industry that we can share with Israeli startups,” Eden said. “We believe in the ‘startup nation,’ and intend to help it reach its full potential.”",
  "latent_26371": "\"The Dale\" redirects here. For other uses, see Dale (disambiguation)\n\nRochdale Association Football Club is a professional football club based in the town of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England. The club currently competes in League One, the third tier of the English football league system. Nicknamed \"the Dale\", the club was founded in 1907, moved to its current stadium, Spotland Stadium, in 1920 and was accepted into the Football League in 1921. Since then, the club has remained in the third and fourth tiers of English football.\n\nRochdale has only achieved promotion three times – in 1969, 2010 and 2014. The club attracts a small but loyal fanbase, with a hardcore following of around 2,000 home fans on average per match.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nRochdale played 36 consecutive seasons in the Football League's bottom division from 1974 to 2010, the longest time any team has been in the bottom division of the League, with some even derisively calling it \"the Rochdale Division\".[2] The club has the lowest average position of all the clubs which have existed continuously in the Football League since its expansion to four divisions in 1921–22 (76th) and since its expansion to 92 clubs in 1950–51 (79th). Additionally, the club holds the distinction of having played the most seasons in the English Football League without either reaching the top two tiers (91 seasons as of 2018-19) or being relegated to the National League.\n\nThe club reached the League Cup Final in 1962. This was the first time a club from the bottom league division had reached the final of a major competition – where they lost to Norwich City.\n\nDuring its history, the club has had three promotions and three relegations, with promotion coming in 1969 and 2010 and 2014 and relegation in 1959, 1974 and 2012. The 1959 relegation followed the 1958 restructuring which saw the combination of the two Third Division sections into the Third Division and Fourth Division. In the restructuring, Rochdale managed to secure a spot in the Third Division, but was relegated at the end of the season to the now lowest Fourth Division.\n\nRochdale A.F.C. was formed in 1907.[3] After World War I the Football League was expanded and the club unsuccessfully applied to join. In 1921 Rochdale was recommended to be included in the new Third Division North, and played their first League game at home against Accrington Stanley on 27 August 1921, winning 6–3. However, this first season ended with the club at the bottom of the League, having to reapply for membership.\n\nThe club's first promotion came in 1969, earned by a team largely assembled by manager Bob Stokoe, though it was Stokoe's assistant, Len Richley who steered Rochdale to promotion after Stokoe moved to Carlisle United. In the early stages of the 1969–70 season, Rochdale topped the Third Division table, sparking hopes of a second successive promotion. The team's form significantly declined around Christmas 1969, however, and a failure to halt the team's decline led to the dismissal of Richley. He was succeeded by Dick Conner, who stabilised the club's form and steered them to a 9th-place finish. The following three seasons saw the club finish in the lower reaches of the Third Division table, narrowly avoiding relegation each time. The board viewed merely surviving in the Third Division as unacceptable and replaced Conner with Walter Joyce for the 1973–74 season. This move failed to pay off, and Rochdale was relegated after a campaign in which they won only 2 of 46 league games.\n\nThe club finished bottom of the league in 1977–78, but was successful in their bid for re-election. Southport, which had finished one place above Rochdale, was demoted instead and replaced by Wigan Athletic. Rochdale finished bottom for a second time in 1979–80, but was again re-elected – by one vote over Altrincham. In 1989–90 the club reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time, but lost 1–0 to Crystal Palace.\n\nSteve Parkin was appointed as manager in 1998, a period in which the success of the club improved significantly with the emergence of talented players such as Gary Jones, Clive Platt, Grant Holt and Kevin Townson.\n\nParkin left to take over at Barnsley in November 2001 with Rochdale second in the Third Division.[4] This gained him little popularity with the fans, especially when he took Gary Jones with him. John Hollins was appointed as his successor and the club finished the season in 5th place, entering the promotion play-offs where they lost to Rushden & Diamonds in the semi-final.\n\nThe club reached the fifth round of the FA Cup again the following season, but lost 3–1 at Wolves. Hollins was replaced by Paul Simpson in 2002, and Alan Buckley, appointed and sacked as manager in 2003. Parkin then returned to the club as manager, until being sacked in December 2006.\n\nParkin's replacement, Keith Hill, who was initially appointed as caretaker manager, became arguably the club's most successful manager to date. Hill and his assistant manager David Flitcroft led Rochdale to a 5th-place finish in 2007–08, securing a play-off place. After beating Darlington 5–4 on penalties in the semi-final, Rochdale reached Wembley for the first time in their history. Despite taking the lead in the match, they lost the final 3–2 to Stockport County.\n\nIn the 2008–09 season, Rochdale reached the League Two play-offs for the second consecutive season, finishing 6th in the table on 70 points. Season 2009–10 ended a 41-year wait for promotion with a win over Northampton Town as Rochdale secured the third automatic promotion spot. Rochdale continued their progression under Keith Hill, now with the club for 3 years, with a secured spot in League One in 2010–11. In 2010–11 Rochdale finished 9th in league one with 68 points, equalling their highest league finish since 1969–70.\n\nOn 1 June 2011 manager Keith Hill joined Championship club Barnsley. Former Manchester City apprentice and youth coach Steve Eyre was confirmed as Hill's replacement on 12 June 2011. Eyre's spell at Spotland did not last long, as he was sacked after 27 competitive games in charge, the team having recorded just 4 league wins in this time. Eyre's last game was a 0–0 draw against Yeovil, in which Yeovil's keeper Rene Gilmartin played the second half with a dislocated finger. Director of youth Chris Beech was then appointed as caretaker manager. Under Beech's first game in charge, the team drew 1–1 with Preston North End with an equaliser from Daniel Bogdanović who scored on his debut. Beech's 5 games in charge ended with a 5–1 defeat by Stevenage and a 3–0 defeat to bottom of league Wycombe Wanderers.\n\nOn 24 January 2012, Accrington Stanley's John Coleman was confirmed manager as the successor to Steve Eyre and left his club where he had been for more than a decade. John Coleman's first match in charge was a 3–0 win at home over Bury in the local derby. However, on 21 April, Rochdale lost 2–1 to Chesterfield resulting in relegation from League One after two years in the league. John Coleman's and Jimmy Bell's contracts were terminated by Rochdale on 21 January 2013 following a poor run in form.[5] In January 2013, Keith Hill, previously in charge of Rochdale from 2007 to 2011, was appointed as the new manager.[6]\n\nRochdale were promoted to League One on 26 April 2014, after beating Cheltenham Town 2–0.[7] Playing at the club's highest level the 2014–15 season was the club's most successful yet. Apart from a couple of games, they remained in the top half of the league all season, eventually finishing in 8th place, their highest league placing. Notable results were a 2–1 win away to Bradford City and home wins against Preston North End and Chesterfield. The club reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, and despite being eliminated by Premier League opposition, remained in contention for promotion to the Championship.\n\nRochdale has participated in the Football League play-offs on three occasions. In 2002, they lost 4–3 on aggregate to Rushden & Diamonds. In 2008, they went through to Wembley Stadium, defeating Darlington in the semi-final 5–4 on penalties after a 3–3 draw after extra time over two legs. Ben Muirhead scored the crucial penalty for Rochdale. However, despite scoring the first goal at the Wembley final, Rochdale suffered a 3–2 loss to Stockport County. In 2009, Rochdale lost 2–1 on aggregate to Gillingham in the playoff semi-finals.[8]\n\nClub badge and colours [ edit ]\n\nRochdale home colours, used until the 2006–07 season\n\nThe club crest used by Rochdale focuses on a variant of the arms of the former County Borough of Rochdale. The coat of arms, based on those of the local and reputed Rochdale family with certain additions, was granted to the Borough by Herald's College in 1857. At its centre, a shield shows a sack of wool and a cotton plant, representing the local wool and cotton industries. Around the edge of the shield sit eight martlets (birds). These are taken from the Rochdale family coat of arms (mentioned above) and are widely used on heraldic devices. Above the shield and helm (in the position technically known as the \"crest\" in heraldry) more local industry representations are made by the inclusion of a fleece of wool (suspended by a band) and the iron centre of an old mill-stone (known as a mill-rind).\n\nA motto below the shield reads \"Crede Signo\". Roughly translated, this means \"Believe in the sign\". The blazon (official heraldic description) for the arms reads as follows: \"Argent a woolpack encircled by two branches of the cotton tree flowered and conjoint proper; a bordure sable charged with eight martlets of the field; and for a crest on a wreath of the colours a mill-rind sable and above a fleece argent banded or.\"\n\nWhen Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council was formed in 1974 (taking over from Rochdale County Borough Council and five other borough/urban district councils), a new coat of arms was created and awarded for council use. Rochdale A.F.C., however, continued (and continues today) to adopt the old Rochdale County Borough arms.\n\nRochdale's current home colours are black and blue shirts, white shorts and blue and black hooped socks. Previously, Rochdale's usual colours were blue and white, introduced in 1949. Prior to this, Rochdale wore black and white stripes, which was influenced by the strong Newcastle United side of 1907 (the year Rochdale was formed), the stripe which they adopted for their centenary season in 2007.\n\nRochdale's centenary kit, used in the 2007–08 season.\n\nThis black and white kit was re-introduced in the 2007–08 season as the one-off centenary kit; the new Internazionale-influenced design which succeeded it was an amalgamation of the striped kit and the blue kit to herald the second century of Rochdale's existence. Between 2010 and 2012 Rochdale's shirts were predominantly blue with black pinstripes on the body and black sleeves.\n\nRochdale's away kit comprises white shirts with a purple stripe, purple shorts and purple and white hooped socks. Other historical away kits have included yellow, teal, green and red. Other kits have included white shirts with black shorts, white shirts with blue shorts and a blue shirt with white sleeves.\n\nRochdale has had sponsored shirts since 1983. Former sponsors include Carcraft, MMC Estates, All-in-One Garden Centre, Smith Metals, Keytech, Freebets.co.uk, Cabrini and the Co-operative. On 28 May 2013, Crown Oil Ltd was unveiled as the club's new principal sponsor.\n\nIt was announced in June 2009 that the kit supplier for the next three seasons would be Carbrini.\n\nFrom 2012–2015 Rochdale's kit was supplied by Fila.\n\nOn 25 April 2015, Rochdale revealed Erreà as their new supplier.[9]\n\nStadium [ edit ]\n\nRochdale plays their home matches at Spotland Stadium (known locally as just Spotland and currently known as the Crown Oil Arena for sponsorship reasons), which has a capacity of 10,249. The stadium was officially opened in 1920, and for the first 68 years of its existence it was used exclusively by Rochdale. In 1988 – 2016 the ground was jointly owned by the football club, Rochdale Council and Rochdale Hornets the rugby football league association. In 2016 Rochdale A.F.C. bought the stadium shares they did not hold to own 100% of Spotland Stadium. At the same time the stadium received its new sponsored name The Crown Oil Arena as a result of a sponsorship agreement between Rochdale AFC and its first stadium sponsor.\n\nThe ground has four stands: the Co-Operative Stand (or Main Stand), the Thwaites Beer Stand (the Sandy Lane End), the T.D.S Stand (Pearl Street end) and the Westrose Leisure Stand (the Willbutts Lane Stand). All are fully seated, apart from the Sandy Lane End, which is a small terrace behind one of the goals.\n\nApart from local football and rugby league, Spotland has in the past been used to host minor nations' rugby league matches, such as British Amateur Rugby League Association (British Amateur Rugby League Association) matches, and also the National League Cup finals of 2003 and 2004.\n\nSpotland Stadium was selected as a venue for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, hosting a match between Fiji and Ireland. This was the first time that Rochdale had staged an event in a World Cup in any sport. The event was almost sold out with almost 9,000 people[10] attending, setting what was incorrectly claimed to be a new stadium record. Rochdale had 24,231 for an FA Cup tie vs Notts County in December 1949 and three higher crowds for FA Cup and play-off games between 1990 and 2008 against Northampton Town, Coventry City and Darlington.\n\nIn August 2016, Rochdale A.F.C. renamed Spotland Stadium the Crown Oil Arena as part of a sponsorship deal by the Bury-based fuel company Crown Oil.[11]\n\nRivalries [ edit ]\n\nRochdale have a number of rivalries with local and non-local clubs. The club's main rivals are Bury and Oldham Athletic. Bury, after Oldham, are the closest Football League club to Rochdale, and the fixture is also known as the M66 Derby. Although a more recently revived rivalry after a number of years in different divisions, games with Oldham Athletic are arguably every bit as intense as those with Bury.\n\nRochdale's other significant rivalries have been with Halifax Town, Burnley, Stockport County, Wigan Athletic and Accrington Stanley.\n\nPlayers [ edit ]\n\nFirst-team squad [ edit ]\n\nAs of 6 February 2019[12]\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

  "latent_26386": "The common criticism is that market-liberalising policies sacrifice social and political rights. Robert Blanton and Dursun Peksen adopt a novel approach, finding more nuanced insights concerning the dynamics between neoliberalism and labour rights. Overall, their findings confirm that the relationship between the two is markedly negative, in spite of the mounting empirical evidence that worker rights may be conducive to a competitive economy. As they argue, achieving a more equitable balance is an issue that needs to be urgently addressed.\n\nNeoliberalism – the so-called “Washington Consensus” playbook for economic policies – has generated no shortage of contention over the years. Such controversies have long been a fixture in the global south, as anti-IMF and World Bank protests remain ubiquitous. Over the past decade citizens in the developed world have become “new discontents” against neoliberal policies. Some examples include the recent protracted strikes staged by French workers against labor reforms, a resurgence of anti-globalization populism in the Brexit referendum, and the political ascendance of Donald Trump in the U.S. Indeed, even researchers at the IMF are starting to question whether neoliberalism has been “oversold.”\n\nA common area of concern is the “human cost” of neoliberalism, particularly on lower and working-class citizens. Free-market policies were initially hailed as an important step in ensuring prosperity and broader freedoms throughout the world, and a wide body of research attests to the economic benefits in terms of reduced unemployment and increased economic growth. Yet the common criticism of neoliberalism has been that the distribution of resources in free economies is inequitable, and that market-liberalising policies sacrifice social and political rights in the interests of economic competitiveness.\n\nIn a recently published article, we examine a facet of human rights that is one of the most commonly-cited “human costs” of neoliberalism: labour rights. More specifically, we analyse the linkages between core worker rights recognized by the ILO (collective bargaining, freedom of association, acceptable work conditions, and prohibitions of child and forced labour) and five distinct policy areas associated with economic liberalisation, namely freedom to trade, business regulation, sound money, government size, and protection of property rights. While our overall results indicate a consistent, and negative, relationship between neoliberalism and labour rights, our analysis does provide somewhat nuanced and distinct insights into the specific dynamics through which neoliberal policies affect labour rights conditions.\n\nFirst, a key element of neoliberalism is the openness to global trade and investment, through such policies as the dismantling of tariffs and elimination of capital controls. Unlike commonly-used measures of economic globalisation such as foreign trade and investment flows – which are essentially the intended outcomes of neoliberalism – we focus on the actual policies intended to increase economic openness. We find a negative relationship between such openness and worker rights. Most directly this implies that efforts to increase participation in the global economy are accompanied by reduced protection for workers. These results provide some support for the oft-raised “race to the bottom” dynamic regarding global capital and labour rights.\n\nAlong similar lines, we find broader policy reforms to establish a “business friendly” regulatory environment, including increased labour flexibility and lower obstacles to starting businesses, also negatively influence labour rights. Such measures have long been a key part of policies aimed at increasing economic competitiveness with the assumption being that respect for worker rights may be antithetical to economic growth, as business and labour regulations “infringe upon the economic freedom of employees and employers” (Gwartney et al.). Somewhat ironically, while there is mounting empirical evidence that worker rights may actually be conducive to a competitive economy, our findings indicate that states may still view the two as contradictory.\n\nWe also find that tighter, so-called “smart money” policies are damaging to labour rights. From a macroeconomic perspective, countries face a trade-off between expansionary and tighter monetary policies. Neoliberal policies emphasize the latter, arguing that the price stability created by such policies provides a more predictable environment for commerce. Despite the other advantages of such policies, particularly the control over inflation, such stability can be damaging to labour rights – it imposes downward pressures on wage levels and potentially undercuts the power of labour organizations to protect the wage levels of their members.\n\nAnother key facet of market-friendly institutions is a “small” state that plays a less prominent role in its economy. A minimal state, the argument goes, will be less likely to crowd out private investment and interfere with voluntary market transactions. In terms of societal rights, the primary obligation of a state to its people is in the area of “negative” rights, specifically providing protection to individuals and their property versus aggression or repression. However, we argue – and find – that such a minimal state is less able to protect positive rights such as worker rights. Specifically, the protection of labour rights can be a cost-intensive enterprise, as it connotes the provision of state resources to monitor respect for these rights and to prosecute offenders if necessary. Along those lines, a “small” state is less able to prevent employers from violating the core labour standards of their workers.\n\nIn all, excluding the policies associated with the legal environment and security of proper rights, we find a consistently strong, negative relationship between neoliberal policies and respect for core worker rights, as more “market-friendly” policies are damaging to labour rights. In addition to the extent that countries follow neoliberal norms, the shifts towards such policies – free-market reforms – are also of interest. Such reforms swept through the world economy during the 1980s and 1990s, widely seen as the heyday for the “Washington Consensus”, as East and Central-European countries transitioned into free-market structures while many other states drastically reformed their economies in line with IMF and World Bank programs. We find that such transitions, measured by yearly changes in our indices of neoliberalism, are likewise damaging to respect for worker rights. Thus, both the overall levels of neoliberalism in an economic system, as well as moves towards a more free-market system, have deleterious effects on worker rights.\n\nIn sum, we offer support for some of the long-held suspicions regarding the impacts of market-friendly policies, and find some empirical basis for both “old” and “new discontents” of neoliberalism. More broadly, our study suggests that it cannot be assumed that the logic of the market will necessarily lead to better worker rights, and that states need to take active steps to ensure that the “embedded liberalism” consensus is not supplanted by neoliberalism. Free-market policies were to a large extent a reaction to the overly controlled labour and business markets, and bloated state sectors, in many countries during the 1970s and 1980s. Along these lines, the intent of neoliberalism was to push the balance of power between capital, the state, and labour to a new equilibrium that was necessary for sustained economic growth. Our findings imply that this new equilibrium is to the detriment of worker rights, and that efforts should be made towards achieving a more equitable balance between the interests of labour rights and economic competitiveness.\n\n_____\n\nNote: This was originally posted on Democratic Audit.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nRobert G Blanton is Professor at the Department of Government, University of Alabama at Birmingham.",

Mike Stewart, D-Nashville, who called it \"extremely reckless.\"\n\n\"You have school kids coming down into these hearings,\" he said. \"Things can get very heated.

Bill Haslam balked, saying through a spokeswoman that he thought the idea would lead to complications and that Haslam \"feels strongly that guns are not carried in the Capitol.\"\n\nThe idea of allowing guns in the plaza was stalled in favor of waiting until the move to the Cordell Hull building.\n\nLast year legislators passed a law, sponsored by McNally, which specifically said lawmakers have authority to set policies and control any buildings they predominantly occupy. The law was introduced after there was disagreement between Haslam and lawmakers about who had the authority to set the policy on guns inside Legislative Plaza.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jennifer Donnals, a spokeswoman for Haslam, stressed that while the General Assembly has control over the operations of the Cordell Hull building, the governor maintains that weapons shall continue to be prohibited in the Capitol.\n\nReach Joel Ebert at jebert@tennessean.com or 615-772-1681 and on Twitter @joelebert29.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/01/tennessee-lawmakers-allow-guns-renovated-legislative-office-building/822044001/",

On Friday and Saturday nights, that increases to one in the Valley, one north of the 10 freeway, and one south of the 10 freeway, he says.\n\nThe elemental answer to the question in the headline is that L.A. is an unusually large city geographically; the LAPD is, on a per-capita basis, a relatively small force. Helicopters are essential to helping the department respond to crime in roughly 470 square miles of municipal turf.\n\nThe department's main air ride, the American Eurocopter AS350 B2, can travel up to 178 miles per hour. Air units are often first on the scene of major emergencies.\n\nCongress recently passed the Los Angeles Residential Helicopter Noise Relief Act but, alas, law enforcement and fire-rescue aircraft are exempt, leaving a major source of that noise unabated.\n\nYour complaints aren't being ignored, but the department thinks that catching bad guys is more important than your aural comfort.\n\n\"Sometimes you're in the hills and you have a hot prowl burglary in progress,\" Smith says. \"There's no higher priority than that. You're going to upset neighbors if it's 2 or 3 in the morning. Our phone line here will ring. We don't enjoy it. It's our job. They will get out of there as soon as they can.\"\n\nHere's a list of reasons why that LAPD chopper is overhead:\n\n5. Traffic stops. If there's nothing else more pressing going on, LAPD air units will circle over traffic stops, particularly if they involve wanted or allegedly armed-and-dangerous suspects. Officer safety is a high priority for the Air Support Division. \"You never know who's behind the wheel of that car you're pulling over,\" Smith says. \"This lets whoever's in that car know we're here and we're watching.\"\n\n4. Property crimes. Being 2,000 feet above Los Angeles can be a good place to spot burglars, car thieves and taggers. As Smith said above, catching burglars red-handed is a big deal to the department. Last year air units used infrared search technology in such suspect searches 882 times, which is more than twice a day.\n\n3. Perimeters. This duty probably accounts for much of your annoyance. LAPD helicopters are especially well positioned to help cops on the ground set up dragnets for an array of suspects - alleged burglars, gangsters who run from officers, robbers on the loose. Air units usually take command of these situations and order badges down below to take strategic positions in your neighborhood. This, unfortunately for you, can be quite a production. Air units responded to 1,433 of these kinds of calls in 2013, Smith said.\n\n2. Pursuits. Actually, what we're talking about here is not just pursuits, but what the LAPD calls \"followings,\" too. Anticipating that a chase is about to break out because they just pulled behind a stolen car or wanted suspect, ground units will radio for air support. Most of the time, these things end with the vehicle pulling over. Sometimes, though, a suspect will drive so hard that the ground units back off. But virtually no car can beat a helicopter in L.A., so the pursuit carries on from the skies. Air units get over two-thirds of the department's pursuits and followings, Smith says.\n\n1. Violent crimes in progress. Homicides, armed robberies, kidnappings, sex crimes - you get the picture. Cops call these kinds of reports \"hot shots,\" and they're broadcast on the department's highest-priority \"Tac 1\" radio frequency. The helos are your best bet for the fastest possible response. Often times, Smith says, the air unit will fly over expected escape routes to search for getaway cars. Of about 48,000 incidents air units responded to in 2013, Smith says, the helicopters were on scene before patrol cars were 14,500 times.\n\nBonus question: Why do LAPD helicopters fly in circles above crime scenes while news choppers hover in place?\n\nIt's not to make it difficult for someone to shoot at the birds. Smith explained that his choppers get lower than others (sometimes down to a high-rise height of 1,500 feet) so the officers inside can see what's going on. This, however, is dangerous. In the event of engine failure, a helicopter would have no momentum to glide to a crash landing. News choppers are so much higher that they don't face this problem. To generate some air speed, LAPD helos keep moving.\n\nSmith:\n\nFlying is all about altitude and air speed. If you lack one, you better have the other. It's strictly an aviation thing to keep moving. It does actually lower our noise signature because we're moving around. If we were hovering it would be very annoying.\n\nSend feedback and tips to the author. Follow Dennis Romero on Twitter at @dennisjromero. Follow LA Weekly News on Twitter at @laweeklynews.",
  "latent_26764": "101 East goes on the campaign trail with Narendra Modi, the man tipped to be the next Prime Minister of India.\n\nEditor's note: We no longer have rights to show this episode on our website.\n\nIn an old Muslim cemetery surrounded by the fallen vines of Banyan trees, Pathan Mohammad Mahrouf stood over the grave of his wife and two children.\n\n\"It feels like they're still with me,\" he said looking down at the mound of dirt. \"It feels like I'm sitting with them.\"\n\nIt has been 12 years since they were murdered, burnt alive by a rampaging mob of Hindu vigilantes. His wife Bilqis, along with his daughter Kherun Nisha, 14, and son Hamid, 10, were among the first victims of the 2002 communal riots in India's Gujarat state. They were attacked by a Hindu mob seeking retribution for the death of almost 60 Hindu pilgrims in a train fire started by Muslims.\n\n\"I didn't see my daughter but the lady who was with me said my daughter was raped and then burned,\" Mahrouf said. \"They attacked my wife with a dagger and there was a deep cut. They poured petrol inside (the wound) and lit a match…I did whatever I could to save the two kids that were with me.\"\n\nIt is a scene that Mahrouf has played in his mind many times as parliamentary elections sweep across India. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) candidate Narendra Modi is favorite to win thanks to an anti-incumbancy wave against the ruling Congress. The self-proclaimed Hindu nationalist enjoys tremendous popularity amongst young Indians who make up a large percentage of the electorate.\n\n\"He is a man of integrity, a man of honesty with an incorruptible record and performance,\" said the BJP spokesman, Prakash Javadekar. \"People want delivery, he is the man of delivery.\"\n\nBut Mahrouf remembers Modi very differently. He was Gujarat's chief minister when the anti-Muslim riots spread across the state. More than 1000 people, including Mahrouf's family, were killed in the carnage that continued sporadically for months. Survivors like Mahrouf have accused Modi's right-wing BJP government and the police of willfully failing to protect them.\n\n\"We went to the police headquarters next to us. They said today we can't help you at all. Today you have to die, there are orders from above,\" Mahrouf said.\n\nSanjiv Bhatt, a senior Gujarat police officer, says he has testified to several official inquiries that these 'orders' came from Modi himself.\n\nBhatt was the Deputy Police Commissioner of Internal Security during the riots. He said during a late night meeting at Modi's residence on February 27 2002, the chief minister asked commanding officers not to allow their men to interfere with the Hindu rioters.\n\n\"This time there is a lot of anger in the Hindus,\" Bhatt quotes Modi as saying. \"The normal practice of the police to take an even handed action against Hindus and Muslims will not work this time, he said. There is so much anger, you'll have to allow the Hindus to vent out their anger.\"\n\nVictims want Modi tried for criminal conspiracy linked to the violence, and he has been named in a petition currently before the Gujarat High Court.\n\nBut a separate Supreme Court initiated investigation failed to find any evidence to charge him. Modi and his party, the BJP, have always denied culpability.\n\n\"There were 10,000 rounds of bullets fired. It's a very tough police action. More than 190 rioters were killed. So this is what has actually happened,\" said Prakash Javadekar, the BJP's spokesman.\n\nYet rights advocates and the Supreme Court have expressed grave concerns about a perceived cover-up following the violence.\n\nIn a 2012 report, Human Rights Watch accused Modi's government of \"subverting justice, protecting perpetrators and intimidating those promoting accountability 10 years after the anti-Muslim riots\".\n\n\"Instead of prosecuting senior state and police officials implicated in the atrocities, the Gujarat authorities have engaged in denial and obstruction of justice,\" HRW's South Asia Director, Meenakshi Ganguly, said in the report.\n\nSeveral times the Supreme Court re-opened cases that were dismissed due to a lack of evidence or because witnesses had turned hostile. They were even forced to transfer cases out of the state to protect witnesses from intimidation and ensure fair trials.\n\nIn March 2008, the Court ordered a Special Investigation Team to investigate nine crucial cases after strongly criticising the Gujarat administration for an attempted cover up.\n\nBut the BJP said this on-going criticism of their prime ministerial candidate is politically motivated.\n\n\"The worst kind of persecution has happened to him over the last 12 years by the Congress (Party) and their cronies, NGOs and others,\" said Javadekar.\n\n\"Nobody talks about Bhagalpur where 1000 Muslims were butchered. Congress chief minister was there... Nobody talks about earlier Gujarat severe riots where thousands of Muslims were killed. Such a partial discourse can show only the bias. People have moved on.\"\n\nIndia's voters certainly appear to have moved on. Latest opinion polls indicate that the BJP and its allies could win around 226 seats in the lower house, or Lok Sahba. This is well short of the 273 seats they need for a majority, but enough to form a government through coalition deals.\n\nModi is largely credited for the BJP' resurgence. During his 12 years as Gujarat's Chief Minister, the state has consistently recorded higher economic growth than the national average.\n\nUnemployment is amongst the lowest in the country and the state is fast becoming a manufacturing hub. Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Peugeot Citroen and Ford have all set up plants there in the past three years.\n\nAt campaign rallies across the country, voters talk with envy about Gujarat's pot-hole free roads and its surplus supply of electricity.\n\n\"Modi is like a God to us,\" shouts Manohan Kumar at a BJP rally in Bihar state. \"He'll give jobs to the youth. There's a wave for Modi in the country and that's why I want to support him.\"\n\nSantosh Kumar could not agree more. \"Modi is on everyone's lips - from the young to the old. This time only Modi's government will be formed.\"\n\nIt is a prospect that Pathan Mohammad Mahrouf finds deeply disturbing. He says he understands why so many Indians are drawn to Modi. With the country's GDP growing at less than five percent, the BJP's focus on economic development is alluring.\n\nBut Pathan says there are some things that are more important. \"My kids were the apple of my eye,\" he said, standing over the mass grave they were buried in along with other victims of the riots. \"I won't be able to forget what happened till my last breath.\"\n\nCan the controversial Narendra #Modi lead the world’s biggest democracy?

  "latent_26941": "Leslie Benzies, former president of Rockstar North and one of the lead producers on the Grand Theft Auto games, is suing Take-Two Interactive for $150 million in unpaid royalties, alleging that the company tried to force him out after he took a sabbatical.\n\nReports that Benzies had left the company emerged in January, following a sabbatical that began in September 2014. But according to a statement provided by Christopher Bakes, partner at the law firm Locke Lorde LLP, \"while on sabbatical, Mr. Benzies discovered numerous deceptions on the part of Take-Two, Rockstar, Rockstar North Ltd, Sam Houser and Dan Houser, who sought to force him out of the company and terminate his portion of royalty payments based upon arbitrary actions by the company's royalty Allocation Committee, a committee that may or may not have actually ever met.\"\n\nThese alleged deceptions, according to Bakes, include unpaid royalties worth over $150 million. The lawsuit specifically cites the \"mounting resentments\" of Sam Houser, one of the co-founders of Rockstar Games, which allegedly led to Benzies' denial of compensation and eventual ousting.\n\nIn 2008, Benzies, along with Sam Houser and Dan Houser, entered a long-term agreement with Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar North after years at the company. They signed that contract alongside Take-Two's introduction of an \"incentive compensation program\" that was based on profit sharing, according to a press release. In the statement detailing his legal complaint, Benzies' contract with and payment from Take-Two was said to be identical to that of the Housers until his departure.\n\nAlso in question is Benzies' sabbatical, which Take-Two and Rockstar previously said ended with Benzies' departure from the company. After the January report that the president had parted ways with Rockstar North, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed the reports on a February conference call with investors.\n\n\"I can confirm that Leslie Benzies went on sabbatical in September of 2014,\" Zelnick said, according to a transcript of the call. \"He's decided not to return to Rockstar Games.\" Zelnick went on to say he could not comment further on Benzies' future plans.\n\nBenzies tells it differently. In the statement about the lawsuit, he claims to have attempted to return to work on April 1, 2015, only to find that his key had been deactiviated.\n\n\"After being let inside by building security, Mr. Benzies was then ordered to leave by the Rockstar North office manager without reason,\" according to the statement.\n\nWe've reached out to Take-Two Interactive regarding Benzies' allegations, as well as Benzies' legal team for clarification of the timing of events described in the lawsuit.\n\nUpdate: Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games have filed a counter-suit against Benzies, citing a \"breach of contract.\" In a document obtained from the United States District Court, the plaintiffs claim that Benzies officially left the company on April 2, 2015.\n\nThe company disputes Benzies' reason for terminating his employment, according to the documents; Take-Two Interactive claims that Benzies left the company without \"Good Reason,\" thus excluding him from collecting the pre- and post-termination royalties otherwise promised in Take-Two's compensation plan.\n\n\"Benzies, however, continues to demand parity with respect to pre-termination royalty payments and post-termination royalty payments,\" Take-Two claims in the document. \"The parties to this action have sought unsuccessfully to resolve this issue through mediation and now seek judicial clarification that would resolve this controversy.\"\n\nUpdate 2: \"Leslie Benzies was a valued employee of our company for many years,\" a representative for Rockstar Games told Polygon in an email. \"Sadly, the events that culminated in his resignation ultimately stem from his significant performance and conduct issues. Despite our repeated efforts to address and resolve these issues amicably both before and after his departure, Leslie has chosen to take this route in an attempt to set aside contract terms to which he previously agreed on multiple occasions.\n\n\"His claims are entirely without merit and in many instances downright bizarre, and we are very confident this matter will be resolved in our favor. A core ethos since Rockstar's inception has been the concept of 'the team.' It is deeply disappointing and simply wrong for Leslie to attempt to take personal credit for what has always been the tremendous efforts of the entire Rockstar team, who remain hard at work delivering the most immersive and engaging entertainment experiences we can for our fans.\"\n\nThe full court document from Take-Two Interactive's counter-suit is embedded below.\n\nTAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE and ROCKSTAR GAMES v.

  "latent_26982": "A debate about whether all children are entitled to an “equal” or an “adequate” education has been waged at the forefront of school finance policy for decades. In an era of budget deficits and harsh cuts in public education, I submit that it is time to move on.\n\nEquality of educational opportunity has been thought to require equal spending per pupil or spending adjusted to the needs of differently situated children. Adequacy has been understood to require a level of spending sufficient to satisfy some absolute, rather than relative, educational threshold. In practice, however, many courts interpreting their states’ constitutional obligations have fused the equality and adequacy theories. Certain federal laws express principles of both doctrines. And gradually, more advocates and scholars have come to endorse hybrid equality-adequacy approaches. Still, the debate persists over seemingly intractable conceptual precepts and their political and legal ramifications.\n\nTracking the philosophical origins and evolution of equality and adequacy as legal doctrines, I explain the significance of their points of convergence and argue that the few points of divergence are untenable in practice. Equality of educational opportunity should not be interpreted as pursuing equal chances for educational achievement for all children, because that ideal is infeasible. Nor should educational adequacy be interpreted as completely indifferent to objectionable inequalities that can be feasibly curtailed. Properly conceived, equality and adequacy are not merely congruent but reciprocal. That is, children are owed an education that is adequately equal and equally adequate.",

  "latent_27474": "The stories of the Uighurs in Guantánamo  Muslims from the oppressed Xinjiang province of China, formerly known as East Turkistan  have long demonstrated chronic injustice on the part of the U.S. authorities to those who know of them, although they have only sporadically registered on the media’s radar.\n\nNumbering 22 men in total, three were picked up randomly in Afghanistan, another was caught crossing the Pakistani border disguised in a burqa, while the other 18 were seized together by opportunistic Pakistani villagers after fleeing Afghanistan in the wake of the U.S.-led invasion in October 2001, and sold to U.S. forces for a bounty, as was common at the time. A leaflet dropped by U.S. planes offered enterprising villagers and soldiers \"millions of dollars for helping the anti-Taliban force catch al-Qaeda and Taliban murderers.\"\n\nThese 18 men, who had fled their homeland because of persecution, in search of a new life, or in the hope of gaining some sort of training to enable them to fight back against their oppressors, had been living together in a small, run-down hamlet in Afghanistan’s Tora Bora mountains, mending the settlement’s ruined buildings, and occasionally training on their only weapon, an aging AK-47.\n\nAfter the U.S.-led invasion, they were targeted in a U.S. bombing raid, in which several men died. The survivors then made their way across the mountains to the Pakistani border, where they were first welcomed by the villagers, then betrayed by them. In U.S. custody, they attracted attention because of their supposed insights into the workings of the Chinese government, but it was apparent from early on that they had not been involved with either the Taliban or al-Qaeda, and that there was no reason to hold them.\n\nUnfortunately for the Uighurs, however, the declaration of their innocence only prefaced further problems, as they joined one of Guantánamo’s least enviable groups: cleared prisoners who, because of international treaties, cannot be returned to their home countries for fear that they will be subjected to torture, or worse. The U.S. government had obligingly declared those opposed to Chinese rule in Xinjiang province as \"terrorists,\" in order to secure support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and had even allowed  or invited  Chinese interrogators to question the men in Guantánamo, but when it came to returning them to China they refused to do so.\n\nAttempts to persuade other countries to accept the Uighurs  and other cleared prisoners who faced similar problems with repatriation  were both long and largely futile. Despite the fact that some of these men had been regarded as wrongly detained while they were in U.S.-run prisons in Afghanistan, and many had been cleared after military tribunals in Guantánamo in 2004, it was not until May 2006 that one country  Albania, one of Europe’s poorest nations  could be prevailed upon to accept five of the men, who were joined, in December 2006, by another three cleared prisoners from Algeria, Egypt, and the former Soviet Union.\n\nLiving in a UN refugee camp in Tirana has not been without its problems  there is no Uighur community in Albania, no prospect of work, and no opportunity for the men to have contact with their families  but it is at least better than being in Guantánamo, where their compatriots, who have, for the most part, also been cleared for release (the exact details are, like much else at Guantánamo, difficult to gauge with absolute confidence), remain in a limbo that seems, literally, to be without end.\n\nCompounding their suffering, the Uighurs, like the majority of the dozens of other cleared prisoners, are held not in comfort in Camp 4 (Guantánamo’s only block with communal dorms) but in Camp 6, a maximum security prison in which they are held in complete isolation, in metal cells without windows, for 22 to 23 hours a day.\n\nOne of these men is Abdulghappar, who is now 35 years old. In 2004, he explained to his military tribunal that he had traveled to Afghanistan to \"get some training to fight back against the Chinese government,\" and added that he had nothing against the United States. He said that his own people \"and my own family are being tortured under the Chinese government,\" and when asked, \"Was it your intention when you were training to fight against the U.S. or its allies?\" came up with an answer that summed up the feelings of all his imprisoned compatriots: \"I have one point: a billion Chinese enemies, that is enough for me. Why would I get more enemies?\"\n\nAbdulghappar recently wrote a letter to his lawyers, which was declassified by the military censors who review all correspondence between lawyers and their clients. It was then passed to the Associated Press, who quoted parts of the letter in an article last week, which was then picked up by other media outlets.\n\nIn the hope of providing Abdulghappar with more of his own voice, however, I asked his lawyers for a copy of the letter, which I reproduce in its entirety below. As it is a translation, I have taken the liberty of editing the language to convey his message more fully.\n\nAbdulghappar’s Letter From Guantánamo\n\nHow are you, Mr. J. Wells Dixon and Ms. Seema Saifee? I hope that this letter reaches you before you come over, and I hope that it will be a little beneficial for our Turkistani brothers’ situation here.\n\nWe, the Turkistani brothers, left our homeland in order to escape from the brutal suppression and unfair treatment from the Chinese government towards our people. The Uighur youth back home were either incarcerated because of false accusations or prosecuted and executed because of bogus allegations. It was extremely difficult for any Uighur to see a future for themselves within our homeland, and both young and middle-aged Uighurs started to leave East Turkistan and try to find survival abroad, if anyone could find a way to get out. We, the Uighurs in Guantánamo, are also like those Uighurs. We left our homeland for the same cause and sought solace in our neighboring countries.\n\nAs you know, for some specific reasons we ended up in Afghanistan. When we arrived in Afghanistan, the U.S. army invaded. We had to depart for Pakistan, since we could not stay in Afghanistan. As we did not know anyone who could help us there, we had no other choice but to leave. The Pakistani people then arrested us and turned us over to the Pakistani government. Subsequently, the Pakistani government sold us to the U.S. Army for bounties. The U.S. Army then brought us to Guantánamo.\n\nSince the very beginning of the interrogations, we have been saying this. Our circumstances are very clear to the U.S. government, the U.S. Army and related agencies. Thus, the East Turkistani people and we, the Uighurs in Guantánamo, have never had any revulsion against the U.S. at any time, and this would never be possible, because our homeland is being occupied and we need the help of others.\n\nWe were very pleased at the beginning when the Pakistanis turned us over to American custody. We sincerely hoped that America would be sympathetic to us and help us. Unfortunately, the facts were different. Although in 2004 and 2005 we were told that we were innocent, we have been incarcerated in jail for the past six years until the present day. We fail to know why we are still in jail here.\n\nWe still hope that the U.S. government will free us soon and send us to a safe place. Being away from family, away from our homeland, and also away from the outside world and losing any contact with anyone is not suitable for a human being, as, also, is being forbidden from experiencing natural sunlight and natural air, and being surrounded by a metal box on all sides.\n\nI was very healthy in the past. However, since I was brought to Camp 6, I got rheumatism. My joints started to hurt all the time and are getting worse. My kidneys started to hurt ten days ago.\n\nMy countryman Abdulrazaq used to have rheumatism for a while, and since he came to Camp 6 it got worse. Sometime in early August, the U.S. Army told Abdulrazaq that he was cleared to be released, and also issued the release form to him in writing. As a result, Abdulrazaq requested to move to a camp that had better conditions, for health reasons. When his request was ignored he embarked on a hunger strike, which has lasted for over a month now.\n\nCurrently, he is on punishment and his situation is even worse. He is shackled to the restraint chair and force-fed twice a day by the guards, who wear glass shields on their faces. This has taken place for the past 20 days. For someone who has not eaten for a long time, such treatment is not humane. Abdulrazaq would never want to go on hunger strike. However, the circumstances here forced him to do so, as he had no other choice. If the oppression was not unbearable, who would want to throw himself on a burning fire? In the U.S. Constitution, is it a crime for someone to ask to protect his health and to ask for his rights? If it does count as a crime, then what is the difference between the U.S. Constitution and the Communist constitution? What is the difference between this and Hitler’s policies during the Second World War?\n\nI have heard that an Egyptian man broke his back and became handicapped while he was being handled by a team in Camp 1 or 2, and then he was sent home as a crippled person for the rest of his life [Sami el-Leithi, released in October 2005]. Another Libyan broke his arm also. I worry that Abdulrazaq will face a similar or worse situation while being force-fed twice a day for a long time, and I am also concerned for his psychological condition as it is extremely difficult for him to keep his mental state normal under such circumstances.\n\nRecently, I started to wonder, \"Why are we staying in this jail for so long?\" I wonder if we will be released after we damage our internal and external organs and our arms and legs. Or is it necessary for a few Turkistanis to die, as happened in the past here in this jail, in order to gain others’ attention and their concern towards our matter? Such thoughts are in my mind all the time. The reason I am writing this letter to you is that I sincerely hope that you and others related to law and enforcement can solve this issue quickly and help us in a practical manner.\n\nAbdulghappar Turkistani (281)\n\nDecember 12, 2007\n\nGuantánamo Bay jail, Camp 6\n\n[For more on the Uighurs in Guantánamo, see my book The Guantánamo Files: The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America’s Illegal Prison.]\n\nRead more by Andy Worthington",

  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nBulls-Bobcats Preview\n\nBy KATE HEDLIN\n\nPosted Feb 09 2012 2:14PM The Chicago Bulls hope to take the pressure off Derrick Rose and his ailing back by monitoring his minutes. It could be a good sign that they didn't even need him to defeat the Charlotte Bobcats last month. Rose and the Bulls look to win their fifth straight Friday night when they visit the league-worst Bobcats, who are trying to avoid matching the longest losing streak in franchise history. Chicago improved to 5-2 on its nine-game road trip with a 90-67 win in New Orleans on Wednesday, holding the Hornets to 37.3 percent shooting. It was the Bulls' third straight victory by at least 20 points, all against teams with losing records while allowing 90 or fewer. The easy win allowed Rose, who left the previous game with back spasms, to sit out the fourth quarter. He finished with six points, six assists and five rebounds in 22 minutes. \"The back was kind of tight,\" Rose said. \"(Coach Tom Thibodeau) did a great job of managing my minutes when he saw we had the game put away.\" The reigning league MVP recently returned after missing four games due to a sprained left big toe. He played less than 11 minutes in Monday's 108-87 win over New Jersey. \"Give D-Rose a lot of credit, man. He's been playing through it for a while,\" said Carlos Boozer, who led the team with 18 points Wednesday. \"Gutsy, gutsy dude, played through it again and then (backup) C.J. (Watson) came in and played great. ... I thought everybody from one through the whole team did a great job.\" The Bulls (22-6), who will close the road trip against streaking Boston team on Sunday, hope to make it another early night for Rose on Friday. Rose wasn't the only one who missed Chicago's 95-89 win over Charlotte on Jan. 21 with an injury, as Joakim Noah and reserves Taj Gibson and John Lucas sat out. Boozer scored 23 points while Luol Deng had 22. The Bobcats (3-22), who have lost 12 in a row, could have a tough time trying to stop even a less-than-healthy Rose given their own injury issues. Charlotte is coming off a 94-84 loss at Boston on Tuesday to finish a four-game road trip. After the game was close early, the Celtics opened the fourth quarter on a 13-2 run to take an 82-64 lead from which the Bobcats never recovered. Reggie Williams scored 21 points and reserve Derrick Brown had 20, hitting all 10 field-goal attempts. Williams was making his second straight start in place of the injured Gerald Henderson, who is out two to four weeks with a right hamstring strain. Charlotte is also without starting point guard D.J. Augustin, who has missed eight straight games with a toe injury. The Bobcats, who averaged 78.5 points and shot 38.7 percent during the road trip, would match the franchise's longest losing streak - set Jan. 11-Feb. 1, 2006 - with a loss Friday. \"When you have to play your main guys for as long as we do, it gets kind of tough,\" coach Paul Silas said. \"We've just got to keep battling.\" The Bobcats, who are 2-8 at home, have lost three straight to the Bulls.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

(AP) Derrick Rose can afford to take a night or two off with the way the Chicago Bulls are playing - especially when the opponent is the worst team in the NBA. Joakim Noah had 17 points and 14 rebounds, Carlos Boozer scored 16 points and the Bulls throttled the Charlotte Bobcats 95-64 Friday night despite the absence of their leading scorer and reigning league MVP. The Bulls (23-6) won their fifth straight overall and improved to 5-1 this season without Rose, who sat out because of a lower back strain. \"Our depth is our greatest strength right now,\" Noah said. \"Obviously we know that we need everybody healthy (come playoffs). This is definitely not a sprint, it's a marathon.\" C.J. Watson started in Rose's place and played a near flawless game with seven points, five assists, four steals and no turnovers. Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said he likes what Watson brings to the table. \"C.J. was terrific in the playoffs and he had a very difficult job last year,\" Thibodeau said. \"He was deserving of more minutes than he got but he handled short minutes great. He's done a great job with the second unit but he's shown that he can play with the first unit. He gives us multiple pick-and-rolls and also adds to our shooting, which I thought was a big concern. He gives us another 3-point shooter on the floor so we need to take advantage of that.\" And he's quickly earned the respect of his teammates. \"He's stepped up every time we needed him to,\" Boozer said of Watson. \"He's played great. C.J. could start for almost every other team in the NBA that doesn't have a starting point guard. We're very lucky to have him, to say the least.\" Rose injured his back earlier in the week and was limited in a 90-67 win over New Orleans on Wednesday. Thibodeau said Rose would be a game-time decision against the Bobcats and decided to hold him out after watching him in warm-ups. Clearly the Bulls didn't need him. All-Star selection Luol Deng scored 10 of his 12 points in the first quarter, including a pair of key 3-pointers as the Bulls jumped out to a 30-16 lead. They were never challenged after that. The Bulls extended the lead to 22 at halftime before pouring it on in the third quarter, pounding the ball inside to Noah and Boozer, who seemingly scored at will against a Bobcats frontcourt lacking in size and experience. That's been a persistent problem all season for the Bobcats since they allowed center Kwame Brown to leave via free agency. Noah was dominant inside, hitting 7 of 9 shots as the Bulls' lead hovered around 30 for most of the second half. Noah said the key for the Bulls has been playing fast and not giving defenses enough time to react and rotate. \"We're playing very well,\" Noah said. \"We play off Booze(r) a lot and he demands a lot of attention. He either scores or kicks it out and that creates a lot of opportunities for everyone else.\" John Lucas III added 11 points and Omer Asik had 12 rebounds for the Bulls. \"We do a great job of sharing the ball,\" Boozer said. \"We still want to go inside out. We do a great job of making the extra pass on offense. Defensively we're still very sharp and getting better at our defensive scheme and still doing a great job of helping each other. We're a help-side defensive team and I think we're getting better and better at our system.\" Charlotte posed no threat while dropping its 13th straight game. Derrick Brown scored 10 points to lead the NBA-worst Bobcats, who shot 33 percent from the field and hit only 1 of 8 from 3-point range to fall to 3-23. Brown was the only Bobcats player to finish in double figures. Corey Maggette returned to action after missing the last 19 games with a strained hamstring and had four points on 2-of-7 shooting in 14 minutes. Prior to the game, Bobcats coach Paul Silas called the Bulls the most talented team in the league and they certainly left no doubt about this one early on. The Bobcats even struggled from the free throw line with both Gana Diop and Bismack Biyombo shooting air balls from the stripe, drawing a mixture of chuckles and head-shaking disgust from the home crowd. \"It's just embarrassing,\" guard Kemba Walker said of the losing streak. \"We didn't have the aggressiveness rebounding the ball,\" Silas said. \"We weren't really doing much at all. You have to give them credit. Defensively they really keep you on one side if they can. You've got to move the basketball. We held it too long. We got to move the basketball.\" The Bobcats turned the ball over 16 times resulting in 27 points for the Bulls. \"We just threw the ball away with no real focus, you know, no concentration,\" Silas said. \"It's really hard to explain. I really can't explain why because we go through our offense daily.\" NOTES: The road only gets tougher for the Bobcats, who'll face two more division leaders in the Los Angeles Clippers and Philadelphia 76ers in their next two games at home. ... The Bulls have now won four straight road games - without a stop at home - by more than 20 points, an NBA record. ... Bobcats owner Michael Jordan was sitting courtside for Friday night's game but did not return for the second half.\n\nCopyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

  "latent_27651": "Adam Scherr (born September 6, 1983) is an American professional wrestler, actor and former strongman currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Braun Strowman.\n\nHe is the winner of the 2018 Men's Money in the Bank contract, along with the titular match at the Greatest Royal Rumble event, and is also a one-time Raw Tag Team Champion with Nicholas. Strowman has headlined many pay-per-view events, including the 2017 editions of SummerSlam and Survivor Series. He holds the record for most eliminations in a single Elimination Chamber match with five, most eliminations in a single Royal Rumble match with 13, and is tied for the most eliminations in a single Survivor Series elimination match with four. Upon debuting on the main roster, Strowman was associated with the villainous stable The Wyatt Family, wearing a black sheep mask and being physically dominant. Throughout his appearances with WWE, Strowman has been portrayed as an unstoppable monster.[3]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nAdam Scherr was born on September 6, 1983, in Sherrills Ford, North Carolina.[4] His father, Rick \"Crusher\" Scherr, is widely regarded as one of the greatest slow-pitch softball players of all time,[5][6][7] and is a USSSA Hall of Fame member who still holds the All Time World Series records in home runs (101), hits (166), and RBIs (202).[8] Scherr has a younger sister named Hannah.[9] As he grew older, he spent time in Arkansas and Tennessee. As a teen, he attended Bandys High School, where he was on the football, track and field, and wrestling teams. He went through a significant growth spurt in high school; he was 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) during his freshman year and grew to 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) by the time he graduated.[10] After graduating in 2001, he \"goofed off\" until 2003, when he enrolled in a community college. He spent the next four years playing football semi-professionally for the Hickory Hornets, supplementing his income by working as a doorman and mechanic. Scherr attended the NFL Scouting Combine in 2007, but he ultimately did not turn professional. In the late 2000s, he began competing in amateur strongman competitions.[11][12][13]\n\nStrongman career [ edit ]\n\nScherr earned his Strongman Corporation (ASC) Professional Card by winning the NAS US Amateur National Championships on November 5, 2011.[14] He won the 2012 Arnold Amateur Strongman Championships on March 4, which took place during the Arnold Sports Festival alongside the 2012 Arnold Strongman Classic.[15] This victory earned Scherr an invite to the 2013 Arnold Strongman Classic.[15] He competed in the SCL North American Championships on July 8, 2012, finishing in 5th place overall as well as competing in the Giants Live Poland event on July 21, finishing in 7th place overall.[16]\n\nProfessional wrestling career [ edit ]\n\nWWE [ edit ]\n\nTraining (2013–2015) [ edit ]\n\nScherr signed a contract with the professional wrestling promotion WWE in early 2013 and was assigned to the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida, where he adopted the ring name Braun Stowman (with the first name a reference to Milwaukee Brewers left fielder Ryan Braun).[17] In 2014, he made appearances as one of Adam Rose's \"Rosebuds\" in his Exotic Express gimmick.[18][19] He made his professional wrestling debut at an NXT live event in Jacksonville, Florida on December 19, 2014, defeating Chad Gable.[2] On June 2, 2015, Stowman appeared at a Main Event taping in a dark match, where he defeated an unidentified wrestler.[20]\n\nThe Wyatt Family (2015–2016) [ edit ]\n\nOn August 24 episode of Raw, Scherr, under the tweaked ring name Braun Strowman,[21] made his main roster debut by attacking Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns and establishing himself as the newest member of The Wyatt Family alongside Bray Wyatt , Luke Harper and Erick Rowan. [22][23] Strowman had his first televised singles match on the August 31 episode of Raw, when he defeated Ambrose by disqualification.[24] Strowman wrestled in his first WWE pay-per-view event match on September 20 at Night of Champions, where The Wyatt Family defeated Ambrose, Reigns and Chris Jericho in a six-man tag team match after Jericho passed out to Strowman's lifting arm triangle choke.[25] On December 13 at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, The Wyatt Family defeated The ECW Originals (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley (collectively known as The Dudley Boyz), Rhyno and Tommy Dreamer) in an eight-man tag team elimination tables match.[26]\n\nOn January 24, 2016, Strowman appeared at the Royal Rumble and scored among the most eliminations in the Royal Rumble match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, eliminating five opponents before being eliminated by Brock Lesnar, only to return to the match and helping his fellow Wyatt Family members to eliminate Lesnar.[27] Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter wrote that Strowman was \"put over as a monster\" in the match.[28] On February 21 at Fastlane, The Wyatt Family lost to the team of Big Show, Kane and Ryback,[29] but they got their win back the next night on Raw in a rematch.[30] Strowman appeared on April 3 at WrestleMania 32 during The Rock and John Cena's confrontation with The Wyatt Family.[31] The Wyatt Family were originally scheduled to face The League of Nations on May 1 at Payback,[32][33] but the match was cancelled after Wyatt suffered a legitimate injury.[34] In July, The Wyatt Family began a feud with the WWE Tag Team Champions The New Day,[35][36] which saw them defeating The New Day in a six-man tag team match on July 24 at Battleground.[37]\n\nUndefeated streak (2016–2017) [ edit ]\n\nStrowman in September 2016\n\nAs part of the 2016 WWE draft, Strowman was drafted to the Raw brand while Bray Wyatt and Erick Rowan were drafted to SmackDown instead, Strowman separated from The Wyatt Family and beginning his singles career.[38] On the following weeks on Raw, Strowman appeared with a modified appearance and defeated James Ellsworth and several other local wrestlers who put up no challenge.[39][40] On the September 5 episode of Raw, Sin Cara challenged Strowman due to him disrespecting luchadores, but he lost by countout and by pinfall in the following weeks.[41][42] On the October 17 episode of Raw, Strowman was confronted by Sami Zayn after easily defeating three local competitors in a one-on-three handicap match.[43] Strowman was scheduled to compete against Zayn the following week on Raw, but the match never started as both men attacked each other before the bell rang.[44] On the October 31 episode of Raw, Strowman won a battle royal by last eliminating Zayn for a spot on Team Raw for the traditional Survivor Series five-on-five elimination match.[45][46] At the event on November 20, Strowman eliminated Dean Ambrose, but he was the first man to be eliminated from Team Raw after being counted out due to interference by James Ellsworth, who was put through a table after being chased up the entrance ramp by Strowman.[47] Team Raw later lost the match.[48] On the December 13 episode of Raw, Raw General Manager Mick Foley announced a match between Strowman and Zayn for Roadblock: End of the Line on December 18,[49] being announced as a ten-minute time limit match in which Strowman had ten minutes to defeat Zayn, which Strowman was unable to do.[50] The following night on Raw, Strowman demanded a match against Zayn, but Foley had given Zayn the night off which prompted Strowman to attack Sin Cara and Titus O'Neil during their match and later attacked Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns during their match against Chris Jericho and Kevin Owens.[51] Strowman defeated Zayn in a Last Man Standing match on the January 2, 2017 episode of Raw to end their feud.[52]\n\nOn January 27 at the Royal Rumble, Strowman interfered during Kevin Owens and Roman Reigns' title match, helping Owens retain the Universal Championship.[53] Later that night, Strowman would enter the Royal Rumble match at number seven, eliminating Mojo Rawley, Big Cass, Kalisto, Mark Henry, Big Show, James Ellsworth and Tye Dillinger before being eliminated by Baron Corbin.[54][55] On the January 30 episode of Raw, Strowman challenged for his first world championship when he took on Kevin Owens for the Universal Championship as he was granted the match by Foley after video proof of Owens promising Strowman a title match, which Strowman would go on to win by disqualification after Reigns interfered and attacked him.[56] Strowman then continued to demand better competition, easily defeating four local competitors and then being granted a match with Reigns at Fastlane[57] while also attacked him in his match against Samoa Joe, causing Joe to win.[58] At the event on March 5, Strowman faced Reigns in a losing effort, marking his first loss by pinfall.[59] At WrestleMania 33 in April, Strowman competed in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, but failed to win.[60]\n\nUniversal Championship pursuits (2017–present) [ edit ]\n\nOn the April 10 episode of Raw, Strowman continued his feud with Roman Reigns, attacking him and kayfabe injuring his shoulder.[61] Despite playing a villain, Strowman received a very positive fan response, partially due to the negative fan reaction of Reigns.[62] The two had a match at Payback, where Strowman defeated Reigns.[63] After the May 8 episode of Raw, WWE claimed that Strowman had a legitimate injury with a shattered elbow and would therefore be sidelined for about six months.[64] This also caused a change in the schedule, with the planned match between him and Brock Lesnar at Great Balls of Fire having to be scrapped. Strowman underwent surgery three days later in May 11.[65] However, Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that while Strowman's elbow injury was indeed legitimate, it was minor, scheduled to sideline him for only two months, with WWE exaggerating it in order for him to make a surprise return \"four months early\".[66] On the June 19 episode of Raw, Strowman returned from injury, attacking Roman Reigns.[67] This led to an ambulance match at Great Balls of Fire, with Strowman winning.[68] At SummerSlam, Strowman would challenge for Lesnar's Universal Championship in a fatal-four-way match also involving Reigns and Samoa Joe in a losing effort.[69] Strowman faced Lesnar for the championship at No Mercy in September, but was unsuccessful once again.[70]\n\nStrowman later became involved in The Miz's feud with the reformed stable The Shield, culminating in a five-on-three handicap TLC match at the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in October. During the match, Strowman's teammates turned on him, throwing him into the back of a garbage truck, thus turning Strowman into a face in the process. His team would also go on to lose the match.[71] Strowman would return to Raw the following week, attacking The Miz and The Miztourage (Curtis Axel and Bo Dallas).[72] At Survivor Series in November, Strowman appeared as part of Team Raw, defeating Team SmackDown as Strowman and Triple H were the sole survivors of the team. After the match, Strowman attacked Triple H with two running powerslams.[73] On the December 11 episode of Raw, Strowman fought Kane to a double countout in a match to determine the number one contender to the Universal Championship on January 28, 2018 at the Royal Rumble leading to the match being changed to a triple threat match involving also Kane and Lesnar.[74] At the event, Strowman would be unsuccessful in winning.[75] The next night on Raw, Strowman defeated Kane in Last Man Standing match to qualify for the Elimination Chamber match at the titular pay-per-view to determine the number one contender for the Universal Championship.[76] At the event on February 25, Strowman eliminated The Miz, Elias, John Cena, Finn Bálor and Seth Rollins (setting the new record for the most eliminatation in a single Elimination Chamber match), but in the end he was eliminated by Roman Reigns.[77]\n\nOn the March 12 episode of Raw, Strowman, despite lacking a partner, won a tag team battle royal to determine the number one contenders for the Raw Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 34. Raw General Manager Kurt Angle allowed Strowman to challenge for the titles, under the provision he choose a partner at the event.[78] At the event on April 8, Strowman chose a young fan in attendance named Nicholas to be his partner (in reality, son of referee John Cone).[79] The duo then defeated champions Cesaro and Sheamus, winning his first championship in WWE and making Nicholas the youngest champion of any kind in WWE history.[80] The following night on Raw, Strowman and Nicholas relinquished the titles due to Nicholas' \"scheduling conflict\" (school).[81] On April 27 at the Greatest Royal Rumble in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Strowman won the namesake match and in doing so broke the record for most eliminations in a Royal Rumble match with 13, beating Roman Reigns' previous record of 12.[82][83]\n\nFrom April to August, Strowman feuded with Kevin Owens. He and Bobby Lashley defeated Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn at Backlash,[84] and won the Money in the Bank ladder match, where Strowman threw Owens from the top of a ladder against a table.[85] At Extreme Rules, Owens defeated Strowman in a Steel cage match after Strowman performed a chokeslam off the cage through an announce table on Owens, thereby giving Owens the win as his feet touched the floor first, per the rules.[86] At SummerSlam, Strowman defeated Owens in a singles match with his Money in the Bank contract on the line in two minutes.[87] Later in the night, Strowman announced he would be cashing in on the winner of the main event and challenging them after the match. However, then-reigning Universal Champion Brock Lesnar attacked Strowman during his match with Roman Reigns, leaving Strowman unable to cash in when Reigns won the title after pinning Lesnar.[88]\n\nStrowman would attempt another cash-in on Reigns, the new champion, the next night on Raw, but was stopped by The Shield, who attacked Strowman before the match became official.[89] Strowman then formed an alliance with Dolph Ziggler and Drew McIntyre by helping them attack The Shield, thus turning heel once again.[90] At Hell in a Cell in September, Strowman would cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase on Reigns, but due to interference from Brock Lesnar, the match ended in a no contest.[91] At Super Show-Down on October 6, Strowman, Ziggler and McIntyre faced The Shield in a losing effort,[92] before defeating them two days later on Raw.[93] However, on the October 15 episode of Raw, Strowman, Ziggler and McIntyre lost to The Shield once again after McIntyre accidentally kicked Strowman during the match. Afterwards, Strowman powerslammed Ziggler before being attacked by McIntyre, dissolving their partnership and turning Strowman face once again.[94]\n\nAt Crown Jewel in November, Strowman lost to Lesnar after a pre-match attack by Baron Corbin.[95] Later that month at Survivor Series, Strowman was again attacked by Corbin, along with McIntyre and Bobby Lashley, after Team Raw defeated Team SmackDown in the traditional tag team elimination match.[96] Braun Strowman defeated Baron Corbin in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to earn a Universal Championship match against Brock Lesnar at the Royal Rumble and Corbin was stripped of all authoritative power.[97] On the January 14, 2019 episode of Raw, he was removed from the Universal Championship match since he wasn't medicaly cleared to compete.[98] However, he instead participated in the Royal Rumble match, being the last eliminated by the eventual winner Seth Rollins.[99] In February, Strowman continued his feud with Corbin, leading to a no-disqualification match at Elimination Chamber, which Strowman lost after interference from McIntyre and Lashley.[100] However, the following night on Raw, Strowman defeated Corbin in a tables match.[101]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nScherr is an avid hunter, angler, camper, and outdoorsman.

  "latent_27696": "Photo: Alex DiGerlando/HBO\n\nTo help create the backwoods Louisiana noir of HBO’s True Detective, season-one director Cary Fukunaga recruited Alex DiGerlando, the production designer behind the haunting half-sunken bayou depicted in Beasts of the Southern Wild. Fukunaga had previously worked on a short film made by Beasts director Behn Zeitlin that was also set in a southern Delta community in the aftermath of a flood. Vulture spoke with DiGerlando about how he pulled off the detective drama’s haunting atmosphere, and asked him to walk us through behind-the-scenes photos of 13 exceptional props and set pieces.\n\nThe Devil’s Nests\n\nAll of the show’s artwork — from the twig sculptures known as devil’s nests to the church paintings — was created by Joshua Walsh, an artist from Detroit who had spent 20 years working in New Orleans. “He’s the son of a family that ran a funeral home, and he’s an avid hunter and taxidermist — basically, the perfect dude for the job,” DiGerlando told Vulture. Walsh worked full-time for nine months creating over 100 pieces for the show.\n\nAccording to DiGerlando, there was very little detail about what a “devil’s nest” should look like in the script. Pizzolatto’s rough guidelines specified that they should have a spiral motif and be able to stand on their own. “They were described as sort of watching over that first crime scene,” DiGerlando said. They decided on a tripod structure, which, if laid on its side, would have a spiral naturally build in from the bottom. “We were also told all of this artwork is the killer’s way of ascension to reach this spiritual plain that he has in his mind,” DiGerlando said. “Thus, the ladder aspect. You’ll notice a lot of the tripods have cross-members going up the sides.” Not all of them, though. No two look the same. They show up throughout the series at the girl’s playhouse, the abandoned school, the Ledoux meth compound, “and for reasons best not to get into, we wanted subtly different looks for each of those settings. It wasn’t as simple as making an assembly line for them. Josh Walsh designed each one for each specific set.”\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nDiGerlando found Walsh by chance. For inspiration, DiGerlando had already pulled the art of primitive and voodoo cultures, and of outsider artists Henry Darger and James Castle, when he spotted a small hummingbird sculpture made by Walsh on the desk of set decorator Cynthia Slagter. It was made of twine and sinew and reeds and little sticks, which matched up with DiGerlando’s vision for the killer’s art. “We wanted it to have a primitive, primal feeling,” he said. “He isn’t a person who went to art school. He’s a person who has some deep inner urge to express himself, and he does it through these murders and these constructions. Josh went very Method and made most of the pieces using the materials he thought this guy would use: mud, ripped-up pieces of children’s clothes that he bought at thrift stores, roots. He’d wander through the marsh on shopping expeditions.”\n\nThe Crime Scene\n\nIn the series premiere, Hart and Cohle find the slain body of a prostitute, who had been tied up, raped, mutilated, and crowned with deer antlers, in a scorched sugar field outside of Erath, Louisiana.\n\nIn the original script, the detectives find Dora Lange’s corpse bent over in prayer in the woods with wings attached to her back. The first thing to go were the woods. “There aren’t great woods in Louisiana. It’s more of a swamp,” DiGerlando said. Production swapped in a particularly striking sugar cane field that he had scouted for the finale (which no longer takes place there). “They were burning the fields to clear them at the time, and it was so moody and atmospheric setting for this bizarre altar.” Pizzolatto replaced the wings with antlers for an equally pragmatic reason. “There was something else he remembered that used wings. I think it was Red Riding,” DiGerlando said. “It was always written that she was in a kneeling position, though, praying toward the tree, and there were always three of the twig sculptures standing by looking over her.”\n\nThe Spirals\n\nYou see them everywhere. The bird formation. On the back of Dora Lange. In the freshly mowed grass. There’s just one place that a spiral made an accidental appearance …\n\nDiGerlando can’t say too much about the story behind the spirals — though we can assume they’re all wrapped up in Cohle’s metaphysical monologues. (“This is a world where nothing is solved,” Cohle says in the 2012 timeline. “Someone once told me time is a flat circle. Everything we’ve ever done or will do, we’re gonna do over and over and over again.”) They’re all associated with the killer. Pizzolatto drew a spiral image himself, and Walsh refined the final irregular shape by taking a wire clothing hanger and twisting it into a spiral. “The idea being these guys — the killer and the LeDoux brothers — would use it as a branding tool,” DiGerlando said.\n\nFor those tracking the appearances of the spirals, you can cross off the one you found in Hart’s house. That was a mistake. “I didn’t even notice that one,” DiGerlando said. “We got a whole bunch of artwork from the daughter of a friend of mine down the street and used it to decorate Marty’s house. None of us put it together that there was a spiral in there.”\n\nCohle’s Empty Apartment\n\nWhite walls, a mattress, a cross. Cohle: “That’s a form of meditation.” Hart: “How’s that?” Cohle: “I contemplate the moment in the garden, the idea of allowing your own crucifixion.”\n\nDiGerlando and Fukunaga set out to find a place similar to where McConaughey’s character in Dallas Buyers Club lived. “Like a fleabag motel,” DiGerlando said. “But as we were looking, we realized two things. One, we have a lot of that kind of stuff in the show anyway, and two, it didn’t seem to make sense that a detective, as crazy or as self-destructive as Rust may seem, would live in such a disgusting place.” They went in the opposite direction: spartan style. “It’s no more and no less than what he needs to survive, and that tells you everything you need to know about him. He doesn’t need anything extraneous.” They wound up jettisoning nearly everything from the room, including a sofa bed, a box spring, a nightstand. “It pays off later on when Maggie shows up and you see him by himself flashing his flashlight at the antlers, trying to figure it out,” DiGerlando said. “He doesn’t want the distraction of anything else. The case is where he lives. That is, he lives in his own mind and there’s nothing extraneous in there.”\n\nThe Beer-Can Men\n\nThey’re a motif that runs throughout Pizzolatto’s work. “I think they show up in his novel, too,” DiGerlando said. “You’d have to ask him where it comes from.” Getting the look just right took some experimenting. It had to be someone McConaughey could do with ease while spouting Cohle’s bleak worldviews. Pizzolatto had described the men as having lids for heads, but that didn’t work. “We found that it looked a little goofy, almost too comical, DiGerlando said. “We had cut the rim off the top of the can and folded it up so the hole where you’d drink from became the mouth. It looked like Edvard Munch’s The Scream, with this big head bobbing around.”\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nAnother version used two cans for every one man. Like Cohle’s apartment, they wound up stripping it down to the most minimal figure. As for using Lone Star, DiGerlando said they were the brand game to let their beer cans be used for purposes other than drinking. “It was just serendipitous that it happened to lend itself to the way the star lays out on the beer-can men,” he said.\n\nThe Burned-Down Church\n\nAt the end of episode two, Hart and Cohle arrive at the torched remains of Pastor Theriot’s (Shea Whigham) old church. DiGerlando’s team built it from scratch near the Bonnet Carre Spillway, also seen in Beasts of the Southern Wild.\n\nPhoto: Alex DiGerlando/HBO\n\n“Because of the lack of burnt-down churches available to us, we knew were going to have to build that,” DiGerlando said. The challenge was in finding the right piece of land, which needed to be off the beaten track — so that Hart and Cohle would have to follow their leads to it — but near a road. They settled on the not-so-accommodating patch behind the spillway. “You had to get to it by driving down a service road over a levee, down a mud road, and then we even had to drop down gravel to make it reachable. There was a lot of, Is this worth it?” DiGerlando laughed. “But we all loved the location, having the water and all those refineries in the distance, and the train tracks. What luck to be able to get that shot with the train going by as they pull up. And having that natural brush hitting the church? The approach to the church looked excellent.” The church itself took a month to build. They kept a fire going throughout to char the wood they used to built the skeletal back of the building.\n\nInside the church, they brought back Ella Densen — the same 7-year-old who produced the artwork of Marty’s daughters — to do the Biblical scenes found on the walls. The script specified David and Goliath and Jesus and the leper, among others. Later, Walsh came in to paint the girl with antlers on top of Ella’s work, which he produced using the leftover charred wood as smudge sticks. “There’s a lot going on,” DiGerlando said. “If you stopped and looked, you’d see his artwork on top of hers and then the greens and vines over that, and the idea being a couple months prior to the detectives’ arrival, the church burned down and the killer at some point showed up and left his mark.”\n\nThe Offices of the Louisiana State Criminal Investigations Division\n\nIt’s the only set seen in every episode. The interior had to be re-dressed often as the narrative bounced back and forth between 1995, 2002, and 2012.\n\n“One of the biggest challenges we designed, one of the most important in the show even though people probably don’t think about it, is the room they’re being interrogated in in 2012,” DiGerlando said. It’s a conference room in 1995 that gradually becomes more of a storage area, which is why boxes and typewriters hang out in the background when Hart and Cohle are being interrogated later on. “It was a lot of moving old computers out and new computers in, hiding and displaying wires for IT,” he said. “We built all of it: the evidence room Marty breaks into, the turquoise checkered flooring, all of it.” The offices are set inside an old lightbulb warehouse in Elmwood, Louisiana. “It had a dated architectural look, dated for even 1995, with this pebbled texture, these interesting skinny windows with arched tops, and this fantastic lobby with the free-floating staircase,” DiGerlando said. “We wanted it to not look like it was new in 1995.\n\nPhoto: Alex DiGerlando/HBO\n\nCohle’s Big Hug Mug\n\n“I had nothing to do with it,” DiGerlando laughed. Prop master Lynda Reiss brought several options for the cheesy mug, and Fukunaga picked the big hug. “It’s the one prop Cary wanted to keep,” he said. “I’m so pissed I didn’t go on eBay before the show aired and not buy up a bunch of those. They’re worth a small fortune now.” There’s no secret message hidden there, either, though DiGerlando said they did look for any opportunity to insert some levity into the show, “because it is relentlessly dark.”\n\nPastor Theriot’s Tent Revival Church\n\nIn the beginning of episode three, “The Locked Room,” Hart and Cohle find the pastor preaching in his new church (“This world is a veil, and the face you wear is not your own,” Theriot says) made out of a tent top and decorated with painted-on scripture verses. “This was one of my favorites,” DiGerlando said.\n\nPhoto: Alex DiGerlando/HBO\n\nMany of the revival tents DiGerlando found in his research were striped, which felt too much like a circus, so he opted for a plain one with a big ol’ cross on top. He found a company that made them, but had to create a 3-D model of the tent to figure out how big they could make the cross and have it fit in the frame with Pastor Theriot mid-sermon. Scenic artists came to “dirty up” the fabric and draw in the words as though they were hand-done by the congregation. “The tent revival feels a bit lost in time,” DiGerlando said. “You don’t see them as often, and there’s a sadness to it which I really liked.”\n\nPhoto: Alex DiGerlando/HBO\n\nThe Abandoned School\n\nAt the end of episode five, Cohle revisits the devastated school once attended by Rianne Olivier. He and Marty never got to investigate it because of a last-minute lead on Ledoux. He goes back to explore and finds it decked out with Mary statues, devil’s nests, and the creepiest cherub paintings ever.\n\nThe piles of desks were already at the old Kenner High School in New Orleans, one of the few show-stopper sets DiGerlando was fortunate enough to find. “We sculpted the desks to make a maze for Rust to walk through, leading him to the reveal of the devil nest sculptures. We wanted them to feel like they were sitting there, as if they were students in the classroom,” he said. “They kind of reminded us of these photographs Robert Polidari took of Chernobyl.” Walsh came back to paint the scary “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” cherubs on the wall. “You can really see when he picks up that devil’s nest and looks from the bottom how it has that spiral effect.”\n\nBeth’s Apartment\n\nThe young prostitute Hart encouraged to leave the bunny ranch in 1995 resurfaces in 2002 (episode six, “Haunted Houses”) with a new job, her own place, and her sights set on Hart.\n\n“A lot of these characters are so damaged and living in very desolate living situations, and Beth (Lili Simmons) is a character who actually pulled herself out of a not so great situation,” DiGerlando said. To that end, he made her apartment in 2002 a kind of extension of Jan’s trailer at the bunny ranch where Beth worked. “We tried to make that trailer a little homey, add some feminine qualities to make it … more a shade of gray than just the place where this horrible madame exploits these girls. There’s dialogue in the scene to that effect, that there’s more to it than Marty would think,” DiGerlando said. “We wanted to make sure Beth had some dimension and a real interior life. Her apartment had to be a place she’d walk in and say, ‘This is my home.’ She’s got a straight job, she’s going to want something nice, and we interpreted that to mean not a cookie-cutter apartment.” To give it some character, he added an arch, put up floral wallpaper, gave it an odd stucco texture, and created a DIY canopy bed that DiGerlando had spotted on a scouting trip made of blankets and old dresses.\n\nThe Ledoux Cousins’ Meth Compound\n\nWe first see Reggie Ledoux briefly at the end of episode three on his meth compound wearing a jockstrap and gas mask. Hart and Cohle don’t get a good look at the place until two episodes later in “The Secret Fate of All Life,” when Marty makes a horrifying discovery and kills Ledoux.\n\nDiGerlando wanted a Frankenstein setup for the compound: a found trailer as their shack, a shipping container to serve as the lab (“We dressed that whole lab and unfortunately, you don’t get to see it,” he said), a deer blind structure in the back, wrecked cars, barrels, and devil’s nests all over the place. “The shack itself had to have a mazelike quality so Marty and Ledoux can cross paths in that one moment without Ledoux realizing,” he said. But the most important detail for DiGerlando was the locked room in which the children were being hidden. “I knew early on I wanted to use the cube from a cube truck for that,” he said. “The way it unlocks, I knew there’d be drama in that.”\n\nCohle’s Storage Unit\n\nTurns out Rust’s even more obsessed with the case than we thought! DiGerlando reports that prop master Lynda Reiss’s team spent months creating all the evidence Cohle had collected over the years, revealed in episode seven, “After You’ve Gone.”\n\n“The night before we shot there, Matthew camped out and painted some stuff. He had himself a vision quest,” DiGerlando said. That’s because the storage unit was the culmination of everything Cohle had drudged up between 1995 and 2012. To make sure the space was bursting with stuff, Reiss held photo shoots, hired artists, created books (like the one on how to build devil’s nests), worked up detailed documents and newspaper clippings — all to demonstrate years of obsession. “It’s not like you can call up an image library and say, ‘Give me all your pictures of dead bodies.’ We had to generate all that,” DiGerlando said, pointing to the weird occult paraphernalia, the photo of the girl with the horses, microfiche, photo copies, the yearbook, and all the stuff that had previously been in Rust’s apartment. “It should look like maybe Rust was around more than we thought he was, like he had in fact been working on this case for years.” And there’s an order to all of it. “He’s meticulous, so while it may look messy, everything is in place. There’s an area for the maps, an area for his photographs, things that inspire him. There’s even an area where he experiments with the construction of how he might make a devil’s nest.”",
  "latent_27722": "Do you believe there’s an objective truth? Well, you’re a white supremacist then, at least according to a small number of black Pomona College students.\n\nDo you believe there’s an objective truth? Well, you’re a white supremacist then, at least according to a small number of black Pomona College students.\n\nIn a letter that strings together words the students no doubt learned in their Blank-Studies classes in what almost appears to be social justice Mad Libs (the word “marginalized” appears seven times in the one-page document), the students claim inviting a speaker critical of Black Lives Matter and supportive of police amounts to oppression.\n\nFurther, the three authors of the letter—freshmen Dray Denson, Avery Jonas, and sophomore Shanaya Stephenson—explain that “the Truth” is a concept rooted in racism.\n\n“The idea that there is a single truth–’the Truth’–is a construct of the Euro-West that is deeply rooted in the Enlightenment, which was a movement that also described Black and Brown people as both subhuman and impervious to pain,” the students wrote. “This construction is a myth and white supremacy, imperialism, colonization, capitalism, and the United States of America are all of its progeny. The idea that the truth is an entity for which we must search, in matters that endanger our abilities to exist in open spaces, is an attempt to silence oppressed peoples” (emphasis added).\n\nNotice the list of social justice buzzwords: white supremacy, imperialism, colonization, and capitalism. I’m surprised they didn’t include authoritarianism and Donald Trump.\n\nThe letter is a response to an email sent by Pomona College president David Oxtoby, who on April 7 criticized those who protested the Manhattan Institute’s Heather Mac Donald. Mac Donald was invited to speak by the Rose Institute for State and Local Government at Claremont McKenna College, Pomona’s sister school, about her book, “The War on Cops.” Some students called her a “notorious white supremacist fascist,” and proceeded to chant “Black Lives Matter” while banging on the windows of the building where Mac Donald was scheduled to speak.\n\nDisagreeing With Me Makes You a White Supremacist\n\nOxtoby wrote in his email to students that Pomona opposes “preventing others from engaging with an invited speaker.” He further stated that Pomona’s “mission is founded upon the discovery of truth, the collaborative development of knowledge and the betterment of society.”\n\nDenson, Jonas and Stephenson took offense to Oxtoby’s defense of the truth.\n\n“The idea that the search for this truth involves entertaining Heather Mac Donald’s hate speech is illogical,” the students wrote. “If engaged, Heather Mac Donald would not be debating on mere difference of opinion, but the right of Black people to exist. Heather Mac Donald is a fascist, a white supremacist, a warhawk, a transphobe, a queerphobe, a classist, and ignorant of interlocking systems of domination that produce the lethal conditions under which oppressed peoples are forced to live.”\n\nWhere do they get the idea that Mac Donald doesn’t think black people have the right to exist? Defending good cops and criticizing the bad tactics of a politically correct group (that not all black people have decided to join) doesn’t mean she believes black people don’t have a right to exist. Also, again notice the string of social-justice-warrior buzzwords to describe Mac Donald.\n\nMac Donald wasn’t the only target of the students’ ire. They also wanted the school to “take action” against the Claremont Independent, a right-leaning campus publication. The three students, along with nearly a dozen others, signed their names to the letter, then said if the Independent publishes those names and they “receive threats and hate mail,” then Pomona should “take legal action against members of the Claremont Independent involved with the editing and publication process as well as disciplinary action, such as expulsion on the grounds of endangering the wellbeing of others.”\n\nGet that? They signed their names, but if they receive any backlash for their actions they want other students expelled and sued. How progressive.\n\nMac Donald Responds: ‘A Major Embarassment’\n\nIn a statement to The Federalist, Mac Donald called the letter “a major embarrassment to the Pomona and Claremont faculty.” She cited instances of poor writing and grammar, but lambasted the content as well.\n\n“The students appear to argue that the ideal of free speech is based on a mystifying and oppressive concept of unitary truth, and that such a concept solidifies white supremacy … [yet] They are fully confident that they possess the truth about me and about their oppressed plight at Pomona and Claremont,” Mac Donald said.\n\nMac Donald also defended her work, saying the students have misread it.\n\n“My entire argument about the necessity of proactive policing is based on the value of black lives,” she said. “I have decried the loss of black life to drive-by shootings and other forms of street violence. I have argued that the fact that blacks die of homicide at six times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined is a civil rights abomination. And I have tried to give voice to the thousands of law-abiding residents of high-crime areas who are desperate for more police protection so that they can enjoy the same freedom from fear as people in more wealthy areas take for granted.”\n\nDo What We Want Or Else We’ll Say You’re Racists\n\nThe students have also demanded that Oxtoby respond to them by Tuesday at 4:07 p.m. and send a revised email by Thursday, “apologizing for the previous patronizing statement, enforcing that Pomona College does not tolerate hate speech and speech that projects violence onto the bodies of its marginalized students and oppressed peoples, especially Black students who straddle the intersection of marginalized identities, and explaining the steps the institution will take and the resources it will allocate to protect the aforementioned students.”\n\nSo. Many. Buzzwords.\n\nThe social justice warrior problem on college campuses appears to be escalating. The protests are becoming more violent, and the demands are becoming more absurd. Just last week, the editorial staff of the Wellesley College student newspaper wrote: “If people are given the resources to learn and either continue to speak hate speech or refuse to adapt their beliefs, then hostility may be warranted.”\n\nThe phrase “hate speech” has lost all meaning on campuses, as it now refers simply to speech liberal students don’t agree with. They claim it is bigoted, dangerous, and “violent,” making it acceptable—in their minds—to respond with physical violence.\n\nI’d honestly believe this letter was a hoax, like that ridiculous article on the Huffington Post demanding we take away all white men’s voting rights, which was taken down because the author was fake—except you can actually find these students in the campus directory.",
  "latent_27730": "House Speaker Paul Ryan. AP\n\nThe House will be forced to vote for a second time on the GOP tax bill because a Senate rule forced Republicans to change it hours after leaders celebrated what appeared to be a massive legislative victory.\n\nThe House on Tuesday voted to pass the version of the tax bill that came out of the bicameral conference committee, appearing to pave the way for the Senate to pass it later in the night.\n\nBut three pieces of the bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, were deemed to violate the so-called Byrd rule and must be removed before the Senate can vote on the legislation.\n\nThe House will now have to vote on this latest version so that both chambers pass an identical bill.\n\nA representative for the House Ways and Means Committee said the chamber would take up this version, expected to pass the Senate, on Wednesday.\n\n\"The Senate parliamentarian determined two minor provisions do not have budgetary impacts and had to be removed from the bill,\" the representative told Business Insider. \"The Senate will still vote tonight, and the House will vote tomorrow to send the final bill to the president's desk.\"\n\nRepublicans are using a process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill without being subject to a Democratic filibuster. But that also means the legislation must comply with the Byrd rule, which stipulates that it must not be projected to add to the federal debt outside of 10 years and that all its provisions must deal with the budget.\n\nThe parliamentarian, a sort of umpire for Senate rules, determined that three elements of the bill violated the Byrd rule:\n\nThe name. The short name of the bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, appears to be placed incorrectly in the legislation. Changes to the so-called 529 savings plan. The bill would have allowed money in the college-savings accounts to be used for homeschooling supplies. The exemption for small colleges from a new excise tax. The bill had proposed a tax on college and university endowments exceeding $500,000 for every student enrolled, but it included a provision that would have exempted those with fewer than 500 tuition-paying students. The parliamentarian struck only the words \"tuition-paying,\" the Ways and Means representative said.\n\nEven with the delay, the bill is expected to make it to President Donald Trump's desk before the GOP's self-imposed Christmas deadline.",
  "latent_27759": "Yet even though 25 percent of Americans suffer from a diagnosable mental illness in any year, there are few signs of innovation from the major drug makers.\n\nAfter a series of failed clinical trials in which novel antidepressants and antipsychotics did little or no better than placebos, the companies seem to have concluded that developing new psychiatric drugs is too risky and too expensive. This trend was obvious at the 2011 meeting of the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, where only 13 of 300 abstracts related to psychopharmacology and none related to novel drugs. Instead, they are spending most of their research dollars on illnesses like cancer, heart disease and diabetes, which have well-defined biological markers and are easier to study than mental disorders.\n\nTo understand this predicament, it helps to know how we got here.\n\nAll of our current antidepressants, antipsychotics and anti-anxiety drugs share the same molecular targets in the brain as their prototypes from the 1950s. For example, the new antipsychotic drugs block dopamine receptors in critical brain regions, just like the first antipsychotic, Thorazine, synthesized in 1950. And all of our current antidepressants increase the levels of one or more of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine or norepinephrine, just like the early tricyclic antidepressants.\n\nWith rare exceptions, it is hard to think of a single truly novel psychotropic drug that has emerged in the last 30 years. True, the new psychotropic drugs are generally safer and more tolerable than older prototypes, but they are no more effective. So why has the pharmaceutical industry churned out so many copycat drugs?\n\nThe simple answer is that we don’t yet understand the fundamental cause of most psychiatric disorders, in part because the brain is uniquely difficult to study; you can’t just biopsy the brain and analyze it. That is why scientists have had great trouble identifying new targets for psychiatric drugs.",
  "latent_28028": "Some of you may have already started digging in deep on the Steam Summer Sale, but it’s important to note that not all discounts are discounts done in good faith. Some of these are discounted after going through a brief price hike, so it seems like you’re getting the game in a nice little bargain deal but that’s not entirely the case.\n\nThere’s a thread over on the official Steam sub-reddit where they warn gamers to keep an eye out on prices raised just for the sake of adding a percentage by it to give the impression that it’s cheaper than what it is. They do note that it was a tactic used by DayZ when it first launched, as well as by Gaijin Entertainment for War Thunder with some of the DLC packs a year ago during the Steam Summer Sale.\n\nThe post notes that deceptive pricing is unlawful in many regions, including the United States of America. It’s listed over on the FTC under title 16, chapter I, sub-chapter B, part 233, where Reddit user LegionVsNinja points to section 233.1 for reference regarding deceptive pricing, which reads…\n\n“If, on the other hand, the former price being advertised is not bona fide but fictitious—for example, where an artificial, inflated price was established for the purpose of enabling the subsequent offer of a large reduction—the “bargain” being advertised is a false one; the purchaser is not receiving the unusual value he expects. In such a case, the “reduced” price is, in reality, probably just the seller’s regular price.”\n\nUsers also notify that users in New Zealand should also be wary of this law, where deceptive pricing is unlawful according to the Fair Trading Act as noted on the official FTA Government website. The ACCC also have a clause about deceptive pricing on their website — and take note that the ACCC is the same organization that helped pressure Valve and EA into adding refunds to Steam and Origin.\n\nThere’s even an example of how deceptive pricing can be used by retailers to deceive customers, with the FTC rolling out the following guideline….\n\n“The following is an example of a price comparison based on a fictitious former price. John Doe is a retailer of Brand X fountain pens, which cost him $5 each. His usual markup is 50 percent over cost; that is, his regular retail price is $7.50. In order subsequently to offer an unusual “bargain”, Doe begins offering Brand X at $10 per pen. He realizes that he will be able to sell no, or very few, pens at this inflated price. But he doesn’t care, for he maintains that price for only a few days. Then he “cuts” the price to its usual level—$7.50—and advertises: “Terrific Bargain: X Pens, Were $10, Now Only $7.50!” This is obviously a false claim. The advertised “bargain” is not genuine.”\n\nA perfect real world example of this is from the Steam Prices website, which shows the markups and markdowns of games and their SRP on Steam. Notice, in particular, Grand Theft Auto V in the image below.\n\nAs of June 8th, 2015 an image of the Steam store page was captured and archived of Grand Theft Auto V indicating that the game was available for $59.99. There were no bundle packs available for $79.99 or $84.97 according to the image above. You can see the comparison in the image below.\n\nAs of June 11th, 2015, you can check the Steam sale page where there’s a “sale” indicating that the game is 25% off for $59.99 or 56,23€, down from the $79.99 markup, as evidenced in the image below.\n\nA few days ago, there was no $79.99 standard retail distribution price or bundle for Grand Theft Auto V, as evidenced by the June 8th, 2015 archive capture. Once the Steam sale got underway the price has been marked up with a 25% discount, bringing it back down to the standard retail price. The only difference is that it now includes a “Great White Shark Cash Card”, which regularly sells for $19.99, a content item that also wasn’t listed on the store in the June 8th capture of the page.\n\nNow, the bundles with Max Payne 3 and GTA V are fine since they’re two completely separate products being discounted during the sale. But adding a cash-shop bundle pack and then discounting the price the day of the sale and making it the normal $59.99 price seems intent on cashing in on the discount craze, even though the price is the same as the SRP.\n\nI did reach out to Rockstar via multiple points of contact and will update the article if they decide to respond.\n\nIn the meantime, be wary of these kind of deals during the Steam Summer Sale and don’t hesitate to contact the FTC about deceptive pricing models from publishers, distributors or retailers. Be sure to include detailed information about the instance and screenshot and archive everything. You can learn more about filing complaints with the FTC by visiting the official FTC.gov website.",

  "latent_28166": "It can be a challenge to stand out in the very crowded ethnic restaurant market of Lakewood, let alone Cleveland. When it comes to Thai food alone there are three separate options within a single half-mile stretch of Madison Avenue. Open just under a year, Thai Thai has indeed managed not only to stand out but rise like cream to the top of the takeout menu pile for folks tired of begging owners to make their food \"Thai spicy.\"\n\nThai Thai offers the perfect illustration of how less is more: less in terms of the space, less in terms of the design, and less in terms of the menu. Like a '60s-era cafe racer, this nimble eatery is stripped down to its bare essentials. That's precisely what happens when you hand the keys over to the next generation and let them do their thing.\n\nKiwi and brother Santi Wongpeng grew up in a restaurant family. Their parents opened and operated the original Thai Hut down the street (now run by different owners) before moving on to the Asian Grille, which they operated for about eight years until the neighborhood no longer provided them with the level of business required to sustain it. At the urging of the kids, the family came out of retirement.\n\n\"This restaurant was actually my idea,\" Kiwi says. \"Everybody here does Thai food for Americans. That's not Thai food to me. I said, 'Why don't we do something new, something more authentic, something like street food.'\"\n\nThai Thai is the kind of joint you'll drive right by, a nondescript storefront in a sea of nondescript storefronts. There are just 15 seats in the diminutive space, and a handful of those are simply stools at a wall-facing counter. In place of the customary pages-long laminated menu filled with dozens of dishes that everybody ignores in favor of pad Thai, this spot hands over a tidy one-sheet affixed to a clipboard. It's not just the trimmed-down quantity of offerings that stands out; it's the nature of those dishes.\n\nDevised for the Instagram generation, Thai Thai offers guests a greatest hits-style mix of dishes that are both foreign and familiar, but always memorable. Items are annotated by Kiwi with emoji-era clips like \"Try me!\" and \"Very tasty!\" and \"Most popular street dish!\"\n\n\"When we were making the menu, I kind of thought back to my memories of when I was young and living in Thailand,\" Kiwi explains. \"I thought about all the different street foods they served and we kind of mixed them together.\"\n\nI've never been to Chiang Mai, but thanks to the Wongpengs I've tasted that city's signature sausage, sold at countless food stalls and markets throughout the city. The chubby housemade links ($5.50) are juicy and pungent, with floral kicks of lemongrass. Likewise, gai yang, Thai-style grilled chicken, is as ubiquitous a dish as they come on the streets of Bangkok. At Thai Thai, marinated chicken ($5) is skewered, grilled to order, and served charred and juicy. Pair that dish with some sticky rice ($5) and som tum ($7.95) and you're halfway to earning your Thai citizenship. Som tum, for the uninitiated, is a deceivingly spicy salad composed of shredded green papaya, carrots, green beans and bean sprouts in a tart and blindingly bright citrus dressing.\n\nThai Thai isn't the only place in town to serve pad krapow ($9.95), sometimes listed on menus as Holy Basil, but it is one of very few that tops the steamed jasmine rice with a runny fried egg, as is customary on the streets of Thailand. The habit-forming minced-meat dish has that textbook layering of sweet, tart and salty, and the standard-issue heat level is \"Thai spicy\" without the need to sound like a goober when ordering.

New processes must be drawn up for registrars, and new forms will also have to be drawn up.\n\nThe government expects to announce a more formal timetable for the implementation of the law in the fall.\n\nThe Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill cleared the House of Lords and the House of Commons this week, just before the summer recess. The monarch's assent -- a formality in the United Kingdom -- makes the measure official.\n\nThe bill had the backing of British Prime Minister David Cameron, but his commitment to it put him at odds with many in his Conservative Party and its grass-roots supporters. The Conservatives govern in coalition with the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe bill was also opposed by religious groups, including the Church of England.\n\nThe Catholic Church in England and Wales said that the law's passage \"marks a watershed in English law and heralds a profound social change,\" and that it regretted that the bill had been \"rushed though\" Parliament.\n\n\"With this new legislation, marriage has now become an institution in which openness to children, and with it the responsibility on fathers and mothers to remain together to care for children born into their family unit, are no longer central. That is why we were opposed to this legislation on principle,\" a statement said.\n\n'Go forth and propose'\n\nThe debate over the legislation became heated at times in the House of Commons, where the issue exposed divisions within Cameron's party.\n\nConservative MP Gerald Howarth angered many when he referred to \"the aggressive homosexual community\" that would \"see this is as but a stepping stone to something even further.\"\n\nResponding to the news that the law had passed, Labour lawmaker Chris Bryant tweeted: \"The Queen has given Royal Assent to Same Sex Marriage. Aggressive homosexuals, please note. Go forth and propose.\"\n\nThe new law will allow same-sex couples to marry in civil or religious ceremonies.\n\nHowever, religious organizations must explicitly \"opt in\" if they want to perform such ceremonies, and the religious minister conducting the ceremony must also agree.\n\nThe law also protects religious organizations and their representatives who don't wish to conduct marriages of same-sex couples from being challenged in the courts.\n\nIt will allow couples in civil partnerships to convert to marriage if they wish. The new law also allows married men or women who wish to change their gender to do so without ending their marriage.\n\nA law recognizing civil partnerships in England and Wales was passed in 2004.\n\nThe issue of same-sex marriage has also divided other nations.\n\nA law that allows same-sex couples to marry and adopt was passed by France this year, despite large street protests and vocal opposition from religious groups. The move made it the ninth country in Europe to allow same-sex marriage.\n\nIn the United States, two landmark rulings by the Supreme Court last month gave the gay and lesbian rights movement huge political and legal momentum.\n\nThe justices said legally married same-sex couples will now enjoy the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples, striking down a key provision in the Defense of Marriage Act.",

  "latent_28492": "After a video emerged appearing to show Hillary Clinton struggling to stand upright before stumbling into a car at a 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York City Sunday, the presidential candidate was forced to go public with the pneumonia diagnosis she received two days before.\n\nBut the near-fainting spell was in fact due to dehydration, exacerbated by her condition. Her husband Bill Clinton said Monday that it wasn’t the first time. “Rarely, but on more than one occasion, over the last many, many years, the same sort of thing’s happened to her where she just got severely dehydrated,” he said.\n\nPolitico reports, citing unnamed sources, that Clinton is chronically dehydrated, and that her reluctance to regularly drink water has become a “source of tension” between the candidate and her staff. “She won’t drink water, and you try telling Hillary Clinton she has to drink water,” a source in close contact with the Democratic candidate said. Politico described a hectic rehydration mission which included lots of bottles of water as well as Gatorade.\n\nIn 2013, CBS reported that some 75% of Americans may be functioning in a chronic state of dehydration, many mistaking the symptoms for other illnesses. Whether she’s among them or not, the Democratic nominee might be better off taking a big gulp next time a staff member approaches with a glass of water. Here’s everything you need to know about dehydration:\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nWhy do we get dehydrated?\n\nDehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in, upsetting its balance of salts and sugar, which affects the way it functions. Water makes up between 60-70% of average adult— and it’s important to keep levels stable. Water is essential for life and our body uses it in many different ways, from lubricating joints and regulating our temperature to enabling waste removal via sweating, bowel movements and urination.\n\nIf not treated immediately, chronic – or ongoing – dehydration can lead to serious medical complications; it can affect your kidney function, increase the risk of kidney stones and lead to muscle damage and constipation. This level of dehydration requires hospital treatment where a sufferer will be attached to a drip to restore fluids. Of patients treated for kidney stones, 50% are likely to have a recurrence within ten years.\n\nHow do we get dehydrated?\n\nUsually, by not drinking enough fluid – usually water – to replace what you lose. Factors that can contribute to dehydration include the climate, physical exercise (particularly in the heat) and diet. Chronic diarrhoea, vomiting, frequent urination and profuse sweating, for example from a fever, can also lead you to become dehydrated.\n\nHow can you tell you’re dehydrated?\n\nEarly warning signs include tiredness, a dry mouth, having dark coloured, strong-smelling urine, feeling thirsty and lightheaded and needing to urinate less than usual. If you begin to suffer from extreme thirst, lethargy, sunken eyes, no tears when you cry, little or no urination, a rapid heartbeat and breathing, and dizziness when you stand that lasts for more than a few seconds, you should get medical treatment straight away as these are signs of chronic dehydration.\n\nAs hydration regulates the body’s process of temperature control, being too hot or too cold can also be a sign of dehydration.\n\nWho is most at risk?\n\nEveryone is prone to dehydration, but some are at higher risk than others. Infants and children are particularly prone to becoming dehydrated as their bodies are made up of 65-75% water.\n\nElderly people are also at risk, as you lose your sense of thirst dramatically as you age, meaning older people often forget to drink enough water. Clinton, who is 68, could fall into this category. According to recent research by the BBC, one in five older people living in care homes does not drink enough fluid and those with dementia were six times more likely to be dehydrated.\n\nPeople living with medical conditions, including diabetes, cystic fibrosis and kidney disease, as well as alcoholics, are also more prone to dehydration.\n\nWhat’s the best way to avoid it?\n\nDrink plenty of water! The Institute of Medicine recommends that women from the age of 19 to 70 drink 2.7 liters – or 11 cups – of beverages per day, and men of the same age are recommended to have 3.7 liters. This includes standard tap water as well as tea, coffee and juice – more or less all drinks which contain water. The U.S.’ Centers for Disease Control advises citizens to choose water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages, recommending teachers to educate students about the danger of consuming too much caffeine, including energy drinks.\n\nWrite to Kate Samuelson at kate.samuelson@time.com.",

  "latent_28599": "Introduction: In mid-2013, Wisconsin legislation took effect requiring abortion providers to display and describe preabortion ultrasound images. We aimed to understand the impact of this law.\n\nMethods: We used a mixed-methods study design at a Wisconsin abortion facility. We abstracted data from medical charts 1 year before the law took effect to 1 year after. We employed multivariable models, mediation/moderation analysis and interrupted time series to assess the impact of the law, viewing and decision certainty on likelihood of continuing the pregnancy. We analyzed semistructured in-depth interviews conducted after the law using elaborative and modified grounded theory.\n\nResults: We abstracted 5342 charts (2724 prelaw, 2618 postlaw), and 23 women completed an interview. In the chart data, 61.3% of women viewed their ultrasound prelaw compared to 90.9% postlaw. Among those eligible for abortion, 8.7% continued their pregnancies prelaw compared to 11.2% postlaw (p=.002). Low decision certainty and having to pay the full cost of the abortion were more predictive of continuing pregnancy than viewing the ultrasound image. Interrupted time series analysis found no effect of the law, although it may have been underpowered. Of the 23 women interviewed, 19 viewed their ultrasound image. Most reported no impact on their pregnancy decision; five reported a temporary emotional impact or increased certainty about choosing abortion. Two women reported that viewing helped them decide to continue their pregnancies; both also described preexisting decision uncertainty.\n\nConclusion: Mandatory ultrasound viewing laws are likely to cause an increase in viewing rates and, in turn, a small increase in continuing pregnancy rates. However, for the vast majority of women, ultrasound viewing laws do not change women’s minds about abortion. Other factors are more influential on a woman’s decision to have an abortion. Ultrasound viewing should not be considered a standalone experience but rather in the context of women’s lives and circumstances.",

  "latent_29041": "Soghomon Tehlirian, a 24-year-old Armenian student in Berlin, was a melancholy man—his former landlady would testify at his murder trial that he would sit in his room in the dark playing sad songs on his mandolin. She had learned that his entire family had been killed in 1915, but thought it best not to ask too many questions about it. She would often hear him waking up in the middle of the night with nightmares and had recommended to him a doctor who specialized in nervous disorders. Lately, he had taken up dance lessons to help calm his nerves and started to practice his German by flirting with girls. Occasionally he suffered fainting spells.\n\nTehlirian’s landlady was surprised when, in early March 1921, he suddenly announced he was leaving her flat to move into a new apartment on Hardenbergstrasse near Berlin’s zoo in the upscale Charlottenburg neighborhood. Tehlirian explained that he was moving because his doctor had recommended that he find an apartment with more natural sunlight. But in truth Tehlirian moved because he had learned that a man he had never met who went by the name of Ali Salih was living across the street from the apartment he had just rented, and Tehlirian had decided to murder him.\n\nAli Salih was the assumed name of Talaat Pasha, the former interior minister and last grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire. One hundred years ago today, on April 24, 1915, Talaat oversaw the arrest of hundreds of leading Armenian community members, a step generally regarded as the first salvo in the Ottoman campaign to deport Armenians from the Anatolian Peninsula, thus beginning the Armenian genocide.\n\nOn March 15, as Tehlirian was reading in his room, he glanced out his window and saw Talaat on the balcony of his apartment. He explained to the court that he recognized the man from having seen his picture in the newspapers. He kept watching and then, “I saw Talaat, the man who was responsible for the deaths of my parents, my brothers, and my sisters.” Tehlirian grabbed the loaded pistol he kept with his underclothes in a trunk, ran after Talaat, and fatally shot him. At the sound of gunfire, a crowd descended upon Tehlirian, beating him and holding him down. Witnesses reported that Tehlirian tried to break free, declaring, “I am an Armenian. He is a Turk. It is no loss to Germany.” Tehlirian would later tell the court that he remembered little about what happened after he fired the gun. But he did remember the sense of elation he felt upon hearing in the police station hours later that his shot had been fatal.\n\nArmenians around the world are commemorating the genocide of their people today: Jews, who have just commemorated Holocaust Remembrance Day last week, should be doing so as well.\n\nArmenians around the world are commemorating the genocide of their people today: Jews, who have just commemorated Holocaust Remembrance Day last week, should be doing so as well. Not only because of a shared humanity. Not only because Jews and Armenians are the two victims of genocide that gave this crime its name. But also because of the stark parallels between our experiences.\n\nWriting in the racialized language of the time, U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morgenthau, who was also a prominent Jewish activist, noted of the Armenians: “There has been considerable intermarrying with Jews and that by this time there is a decided strain of Jewish blood in them. I asked about this because they all look like Jews and have the same characteristics, the same stubborn adherence to their past and religion and a strong race pride.” Morgenthau was the first major international figure to alert the world to the Armenian genocide. In 1919 he would also head a commission to Poland to investigate the pogroms against Jews.\n\n***\n\nIn that same year, on the opposite bank of the Black Sea, in newly independent Ukraine, anti-Jewish pogroms erupted in a manner parallel to what had happened in Anatolia. The list of pogrom perpetrators was expansive and diverse, encompassing foreign armed fighters, Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary organizations, ordinary Ukrainian peasants, military units loyal to the deposed Russian tsar, and Red Army soldiers. But popular memory put the blame for the bloodshed on the figure of Symon Petliura, the leader of the so-called “Directory” government that tried in vain to rule over Ukraine and establish a left-leaning national republic. Despite offering broad autonomy to the Jewish population—the Directory even printed currency in Yiddish and promised Yiddish-speaking telephone operators—the government was unable or unwilling to stem the violence. In total, over one thousand separate incidents of anti-Jewish violence were recorded; a Soviet investigation put the death toll at over 100,194. Other observers estimated that up to 200,000 Jews were murdered.\n\nIn an eerie echo of Tehlirian’s assassination of Talaat Pasha, the Yiddish poet and watchmaker Sholem Schwartzbard took his revenge on Petliura, who had fled Ukraine and was living in Parisian exile. Throughout the spring of 1926, Schwartzbard would wander through the streets of Paris’ Latin Quarter with a pistol in his pocket and a photo of Petliura he had clipped out of the Grand Larousse encyclopédique. The blond 31-year-old poet, who courtroom reporters would later comment looked more like a clerk than a murderer, short and “undistinguished in appearance,” drew no attention to himself as he sought out Petliura from among the crowd, comparing the features of likely candidates to the photo in his hands. Schwartzbard found his target on several occasions, but each time Petliura was surrounded by his wife and children.\n\nFinally, on May 25, Schwartzbard encountered Petliura alone on the corner of Rue Racine and Boulevard St. Michel. Still unsure if he matched the photo, Schwartzbard asked the man, “Are you Petliura?” He didn’t answer. The poet took a chance and shot the former head of state five times. When police arrived at the scene, Schwartzbard was waiting for them: “I have killed a great assassin,” he declared. The crowd began running toward Schwartzbard, beating him, but the gendarme took Schwartzbard by cab to the station. Upon learning that the man he had shot was, in fact, Petliura, Schwartzbard was overjoyed.\n\nSholem Schwartzbard had been a struggling Yiddish writer and anarchist activist. Born in 1886 in Bessarabia, Schwartzbard was raised in the Podolian town of Balta, a town with a history of pogroms. Three of his siblings and his mother died when Sholem was a child; Sholem was apprenticed to a watchmaker soon after his bar mitzvah. As a youth, he became involved in anarchist circles, agitating for the overthrow of the tsar. Once, when he was distributing literature inside a beit midrash, the pious Jews trying to pray got fed up with him and denounced him to the authorities. He was arrested but managed to flee in 1906 across the Austro-Hungarian border, where he continued his anarchist activities.\n\nHe was arrested again in Vienna on the charge of robbing a small wine bar. He was found in the bar at opening time, having apparently locked himself inside at closing the night before. The till was short, and Schwartbard was carrying a tool kit and cash. Nevertheless, he claimed it was a case of misidentification. After serving four months for the crime, he moved to Budapest where he was again arrested, this time for distributing radical literature. He relocated to Paris in 1910, where, during World War I, he served first in the Foreign Legion and then in a regular French infantry brigade. He was injured in the war and awarded the Croix de Guerre.\n\nBut the revolutionary cause remained dear to his heart. Upon hearing news of the overthrow of the tsar in Russia, Schwartzbard returned to Ukraine in the summer of 1917, just as the Russian Empire was breaking up in a bloody civil war. He floated through several revolutionary fighting brigades, eventually finding his way to Odessa, which was from November 1918 to April 1919 under French occupation. Soon after the French abandoned the city, Schwartzbard joined the Bolsheviks and traveled with a brigade to the pogrom-devastated regions around Cherkasy. Disillusioned and traumatized, he returned to Paris, where, under the penname of Bal-Khaloymes (the Dreamer), he published vignettes about the pogroms and a series of poems about the war. He seemed to give up his anarchism and devoted himself to fixing clocks in a small shop—until he found the photo of Petliura in the encyclopedia and became obsessed with the idea of killing him.\n\nSchwartzbard’s obsession, though, was somewhat misplaced. Although Petliura had been nominally in charge during the period of the most rampant anti-Jewish pogroms, his responsibility for them was, at best, indirect. Various warlords controlled most of Ukraine for much of 1919. Petliura’s government could hardly retain control of a single city let alone the entire Ukraine. At times he and his top officials lived in a railway car so they could relocate at a moment’s notice to whichever region his troops controlled at the moment. His proclamations condemning pogroms were as toothless as the secret orders his critics believed—but could never prove—he issued permitting them.\n\nSchwartzbard’s act of vengeance threw him into headlines around the world and brought global attention to the pogroms and the fate of the Jewish people in Ukraine. Emma Goldman published appeals on behalf of Schwartzbard and urged American Jews to contribute to his legal defense. Historians Simon Dubnow and Elias Tcherikower compiled information on the pogroms to provide to Schwartzbard’s lawyers. Yiddish writer Sholem Asch, already known for his controversial hagiography of Jesus of Nazareth, wrote that Schwartzbard’s sin was “a redemption for us all.”\n\nHannah Arendt was more sympathetic to the lone assassin. Both Tehlirian and Schwartzbard, she argued, sought justice, not revenge. Rather than run from the police, she continued, they waited to be caught in order to force a trial and establish a public record of the genocide. Both courts obliged, putting Talaat and Petliura on trial as much as Tehlirian and Schwartzbard.\n\nJuries acquitted both the Armenian student and the Jewish poet, and the public trials of the two brought the crimes they were avenging to global attention.\n\nOne Jewish law student in Warsaw at the time, Raphael Lemkin, followed both trials with rapt attention. Tehlirian, he wrote, “upheld the moral order of mankind,” and Schwartzbard’s act was “a beautiful crime.” Lemkin, who later coined the term “genocide” and lobbied for its recognition at the United Nations, was one of the first to publicly link the Ottoman attacks against Armenians with both the pogroms and the Holocaust. When CBS commentator Quincy Howe asked him in 1949 how he became interested in the topic, Lemkin replied, “Because it happened so many times. It happened to the Armenians, and after the Armenians, Hitler took action.”\n\n***\n\nLike this article?

The nine-page document was submitted on behalf of the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the UK body for the music majors, the Motion Picture Association (MPA), the Premier League, the Publishers Association and the Pact, the film and TV independent producers' trade body.\n\nPrivately, rights holders said there is a \"spirit of optimism\" between the entertainment groups and search engines as they attempt to usher in more legal media sites, including Google's own fledgling music service.\n\nGoogle has in the past year stepped up efforts to remove copyright-infringing content, launching a fast-track removal requests form and filtering terms \"associated with infringement\". However, the rights holders claim in the document that \"as time goes on, the situation is getting worse rather than better\".\n\n\"Consumers rely on search engines to find and access entertainment content and they play a vital role in the UK digital economy,\" the rights holders state.\n\n\"At present, consumer searching for digital copies of copyright entertainment content are directed overwhelmingly to illegal sites and services.\"\n\nThe entertainment groups want Google to \"continuously review key search words\" and \"effectively screen\" mobile apps on Android smartphones in an effort to combat illicit sharing.\n\nThe document claims that 16 of the first 20 Google search results for chart singles link to \"known illegal sites\", according to searches by the BPI in September. In an attempt to persuade the government to clamp down on search engines, the groups claim that 41% of Google's first-page results for bestselling books in April last year were \"non-legal links\" to websites.\n\n\"Much of the illegal activity in the digital economy is facilitated and encouraged by money-making rogue sites,\" the document claimed.\n\n\"Intermediaries, unwittingly or by wilfully turning a blind eye (or in some cases, by encouraging such activity), play a key role in enabling content theft and often even profit from it. Only a comprehensive approach can address this issue.\"\n\nThe entertainment bodies call for search engines to:\n\n• Assign lower rankings to sites that \"repeatedly\" make available copyright-infringing material\n\n• Prioritise sites that \"obtain certification as a licensed site\" for music and film downloading\n\n• Stop indexing sites that are subject to court orders\n\n• Stop indexing \"substantially infringing websites\"\n\n• Improve \"notice and takedown\" system\n\n• Ensure that users are not directed to illicit filesharing sites through suggested search\n\n• Ensure search engines do not advertise around unlawful sites or sell keywords associated with piracy or sell mobile apps \"which facilitate infringement\"\n\nThe chief executive of BPI, Geoff Taylor, said on Thursday: \"The vast majority of consumers want search engines to direct them to legal sources of entertainment rather than the online black market.\n\n\"As search engines roll out high-quality content services, like Google Music, we want to build a constructive partnership that supports a legal online economy. We hope that Google and other search engines will respond positively.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Motion Picture Association added: \"If you look for film or music via a search engine you usually find websites providing access to pirated films or music at the top of the list of results.\n\n\"This is confusing for consumers, damages the legal market and legitimises copyright theft. We are in dialogue with search engines, ISPs [internet service providers], advertising networks and payment processors about a code to deal with the escalating problem of online copyright theft which threatens the growth of the entire creative industries sector. This paper is a result of that dialogue and we appreciate government's continuing efforts to help bring about a more responsible internet\".\n\nA spokesman for Google said: \"Google takes the fight against online piracy very seriously. Last year, we removed over five million infringing items from Google Search. We have made industry-leading efforts in this field, investing over $50m (£32m) in fighting bad advertisements and over $30m on Content ID software, giving rights holders control over their YouTube content.\n\n\"We continue to work in close partnership with rights holders to help them combat piracy and protect their property.\"\n\nPeter Bradwell, campaigner for the Open Rights Group, said the proposal contained \"some dangerous ideas\". He said: \"It's another plan to take on far too much power over what we're allowed to look at and do online.\"",
  "latent_29588": "The migration crisis has posed a number of challenges for European countries, but what lessons can be learned from previous experiences with large scale migration? Mikkel Barslund, Matthias Busse, Karolien Lenaerts, Lars Ludolph and Vilde Renman present evidence from a study of the integration of Bosnian refugees in Europe following the Balkan wars in the 1990s. They find that with the right integration policies and labour market conditions, it is possible to achieve a high level of integration among refugees within a short period of time.\n\nIn 2015, Europe experienced the largest influx of refugees since the Balkan wars in the early 1990s. While arrivals were down in 2016, the security situation in the Middle East and the instability in North Africa and elsewhere mean that Europe will play host to refugees for the foreseeable future. Quite apart from the considerable humanitarian issues at stake, this commands European countries – both out of self-interest and in the interest of refugees – to facilitate wider societal integration. Labour market integration of newcomers plays a key role in achieving this objective.\n\nThe situation in the early 1990s, when over the course of a brief period of time 1.2 million Bosnians fled the country as war refugees and more than half a million sought refuge in Western Europe, was not so different from the situation today. Moreover, there is significant overlap among countries affected by the two refugee waves. Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden all saw a large absolute and relative influx of refugees in both 2015 and between 1992 and 1995, when the bulk of Bosnians arrived in Western Europe (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Overview of registered refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992-1995)\n\nSource: Barslund et al. (2016), Valenta and Ramet (2011) and the OECD population database; population data from 1992.\n\nIn a recent study, we trace the integration experience of Bosnian refugees from the Balkan wars in those five countries to draw lessons for the current wave of refugees. Integration is a slow-moving process. Looking closely at Bosnian refugees enables us to see past immediate integration outcomes and take a longer-term view.\n\nWe drew on international published research but, more importantly, also combed through a significant amount of national sources. The five countries also make for a particularly interesting comparison because they differed in important ways when the Bosnians arrived (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Unemployment rates at the time of the Bosnian war\n\nSource: IMF World Economic Outlook\n\nSweden had just entered what was going to be a prolonged economic crisis. Unemployment was high in Denmark too, but the subsequent path was one of falling unemployment rates and high growth for one decade afterwards. The Netherlands as well as Austria were running at or close to full employment, and Germany was entering the period of being labelled ‘the sick man of Europe’.\n\nThis situation was reflected to some extent in the approach to the initial reception of the Bosnian refugees. Bosnian refugees received temporary protection at the time of their arrival in all Western European countries. This was mainly a political compromise. For host countries, it was the only way of dealing with the large influx of refugees without amending their asylum systems or overburdening them. The UNHCR had deeper concerns. The organisation wanted to push the issue of burden-sharing of refugees across Europe. In fact, discussions at the time bear some resemblance to those taking place within the EU today. Temporary protection left the door open to involving those Western countries that had not initially experienced an influx of refugees displaced from the former Yugoslavia. This strategy turned out to be largely unsuccessful. An additional concern was whether granting refugees permanent residency upon arrival would institutionalise the widespread ethnic cleansing going on in parts of Bosnia.\n\nDespite the consensus on provision of initial temporary refuge, there were vast differences in the legal and institutional approach to dealing with the influx of Bosnian refugees. Three broad categories emerged within the selected sample of countries. Sweden granted refugees permanent residency and labour market access shortly after arrival. Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands converted the initial temporary asylum with limited access to labour markets into permanent residency and full access to labour markets after a few years. Finally, Germany never intended to host Bosnian refugees permanently and repatriated the vast majority of them as soon as the war ended.\n\nWith this background, one may have expected very different outcomes from the integration process. Germany apart, however, the overall story is one of long-term successful integration in the host countries. Differences are most pronounced with regard to the speed of the integration process. Labour market outcomes, measured by employment rates, differ among countries in ways that can be linked to both integration approaches and initial labour market conditions.\n\nEmployment rates picked up fast in Austria where in 1998, 64 percent of Bosnian refugees were in employment. For the three other countries, integration had barely begun (Figure 2). Sweden’s double-digit unemployment rate was a factor, whereas the lack of integration in Denmark and the Netherlands – both being close to full employment in 1998 – may reflect a lack of integration measures early on.\n\nFigure 2: Employment rate of former Yugoslav nationals in 1998 in various host countries\n\nSource: Angrist and Kugler (2003) and Eurostat Labour Force Survey\n\nEmployment then picked up in all countries, albeit at a different pace. In Austria, medium-term labour market outcomes around ten years after the end of the Bosnian war were already on par with the native-born population. In Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, Bosnians still participated significantly less in the labour market and showed higher unemployment rates but the gap to the respective native-born population clearly began to close, in particular for the younger age groups.\n\nRecent evidence from Denmark and the Netherlands indicates that educational attainment of young and second-generation Bosnians is on a par with or even exceeds that of the respective native population. More time is needed to assess if the gains in educational achievements of the second generation translate into higher employment rates, but the initial assessment is encouraging. We did not find any evidence on educational attainment of second generation Bosnians in Sweden.\n\nRefugees in Travnik, Bosnia, 1993. Credits: Mikhail Evstafiev (CC BY-SA 2.5)\n\nHowever, for three of the four countries the process of integration seems to have been completed within one generation. This is rather fast and it is well worth exploring further the determinants of these positive outcomes, particularly because such a catch-up is not found for other immigrant groups. One important factor in explaining this catch-up could well be the fact that Bosnians were generally better educated than other refugees. There is some evidence from Germany that the same is the case for the recent Syrian refugees.\n\nOverall, our results point to four interesting findings. Under favourable integration policies and labour market conditions, employment rates can reach those of the native population in little more than a decade (the Austrian case). Granting the right to work quickly upon arrival is important, but failure to do so can be overcome over time (Denmark, the Netherlands). Initial unemployment levels in host countries are important for initial labour market integration (the case of Sweden): a finding which is not surprising, but important given the European debate on distribution of refugees. Finally, second-generation Bosnians, or those who arrived at a young age, perform roughly on a par with native-born cohorts. We deem this to be a sign of a completed integration process.\n\nPlease read our comments policy before commenting.\n\nNote: This article gives the views of the authors, and not the position of EUROPP – European Politics and Policy, nor of the London School of Economics.\n\n_________________________________\n\nAbout the authors\n\nMikkel Barslund – Centre for European Policy Studies\n\nMikkel Barslund is Research Fellow in Economy and Finance at the Centre for European Policy Studies.\n\nMatthias Busse – Centre for European Policy Studies\n\nMatthias Busse is a Researcher in Economy and Finance at the Centre for European Policy Studies.\n\nKarolien Lenaerts – Centre for European Policy Studies\n\nKarolien Lenaerts is a Researcher in Economy and Finance at the Centre for European Policy Studies.\n\nLars Ludolph – Centre for European Policy Studies\n\nLars Ludolph is a Researcher in Economy and Finance at the Centre for European Policy Studies.\n\nVilde Renman – Centre for European Policy Studies\n\nVilde Renman is Administrative and Research Assistant at the Centre for European Policy Studies.",
  "latent_29714": "The hunt for offshore oil is killing tiny sea creatures that are key for healthy oceans ‘Plankton underpin whole ocean productivity’\n\nA widely used method to find oil and gas for offshore drilling can kill tiny sea creatures that are key for feeding many marine animals like shellfish, fish, and even whales. And the impacts on these tiny, drifting creatures — called zooplankton — are seen in an area much larger than previously thought.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, adds to the body of evidence that the loud noises produced during oil and gas exploration can disrupt marine life — including whales that use sound to communicate and look for food. It also comes just a few months after President Donald Trump has signed an executive order looking to expand offshore gas and oil drilling in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans.\n\nlouder than a Saturn V rocket during launch\n\nOil and gas companies looking for offshore natural resources use seismic airguns to blast compressed air through the water and into the seafloor. The noise produced by these airguns is louder than a Saturn V rocket during launch, according to Nature. So researchers wanted to see what the effects are on the sea’s base of the food chain, the zooplankton.\n\nThe researchers blasted airguns in the ocean off southern Tasmania, and checked zooplankton populations before and after by using sonar and nets. The abundance of these tiny creatures dropped by 64 percent within one hour of the blast, the study says. Two to three times as many zooplankton were also found dead — and the impacts were recorded as far away as 0.7 miles. Scientists previously estimated that impacts would occur only within 33 feet from the blast.\n\nAn airgun test conducted by the researchers off southern Tasmania.\n\nPhoto by Rob McCauley\n\nIt’s not 100 percent clear how the airguns are causing the die-offs, but it’s possible the blast throws off the receptors the animals use to navigate, disorienting them and causing them to die, according to Nature. Because zooplankton is key for feeding larger marine animals, the die-offs could have serious cascading effects.\n\n\"Plankton underpin whole ocean productivity,\" lead author Robert McCauley, an associate professor at Curtin University in Australia, said in a statement. \"Their presence impacts right across the health of the ecosystem so it's important we pay attention to their future.\"",
  "latent_29735": "The cascade of controversies buffeting the White House is starting to rankle high-profile Republicans, who are voicing concerns about how the daily drama is impacting the GOP agenda on Capitol Hill.\n\nEven as House Speaker Paul Ryan tried Wednesday to tamp down the furor over the latest accusation -- that Trump asked James Comey to shutter part of the FBI's Russia probe -- other Republicans were showing their exasperation.\n\n\"We cannot have this constant chaos and serious questions being raised virtually every single day,\" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said. \"It is distracting from the ability to work on certain issues like health care reform, and the administration needs to get its house in order.\"\n\nMost Republicans on the Hill still are not going along with Democratic demands for a special prosecutor, but a handful are. Even more are opening the door to further inquiries into the latest Comey accusation.\n\nPart of this reflects a desire by Republicans not to rush to judgment over the claims in a memo none of them have seen. According to The New York Times, Comey said in a February memo that Trump asked him to end the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\n\"We need the facts,\" Ryan said, echoing comments from Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and others.\n\nThe White House maintains that Trump did not seek to end any investigations.\n\nBut Republicans' fresh inquiries suggest the controversy will continue to play out, as they ask to view the memo and hear from Comey. House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked overnight for documents including the reported February memo. Chaffetz tweeted he's ready to subpoena the information if necessary.\n\nColorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman tweeted: “We need the memos, Comey should testify and I still believe that a special prosecutor should be named.”\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican in his first term, tweeted: “For the purpose of transparency, the White House should share a transcript of the meeting with the House and Senate intelligence committees.”\n\nAnd regarding a separate report -- also disputed by the White House -- that Trump shared classified intel with the Russians, Republican Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock called for \"immediate classified briefings.\"\n\nBut as Republicans exercise their oversight responsibilities, they're openly voicing concern about what it means for the GOP agenda.\n\nOne senior House GOP source told Fox News that the mood at the House Republican Conference meeting Wednesday was \"melancholy.\"\n\nChairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said the White House is \"in a downward spiral right now” and the Trump administration has “got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that’s happening.”\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also got in on the Trump bashing and invoked “Watergate.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Bloomberg Live that \"we could do with a little less drama from the White House\" so lawmakers can focus on tax reform, rolling back red tape and repealing ObamaCare.\n\nThe Comey controversy followed a high point for Hill Republicans, after the House revived the struggling ObamaCare repeal bill and passed it, sending it to the Senate. The biggest congressional win before that was Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n\nRyan and his deputies tried Wednesday to reset focus on tax reform and other priorities.\n\n\"If we're serious about letting Americans keep more of their paychecks, if we're serious about bringing jobs back home, bringing manufacturing back home, then we have got to reform this tax system and seize this moment,\" Ryan said Wednesday.\n\nWhether Republicans can dust themselves off may depend on what the Comey memos and other documents show.\n\nLara Brown, director of George Washington University’s political management program, told Fox News she expects more fallout as the midterm elections approach. She predicted more Republicans will pull away from the Trump White House around October, giving health care legislation low odds and saying tax reform is \"dead in the water.\"\n\n“In the fall, each individual politician will make their strategic calculations if they can attach themselves to the president or distance themselves,” she said. “We’re going to see increasing numbers of Republican partisans moving away.”\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

  "latent_29964": "For mainstream America, the FBI is the Robert Muellers and Jim Comeys—a clear and present danger that is now coming to take down America’s duly elected president\n\nAmerica: They’re Coming To Take Down Your President\n\nAmerica: They’re coming to take down your president. They’re calling it the noble mission of an impeccably honest and above-board ‘special’ investigation, mounted by the Robert Mueller ‘Dream Team’, without anyone saying that the fix was in long before the Big Hunt got underway. It’s an initiative whose narrative is being written by the full-of-hate Democrats in defeat, disseminated, world-wide by the mainstream media. Find your situational awareness and be prepared to take cover because Mueller’s handpicked Dream Team is the nightmare from which it will be impossible to shake yourself awake.\n\nThe mainstream media—out to get Donald Trump since the 2016 election campaign—is cavalierly passing Mueller’s assignment off as a perfumed package, completely missing the stench of the bungled anthrax letters case under his watch as FBI director. It defies belief that the “special counsel” leading the Dream Team is the same man who let Islamists rewrite FBI training manuals during his tenure as FBI chief. (AIM, June 17, 2017) Nary a word from any of the cool dudes and dudettes on the Dream Team when their boss, former President Barack Obama disallowed the term “Islamist terrorism” from public use. How much worse does it get? Incredibly, Mueller’s Dream Team is setting off as a legalized lynch mob and bounty hunter with a whopping 61 percent of public support. “According to a new poll from the Associated Press and the University of Chicago’s NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 61 percent of Americans surveyed believe Trump has tried to impede or obstruct the FBI’s investigation into his campaign, while just 37 percent said they believe Trump hasn’t tried to impede or obstruct the investigation. (The Blaze, June 17, 2017) “The poll also found there is a growing concern over the possibility that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian operatives during last year’s election. When asked, 48 percent said they are extremely or very concerned about the possibility, up from 44 percent in March, while just 30 percent said they aren’t very concerned or not concerned at all, down from 36 percent in March. “An overwhelming majority, 52 percent, also said they disapproved of Trump’s decision to fire Comey, while 22 percent said they approved of the decision and 24 percent said they were indifferent.”\n\nMercifully, the poll found that not many Americans believe special prosecutor Robert Mueller will carry out a fair and impartial investigation—and at the bottom of the report on the poll—only 26 percent believe in his ‘special counsel’. ‘Dream Team’ is a term dreamed up by the always highly imaginative MSM back in the days of the riveting O.J. Simpson trial, a misnomer that went on to prove that anything the media manufactures, like Google, gets to live forever. The still rational among us can take it to the bank that the tooth fairy is more real than Mueller’s, or anyone else’s, so-called ‘Dream Team’. When special counsel Mueller comes back with evidence that President Donald Trump was the agent provocateur in the Russian election collusion story, or is ready to impeach due to his “obstruction of Justice” for having fired FBI Director James Comey —and Mueller will claim his mission unearthed irrefutable proof of Trump impeachable guilt—a tsunami of MSM stories will attest to Mueller’s breath-taking integrity and credibility. That will be their story and they will stick to it. This is a Dream Team that will come back with evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia, obstruction of justice—and will have the audacity to feign surprise when they do. The Dream Team will bring in just what leaders of the Obama-led Resistance want—President Donald Trump’s head, not in a comedian’s performance art, but on the proverbial platter.\n\nIt’s a process, once started, that just cannot be denied, a win-win situation for Mueller and Company because if Trump fires Mueller as he did James Comey, he’ll automatically be found guilty of “obstructing justice”. Former FBI Director James Comey kicked off the process when he leaked information to the New York Times all to have his close friend Robert Mueller named as “special counsel” to find evidence of a story, the Trump/Russia collusion story, already proven untrue. Who can the heavily propagandized and constantly lied to American citizenry trust? Not Comey. That’s for sure. He was the leaker hunting down other leakers and the man who bought into and considered paying for the filth produced by ex MI6 agent Christopher Steele who passed on a dirty dossier including the ‘Golden Shower’ mother of monstrous lies. Few believed that Trump hired prostitutes to urinate on a bed the sacrosanct Obamas slept on at a Moscow Ritz-Carlton. But the FBI must have as they planned to pay Steele to do further research for the bureau. It defies belief that Mueller’s Dream Team is going out gung-ho on a predetermined mission, in which they can rest assured that their former boss Barack Obama, his failed protégé Hillary Clinton and the entire Democrat team wait with bated breath for their return.\n\nThe masses who buy into the bunk that the real life FBI are like the ones they see ion popular television shows will be easy to fool when they come back to announce to the world that Hillary Clinton was right all along, the tag team of Donald and Vladimir stole the election from her. The FBI has never corroborated or verified any of the outrageous allegations in Steele’s dirty dossier. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein gave the special counsel job to Mueller on May 17. Lawyers with loyalties to the Democrat Party have been jumping aboard the Dream Team ever since. “Mueller has his pick of some of the top lawyers in the country. “If you’re a prosecutor, this is what you dream of—getting on a case like this,” says Peter Zeidenberg, who prosecuted I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff. (Bloomberg, June 14, 2017) “Among the most notable of Mueller’s early hires is Michael Dreeben, who’s argued more than 100 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and is considered an expert on whether the president can legally keep his staff communications secret. “Another is Andrew Weissmann, former head of the U.S. Department of Justice’s fraud unit. Aaron Zebley has spent years in proximity to Mueller, most recently at WilmerHale and before that as his chief of staff at the FBI. Zebley worked as a national security prosecutor in Virginia, where at least one of the Russia-related cases was based. He was also the lead FBI agent in the case against a key Sept. 11 conspirator. “This is an incredibly intelligent, tenacious, and thorough team,” says Tom Hanusik, a former prosecutor on the Enron Task Force. “Regardless of your political persuasion, if you’re interested in having this resolved, you should be heartened by this kind of team.” “Trump allies have already questioned the independence of some of Mueller’s investigators over their political donations to Democrats. “Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, is having trouble persuading people to join his defense team, according to two people familiar with his efforts. Instead, Kasowitz is leaning on his longtime partner, Michael Bowe, a prominent litigator. He also signed up Jay Sekulow, chief counsel to the conservative American Center for Law and Justice, who was dispatched to cable news shows to attack Comey’s credibility.”\n\nIt shouldn’t be Trump’s past that should be coming back to bite him. Trump arrived at the White House as an outsider and a successful businessman—and had no say in what the FBI did or didn’t do before his highly unexpected arrival. “Robert Mueller took office as FBI director in 2001 expecting to dig into drug cases, white-collar misdeeds and violent crime. A week later was Sept. 11. (Chicago Tribune, May 18, 2017) “Overnight, his mission changed and Mueller spent the next 12 years wrestling the agency into a battle-hardened terrorism-fighting force. “Now, Mueller once again finds himself catapulted into the midst of historic events: The Justice Department has named him special counsel to investigate potential coordination between Russia and the Trump team during the 2016 presidential election and related matters.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats alike praised Mueller, 72, as someone widely respected for his integrity and independence. “As FBI chief, Mueller stood alongside James Comey, then deputy attorney general, during a dramatic 2004 hospital standoff over federal wiretapping rules. The two men planted themselves at the bedside of the ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft to block Bush administration officials from making an end run to get Ashcroft’s permission to reauthorize a secret no-warrant wiretapping program.\n\n“Republican Rep Jason Chaffetz of Utah, chairman of the House oversight committee, tweeted that Mueller was “a great selection. Impeccable credentials.” “Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Mueller’s appointment gave him “significantly greater confidence that the investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead.” That’s akin to saying that the mainstream media of the day follow the facts wherever they lead in this era of Fake News, Mr. Schumer. Where is the proof that Mueller transformed the FBI into a “battle-hardened terrorism-fighting force”? Where is the evidence that Mueller delivered on his promise to delve into “drug cases, white-collar misdeeds and violent crime?” With violent crime multiplying every weekend in the streets of Chicago, the evidence must be in the whitewash. The media has been cutting Mueller a break from the get-go: “Mueller’s effort to shift the FBI’s top priority from solving domestic crimes to preventing terrorism was a daunting challenge: Even preventing 99 out of 100 terrorist plots wasn’t good enough for a traumatized nation. (CBS News, May 17, 2017) “In response, the FBI shifted 2,000 of the 5,000 agents in its criminal programs into national security. “Two terrorist incidents occurred toward the end of Mueller’s watch — the Boston Marathon bombing and the Fort Hood shootings. Both weighed heavily on him, he acknowledged in an interview two weeks before his departure in 2013. “You sit down with victims’ families, you see the pain they go through and you always wonder whether there isn’t something more” that could have been done, he said.” Did the victims’ families know that Mueller let Islamists rewrite FBI training manuals? There was no FBI tip-off when James Hodgkinson cut loose at the Alexandria baseball practice Wednesday injuring five, including House Majority Whip, Steve Scalise. Police often stand-down at public events where Trump supporters are assaulted. In short, the Donald Trump administration can look to little support from the FBI in an era where violence seems to be the norm. There may be good agents in the FBI but somehow they never get to the top. The FBI of the present day is nothing like the ‘good guys’ viewed on television drama. For mainstream America, the FBI is the Robert Muellers and Jim Comeys—a clear and present danger that is now coming to take down America’s duly elected president.\n\nOnly YOU can save CFP from Social Media Suppression.

  "latent_30034": "The Turkish Foreign Minister has said that his country is prepared to once again allow migrants passage into Europe if Turks are not permitted to travel in the European Union (EU) without visas.\n\nMinister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN Turk television Saturday that the EU’s failure to uphold its part of the agreement entered into last March jeopardized Turkey’s will to keep migrants from crossing through Turkey into Greece.\n\nTurkey will present a final text to EU leaders, Cavusoglu said, “and either it will all be canceled, including the visa liberalization and migrant deal, or it will all be implemented.”\n\nThis is not Turkey’s first threat to release droves of migrants into the European Union.\n\nLast August, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s warned that he was ready to reopen migrant routes from Turkey into Europe, a move that could mean an influx of as many as 3 million migrants into the EU.\n\n“The European Union is not acting sincerely with Turkey,” Erdogan said in an interview with the French daily Le Monde. “We have taken in 3 million refugees, whereas the EU’s only concern is keeping them out of its territory.”\n\nTurkey has exploited the prospect of waves of millions of migrants into Europe to pressure Brussels into allowing Turkish citizens to enter Europe freely without visas, which is seen as a first step toward eventual Turkish membership in the EU.\n\nErdogan has insisted that the waiving of Europe’s visa requirement was meant to go into effect simultaneously with the agreement regarding Turkeys’ blocking of migrants from entering EU states, particularly Greece.\n\n“If our demands are not met, readmissions will no longer be possible,” Erdogan warned.\n\nIn March 2016, Turkey and the EU made a pact to stem a the flow of migrants to Europe in exchange for billions of euros in aid to Turkey and the lifting of short-term visa requirements on Turkish citizens.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

For them, America was the antidote to the crushing restrictiveness of European life, to the pogroms. For them, the American dream was an uplifting spiritual creed that offered dignity, the chance to rise.\n\nYour ancestors came in chains. In your book the dream of the comfortable suburban life is a “fairy tale.” For you, slavery is the original American sin, from which there is no redemption. America is Egypt without the possibility of the Exodus. African-American men are caught in a crushing logic, determined by the past, from which there is no escape.\n\nYou write to your son, “Here is what I would like for you to know: In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body — it is heritage.” The innocent world of the dream is actually built on the broken bodies of those kept down below.\n\nIf there were no black bodies to oppress, the affluent Dreamers “would have to determine how to build their suburbs on something other than human bones, how to angle their jails toward something other than a human stockyard, how to erect a democracy independent of cannibalism.”\n\nYour definition of “white” is complicated. But you write “ ‘White America’ is a syndicate arrayed to protect its exclusive power to dominate and control our bodies. Sometimes this power is direct (lynching), and sometimes it is insidious (redlining).” In what is bound to be the most quoted passage from the book, you write that you watched the smoldering towers of 9/11 with a cold heart.

  "latent_30166": "There will be no new investigation or prosecution in the explosion of a hand grenade in a Dutch army vehicle in Afghanistan in 2010, the Public Prosecutor announced. An analysis by the Koninklijke Marechaussee - a policing force that works as part of the Dutch military - did not reveal any new facts, the Telegraaf reports.\n\nThe case involves a hand grenade exploding in a Bushmaster vehicle at Camp Coyote in Uruzgan. At the time two Dutch soldiers were suspected of setting of the grenade. One of them was Admilson R., who was sentenced to 30 years in prison and institutionalized psychiatric care in November 2015 for three robberies-turned-murders in Drenthe. The appeal on this case is currently ongoing. The other was a soldier who narrowly survived the explosion.\n\nThe Marechaussee re-analyzed the case at the request of the Public Prosecutor after the second soldier, who narrowly survived the blast, pressed charges against R. According to the second soldier, R. was the one who set off the grenade in the vehicle. The Marechaussee investigation showed that one of the two soldiers must have caused the explosion, but as there was no one else there and both deny doing so, it is impossible to say who was responsible. It is clear that R. verbally warned his colleague shortly before the explosion.\n\nThe veteran's lawyer, Sebas Diekstra, called the decision not to launch a new criminal investigation disappointing, but added that he is satisfied with the \"thoroughly done investigation\" by the Marechaussee.",
  "latent_30294": "Anticipating Taylor's move, several public education and teacher groups, a state Board of Education member, a superintendent, the mother of a special education student and two Democratic senators held a news conference Monday to denounce the expected school choice proposals. They said the plans would siphon scarce dollars from public schools and parcel it to private entities loosely, in ways that lack accountability.\n\nPrevious attempts to expand tax-supported school choice to private schools have fallen short because of vigorous opposition from school districts and Democrats.\n\nBut the election two years ago of Patrick and eight tea-party-backed freshman GOP senators gave the cause fresh impetus.\n\nLast year, the Senate passed a bill that would have allowed businesses to claim franchise and insurance premium tax credits to offset donations they make to organizations providing scholarships for children to attend private schools. The measure, though, died in the House.\n\nOn Wednesday, several freshmen Republican senators called on the Legislature to remedy that next year. Poor Texas families are being hurt because they can't afford private school, they said.\n\nThe day's testimony afforded glimpses into an internal GOP tussle on whether to resurrect last session's tax credit scholarships or refocus efforts on \"education savings accounts.\"\n\nThe accounts allow parents to receive a deposit of public funds into government-authorized savings accounts. Five states, most notably Nevada, have embraced them.\n\n\"The kids need an option,\" said Sen. Don Huffines, R-Dallas. \"That's what this program's about.

  "latent_30318": "A joint survey from O’Reilly and Ruxit says that container monitoring (including Docker monitoring) is an important issue and a challenge for Docker users, according to Ruxit. Sponsored surveys seem to provide only results the vendor finds useful for marketing. You would probably benefit as much from asking yourself whether YOU see Docker container monitoring as challenging as you would from reading the survey.\n\nIf you agree that monitoring containers is more difficult than predicting what GOP candidate is going to earn the privilege of standing in the center during the next Presidential debate, Ruxit has a container monitoring solution (obviously) and it works something like this.\n\nRuxit’s Approach to Docker Transparency\n\nRuxit’s offering attempts to use a single agent (as many monitoring vendors such as Scout and Datadog do). The Ruxit agent works on the OS without disrupting automated, plug and play container operation or the tools such as Marathon that manage containers. Ruxit determines what containers are running and monitors the infrastructure using its agents.\n\nAccording to Alois Reitbauer, Chief Evangelist, Ruxit, the Ruxit agent is “hands free” in its approach to installation and management using a single wget-based install. “We instrument at the OS level and automatically detect processes and trigger deeper instrumentation like Java byte code, node.js, and JavaScript. We instrument web servers and inject a JavaScript agent into the delivered web content. Usually agents only cover one aspect in an automated fashion and do not collect information on all application levels automatically,” says Reitbauer. The agent can self-diagnose and the customer can turn it off in real-time if needed, to avoid creating technical issues.\n\nRuxit monitors the Docker runtime and each newly started container through the underlying OS (again, this sounds similar to how other monitoring solutions work). “We monitor Java, nginx, and other technologies running inside the container. For application environments we instrument the code and see actual code execution details. For the web server we instrument the delivered HTML. We also use the Docker API to get CPU metrics for the container,” says Reitbauer.\n\nAccording to Ruxit, people expect APM and monitoring solutions to serve multiple purposes. “Sharing metrics and health metrics is kind of the basis for everything. We get some of the greatest feedback about how we’re able to visualize all the dependencies amongst containers,” says Reitbauer.\n\nRuxit also scales up with Docker containers. “One of the reasons you might use Docker is that you eventually want to scale up and you need to scale up your monitoring infrastructure to the same level of scale,” says Reitbauer.\n\nRuxit Customer Cases\n\n“One customer used to run about 100 JVMs and each one hosted about 20 services,” says Reitbauer; “they moved to Docker to separate all the individual services for the obvious reasons, including better isolation.” In the transition, the Ruxit customer’s infrastructure scaled up from 100 JVMs to 2K.\n\nRuxit provided them with a solution including a micro-service based view that helped them understand the dependencies in their application and find problems despite the very high infrastructure complexity, according to Reitbauer.\n\n“A customer that runs a large ecommerce environment on Docker is monitoring the Docker infrastructure as well. They run Marathon and Marathon crashed,” says Reitbauer.\n\nRuxit instrumented Marathon and helped them to discover that they had an issue where the task queue was slowing down; they discovered that their newer version of Marathon was keeping old tasks in the queue by default, causing them to pile up, so-to-speak.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nNo matter what a vendor says, no one container monitoring solution is right for everyone’s needs, if it is a fit for anyone’s needs. Selecting a container monitoring solution or any solution is about knowing where any existing products or approaches fail and how, and then knowing how to investigate and properly vet potential solutions. You should certainly look at many solutions, ask for references, and ask about trials, track records, and customer support options.",
  "latent_30606": "The Marshmallows turned out in droves this weekend to check out the theatrical debut of Veronica Mars. The Kickstarter-funded, cult TV show adaptation opened to a cool $2 million from 291 theaters (265 in the U.S.), earning the pic a spot on the top 10 according, to initial estimates.\n\nThe PG-13 pic was also released simultaneously on VOD — free for Kickstarter backers who’d contributed $35 or more to the record-breaking campaign, but also available for purchase or rental through digital download services such as iTunes or Amazon. The industry has not gotten into a mode where they share VOD earnings, but the multi-platform availability clearly did not dissuade fans from making the trek to the theaters.\n\nBut, is it a success?\n\nIn a note to Kickstarter backers coinciding with Friday’s release, Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas wrote: “My number one goal for Veronica Mars was to make our fans happy.” He added: “Do I still hope Veronica Mars does well in movie theaters, and sells a hundred billion copies on opening weekend? Of course I do. And is there a number I’ve discussed with Warner Bros. that would make it easier to start talking about a sequel? Of course there is. The more audience we can show for Veronica Mars, the better the odds that we’ll get to do this again in the future.”\n\nWarner Bros.’ executive vice president of theatrical distribution Jeff Goldstein was happy with the opening, telling EW: “Our result starting with our Thursday fan events was $260K. You add that together with our weekend for a total of $2 million from 291 theaters? That’s pretty significant.”\n\nThis might not change the model for filmmaking and distribution as we know it, but Warner Bros. does have a few takeaways. “We recognize going forward that there’s room in the marketplace for huge movies, medium movies, and boutique films for a very specific audience,” says Goldstein. The biggest obstacle with this particular model was convincing movie theater owners to take a gamble and show the film theatrically, knowing that it would also be available on VOD — and free for many backers, who are arguably the most passionate of the fan base. AMC came through, and Goldstein says it was “hugely successful” for the chain.\n\n“In so many of their complexes, Veronica Mars was the No. 1 movie for the entire weekend, far exceeding the next closest movie,” says Goldstein. “It’s not the number of theaters, it’s the quality of the theaters and the number of seats you can make available so that the patrons in the area can go see the movie. That’s what happened this weekend — they flocked.” The per theater average was about $6,945.\n\nAs for sequel possibilities? “We haven’t had that conversation yet,” says Goldstein. “We wanted to get through this weekend and then sit down and figure out where we’re going.” That includes looking at VOD numbers, which may actually be released. Take note, Marshmallows — everyone may be staying mum on what magic number they needed to hit, but there could be an answer soon. Goldstein says: “In a week we’ll have a better sense.”",
  "latent_30674": "The Australian-made Crash the Super Bowl entry “Finger Cleaner” is pretty disgusting. It’s gross and it’s weird and its thinly-veiled sexual subtext is completely outrageous. And you know what? That’s why I love this commercial. I didn’t think the CTSB judges would have the stones to pick Finger Cleaner for the Top 5 but I guess I was wrong. (Apparently they were serious when they told their fans they wanted “bold” submissions.) Finger Cleaner is so crazy and so hilarious that it actually went viral about 2 months before it even made the semi-finals. And when the ad was announced as an official finalist on January 2nd, Finger Cleaner was shared by so many people that it gained almost 300,000 views in a day. With three days left to go in the online voting, the commercial is up to 2.6 million views and 5,252 shares. Compare that to the finalist in 2nd place in the (unofficial) view count race; Time Machine. That ad has proved to be pretty popular too but it’s only earned 1,120,438 views and 574 shares.\n\n–\n\nViews and shares don’t actually count in this contest but they’re a good indicator of how an entry is doing in the public voting. Finger Cleaner is getting so much positive media coverage and so many social media shares that it’s probably going to win the online poll in a landslide. The finalist that gets the most votes is supposed to air during Superbowl XLVIII and the creator is supposed to automatically win a million dollars. But ever since Janet Jackson’s wardrobe malfunction, the networks that broadcast the Super Bowl have been trying to keep the event squeaky-clean and controversy-free. Every year there are a few stories about Super Bowl ads that are rejected because they’re “too hot for TV” or because they might offend viewers. Advertisers such as Godaddy have realized that they can get some free press attention just by submitting Super Bowl ads that they know will get rejected. It’s a win-win situation for sponsors because these “controversial” ads go viral but the company doesn’t have to pay 3 million bucks to air it during the Super Bowl. Case in point, this Godaddy ad that was rejected CBS last year…\n\n–\n\nThat was pretty lame. I doubt Godaddy ever actually wanted to air that 49 second-long commercial during the Super Bowl. (They wound up airing a shorter, less-gross version of this spot) But because it was officially “rejected,” Godaddy could call it “too hot for TV” and post it on youtube. Since January 2013 that commercial has been seen more than 1.6 million times and those views didn’t cost Godaddy a dime.\n\nThe day after Doritos revealed their finalists, The Today Show aired and discussed the other selected ads (Office Thief, Breakroom Ostrich, Cowboy Kid and Time Machine) but at the end of the segment, Matt Lauer said:\n\n“Now, there was a fifth finalist, but after watch it 37 times, I decided, and so did some other people here that it was not right for morning TV. So we’re gonna put that on our website and you can go to Today.com and check that one out.”\n\nIf you went to Today.com and looked for their story about the Crash the Super Bowl contest, you’d see that the headline they used was “See 5 Super Bowl ads competing for $1M and the one that couldn’t air on TV.” The article does include Finger Cleaner but states that it was “too provocative for TV.”\n\nIf The Today Show couldn’t show Finger Cleaner, will FOX be able to air it during the new G-rated Super Bowl? The commercial is so bizarre and so suggestive that I’ve had a creeping suspicion that Doritos picked it because they thought it might get rejected by FOX. If the ad didn’t get approved, the company could just air another Crash the Super Bowl commercial but they would still get millions of free viral views from Finger Cleaner.\n\nBut that plan doesn’t really seem like Frito-Lay’s style. So I contacted the company and asked what would happen if Finger Cleaner won the online vote but was rejected by the network. The Senior Director of Public Relations for Frito-Lay North America, Chris Kuechenmeister (AKA one of the top Crash the Super Bowl judges) sent me back a pleasantly definitive answer:\n\n“All five finalist spots have been approved by FOX and the NFL. Two of the five finalist spots will air during the Super Bowl – one selected by the world’s votes, the other by the Doritos brand team.”\n\nSo that’s that! If Finger Cleaner wins the online vote CAN air during the Super Bowl. And that’s great news for everyone who thinks there aren’t enough glory holes for cheesy fingers on TV!\n\n–",
  "latent_30847": "According to the fourth quarter 2015 RLB Crane Index, 220 cranes currently dot the Sydney skyline. A whopping 170 of these cranes were devoted to residential projects, some of which will become the tallest buildings in the city. The rate of growth shows no real signs of slowing down either; new development applications lodged with City Hall totalled $7.4 billion AUD worth of investment. With its urban makeup constantly changing, we take a look at some of the largest towers planned for Australia's biggest metropolis.\n\nSydney Crown, image via Wilkinson Eyre\n\nLocated on the northwestern edge of Sydney's central business district (CBD), Barangaroo is a former port facility undergoing a massive transition into a bustling mixed-use neighbourhood. The $6 billion AUD waterfront redevelopment is being managed by the Barangaroo Delivery Authority on land owned by the New South Wales government. The parcel has been split into three distinct areas: Barangaroo Reserve, Central Barangaroo, and Barangaroo South. Acting as an extension of the CBD, the Lendlease-developed Barangaroo South will include a number of tall skyscrapers, including the 271-metre Sydney Crown.\n\nSydney Crown, image via Wilkinson Eyre\n\nDesigned by Wilkinson Eyre, the 70-storey hotel and casino complex will include 350 guest rooms plus luxury apartments and retail. As the first six-star international hotel to be constructed in Sydney, it will finally surpass the Chifley Tower as the tallest building in the city, a record the 53-storey tower has held since 1992.\n\nOne Sydney Harbour, image via Renzo Piano Building Workshop\n\nWithin the same precinct, Renzo Piano Building Workshop promises to bring two residential towers to life. One Sydney Harbour's 71- and 60-storey glass towers are the last pieces of the puzzle to come together. A trio of office towers designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, the International Towers, will also join the emerging waterfront skyline. Construction on those three buildings has already begun, and the entire Barangaroo South district is scheduled for completion in 2021.\n\nInternational Towers, image via Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners\n\nThough Sydney Crown appears locked in to become the tallest skyscraper in the city, the 78-storey 505 George Street will top out at a height just nine metres shorter. Developed by Coombes Property Group and Mirvac, who have hired Crone Architects, the project will contain 629 residential units and over 10,000 square feet of retail.\n\n505 George Street, image via Crone Architects\n\nIn addition to world-famous architects making their mark on the city, major international developers are also investing in the country. China's largest real estate developer, Greenland Group, unveiled plans to build a 245-metre building with 66 floors. The Sydney Greenland Centre features a design by BVN Donovan Hill and Woods Bagot, who have proposed a rectangular glass tower atop the existing Art Deco Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board building. That building is being converted into a 180-bed hotel which is due for completion in 2016. The residential tower will forgo any floor numbers with \"four\" in them, as the number has a similar pronunciation to \"death\" in Mandarin. The tower is being marketed as a 82-storey building as a result. Now under construction, completion of the full project is expected in 2019.\n\nSydney Greenland Centre, image via Woods Bagot\n\nSeveral of the towers listed above exceed Sydney's longstanding height limit of 235 metres. After 40 years, there is increasing pressure to raise the limit so that more growth can be accommodated in the central core. Technically, developers can build up to 257 metres, though they would have to sacrifice ten percent of floor space to do so. That is putting a strain on developers hoping to add more office space and residential units to the city. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird is hoping to lift the restriction, pointing to other cities like Melbourne who are building towers exceeding the supertall mark.\n\nAdditional images and information on the projects above can be found in the Database files linked below.

  "latent_30996": "Polish MEP Danuta Hübner says Britain cannot negotiate a free-trade agreement until it has left the European Union\n\nLiam Fox’s hopes of securing a trade deal with the European Union before Brexit have been dealt a blow by a leading member of the European parliament, who insists no deal can be struck until the UK has left the bloc.\n\nDanuta Hübner, a former Polish minister who became the country’s first European commissioner, said it would not be possible for the UK to conclude a trade deal while still an EU member.\n\nNow an MEP, she chairs the European parliament’s constitutional affairs committee, which will be responsible for vetting any post-Brexit free-trade agreement with the UK.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, she stressed negotiations on Britain’s EU exit under article 50, due to begin next year, would be on a different track to talks on the future relationship.\n\n“Formally you cannot conclude or even negotiate the agreement that belongs to a third-country situation while you are still a member. Article 50 is only about withdrawal and only when you are out can [you] negotiate another agreement.”\n\nLast week, Fox, the international trade secretary, suggested the UK would aim to reach an agreement on its future trading status with the EU before leaving.\n\nCriticising positions of “ultra-legality”, Fox argued it was in the interests of both sides to avoid a situation where a regional parliament could delay a UK-EU economic agreement, in the same way the Belgian region of Wallonia blocked an EU trade deal with Canada.\n\nSpeaking to MPs on the European scrutiny committee, he said: “That sort of procedure would only be undertaken were we to leave the European Union after article 50, period, without any agreement whatsoever and were looking to seek a new FTA [free trade agreement] from outside.”\n\nHübner said the two processes, although linked, would not be merged. A trade deal would be “challenging” to agree, she added, because it requires unanimity from all EU member states. The article 50 exit talks, which cover unwinding 43 years of the UK’s EU membership, require only majority agreement among other member states.\n\nBut the Polish politician was clear that the British withdrawal agreement would have to specify whether the UK was heading for hard or soft Brexit. This is in line with article 50, which states that the exit agreement shall take into account “the framework for [the the departing state’s] future relationship with the union”.\n\nThe MEP said: “Our major challenge is how to ensure that between the withdrawal agreement and the future agreement there is no legal vacuum.”\n\nAs the British government weighs up its options on the single market and customs union, the EU machinery is whirring into gear to prepare for the launch of Brexit talks in spring 2017.\n\nOfficially, the European parliament has no place at the negotiating table, but its consent is needed to seal the article 50 deal and any new status agreement with Brexit Britain.\n\nPreparations go well beyond the appointment of Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian prime minister and leader of the Liberal bloc, as the parliament’s spokesman on the Brexit process. Hübner’s constitutional affairs committee will be in charge of drafting the parliament’s position on any new deal with the UK; several other committees will also weigh in, before the agreement is put to a vote by all MEPs.\n\nTheresa May’s government should expect the European parliament to be one of the staunchest defenders of the principle of free movement of people, according to Hübner.\n\n“We will be the institution that will be looking with concern to the rights of citizens,” she said, adding that free movement was where “the most drastic differences” between the UK and rest of the EU were evident.\n\nA former Polish Europe minister, who spent years in painstaking negotiations to bring her country into the EU, she said: “We are working to facilitate free movement, not to block it and to limit it, so I don’t see much chance in looking for restrictions.”\n\nShe rejected the idea that central and eastern European governments would cave in on this principle, in order to keep more of their talented citizens at home. “You don’t control what your citizens are doing from this point of view,” she said. “It is up to people to evaluate their future and their chances and have the freedom of moving and working wherever there is a job.”\n\nShe contrasted Poles, Romanians and Spaniards, who worked in the UK and paid more taxes than they received in benefits, with British pensioners living in Spain, who were likely to take advantage of the Spanish healthcare system. “It is not fair that in UK, politicians do not explain how much you have benefited from the free movement of labour.”\n\nDescribing Brexit as a “major mistake” in European history, she said she would prefer to be in a union of 28, with the UK. But she is not convinced a hard Brexit is inevitable and predicted that economic arguments would win out over demands for curbs on immigration.\n\nShe predicted a shift from “purely political considerations” towards a stance that takes greater account of the economic repercussions of Brexit. But she still regretted the Brexit choice.\n\n“Such a decision is not made for a week or a year, it is for a generation.”",

  "latent_31246": "The train-wreck that is our current administration didn’t happen overnight, the roots to many of these problems go back multiple administrations. Democrats lost plenty of seats in the House and Senate during both of Obamas mid-terms and the 2016 election continued this losing streak for the party. Though there may be many arguments about what went wrong in the past for Dems, and I have a whole piece dedicated to this topic called How to Beat Trump, it is time to correct course and look towards the future. Hawaiian representative Tulsi Gabbard is authentic, standing strong in her values with substance and loved by the very voters who Democrats will need to inspire if they want to start winning again. A darling to many Independents, Millennials, and the Bernie Wing, Gabbard represents a new direction and vision for the party that has lost its way.\n\nwww.votetulsi.com\n\nThough the Trump fiasco is stealing headlines, Democrats have been having their own problems. If they want to win back the Whitehouse and the midterms, focusing on Trumps failings will not be enough. They will need a new path forward, a shift away from neoliberal/Wall Street extremists who have taken over the party. They will need to restore trust with their voting base. Tulsi is one of the few who can do this for the party... if they will let her.\n\nSome Background, Another Tough Couple of Weeks for the DNC\n\nSadly, establishment Democrats have continued their downward spiral and it is getting hard to watch. The lawsuit against the DNC over their conduct of the primaries has their attorney stating openly that the party can select whoever they want without honoring the words of their own charter to hold fair elections. Article 5, Section 4 of the DNC Charter states, “The Chairperson shall be responsible for ensuring that the national officers and staff of the Democratic National Committee maintain impartiality and evenhandedness during the Democratic Party Presidential nominating process.” but the lawyer representing the DNC in court refutes this clause saying that it is not legally binding by stating:\n\n...there’s no right to not have your candidate disadvantaged or have another candidate advantaged. There’s no contractual obligation here... we could have voluntarily decided that, look, we’re gonna go into back rooms like they used to and smoke cigars and pick the candidate that way. That’s not the way it was done. But they could have. And that would have also been their right. -DNC attorney Bruce Spiva (full transcripts here)\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats who despise Trump applauded his illegal military escalation in Syria. Howard Dean, who is apparently now a big supporter of Trump for the bombing, tweeted “This is a disgrace. Gabbard should not be in Congress.” Meanwhile all that Gabbard did was suggest that the U.S. respect international protocol and investigate Assad before escalating instead of going down the same costly road we went down in Iraq. Her response on Twitter was priceless:\n\nThose who’ve declared Trump a habitual liar now vilify those refusing to blindly follow him into another regime change war. Hypocrisy. — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) April 10, 2017\n\nA USA Today/Suffolk University poll recently showed that Americans have given the DNC (36%) and Clinton (35%) lower approval ratings than Trump (45%). Then Perez and the party launched their “Unity Tour” which opened with half the audience booing him while cheering wildly for Bernie Sanders. Perez is disliked because of his support for Wall Street and neoliberal policies like TPP, but also because he encouraged the Clinton Campaign to wrongfully smear Sanders during the primaries. Dianne Feinstein (who is also a supporter of Trumps Syria bombing and regime-change wars) was booed for refusing to support HR 676, Medicare for All Bill. This shouldn’t be too surprising considering that she has taken almost a half million dollars from pharmaceutical lobbyists. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi is either displaying how out of touch she is or just plain lying when she stated that Democrats are united.\n\nNow for the Good News...\n\nThe Democrats desperately need authenticity, and though many of the establishment leadership doesn’t have it, Tulsi Gabbard does! During the Democratic Primaries, Tulsi received a threatening letter that the DNC would not support her next campaign because she had the integrity to leave her post in the DNC to endorse Bernie Sanders. This is one example of the ways that money is used to bully and corrupt our democracy. No campaign funding, no re-election. In Tulsi’s favor, this incident shows the courage she has to stand for her principles and place them above money or towing the party line. This did not go unnoticed by Independents, Millennials, and Bernie Supporters.\n\nWhile representatives are meeting angry crowds across the country, Tulsi received a standing ovation as she entered the room for her Town Hall Meeting in Hilo, Hawaii. To say that she is loved is an understatement, and though she has a sparkling demeanor, this isn’t personality politics. This is about substance and policy. While many Americans are upset about Trumps healthcare plan, Gabbard is a co-signer on HR 676, Medicare for All. This is one area that we can get behind her by encouraging our representatives to sign on as well, and since the topic is trending, now is the perfect moment. Click here to take action!\n\n“I supported and signed on for the Medicare for All Bill HR 676 for a few simple reasons... The ACA did some good but there was also this signature from insurance and pharmaceutical companies that existed in it... Medicare is still not allowed to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to bring down the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare recipients. They’re not allowed to. The VA can negotiate those prices and reduce costs for veterans but Medicare can not. I signed legislation that would allow Medicare to negotiate those prices. I signed legislation that will allow us to import pharmaceuticals from Canada where they are available at a fraction of the price that we pay here. I mention each of these because our health care system is broken... So that people have access to care, not just insurance. There is an important difference.” -Rep Tulsi Gabbard at Hilo Town Hall Meeting\n\nGabbard has brought significant attention to the problems that interventionist wars create at home and abroad. The expensive and dangerous regime change policies supported by Bush, Obama, and Clinton actually make our country and the world less safe. Rather than alleviate suffering, they increase it. In addition to breaking international laws, these military excursions cost tax payers billions of dollars leaving less money to address domestic issues like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. That is why she has sponsored the Stop Arming Terrorists Act, which you should contact your representative and urge them to also support.\n\nCongress has not voted on or authorized this war in Syria. This war has actually been waged longer than you might think. This war in Syria did not begin with Trumps missile strike a few days ago. It began years before that when our government, your tax-payer dollars, began being used to provide arms, weapons, salaries, intelligence assistance to arm militants inside Syria who were working with and often directly under the command of terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda to overthrow the Syrian Government. We provided the support indirectly through countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar who, for their own interests want to see the Syrian Government overthrown and who provide support for these terrorist groups working towards that ends as well. So this illegal regime-change war has been waged for years and Trumps missile strike was really an escalation of this illegal war that was never debated on the House Floor, that you never had a say in, and that was never voted on so that you could hold your leaders accountable for it. Part of the problem here is that, over the years, Congress has ceded its’ authority to the Executive Branch because too many people are afraid of being on the record. They don’t want to be held accountable. So I’ve introduced legislation to deal with the issue I’ve just talked about. The CIA has been waging this war by providing this support directly to armed militants working with terrorist groups. My bill is called the Stop Arming Terrorists Act and it will prevent your tax dollars from being used to provide armed militant groups who are working with terrorist groups. -Tulsi Gabbard at Hilo Town Hall Meeting\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul has co-signed the bill with her, and any Republicans or Democrats who refuse to sign onto a bill titled Stop Arming Terrorists should be scrutinized by their constituents. The fact that she is drawing bipartisan support also shows that she knows how to get the job done. The American People are ready for leadership that is fresh, that isn’t entrenched in personality or party politics. The values keep flipping across the aisle as we saw the Democratic candidate (Clinton) standing on a platform of more war and costly intervention, and a Republican candidate (Trump) standing against regime-change wars during the campaign.\n\nMillennial Youtube Star, An0maly made a recent video about Tulsi’s speech in Hilo. This exemplifies the way that the upcoming generation utilizes media, and ignores party lines. An0maly stays focused on policy, praising or cursing both Republicans and Democrats based on this criteria rather than being distracted by personalities or party lines. This is what we can expect from young voters in the coming elections, and it would be wise for any party interested in winning to take note of this. An0maly naturally supports Gabbard on a number of issues because of her direct, no-nonsense, principled demeanor and because she is a veteran who is working for peace in a world on the verge of potentially catastrophic war.\n\nThe majority of Americans want peace just like the majority of Americans want access to affordable healthcare, and we need individuals who are willing to stand for these principles fearless of party lines, or the corruption that comes from big money. Tulsi has showed us that she is this type of leader. She also has strong stances on net neutrality, sustainability, Wall Street Reform and other issues that are important to Millennials, Independents, Republicans and Democrats alike. You can learn more about her at her website.\n\nwww.twitter.com\n\nIn 2016 The Democratic Party and many of its’ followers held a stance that they didn’t need support from Independents, Millennials, or Bernie Fans and instead tried to appeal to the Conservative Base. This strategy failed miserably for Democrats and our nation. It is time for Democrats to get the message, to start getting behind new, authentically progressive voices in the party, and listen to those who are tired of war and neoliberal policies. Many Democrats, still sour over their recent defeat are taking the wrong approach when they defend Clinton, or make excuses for the policies that cost them the White House in 2016.\n\nWe cannot further the cause of peace and understanding without meeting with people who we disagree with. -Tulsi Gabbard at Hilo Town Hall Meeting",

A senior Afghan security official said the Afghan troops were a rapid-reaction commando force that had arrived in Kunduz just days before the airstrike.\n\nThe commandos, who were dispatched from Kabul on Sept. 29, the day after Kunduz fell to the Taliban, would not have been very familiar with the terrain, the official said.\n\nFinally, investigators are interviewing the crew of the AC-130 gunship, and reviewing transcripts of the audiotapes between the aircrew and the Americans on the ground approving the strike, as well as gun-camera video of the strike itself.\n\nBut no evidence has yet emerged that the Afghan troops who called in the strike were under fire from the hospital, said the senior Afghan security official, who works closely with American forces.\n\nThe results of the first of three inquiries into the attack on the Doctors Without Borders hospital will most likely be released later this week, Pentagon officials said on Tuesday. That inquiry, conducted by NATO officers, is to determine whether civilians were killed, something that all sides quickly agreed did occur. But it may offer new insights into events leading up to the strike.\n\nAmerican officials now acknowledge, for instance, that the hospital was on a “protected list” of specially designated buildings like mosques or schools, to avoid the very kind of strike that happened. But investigators are still trying to determine why the Afghans, the American Special Forces and the gunship crew apparently were not aware of that.\n\nOther factors most likely contributing to the airstrike have previously emerged. General Campbell, according to military officials, believes that United States troops probably did not follow their own rules in calling in the airstrike when no American and Afghan troops were in extreme danger, according to officials with direct knowledge of the general’s thinking.",
  "latent_31826": "Magical Contracts\n\nby Kalen Darkmoon\n\nSummary: In Goblet of Fire, JKR established that it was absurdly easy to bind other witches and wizards unwillingly into binding magical contracts with a simple school-taught confundus charm. So, what if Harry took note of that and decided to do something about it himself?\n\nDisclaimer: I own nothing of the the world of Harry Potter. JKR botched it up all on her own. I am merely playing in her plot-holes.;-)\n\n--\n\nThe day after Harry's name burst forth from the Goblet of Fire...\n\nHarry just couldn't believe it. How was this possible? Despite his objections he was now bound unwillingly by a magical contract that he in no way agreed to. A contract that compels him to compete in a historically deadly tournament. Even Dumbledore had told him that he had no choice and was bound to compete. What was it that Moody had said? A confundus charm was used to trick the Goblet. Well, if a simple confundus worked on a supposedly powerful ancient magical artifact against him then surely such a concept could be used against others as well. Granted he said it had to be someone powerful to 'confund' an artifact like the Goblet of Fire but what if he didn't need to use such a powerful artifact? After all, witches and wizards used magical contracts in every day business dealings as well.\n\n--\n\nHarry sat back with a wide grin on his face as he perused the magical contract he had drawn up on specially enchanted contract parchment that Hedwig just returned with from Hogsmeade. He wondered if it could truly be that easy. After thinking it over he decided to keep the contract short, simple and to the point...\n\nI, the undersigned, swear upon my magic that I have never and will never, knowingly, intentionally and of my own free will, kill or inflict serious harm upon another being except in direct defense of self or another when no other action is believed possible.\n\nSigned,\n\nHarry grinned at this point as he dipped his quill in the special enchanted contract ink and waved his wand while casting a 'confundus' upon the parchment. If this worked, then if those people whose names he signs had ever or will ever intentionally kill or hurt an innocent person, they would instantly become squibs. Now for the first name...\n\nTom Marvolo Riddle\n\nUpon lifting the quill from the parchment there was a bright flash as the contract seemingly activated. After but a few seconds the lettering morphed from black ink to the red of blood and the parchment began to glow increasingly brighter. Harry chuckled as he realized that it seemed to indeed be working and the evil git was in obvious violation of the contract. While he was glad he learned Voldemort's true name in the Chamber of Secrets at the end of second year, he had to wonder what it was with evil gits and the need to gloat anyway?\n\nSuddenly names started appearing in blood beneath the signature - names of each and every innocent killed or harmed in violation of the contract. In addition, for each named, a separate parchment appeared beneath the contract with the details of each violation. As the list and stack of parchment grew Harry found himself becoming increasingly nauseous as the page seemed to fill with blood from the hundreds of names that came forth. He was forced to stifle a sob when first his father's, then his mother's names appeared followed by his own name and a few others. After the last name appeared, he felt a sharp stabbing pain in his scar for a few moments and could swear just for a moment that he heard an anguished scream seemingly inside his head. As a black mist was ejected from his scar and faded away, the edges of the contract blackened. He grinned viciously as it seemed to indeed work. A bit of poetic justice, if you will. It served the bastard right to become a squib.\n\nHe rubbed his scar for a moment wondering what that last bit was about and noticed that he could hardly feel it anymore. Setting his quill aside, he walked over to a mirror and was shocked to see his scar had almost completely faded. Oh, it was still there but rather than prominent and angry as it had been before it was now nothing more than a thin lightning bolt shaped white scar that had shrunk in even with the surface of his skin. He stared a moment longer as it began to really sink in that the contract did indeed appear to work! No small part of him was rather incredulous that nobody else ever thought to try something like this before whoever put his name in the Goblet. Really! It was rather absurd that if one can bind others in magical contracts so easily that nobody thought to use such a method to strip the magic from evil gits like Voldemort.\n\nWith a grin that would terrify even a hardened Slytherin, he went back to the table he was working at and grabbed another contract parchment from the stack. After he copied the previous contract and again cast a confundus charm on the parchment, he signed this one:\n\nPeter Pettigrew\n\nThe contract flashed as it activated and the ink turned to blood as the contract judged the signed to be in violation. Again a list of violations (victims) are shown, this time showing not only his parents and himself but also Sirius and more than a dozen others. Gleefully he grabs the next parchment thinking it was now time for the slippery bastard that snuck the diary in during second year...\n\nLucius Malfoy\n\nHe was again sickened and not the least bit surprised as a long list of names appear in blood before the edges blacken and Lucius Malfoy is stripped of his magic. This went on well into the night as he made copies, confunded and signed the names of several Slytherin school-mates who spewed hate and/or threatened others in Harry's presence...\n\nDraco Malfoy\n\nTheodore Nott\n\nVincent Crabbe\n\nGregory Goyle\n\nPansy Parkinson\n\nMillicent Bulstrode\n\nMarcus Flint\n\nThough he graduated the previous year, Harry tacked on the former Slytherin Quidditch Captain's name just on a hunch. Interestingly for each of the Slytherins, the contract only flashed and activated but none found the person to have been in violation - yet. Harry was a little suprised that even Malfoy had yet to seriously harm another. Perhaps there was hope for him despite how much of a nasty git he was.\n\nAfter packing away the contracts he had thus far completed into his bag, he noted he was down to only a couple of sheets left. He wracked his brains as he tried to think of anyone else. Hmmm... There was the greasy git who had done nothing but take every opportunity to degrade and make him miserable at Hogwarts. Harry was almost certain he would be in violation and thought that the greasy git truly deserved this fate if he really did harm or kill anyone. Especially after the years of torment inflicted not only on himself but countless other students. With a flourish he signed the name,\n\nSeverus Snape\n\nAgain there was a flash as the contract activated and not entirely surprisingly the script became blood as the contract found him in violation. Harry shook his head. It was one thing to strongly believe something about someone but entirely different to see it confirmed. As he glanced at the names appearing in blood, Harry gasped and paled as he saw the names of his parents and himself appear upon the list of victims.\n\nHe shot out of his seat with a shout, \"What in the bloody hell!?\"\n\nOblivious to the stares of a few fellow students around him, he stood there staring stupefied at the contract. How was it that Snape was involved in the death of his parents and his being hurt!? Flipping to the parchment that listed the details of that violation he was sickened to learn that Snape had provided some sort of information about a prophecy that referred to his family and the Longbottoms being a threat to Voldemort with full knowledge that it would cause the Dark Lord to hunt and kill those families. The greasy bastard essentially was responsible for the Dark Lord targeting and killing his parents! With that thought a seed had been planted and a cold knot formed in the pit of Harry's stomach. Why did Dumbledore hire him? Why was he always defending him when he was so obviously cruel to students and seemed to take a particular interest in tormenting him?\n\nNot entirely knowing quite why, he numbly sat down and on the last sheet of confunded parchment before him he signed the name,\n\nAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore\n\nBut then again, at least subconciously he knew the old coot had to be up to something since he seemed to take a very particular interest in Harry's life and whereabouts at all times. In fact, a small part of him wondered if Dumbledore put him with the Dursleys fully aware of what they were doing to him. After all, he turned a blind eye to Harry's complaints about them in first year and said nothing about the Weasleys having to rescue him from a barred room at the beginning of his second year. Combine that with his ignoring of complaints about a man who was partially responsible for his parent's deaths, Harry's suspicions were fully inflamed. Little did he know how close to the truth he really was. Glancing down at the contract, he wasn't prepared to see the first victim's name to appear in blood...\n\nTom Marvolo Riddle\n\nHarry was about to read the details regarding Tom Riddle but there weren't many names listed and he was momentarily shocked to see a Dumbledore on his list of victims as well. Yet nothing fully prepared him to again see his parent's names along with his own and Sirius as well. The old bastard somehow had a hand in his parent's deaths and did something to Sirius! Forgetting entirely about Tom Riddle for the moment, he quickly flipped to the parchment listing the violations surrounding his parents and himself and started reading.\n\nAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore instructed his spy in the Dark Lord Voldemort's ranks, Death Eater Severus Snape, to inform the Dark Lord Voldemort about a portion of a prophecy regarding a child being born with the power to defeat the Dark Lord as both a means to elevate Severus Snape's rank and a means to put the prophecy in motion. The prophecy in question designated Harry James Potter and Neville Longbottom as potential candidates with the ability to defeat the Dark Lord Voldemort. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore's action led to Voldemort attacking the Potter family on October 31, 1981 the result of which designated Harry James Potter as the child the prophecy spoke of and resulted in the deaths of James Potter and Lily Evans Potter. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore acted with the knowledge that his actions would lead to the deaths of the elder Longbottoms and/or Potters and the belief that it would lead to the destruction of the Dark Lord Voldemort or the mutual destruction of the Dark Lord Voldemort and Harry James Potter or Neville Longbottom.\n\nUpon the survival of Harry James Potter, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore ordered and participated in the kidnapping of Harry James Potter from his legal and rightful guardian, Sirius Black, while placing him in the home of his mother's sister - Petunia Evans Dursley - with full knowledge of their intense hatred for all things magical. It was his belief that the Dursley family would ensure that Harry James Potter matured with a personality that would be easily pliable and subject to his later influence. Having cast the Fidelius charm himself that hid the Potter family, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was well aware of, and with intent, withheld all knowledge of the true Potter Secret Keeper - Peter Pettigrew - to ensure Sirius Black's eventual incarceration and inability to ever claim his rightful and legal guardianship over Harry James Potter. These actions caused for an innocent child, Harry James Potter, to be enslaved and treated with nothing but neglect and cruelty with the full knowledge thereof by Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore through an informant, Arabella Figg, placed living nearby.\n\nAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore knowingly allowed a Dark Lord Voldemort possessed Quirrinus Quirrel to teach at Hogwarts with the intent of drawing a confrontation between the Dark Lord Voldemort and Harry James Potter by using the Philosopher's Stone as bait for both parties. Failing that, it was the belief of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore that year long close exposure between the Dark Lord Voldemort and Harry James Potter would strengthen the connection between them through the cursed scar upon Harry James Potter. It is of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore's intent that encouraging the link between the Dark Lord Voldemort and Harry James Potter would later ease the eventual defeat of the Dark Lord Voldemort should the Dark Lord Voldemort prevail and sucessfully kill Harry James Potter.\n\nAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore knowingly allowed a Death Eater - Bartemius Crouch Jr - to impersonate Alastor Moody and force a binding magical contract upon Harry James Potter to participate in a deadly tournament. A tournament for which, historically, Harry James Potter is woefully under-educated and is clearly an attempt to bring harm or death upon his person.\n\nA scream of pure rage erupted from Harry as the edges blackened upon the parchment. The entire castle rumbled as the wards shudder and shift control to another after her headmaster was violently stripped of his magic. The few students still awake and in the commons look at Harry in a mixture of awe and terror that his scream of rage seemed to shake the entire castle. They quickly flee to their rooms after he violently flips the table he was seated at and storms out the portrait tightly holding the Dumbledore and Snape contract parchments crushed in his left hand. To Hell with the fake Moody for now, there was an old squib who he wanted answers from... just before he killed the bastard with his own bare hands. After that there was a certain greasy haired squib that would also pay dearly for setting up his parents' deaths, this Harry vowed upon his magic.\n\n--\n\nA shocked school would learn the next morning that their beloved headmaster had fallen down a flight of stairs breaking his neck and killing him instantly as well as their not-so-beloved potions professor was a fatal victim of an exploding cauldron. A young Harry Potter briefly eyed a certain seemingly nervous Defense professor as he sat down for his breakfast. He only had to wait for Hedwig to return with a fresh order of contract parchment...\n\n-- -- -- -- -- --\n\nAN: Just a little one-shot that I pounded out last night that highlights a few of the many rather fatal plot holes in JKR's world of Harry Potter. In particular the binding of others in magical contracts with a simple confundus charm.\n\nHow about the much vaunted wards of the supposedly safest place in Britain? Name one Death Eater that was prevented from walking in or out of the front doors of Hogwarts at will. Snape, Pettigrew, Lucius Malfoy, Crouch Jr and even Voldemort himself waltzed in and out without difficulty. How about the junior Death Eaters?\n\nOr how about an often completely overlooked detail by most in that, per canon, Dumbledore was the caster of the Potter's Fidelius and would have thus had full knowledge that Pettigrew was the real Secret Keeper rather than Sirius. In fact, Pettigrew's very presence in the Order was either knowingly allowed by Dumbledore or along with Quirrelmort and Crouch Jr.s infiltrations into Hogwarts it rendered not only Dumbledore's Leglimency skills suspect but more importantly the entire idea of a phoenix (in this case Fawkes) being able to judge the 'goodness' of a person as totally false.\n\nDumbledore was supposedly a Master Leglimens that supposedly nobody can ever successfully lie to and had a phoenix familiar that could supposedly sense whether someone is good or evil. BUT, yet, his twenty plus year long friend and ally Mad-Eye Moody was successfully replaced by a poly-juiced Death Eater for an entire school year in his close proximity (even meeting in his office with Fawkes RIGHT THERE) as well as Voldemort himself remained in close proximity for an entire year in a possessed Quirrel. This begs questions about Dumbledore's own \"righteousness and good\" as well then doesn't it? Fawkes obviously could NOT be relied upon as an indicator or was kept silent by Dumbledore in the face of such evils.\n\nSome have pointed out that Harry would be susceptible to his own contracts or that he is somehow being hypocritical. I urge those people to read a little more closely. He caused no direct harm against anyone that wasn't a threat to him or someone else. Even Dumbledore and Snape were proven a threat as evidenced by the revelations in the contract breaches for them. Harry's targets were Death Eaters known by him (plus Snape), their hate-spewing children (who were innocent and thus NOT HARMED), Voldemort and Dumbledore. Every person actually \"harmed\" by Harry's contracts were those out to harm Harry, so he himself would (so far) be safe if one were used against him because it was self-defense.\n\nEven if you wanted to argue Snape's and Dumbledore's deaths after having their magic stripped, I would point out that no-where did I explicitly state that Harry actually killed either Snape or Dumbledore. Both could have merely been accidents that happened from the shock of losing their magic and/or the castle shaking from the ward shift. ;-) Although, even if Harry has killed them, they both in fact remained a threat even as squibs and thus he would not run afoul of his own contracts. Snape could have remained a potions teacher even as a squib (remember, \"no silly wand waving\" needed) and thus retained access to Harry to continue to inflict harm upon him and other students. Dumbledore would have most likely been able to hide his loss of magic given his influence and Fawke's assistance - enough to remain in control of Harry's life and thus also remained a threat.\n\nLong live fan-fiction.\n\nP.S. If anyone wants to pick up and continue my other Harry Potter story, they are welcome to do so. I'm uncertain when I'll have time to continue it further though I do have parts of the next two chapters completed already. I kind of wrote myself into a corner on that one as I find it hard to believe that Hermione's parents would allow Hermione to return to Hogwarts in light of their newfound knowledge of all that has happened there already. A school with a number of different professors who kidnap, terrorize, torture, obliviate and/or attempt to kill students is a bit much for any parent to just overlook. I'm currently working out an angle where Harry and Hermione leave Britain entirely for a while. Especially after the Wizengamot shines through with its foolish arrogance...",

  "latent_32016": "TEL AVIV, Israel -- When Avraham Meker moved from his native Georgia to Israel in 1974, he had a transformative experience while getting a glass of water at a kibbutz dining hall.\n\n\"I saw four taps,\" recalls Meker, who grew up in Georgia's second city of Kutaisi. \"I opened one and water came out. A second was milk. A third was soda water, and a fourth was hot water. I didn't even finish my food. I looked for a phone and called my mother and said, 'Mom, we have reached the land of milk and honey.'\"\n\nForty years after the Jews of Georgia began their wholesale immigration to Israel, the tables have turned. Veteran Israelis now seek out Georgian cheese-filled bread, steaming meat dumplings, and herb-laced stews, including at a newly opened 150-seat temple to the cuisine on swish Rothschild Boulevard in central Tel Aviv.\n\nIt is one of more than a dozen Georgian restaurants operating nationwide, serving Israelis and about 140,000 Georgian emigres, according to Meker. In their mutual appreciation for eggplant, meat, and spice, Israel and Georgia have found a bond strengthened by inexpensive travel to the former Soviet republic, a large community of Russian-speaking immigrants in Israel, and the buzz of Tel Aviv’s celebrity chefs.\n\nOn a recent Monday afternoon, Dalia Heilpern, 55, rolled khinkali, the Georgian meat dumpling, in the spacious kitchen of the newly opened Supra restaurant. Heilpern's family traces its roots to Iraq, but Georgian cuisine found her while she ran an Israeli restaurant in Vienna with fellow Israeli business partner Yoram Sabi. Located in a neighborhood peppered with Georgian emigres, the restaurant filled with regulars who begged Heilpern to prepare their national specialties.\n\n\"I said, 'I'm sorry. I know what is hummus. I know what is falafel. I don't know this food you are speaking about,'\" Heilpern recalls. \"They said, 'I will bring my grandmother and she will [teach] you how to do it.'\"\n\nWATCH: Cooking Khinkali: Georgian Meat Dumplings\n\nHeilpern's growing expertise led her and Sabi to launch a catering business together that served Georgian food worldwide, including in Belgium, the United States, Russia, and France. Still, in Israel, the cuisine that had become her specialty remained anonymous.\n\n\"When I was coming to Israel to visit, nobody knew Georgian food,\" she says. \"Maybe in [the port city] Ashdod some woman would make [it] at home, but there was no restaurants.\"\n\nIn 1998, they moved their company to Israel. These days, Heilpern says, \"in every place there's a Georgian kitchen,\" a development that gave her and Sabi the confidence to open Supra, the Georgian term for a feast that can last for hours or for days. The menu is mostly Georgian classics, with a nod to Middle Eastern street food. For example, at Supra, the common sandwich in a pita known as a shawarma -- usually meat and vegetables drizzled with tahini sesame paste -- is grilled chicken thighs and lamb topped with eggplant and ground walnuts.\n\nSupra’s third co-owner, Mickey Mirel, said serving walnuts reminds him of his Georgian grandmother, who spent hours a week crushing the nuts in their home city of Ramle, outside Tel Aviv.\n\n\"As a boy, people laughed at me for being Georgian,\" Mirel says. \"Being Georgian was not seen as being sexy. But now they understand the Georgian culture is full of culture, full of joy, full of passion.\"\n\nMirel has been part of the transformation. For seven years, his stage persona -- Tash Tash -- was the house entertainer at Nanuchka, a hedonistic, 20-year-old Georgian institution in south Tel Aviv. Among his hits is a Hebrew song called I Also Want To Be A Georgian. The music video features a pale, bespectacled Israeli man in an argyle sweater who receives a Georgian makeover. Gone are the glasses, the sweater is replaced with a tight black button-down, and the man guzzles liquor straight from the bottle at a dance party:\n\nWATCH: I Also Want To Be A Georgian -- Mickey Mirel\n\nMirel said he thought about opening his own restaurant after Nanuchka’s owner, Nana Shrier, was swept up in the vegan wave washing over Tel Aviv. In 2014, she banished meat, eggs, and cheese from the menu. The joyous atmosphere and drunk clientele tottering on the bar have remained. But Mirel said his fans begged him to open his own restaurant where they could chew on shashlik, or grilled meat, while listening to his music.\n\nIn addition to Supra and Nanuchka, this month a third Georgian restaurant is slated to open in central Tel Aviv. Proprietor Lily Ben Shalom shot to national prominence in 2014 as a contestant on the reality TV cooking show Game Of Chefs, where she wowed the judges with the sour plum sauce tkemali.\n\nBen Shalom’s TV appearance coincided with a highly televised visit by Israeli celebrity chefs to Georgia, on a junket sponsored by Tbilisi. Eyal Shani, known in Israel as the man who invented whole roasted cauliflower, waxed poetic about Georgia's raw and rustic cuisine, where most people make their own wine. Fellow judge Michal Ansky has since opened a private tour company that arranges culinary romps to Georgia.\n\nAnksy’s customers are among the some 60,000 Israelis who visit Georgia annually, according to Israel's Tourism Ministry, and the number is growing substantially each year. Georgia has become a popular alternative to Turkey, which drew half a million Israeli visitors a year before relations between Jerusalem and Ankara deteriorated in 2009 over Israel’s policies in the Gaza Strip. Israel and Georgia have a visa-free travel agreement. In January, El Al became the third Israeli airline to offer direct 2.5-hour flights between Tel Aviv and Tbilisi, in addition to Georgian Airways.\n\nEka Tsiskarishvili says the spike in Israeli visits to Georgia is bringing new crowds to her 25-year-old restaurant, tucked into a stone alley in downtown Jerusalem. Tsiskarishvili, 40, grew up in Tbilisi and Moscow and moved to Israel in her 20s. When her father opened Kangaroo, she said, most of the customers were immigrants from Russia who were raised on summer trips to Georgia and on Georgian wine, favored by the Kremlin. The veteran Israeli clients were disoriented.\n\n\"My dad would tell me it was hard to explain where Georgia was,\" Tsiskarishvili explains. \"He had to explain via Armenia because there are lots of Armenians in Jerusalem's Old City, and Armenia is also in the Caucasus. But about Georgia, people knew nothing.”\n\nIn contrast to the changes under way in Tel Aviv, the menu at Kangaroo focuses on classics: flavorful stews served in ceramic pots, expertly rolled fluffy breads and dumplings, all eaten in an airy room lined with Georgian tapestries and knickknacks. But innovation has made it to the wine list, which includes imported Georgian Saperavi red wine along with bottles from the 6-year-old Israeli Kadma winery. Tbilisi-born owner Lina Slutzkin spent two decades in high tech before she studied winemaking. She imported 20 handmade clay casks from Georgia, which she uses to ferment red grapes in a modified homage to Georgia's 8,000-year-old wine tradition. In Georgia, the qvevri, or casks, are buried underground; in Israel, Slutzkin keeps them upright to better monitor their temperature.\n\nMeker, who maintains a list of a dozen restaurants operating in Israel, says it is a golden moment for the cuisine of his ancestors. When he first arrived in Israel, Meker said he visited a Georgian restaurant where he ate a khachapuri cheese bread so repellent he could not finish it. Now, the taste has improved. Still, he says that the realities of life in Israel, with its high cost of living, can add a sour note.\n\n\"I prefer the Georgian food in Georgia because it costs a third less,\" Meker says.\n\nHeilpern, of Supra, welcomes the new class of Georgian restaurants.\n\n“There’s enough water in the sea for everyone,” she says.\n\nTry making your own Khinkali (Georgian dumplings) with this recipe:",
  "latent_32021": "This tutorial will focus on designing a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. As the series progresses, it will discuss the necessary steps to implement the filter on real hardware.\n\nA FIR filter is a digital filter whose impulse response settles to zero in finite time as opposed to an infinite impulse response filter (IIR), which uses feedback and may respond indefinitely to an input signal.The great thing about FIR filters is that they are inherently stable and can easily be designed to have linear phase. I won't get into the details much further on FIR filters and their pro's and con's as this tutorial focuses more on designing filters fast and efficiently with the aid of Octave.\n\nTypically, in FIR filter design the length of the filter will need to be specified. You can guess and check until the filter matches your expected bandwidth and cutoff requirements, but this could be a long and tedious process. The equation below is an efficient way to compute a reasonable starting length. After trying the calculated N, one can then tweak N or parameters which make up N to meet filter specifications.\n\n$$N \\approx \\frac{A_{dB} F_{s}}{22 \\Delta f}$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$A_{dB}$$ is your stopband attenuation in dB\n\n$$F_{s}$$ is your sampling frequency\n\nand\n\n$$\\Delta f$$ is your transition bandwidth\n\nLets say we want to filter an audio signal with the following characteristics and desired filter response:\n\n- The samples may contain frequencies from 0-20kHz\n\n- We wish to design a filter that passes only frequencies less than 10kHz\n\n- We want a stopband attenuation of 40 dB at 15kHz\n\n- Our system has a $$F_{s}$$ of 192kHz\n\nWith this information we can begin the process of design. Using the equation for N we estimate the filter length to approximately be:\n\n$$N \\approx \\frac{(40) (192000Hz)}{22 (15kHz - 10kHz)}$$\n\n$$N \\approx 69.818$$\n\nrounding to the nearest odd number\n\n$$N \\approx 69$$\n\n*Designing an FIR filter length to be odd length will give the filter an integral delay of (N-1)/2.\n\nUsing the Octave/Matlab code below, we can see how to design a lowpass filter with a bandwidth of 10kHz and a cutoff of 15kHz using Octave's built in fir1 function, which is well documented here\n\nclose all; clear all; clf; f1 = 10000; f2 = 15000; delta_f = f2-f1; Fs = 192000; dB = 40; N = dB*Fs/(22*delta_f); f = [f1 ]/(Fs/2) hc = fir1(round(N)-1, f,'low') figure plot((-0.5:1/4096:0.5-1/4096)*Fs,20*log10(abs(fftshift(fft(hc,4096))))) axis([0 20000 -60 20]) title('Filter Frequency Response') grid on\n\nOctave/Matlab Code\n\nThe code above gives us the following response:\n\nFigure 1\n\nBut if we zoom in we will see that the attenuation at 10kHz is greater than 3dB:\n\n\\\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe bandwidth of the filter is always specified to the -3dB point, so in the first iteration of design our filter has a smaller bandwidth than specified (somewhere less than 9kHz). We can see from the first figure that the attenuation in the stopband exceeded our specifications, perhaps we can tweak the attenuation and passband frequency to enhance the design.\n\nTweaking the parameters in the code to\n\nf1 = 11200;\n\nf2 = 15000;\n\ndB = 30;\n\ngives us a filter which closely matches our speicfications\n\nFigure 3\n\nThe filter design is now complete. Let's simulate how it works by adding the code below to the first bit of code we looked at.\n\nx = sin(2*pi*[1:1000]*5000/Fs) + sin(2*pi*[1:1000]*2000/Fs) + sin(2*pi*[1:1000]*13000/Fs) + sin(2*pi*[1:1000]*18000/Fs); sig = 20*log10(abs(fftshift(fft(x,4096)))); xf = filter(hc,1,x) figure subplot(211) plot(x) title('Sinusoid with frequency components 2000, 5000, 13000, and 18000 Hz') subplot(212) plot(xf) title('Filtered Signal') xlabel('time') ylabel('amplitude') x= (x/sum(x))/20 sig = 20*log10(abs(fftshift(fft(x,4096)))); xf = filter(hc,1,x) figure subplot(211) plot((-0.5:1/4096:0.5-1/4096)*Fs,sig) hold on plot((-0.5:1/4096:0.5-1/4096)*Fs,20*log10(abs(fftshift(fft(hc,4096)))),'color','r') hold off axis([0 20000 -60 10]) title('Input to filter - 4 Sinusoids') grid on subplot(212) plot((-0.5:1/4096:0.5-1/4096)*Fs,20*log10(abs(fftshift(fft(xf,4096))))) axis([0 20000 -60 10]) title('Output from filter') xlabel('Hz') ylabel('dB') grid on\n\nMore Matlab/Octave Code\n\nFigure 4\n\nAs we can see in Figure 4, we have the time domain signals on the left and the frequency domain on the right. The filter (in red) is overlaid onto the plot to show how the filter leaves the sinusoids in the passband and attenuates the signals in the transition and stopband.\n\nThe fir1 function can also be used to produce notch filters, high pass filters, and bandpass filters by replacing these lines:\n\nf = [f1 ]/(Fs/2), may need to be specified with two arguments for bandpass and notch filters as such:\n\nf = [f1 f2]/(Fs/2), where f1 is the left -3dB edge and f2 is the right -3dB edge\n\nhc = fir1(round(N)-1, f,'low') can be modified as such:\n\n'low' can be replaced with 'stop' (notch), 'high' (highpass), 'bandpass' (bandpass)\n\nFrom the lowpass filter demonstration above it should be easy to form the coefficients (this is the variable hc in the code) for any filter desired. Once you have calculated the coefficients it is important to scale and quantize them so you can implement your filter in a microprocessor. In part 2 we will get into scaling the coefficients and other steps necessary to put your coefficients into an N-bit microprocessor. This is important because without proper scaling you will experience quanitization noise that will affect the frequency response of your filter. Consequently, your design will not match your original specification or the output you simulated in Octave.\n\nNext Article in Series: Practical FIR Filter Design: Part 2 - Implementing Your Filter",

Vote for your favorites in our live heat here.\n\nOur Most Stylish Man Showdown is that time of year when we pit 64 streetwear masters and suited men, world leaders and world champions, traditionalists and ultimate swerve-rs against each other in a head-to-head heat to see who will rise above the rest and be crowned 2016's Most Stylish Man. There's only one way that's going to happen: your votes. Every day at Noon, a new round of voting will begin (be sure to check back daily to control the fate of your style god).\n\nKanye West vs. Tyler the Creator\n\nOur two-time defending Most Stylish Man champion started 2016 off with a bang, riding in on a wave of still piping hot Yeezy hype and an arena's worth of Life of Pablo merch. The rapper/designer's Yeezy Boosts continue to sell out in seconds and those gothic font Pablo tees are to thank (or blame) for all of the artist merch you see today. Tyler is 2016's other rapper turned designer whose colorful Golf Wang lineup is the perfect distillation of his own personal style. What's your preference: High fashion sweats or subversive sportswear?\n\nConor McGregor vs. Drake\n\nHere are two men who know the ultimate power of killer outerwear and how to harness it to their advantage. McGregor is the trash-talking, wildly entertaining UFC sensation who doesn't shy away from swanky three-piece suits or pimp-level Gucci furs. Drake, of course, is everyone's favorite rapper with all the feels who turned his love of things cozy into OVO, his label of cool kid sweatsuits and hoodies and never met an flex-level outerwear piece he didn't like (or wear). Only one can continue on in this year's Most Stylish Man battle.\n\nRyan Gosling vs. Roger Federer\n\nOur January cover man faces off against the tennis ace who can wear the hell out of a turtleneck. Gosling, of course, is the #menswear icon who never met a swervy well-tailored suit he didn't' like and does things like pull off actual pajamas out in public. And while the La La Land actor is known for his retro-tinged wardrobe, Federer is a man who reminds us why the classics (dove gray suits, v-neck sweaters) are timeless. It's not easy to knockout Gosling but then again, we're not underestimating the power of the #3 ranked player's loyal fan base.\n\nNick Jonas vs. Steven Yeun\n\nNick already pulled off the ultimate upset, taking out brother Joe in the first round of this year's showdown. But does he have what it takes to defeat Yeun and his army of The Walking Dead fans still mourning Glenn's death? Hard to say. Yeun has the everyman style thing down pat thanks to wardrobe of quietly stylish staples that never look out of place no matter what event he's attending. Jonas, meanwhile, is happy to run the menswear gamut, turning up in classic tailoring one minute and stage-ready drapey tees and bomber jackets the next.\n\nJared Leto vs. Shia LaBeouf\n\nIt hurts us to put these two mavericks against each other, but that's what the people wanted. What can we say about either of these men in 2016 that you don't already know. Leto had a breakout year getting more press for becoming the Joker than the movie he played the character in and became Alessandro Michele's favorite living mannequin for all things Gucci. LaBeouf started his ascent back to A-list status on screen and off, decided he was an amateur rapper and finally explained why he dresses like a broke college student. Who's your preferred style outlier?\n\nYoung Thug vs. Luka Sabbat\n\nYoung Thug a.k.a. Jeffery is a talented rapper with zero interest in what you think of his fits, and even less interest in whether or not his wardrobe comes form the women's section of a store. Sabbat is a founding member of the new Cool teen™ pack, a crew of barely two-decade old kids with signature personal style that folks twice their age can't claim. These are two guys who ooze DGAF-ness when it comes to what they wear and helped make this year in menswear so damn enjoyable. That said, only one guy can advance to the Round of 16...\n\nJohn Mayer vs. Donald Glover\n\nBoth Mayer and Glover know just what they're doing when getting dressed, but neither one makes a big deal out of it. Sure, Mayer has a predilection for rare artisanal kimonos, sea island cotton tees, and boatloads of Visvim, but you wouldn't necessarily pick that up on first glance (you would think \"this guy knows how to wear a t-shirt and jeans damn well.\"). Glover always impresses us with his ability to wear classic suiting the way we wear sweatpants and basic wardrobe essentials look not, well, so basic. It's a head-to-head matchup of understated style and only one man can walk away the victor.\n\nJaden Smith vs. Hasan Minhaj",
  "latent_32717": "Michael Bryant was attorney-general of Ontario from 2003-2007, clerked for Chief Justice Beverly McLachlin in 1993, taught constitutional law at King's College, London, and co-authored the book Public Law (Carswell) with the current Dean of Osgoode Hall, Lorne Sossin.\n\nThe problem with what Prime Minister Stephen Harper said about Chief Justice Beverly McLachlin is not about protocol or political debate or just bad taste. Our Prime Minister showed contempt for the Chief Justice of Canada, by trying a childish, political gotcha tactic against someone for whom there is supposed to be constitutional independence and institutional, if not personal, respect.\n\nIn another era, the justice minister would have resigned. The incident marks the complete breakdown of the constitutional relationship between the executive and judicial branches, threatening Canadians' confidence that their government has an effective judicial watchdog to protect them against political hubris and worse.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt's not that the prime minister and chief justice are supposed to get along, or even agree on anything. The issue at hand is who is supposed to do what. The prime minister is not supposed to be in charge of appointing judges, but that's what has happened under Stephen Harper. It may seem like a distinction without a difference, but there are some very good reasons why the attorney-general or justice minister (basically interchangeable in Canada) takes the lead on judicial appointments, and why the appropriate channel between cabinet and judiciary is through the peculiar office of the attorney-general, who is both political cabinet minister and non-political chief legal officer to the cabinet.\n\nIn a paper only a mother could read, at the request of the Quebec Bastarache Commission on judicial appointments, I chronicled my experience in appointing about 70 judges and 100 justices of the peace from 2003 to 2007. I advocated that the attorney-general protect his or her first minister – and the public – from politicizing the appointment process. In fact, thanks to my predecessors Ian Scott and Roy McMurtry, Ontario's process is internationally renowned for its independence.\n\nAs for communication between the executive of government and head of the judiciary, it's very clear how that is supposed to work. When I was Ontario's attorney-general there were regular meetings and consultations between the chief justices and myself regarding appointments and court management. To be sure, I would have tried to block any outreach between the premier and a chief justice regarding an appointment, but that wouldn't have prompted a reaction from the first minister, à la Mr. Harper's scandalous smear of Canada's Chief Justice (for whom I clerked in 1994, but with whom I haven't had occasion to contact for the past few years).\n\nThe sad truth is that the federal attorney-general, who is supposed to depoliticize the judicial appointments process, is politically impotent under Mr. Harper. That wasn't true of the late attorney-general Jim Flaherty under former Ontario premier Harris, or of Mr. McMurtry under William Davis. This has long been the case under the Harper government, however. Under the Paul Martin government, when I was provincial A-G, I was consulted by federal attorney-general Irwin Cotler directly. Although I knew officials in the PMO, they always made it clear that any appointment decisions were Mr. Cotler's to make. Maybe the PMO leaned on Mr. Cotler from time to time, but it was never the reverse.\n\nUnder the Harper government, in my experience, it is the reverse. The federal A-G might lean on the PMO functionary, if at all, but the responsibility for judicial appointments is well entrenched in the PMO. The PMO functionary would formally consult with me over the appointment of a chief justice, or a Court of Appeal judge, but the federal A-G was always missing in action. (That said, a pro-gun-control urban Liberal was never going to be the Conservatives' touchstone for judicial appointments – fair enough).\n\nIt's hypocritical, misleading and misconstrued for Mr. Harper to cry foul at Chief Justice McLachlin's efforts to forestall an unconstitutional appointment. If the federal A-G weren't so feckless today, then that would be where any discussion about an appointment ought to take place, and historically, that's where it happened. Today, however, Mr. Harper is playing Captain Renault in Casablanca: shocked, shocked that the Chief Justice would request a meeting through the justice minister. The Chief Justice of Canada sought to honourably and effectively discharge her duties. The Prime Minister did the opposite."
